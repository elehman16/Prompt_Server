There is limited rigorous evidence, however, that this is the case in practice. This evaluation will examine explicitly, and from a holistic perspective, the simultaneous impact of a national school meals programme on micronutrient status, alongside outcomes in nutrition, education and agriculture domains.</p><p>The 3-year study involves a cluster-randomised control trial designed around the scale-up of the national school feeding programme, including 116 primary schools in 58 districts in Ghana. The randomly assigned interventions are: 1) a school feeding programme group, including schools and communities where the standard government programme is implemented; 2) &#x02018;home-grown&#x02019; school feeding, including schools and communities where the standard programme is implemented alongside an innovative pilot project aimed at enhancing nutrition and agriculture; and 3) a control group, including schools and households from communities where the intervention will be delayed by at least 3&#x000a0;years, preferably without informing schools and households. Primary outcomes include child health and nutritional status, school participation and learning, and smallholder farmer income. Intermediate outcomes along the agriculture and nutrition pathways will also be measured. The evaluation will follow a mixed-method approach, including child-, household-, school- and community-level surveys as well as focus group discussions with project stakeholders. The baseline survey was completed in August 2013 and the endline survey is planned for November 2015.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The tests of balance show significant differences in the means of a number of outcome and control variables across the intervention groups. Important differences across groups include marketed surplus, livestock income, per capita food consumption and intake, school attendance, and anthropometric status in the 2&#x02013;5 and 5&#x02013;15 years age groups. In addition, approximately 19&#x000a0;% of children in the target age group received some form of free school meals at baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Designing and implementing the evaluation of complex interventions is in itself a complex undertaking, involving a multi-disciplinary research team working in close collaboration with programme- and policy-level stakeholders. Managing the complexity from an analytical and operational perspective is an important challenge. The analysis of the baseline data indicates that the random allocation process did not achieve statistically comparable treatment groups. Differences in outcomes and control variables across groups will be controlled for when estimating treatment effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN66918874">ISRCTN66918874</ext-link> (registered on 5 March 2015).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>School feeding</kwd><kwd>Impact evaluation</kwd><kwd>Education</kwd><kwd>Nutrition</kwd><kwd>Agriculture</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>School feeding programmes have been a key response to the recent food and economic crises and function to some degree in nearly every country in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. School feeding is a multi-sectoral intervention with effects across education, health and nutrition, and with the potential for benefits across a life course. Rigorous studies have shown that school feeding programmes can improve school attendance and learning, as well as a child&#x02019;s physical and psycho-social health (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] for a recent review). These effects are heterogeneous and context-specific, depending also on the quality of programme implementation. There is no rigorous evidence on the impact of providing a reliable market for smallholder farmers through &#x02018;home-grown&#x02019; school feeding (HGSF) approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In HGSF, the demand for food and services from school feeding is channelled explicitly to smallholder farmers and other stakeholders involved in the school feeding supply chain. As most of the studies in the scientific literature in low-income settings involve humanitarian aid, there is also a paucity of evidence on government-led programmes operating at scale in low- and middle-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This study is aimed at addressing these research gaps by evaluating the full cost and impacts of alternative school feeding implementation approaches, across education, health and nutrition, and agriculture domains in Ghana.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Country context</title><p>Ghana is a lower-middle income country with a population of 25 million people, over 40&#x000a0;% of whom are under 15&#x000a0;years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Despite the high rates of economic growth occurred in the past two decades, Ghana is ranked 138th in the 2014 Human Development Index table, with a life expectancy at birth of 61&#x000a0;years, 7 mean years of schooling for adults and a Gross National Income (GDP) based on per capita purchasing power parity (PPP) of US$3532 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The domestic economy is centred on subsistence farming, which accounts for nearly 40&#x000a0;% of the GDP and employs over 50&#x000a0;% of the workforce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Around 25&#x000a0;% of the country&#x02019;s population live in poverty based on the national-level poverty line, with this percentage increasing to 38&#x000a0;% in rural areas in contrast to 10&#x000a0;% in urban ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Food security in the marginal agricultural and arid areas varies with the seasons. The peak hunger seasons for the south of Ghana are from May to August whereas the north of Ghana experiences peak hunger seasons between July and October. The incidence of malnutrition in Ghana has been assessed through the Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys (GDHS) conducted every 5&#x000a0;years since 1988. From 1993 to 2008 there was some progress in reducing the rate of chronic malnutrition, with rates of stunting decreasing from 34&#x000a0;% to 29&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. According to the 2003 and 2008 GDHS the prevalence of anaemia among children of 6&#x02013;59 months of age increased marginally from 76&#x000a0;% in 2003 to 78&#x000a0;% in 2008. In 2008, the prevalence of anaemia among rural children aged under 5&#x000a0;years (84&#x000a0;%) was higher than in urban areas (68&#x000a0;%). The overall prevalence of stunting among school-aged children was 17&#x000a0;%, ranging from 13&#x000a0;% in the forest-savannah transitional zone to 21&#x000a0;% in the northern savannah [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The same study estimated that the prevalence of anaemia among school-aged children was 39&#x000a0;%. This, however, varied widely across ecological zones. Anaemia rates were highest in the northern savannah (65&#x000a0;%) and the coastal savannah zones (59&#x000a0;%) and least prevalent in the transitional zone (16&#x000a0;%).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Complex intervention</title><p>This evaluation focusses on the Government of Ghana school feeding programme. As of 2011, the Ghana School Feeding Programme (GSFP) reached over 1.6 million primary school children in all 170 districts of Ghana. The programme is directly funded by the Government of Ghana, with a 4-year programme budget of over US$200 million. The GSFP was piloted in 10 schools in late 2005. By the end of 2009, GSFP had progressively grown to serve 1695 public schools with 656,624 pupils across the country. The GSFP is a complex intervention and was designed as a strategy to increase domestic food production, household incomes and food security in deprived communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The objectives of the strategy combined child-level education and nutrition, alongside household food production. GSFP co-ordination and implementation are undertaken by a national secretariat, with programme oversight provided by the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development (MoLGRD). Line ministries offer technical support through the programme steering committee, although a number of NGOs and bilateral agencies are also involved with that support. The GSFP service delivery is provided through private caterers who are awarded contracts by the GSFP to procure, prepare and serve food to pupils in the targeted schools. Each caterer is responsible for procuring food items from the market, preparing school meals and distributing food to pupils. Cash transfers are made from the district assemblies, under the supervision of the District Implementation Committees (DICs), to caterers based on 40 Ghana pesewas (circa US$0.33) per child per day. Caterers are not permitted to serve more than three schools each, and profit is derived from savings made after food has been procured, prepared and distributed. Supervision at the school level is by the School Implementation Committee (SIC) and funds are intended to be released to caterers every 2&#x000a0;weeks. Storage is the responsibility of caterers and no rigid tendering process is enforced. The caterers are not restricted or guided in their procurement and are able to procure on a competitive basis without commitment to purchasing from small-scale farmers. The GSFP project document prioritises procurement from the community surrounding the assisted schools, broadening the focus to the district and national levels when food items are not available.</p><p>A recent supply chain analysis describes how caterer procurement decisions depend on costs (of food, transport, preparation) and on cash availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. According to this study, the way and the extent to which caterers store food varies from district to district, but most have access to storage facilities (small household storage, school storage, or private storage). Caterers generally hire cooks to prepare food for students either in their homes or at school facilities. The main challenges faced by caterers include managing changes in food prices, hampered by the inability to mitigate price fluctuations due to delays in payments from the GSFP. Caterers reported that seasonal price variations between harvest and lean periods included price increases of up to 400&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The GSFP payments are received after the meals are served, resulting in caterers not having the resources to buy in bulk and guarantee a better and stable price to smallholder producers. Caterers were also reported to buy on credit from traders known as &#x02018;market queens&#x02019; in Ghana, weakening their overall negotiation position. In addition, caterers also reported that payments often do not reflect the real number of pupils since enrolment often increases during the school term, which could possibly lead to either less food being served per child or higher costs faced by the caterers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In practice, caterers often adapt to these challenges by reducing the quantity of food provided or by adjusting the quality of the food and adapting the menus. According to the supply chain study, procurement of food from smallholder farmers could help to mitigate the price volatility challenge. The study found that caterers were willing to procure their food from local farmers and that by buying from farmers, caterers could benefit from lower and more stable prices than those offered by traders on the market. Nonetheless, the reality is that almost all the food is still bought from markets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Challenges in linking agriculture</title><p>The most recent evaluation of the GSFP undertaken in 2012 identified the need for &#x02018;a more strategic approach in linking farmers to the programme&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This gap between the food production side and the caterers has been documented in other studies as well, including a recent supply chain analysis that highlighted a number of key constraints in the current model (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), including:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Mismatch of cash flow: farmers need money as soon as they harvest.

The details of the pilot were developed by a multi-disciplinary working group composed of in-country stakeholders under government leadership. This pilot involves the development of an integrated package of community-level activities aimed at enhancing the impact of the GSFP on poverty and food insecurity and involves two main components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Agriculture: this component is designed to stimulate the economy at community level by purchasing food from smallholder farmers. The component aims to bring the actors of the school feeding supply chain and GSFP community programme together to discuss the demand and supply needs to the school feeding market.

This agreement will be backed by a master contract</p></list-item><list-item><p>Nutrition: this component will include activities to improve the nutritional quality of the school meals (e.g. menu planning), promotion of improved health, nutrition and hygiene behaviours (e.g. behaviour change campaigns), and the provision of multiple micronutrient fortification</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Programme theory of the intervention</title><p>School feeding interventions linked to smallholder agriculture can have multiple goals in the following areas:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Education: increasing school enrolment, attendance and reducing drop-out, and improving cognition and learning achievement</p></list-item><list-item><p>Health: improving nutritional status of school age children</p></list-item><list-item><p>Agriculture: supporting incomes of recipient households (those consuming food) and farmer households (those providing the food)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Small enterprise development: supporting incomes of caterers and cooks involved in the food service provision</p></list-item></list></p><p>Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> illustrates in very broad terms the impact theory of school feeding on agriculture, education, and health. School feeding affects educational outcomes directly by increasing enrolment, attendance and completion (line &#x02018;a&#x02019; in the figure). It affects health directly by improving nutritional status (line &#x02018;b&#x02019;); this in turn has an indirect impact on education, as improving nutritional status has a positive impact on learning outcomes (line &#x02018;d&#x02019;). The intervention can also affect income directly by increasing households&#x02019; food security (line &#x02018;c&#x02019;). In addition, the intervention can benefit the small enterprises involved in the school food service provision. Finally, there are effects running through increased income and health and nutrition and vice versa, as richer families are investing more in human capital and more educated and healthier adults are more economically productive (lines &#x02018;e&#x02019;). However, these latter effects (represented as dotted lines in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) only occur in the long term and certainly not before children have left school: therefore, we will not discuss them in the following design. Whilst the evidence base on the effects on child education, health and nutrition is generally well-established (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] for a recent systematic review) this evaluation is the first to also examine the effects on agriculture and enterprise development.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Overall programme theory of school feeding interventions</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2015_1116_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p>It must be emphasised that the ability of the school feeding intervention to deliver the effects depicted in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> critically depends on the appropriate implementation of the programme. The management and implementation of the intervention involves several actors, and there is evidence that in Ghana there are several problems of information flow, supervision and monitoring between these different stakeholders. Programme success will also depend on the ability of communities to actively engage in the programme and in the strengthening of the public institutions involved.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Main hypotheses and outcome indicators</title><p>We summarise here the expected impact of the intervention on education, nutrition and agriculture as captured in the programme theory.

In terms of other intermediate indicators in the nutrition and health pathway, we will observe the effect of the programme on knowledge and practices of caterers and school management members, and on the quantity, quality, and timeliness of the preparation and delivery of the school meals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Design of the randomised evaluation</title><p>The impact evaluation will be an integral component of the monitoring and evaluation activities of the GFSP. Two rounds of surveys are envisioned, with the baseline planned in the intervention and control sites in June 2013 and a follow-up planned in November 2015. After the follow-up survey, the control schools and community will be fully integrated in the intervention. We will consider the possibility of conducting further surveys in the following years, building matched control groups in order to detect long-term effects of the intervention on smallholder agriculture.</p><p>The GSFP will be expanded across the 10 regions of the country. The GSFP has set clear criteria for the selection of the intervention areas as captured in the retargeting exercise conducted in 2012. Poverty rankings were developed using the Ghana Living Standards Survey and Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire carried out in 2005/2006 and 2003 respectively. Food consumption scores were calculated using the Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Assessment 2008/2009 and spatial data variables computed by the World Food Programme (WFP). The data were then used to generate district-level composites for share of national poverty and food insecurity that were then used to allocate programme resources.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Random assignment and manipulation of treatments</title><p>Households and schools were randomly assigned to three treatment arms:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Control group: these are schools and households from communities where the intervention will not be implemented.

Training and monitoring systems involve caterers and exert their effects at the district level, affecting outcomes in schools where the HGSF+ programme is not implemented. On the other hand, the number of districts where the programme is implemented is rather small, which reduces the statistical power of the analysis, and the effects of the school feeding intervention against the control group are best observed at the school level. Hence, we opted for a design that compares the outcomes of the school feeding and control groups at the school level, and that compares outcomes of HGSF+ and regular school feeding (GSFP) at the district level.</p><p>The GSFP selected 58 districts in which the programme will be implemented. In each of these districts, two candidate schools were selected and each school was randomly assigned to the treatment or to the control. A protocol was designed in order to ensure that the schools were comparable based on data from the Education Management Information system (EMIS) and that contamination between the two schools in each district will be minimised. This will allow comparison of outcomes of the intervention against the control group at the school level in 58 districts. The 58 schools assigned to the intervention were then randomly assigned to regular GSFP and HGSF+. In this way the randomisation of the HGSF+ intervention occurs at the district level. The number of 58 schools is based on power calculations (see <xref rid="Sec29" ref-type="sec">Appendix 1</xref>) determined with the objective of achieving statistical validity and representativeness for the main outcomes of interest.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Anaemia sub-study</title><p>The impact evaluation includes a sub-study focussing on nutrition in school feeding with and without micronutrient fortification.

Non-farmer households with children in the 5&#x02013;15 years age group were randomly selected from the household listings.

The sample frame was stratified by region, and district inclusion was prioritised using data from the GSFP retargeting exercise including data on the prevalence of poverty and food insecurity; 2) the second step involved identifying 2 comparable schools within each of the 58 selected districts. A list was obtained through the GSFP secretariat including schools not currently covered by the GSFP in each district. Data from the annual school census from 2011 to 2012 were then used to match schools not receiving the GSFP and identify &#x02018;best matched&#x02019; pair. The allocation of school feeding and control was then randomised (lottery style) within each pair; 3) the third step in the site selection protocol involved the random allocation of districts to the HGSF+/GSFP groups by modelling pilot selection using a set of community- and district-level variables and selecting the permutation of allocation that minimises the <italic>R</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> for the predicted selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Survey instruments</title><p>The impact evaluation includes child-, household-, school-, caterer- and community-level data collection as shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Survey instruments</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Instrument</th><th>Topic/Modules</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Household questionnaire</td><td>&#x02022; Household roster (main demographic characteristics, including of children residing elsewhere)<break/>&#x02022; Education (school enrolment, attendance, education of all household members, time spent in class and working, distance and transport to school, meals while in school, parents&#x02019; aspirations, PTA membership and involvement)<break/>&#x02022; Household assets and farm assets (household facilities and durables including land and livestock holdings)<break/>&#x02022; Economic activities (simple income questionnaire on time spent working by household members in wage work, own business and own farm)<break/>&#x02022; Expenditure (monetary expenditure and own production of food, education, health, durables, and non-food expenditure)<break/>&#x02022; Anthropometry (height and weight of parents and children above 6&#x000a0;months of age - parents measurements are taken to assess the genetic potential)<break/>&#x02022; Micronutrient status (haemoglobin levels, anaemia prevalence)<break/>&#x02022; Cognitive and literacy and maths achievement tests (test scores on maths, literacy, Raven&#x02019;s matrices and digit span test)<break/>&#x02022; Farm income (agricultural production and revenues, input expenditure and depreciation of farm assets)<break/>&#x02022; Other income (a simplified income questionnaire for other income sources like microenterprises, transfers, remittances, gifts, etc.)</td></tr><tr><td>School questionnaire</td><td>&#x02022; School facilities (school characteristics including boards, toilets, furniture, books and all school-feeding related characteristics - kitchen, storage room, etc.)<break/>&#x02022; School participation (school-level data on enrolment, attendance and drop-out)<break/>&#x02022; School management and food procurement<break/>&#x02022; Teachers (qualifications, living conditions and aspirations)<break/>&#x02022; Training and monitoring activities</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>

Serial correlation affects estimated standard errors and can lead to erroneous acceptance or rejection of null hypotheses but not the estimation of the effect size of the intervention. Thus, it may lead to erroneously finding or not finding a statistically significant impact of the intervention. Angrist and Pischke illustrate how this problem can be addressed by calculating clustered standard errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], a procedure that is easily implemented using Stata software. Clustered standard errors will also be employed in all cases in which correlated outcomes are observed within the same unit of analysis. For example, when the impact of the intervention is analysed at the school level and test scores within school are obviously correlated. Similarly, clustered standard error will be used at the household level when the project is affecting more than one child within the same family, as in the case of impact on younger siblings.</p><p>The single difference model specification has the following form:<disp-formula id="Equb"><alternatives><tex-math id="M3">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Regional equality of consumer prices, however, does not imply the equality of producer prices at a more localised level. The ability of market interventions to influence local price dynamics depends on the level of spatial market integration between local markets. Abdulai [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] analysed the maize market in Ghana and found a high level of integration, meaning a quick transmission of prices from one locality to the other. In these circumstances large purchases of staple food in localised markets are unlikely to produce price changes. Cudjoe et al. tested for market integration for several staple foods in Ghana and found a high level of integration for rice and maize but much less for tubers such as cassava and yam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Prices of the latter items may be strongly localised and transmission between markets may not be easy. It should also be noted that the studies quoted above looked at market integration across large wholesale markets that are well-connected by roads and communication flows. Differences in prices might emerge in more remote and isolated areas even for more commercial crops like maize and rice. We therefore considered studying the impact of the intervention on local market prices, particularly when the food purchased consists of food items that are not highly commercialised such as cassava and yam.</p><p>Impact on prices could, in principle, be observed through the household-level questionnaires. The farm gate price could be observed at the household level by including in the questionnaire questions related to prices paid and time of sales. This, however, would complicate the income section of the farmer questionnaire. Consumer prices are more difficult to observe in a standard household survey because the recall time is 7 or 30&#x000a0;days and there is only one survey per year. As part of the programme monitoring activities, price data will be collected, on a monthly basis, for main staple crops in the local market next to each of the selected schools for a sub-sample of farmer households. Collection of prices does not even require visits to markets if stable contacts can be established with collectors in each of the markets and prices could be communicated by phone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Heterogeneity of impact</title><p>The large dataset will allow for extensive sub-group analysis, including gender, age and geographic characteristics. The impacts of school feeding in different contexts are quite heterogeneous and context-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. School feeding, for instance, has been associated with marked improvements school participation by girls in rural areas with large gender disparities in access to education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Smallholder farmers targeted by the programme will, in large proportions, be women. From the educational perspective, school feeding impact has also been found to vary with pupil age, as household schooling decisions are also affected by the opportunity costs of education, that tend to increase with age and vary by gender.</p><p>The programme is targeted to disadvantaged groups. The main beneficiaries are located in poor, rural districts of the country and the programme has a potential poverty inequality reduction impact at the national level. At the local level, the programme has a potential poverty reduction impact, but the inequality reduction impact will depend on whether:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The project will increase enrolment.

The survey will be based on a standardised costing framework capturing capital (fixed) and recurrent costs incurred at the school level. The questionnaire will also cover both cash and in-kind contributions and will be used to estimate both financial and economic costs. Financial costs capture actual expenditures in terms of programme implementation on an annual basis. Economic costs included the opportunity costs of community members, teaching staff and other school-level stakeholders involved in the school feeding and school health and nutrition (SHN) service provision. Opportunity costs of school staff and community members will be calculated using local pay scales. Capital costs will be annuitised over the useful life of all relevant school-level assets using a discount rate of 3&#x000a0;% as per World Bank recommendations. Annuitisation enables an equivalent annual cost to be estimated and reflects the value in-use of capital items, rather than reflecting when the item was purchased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Process and output data covering the adequacy of the service delivery will be collected from monitoring visits on a quarterly basis using standardised data collection forms. Output data will be combined with the costs to provide estimates of cost-efficiency metrics, including costs per beneficiary, kilocalories, iron, and vitamin A delivered. Sensitivity analysis will be undertaken to account for uncertainties in the economic evaluation. The figures obtained in this way will then be compared to figures calculated for other interventions.</p><p>Of particular interest is the cost-effectiveness of the community-level component of the intervention. The comparison between the HGSF+ and the regular GSFP groups is roughly equivalent to the comparison between a &#x02018;home-grown&#x02019; school feeding project and a standard school feeding project. Many would expect HGSF to be cheaper and more cost-effective because of lower transport costs. However, the alternative procurement source, its distance and affordability is unknown, and hence the difference in costs between the two programmes is an empirical question.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Data collection</title><p>The enumerators were recruited from Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research (NMIMR) and Institute of Statistical, Social and Economic Research (ISSER), and trained for the baseline survey.

To date, there is little evidence on the potential for agriculture and community development. This paper described the design and baseline results for a randomised evaluation of school meals interventions linked to smallholder agriculture. As far as we are aware, it is the first to examine explicitly from a holistic perspective the simultaneous impact of a national school meals programme on micronutrient status, alongside outcomes in nutrition, education and agriculture domains. The evaluation builds on a trial design taking place in Mali that includes an extensive analysis of the programme theory for the intervention. As the intervention is complex, the scope of this evaluation is also very broad and includes measurement of a range of outcome indicators across multiple traditional disciplines. Designing and implementing such an evaluation is in itself a complex undertaking, involving a multi-disciplinary research team working in close collaboration with programme- and policy-level stakeholders. The survey also required a range of different expertise in the enumeration teams in order to collect data including anthropometry, haemoglobin levels, and educational tests, alongside expenditure, income and other socio-economic-related modules. The use of the survey tools required to capture the data was inevitably fairly time-intensive. Extensive analysis of the rich baseline data is currently underway.</p><p>A number of important considerations can be drawn from the baseline data analysis. Firstly, the tests of balance showed evidence of small differences across the treatment arms for several variables across education, nutrition, agriculture and other socio-economic domains. The randomisation of treatment across the arms of the cluster-randomised trial is aimed at minimising the systematic differences in the outcomes between the intervention groups. In practice, differences between the intervention groups can arise due to sampling error in moderate sample sizes. When estimating programme impact it is important to control for these differences where they exist.</p><p>In addition, approximately 19&#x000a0;% of children in the target age group (5&#x02013;15 years) received some form of free school meals at baseline. Similar findings were reported in a similar study in Mali in 2013 by Masset and Gelli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] where, because of information flow constraints, the original list of schools used in the randomisation included schools with school feeding. This finding has important implications in terms of the evaluation design, considerably reducing sample sizes available for comparisons after the follow-up survey. The small sample sizes between the HGSF+ and HGSF++ comparisons are a particular concern, and power calculations using the baseline data suggest folding these two arms into one, adding micronutrient sprinkles to the HGSF+ intervention.</p><p>Significant differences were found in the means of a number of outcome and control variables across the intervention groups. It appears, therefore, that at baseline the random allocation process did not achieve statistically comparable treatment groups. In particular, important differences across groups include marketed surplus, livestock income, per capita food consumption and intake, school attendance, anthropometric status in the 2&#x02013;5 and 5&#x02013;15 years age groups. Differences in outcome and control variables across groups will be controlled when estimating treatment effects. More in-depth analyses of the very rich baseline dataset, examining the associations between key outcomes and variables along the complex agriculture-nutrition are also underway.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Assessing the simultaneous impact of &#x02018;home-grown&#x02019; school feeding on micronutrient status, health, education and agriculture is a complex undertaking, involving coordination across policy, programme and research stakeholders.

In both cases it is assumed that the size of the sample in each cluster is 20. This is consistent with 20 household interviews per community and considering that several children may end up not being tested. In any case, only a marginal gain can be obtained by expanding the sample beyond 20 as power is mainly driven by the number of clusters (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Haemoglobin: minimum detectable difference versus number of clusters</p></caption><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2015_1116_Fig6_HTML" id="MO6"/></fig></p><p>The table below reports the standardised detectable differences and their equivalent level values for 3 different designs: 30 clusters, 60 clusters and 120 clusters.
