Nearly 70&#x000a0;% of the expenditure is on medicines purchased at private pharmacies. Patients with chronic ailments are especially affected, as they often need lifelong medicines. Over the past years in India, there have been several efforts to improve drug availability at government primary health centres. In this study, we aim to understand health system factors that affect utilisation and access to generic medicines for people with non-communicable diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study aims to understand if (and how) a package of interventions targeting primary health centres and community participation platforms affect utilisation and access to generic medicines for people with non-communicable diseases in the current district context in India. This study will employ a quasi-experimental design and a qualitative theory-driven approach. PHCs will be randomly assigned to one of three arms of the intervention. In one arm, PHCs will receive inputs to optimise service delivery for non-communicable diseases, while the second arm will receive an additional package of interventions to strengthen community participation platforms for improving non-communicable disease care. The third arm will be the control. We will conduct household and facility surveys, before and after the intervention and will estimate the effect of the intervention by difference-in-difference analysis. Sample size for measuring effects was calculated based on obtaining at least 30 households for each primary health centre spread across three distance-based clusters. Primary outcomes include availability and utilisation of medicines at primary health centres and out-of-pocket expenditure for medicines by non-communicable disease households. Focus group discussions with patients and in-depth interviews with health workers will also be conducted. Qualitative and process documentation data will be used to explain how the intervention could have worked.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>By taking into consideration several health system building blocks and trying to understand how they interact, our study aims to generate evidence for health planners on how to optimise health services to improve access to medicines.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Protocol registered on Clinical Trials Registry of India with registration identifier number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ctri.nic.in/Clinicaltrials/pmaindet2.php?trialid=9652">CTRI/2015/03/005640</ext-link> on 17<sup>th</sup> March 2015.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12913-016-1680-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Non-communicable diseases</kwd><kwd>Health systems research</kwd><kwd>Access to medicines</kwd><kwd>Out-of-pocket expenditure on medicines</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007855</institution-id><institution>Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research (CH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>E19-TSA-007</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Access to medicines</title><p>The first point of contact for curative services in India is typically in the private sector, and often with medical practitioners without a formal medical degree in modern medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In most Indian cities and in rural areas, private healthcare providers manage patients with chronic diseases deepening health insecurity for the poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Even in cases where patients obtain outpatient care in government hospitals, they often have to purchase medicines from private pharmacies, either due to frequent stock-out of medicines at primary health centres (PHC), or poor procurement and distribution of drugs at higher levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In spite of recent efforts through the National Rural Health Mission to improve utilisation of public services and decrease out-of-pocket expenditure (OOP) on medicines, recent estimates of OOP expenditure on medicines continues to be as high as 70&#x000a0;%, with instances of people falling into poverty merely from paying for outpatient care for non-communicable diseases (NCD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>The poor availability of drugs in public services is further complicated by inadequate availability of relatively inexpensive branded or unbranded generic alternatives in the private pharmacies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In spite of India&#x02019;s reputation as a global supplier of generic drugs, widespread reports of spurious medicines and the lack of an effective regulatory system for medicines affect people&#x02019;s perceptions of quality of these drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In addition, leadership and management of government health services at various levels within the health system influences access to medicines. The ways in which health systems organise their governance, resources use, organisation and management of services as well interact with people are being identified as the crucial in ensuring access to medicines, especially in public services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Recent efforts at making available cheaper generic equivalents of essential drugs through <italic>Jan Aushadhi</italic> stores (people&#x02019;s pharmacy in Hindi) have shown promising results; the generic drugs supplied have been reported to be comparable in quality to their proprietary equivalents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Problem tree illustrating government health services problems that could drive NCD patients to buy essential drugs from private pharmacies</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12913_2016_1680_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Medicines and primary health care</title><p>Among the several approaches to organising care for NCDs in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), the underlying principle is a well-performing primary health care system that ensures access to essential drugs for treatment of NCDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Ensuring availability of medicines in government PHCs is necessary, but not sufficient to ensure access to medicines. Several factors ranging from individual and household perceptions, societal preferences and health-seeking behaviour to other factors related to health system, including availability, but also affordability, quality and management of government health services together characterise a well-performing health system. A systemic perspective on how these various factors interact is crucial in strengthening public services response to NCDs.</p><p>In this study, we aim to study the health system factors at the sub-district and PHC level that influence access to medicines for people with NCDs (diabetes and hypertension) in a rural Indian district setting. In doing so, we seek to understand how a mixed public-private health system, which is in the process of strengthening and decentralisation, such as the one in India responds to health services strengthening interventions to improve access to medicines.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Rationale of the study: medicines and NCDs in India</title><p>Globally, there has been a lot of focus on the challenges in organising care for NCDs, especially in LMICs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Recent publications highlight the inability of several LMIC health systems to deal with the rising needs of continuous care and follow-up required for patients with NCDs, as opposed to sporadic and episodic care for infectious diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. There is increasing pressure on Indian policymakers at all levels to improve services for people with NCDs. Recently, a vertical programme, the <italic>National programme for control of cancer</italic>, <italic>diabetes</italic>, <italic>cardiovascular diseases and stroke</italic> (NPCDCS) was launched by the Indian government to address this challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Various state governments in India as well as the national government have responded favourably through policies to improve access over the last decade. We take into consideration the following factors related to the policy environment within which this study is being proposed, thus of importance to the design of the study and, eventually for the interpretation of its results.</p><p>The governments of India and Karnataka have committed to investing more money in purchasing generic medicines and improving availability of these in government-funded/operated generic drug pharmacies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Recent reforms in Indian government health services through the National Health Mission (NHM) encourage community involvement in managing and financing primary health centres (PHC) through the establishment of <italic>Arogya Raksha Samitis</italic> (patient welfare committees).

We will use a quantitative before-after quasi-experimental study design to understand determinants of improved access to medicines, and a qualitative theory-driven evaluation approach to answer the <italic>how</italic> questions. All PHCs (39 PHCs) across three selected <italic>talukas</italic> were randomly assigned to one of three arms of the intervention. A baseline and an endline survey of households, PHCs and private pharmacies will be conducted for the before-after quasi-experimental component.</p><p>The qualitative component of the study will use a theory-driven approach to understand and explain the changes if any, and why the intervention worked for some (where it did) and not for others (where it did not) across the three arms of the study. The theory-driven approach uses successive waves of qualitative data to refine the programme theory, thus resulting in a contextual explanation for how the programme worked in the given setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In so doing, we shall generate an explanatory theory about improving access to medicines in local health systems in India especially focusing on what works, for whom, and under what conditions, and why. The study design and initial programme theory have been represented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. An initial programme theory is an explanation of why the programme is expected to work; it takes into consideration the inputs of the intervention and the assumptions of the implementers on how the intervention inputs could result in the expected outcomes, integrating contextual information from the implementation setting.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Study design of the Access to Medicines study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12913_2016_1680_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig><fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Initial Programme Theory</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12913_2016_1680_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p>After the completion of the quantitative analysis (assessing effectiveness of the intervention) and the qualitative analysis (assessing the plausible reasons for the intervention working in some places and not in others), we will integrate the results into a final programme theory using the conceptual framework for access to medicines from a health system perspective proposed by Bigdeli et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, the Tumkur ATM intervention components have been represented in the Bigdeli et al. access to medicines framework. We will use this conceptual framework in explaining how the intervention contributed to improved NCD care in some settings, with a focus on the PHC and <italic>taluka</italic> level dynamic interactions between individual and institutional factors that contributed to the change, wherever it occurs.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Study setting of the ATM project.

The questionnaire was adapted to suit the local context by choosing modules relevant to our study as well as adapting it for NCDs (the tool is originally designed for communicable diseases). Our final tool was divided into six parts to collect routine demographic information, health seeking behaviour, socio-economic status, perceptions on price and quality of NCD drugs and access to and use of medicines for NCD.

Sample size calculation was based on obtaining at least 30 households per PHC spread across three clusters (a, b and c with 10 households per cluster; see above). A typical PHC in Tumkur district has at least five villages in each cluster, and hence at least 1000 households in each cluster (approximately 250 households in a village). We aimed for a total of 1170 households anticipating 30 households per PHCs across the 39 PHCs.</p><p>We started the survey at the PHC where we listed all the villages under the PHC area. These villages were then divided into the three clusters based on the distance from the PHC and from each cluster, one village was randomly chosen. We randomly selected a minimum of 10 NCD households from all four directions starting from the central point of the village. After getting informed consent of the participant the survey questionnaire was administered to the NCD patient for the interview. In his/her absence, the spouse or another member of the household who was over 18&#x000a0;years of age, aware of the information sought in the survey and willing to provide this information was interviewed. The data collectors started the survey within each village in four different directions and ensured that all types of houses and areas within the village were included in the sampling. Wherever 10 NCD households were not obtained in one village, the data collectors repeated the process in the nearest adjoining village. Each participant was provided with an information sheet and health awareness material in local language related to NCDs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>) as well as contact information of the research team.</p><p>We surveyed 10 households from within five kilometre radius from the PHC (cluster a), 10 from between five to 10 km radius (cluster b), and 10 from more than 10 km distance from the PHC (cluster c).

This data will be directly imported into NVivo for coding.</p><p>The qualitative data analysis will draw from the principles of theory-driven approach, in this case starting with the initial programme theory. We will analyse the qualitative data by examining the extent to which the intervention designers&#x02019; assumptions were borne out, especially looking for alignments as well as contradictions to these programme theory assumptions. In doing so, we will borrow from wider literature on how and why interventions such as this one have been studied in literature, as well as scanning our data for micro and meso level contextual factors that affected programme performance and/or outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. We will thus refine the initial programme theory enriching it with the contextual understanding of the intervention in order to explain how the intervention worked (where it did) and under what conditions it worked. The resulting refined programme theory at the end of the intervention will be useful in understanding how local health systems such as Tumkur respond to resources that such interventions provide.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec37"><title>Understanding the <italic>why</italic> and <italic>how</italic> of interventions</title><p>Healthcare organisations and systems are complex entities, which do not respond uniformly and predictably to a given policy. Feedback loops and path dependence often result in policy failures or inadequate response, while there could also be unintended and unforeseen consequences of interventions. We have developed an intervention based on the gaps in the present health system that need to be addressed for the above policies to result in improved access to medicines for people with NCDs.</p><p>Our intervention is being implemented at the district level in partnership with the district health services. It could be described as a complex intervention in view of the involvement of actors at various levels of the health system with varying interests, powers and relationships. Innovative health services interventions need to be designed in LMICs to better understand the conditions that could enable improvement in complex health systems. Hence, integrating experimental study designs (effectiveness) with qualitative methods (process) is crucial. Our study provides a model for strengthening health services for NCDs and identifying the necessary conditions for improvements. By taking into consideration several components of the health system (governance, service delivery, resource planning and community) and trying to understand them, our study aims to generate evidence for health planners on how to optimise health services to improve access to medicines in a particular kind of setting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Medicines: from availability to access</title><p>In India, as in many other LMICs, various issues hinder access to medicines. The access issue is more acute for NCD patients due to their need for lifelong supply. Issues related to procurement, management of supply chain and the governance of drugs procurement systems in the state level are crucial to ensuring availability of medicines at PHCs. Since drugs procurement and supply is often relatively centralised in many states, those states that have implemented reforms of their procurement systems are better-off with respect to ensuring availability of medicines in PHCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. However, in addition to reforms at the state level, district and sub-district level capacity and performance issues are crucial to strong health systems. In most Indian states, local health systems are increasingly being strengthened through decentralisation reforms and understanding how such local initiatives at district and sub-district levels work is crucial to improving responsiveness of health systems to emerging challenges of providing good quality NCD care.</p><p>Access to medicines is much more than ensuring availability. In spite of free medicines and care at PHCs on paper, various reasons related to availability of services, acceptability of care, health-seeking behaviour of patients and perceived and technical quality of medicines and healthcare at government PHCs hinder utilisation of medicines, even where medicines are available. In the present study, we hope to better understand how this situation could be changed in favour of improving access to medicines.</p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>NCD in primary health care</title><p>Our intervention somewhat mirrors the much-criticized vertical disease-control approach as it focuses on improving access to medicines for NCD patients <italic>specifically</italic> (and thus not for patients presenting with other problems) and on strengthening processes at the primary level for the care of NCD patients <italic>specifically</italic> (and, again, not for patients presenting with other problems), while not addressing the various underlying reasons for the <italic>general</italic> under-performance of local health systems. A more integrated and less selective approach would have been more appropriate in addressing PHC-wide issues in drugs management and continuity of care rather than take up these issues only in relation to NCDs. The intervention by highlighting NCDs may in fact in some areas decrease focus on other services or activities that are less in the picture and therefore less well-resourced. To some extent, this may be addressed by ensuring that the intervention warrants that health workers privilege their existing services whenever there is a need to choose one against the other. In terms of sustainability of the intervention, since the most of the government health services in India do not currently provide systematic care and follow-up for NCDs, we foresee that the generation of research evidence and positive experiences by the district team during the ATM intervention may result in the incorporation of some of its intervention activities into their annual action plans.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec40"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12913_2016_1680_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Rapid local health system assessment.
