Both psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are effective
treatments for infertility stress. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of
cognitive behavioral therapy along with fluoxetine for improvement infertility stress in
infertile women.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>In a randomized controlled clinical trial, 89 infertile women
with mild to moderate depression (Beck scores 10-47) were recruited into the following three groups: i. cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), ii. antidepressant therapy,
and iii. control group. Twenty-nine participants in the CBT method received gradual
relaxation training, restructuring, and eliminating of negative automatic thoughts
and dysfunctional attitudes to infertility for 10 sessions. Thirty participants in the
pharmacotherapy group took 20 mg fluoxetine daily for 90 days. Thirty individuals
in control group did not receive any intervention. All participants completed fertility
problem inventory (FPI) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) at the beginning
and end of the study. We applied Chi-square paired t test, ANOVA and Turkey&#x02019;s test
to analyze the data. </p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean of the infertility stress scores in CBT, fluoxetine, and control
groups at the beginning and end of the study were as follows, respectively: 3.5 &#x000b1;
0.62 vs.2.7 &#x000b1; 0.62 (p&#x0003c;0.05), 3.5 &#x000b1; 0.53 vs.3.2 &#x000b1; 4.4 (p&#x0003c;0.05), and 3.4 &#x000b1; 0.55 vs. 3.5
&#x000b1; 0.48. In CBT group, the mean scores of social concern, sexual concern, marital
concern, rejection of child-free lifestyle, and need for parenthood decreased meaningfully compared to those before starting the therapy. But in fluoxetine group,
mean score of women sexual concern out of those five main problems of infertility
reduced significantly. Also, fluoxetine and CBT reduced depression compared to the
control group. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>CBT improved the social concerns, sexual concerns, marital concerns,
rejection of child-free lifestyle, and need for parenthood more than floxitine group.
Thus, CBT was not only a reliable alternative to pharmacotherapy, but also superior
to fluoxetine in resolving and reducing of infertility stress (Registration Number:

the infertility crisis, accompanies with physical, economical and social stress that affect all aspects of individual&#x02019;s life. Maybe it can be said that infertility is
one of the most stressful events in infertile people&#x02019;s
life (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Infertility and psychological difficulties
are interrelated with each other. Some researchers
believe the psychological difficulties as the cause of
infertility, and call it, "stress hypothesis". They believe infertility as a psychosomatic problem. They
also investigate the effect of psychological mood on
neuroendocrine activities and the pregnancy rate. A
study by Gallinelli et al. showed that there are correlations between stress, immunity, and fertility. Their
result showed that there was higher serum cortisol and
corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) in infertile
women than healthy control (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), while the similar
studies suggest that higher level of stress accompanies
with lower level of success in infertility therapy (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).
Feeling of threat, sexual concern, guilt, hopelessness
and marital problems are related to infertility (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>But others, who have more supporters, know psychological stress as the result of infertility. According
to this thesis, the experience of infertility affects the
infertile couple with deep emotional tensions which
is the fixed source of psychological and social dreads
(<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Various studies reported a rise in anxiety and depression, and also decrease in self-confidence (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).
The couples&#x02019; emotional reaction should be concerned
from the very point of diagnosis of infertility, during
therapy until success or failure of the process (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).
At the moment, there is an international agreement
that infertility centers should consider psychological
problems. Kainz believes the role of a psychologist
in infertility therapy process is investigation of cognitive documents, sexual problems, and marital relationships, while detecting and curing psychosomatic
problems relating to fertility is possible through application of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).
Psychological council regarding the way of adaption
with problem is a good way to avoid failure and
hopelessness in infertile women (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Terzioglu
showed that infertile couples who received daily information and support during treatment have lower
anxiety and depression scores, indicating higher life
satisfaction than control groups (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Similar studies
showed that teaching confronting methods to infertile
women gives rise to mental health and reduces depression (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). CBT is a psychotherapeutic approach
based upon a combination of basic behavioral and
cognitive research. The similar studies showed that
psychotherapy is a reliable alternative to pharmacotherapy in order to decrease anxiety and to promote
the mental health of infertile women (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Despite of widespread belief in the worthiness of CBT
in the treatment of a variety of psychological problems, relatively, few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in the field
of infertility. There have been no published studies or
randomized controlled prospective trials for adequate
comparison of the impact of group psychological inventions with pharmacotherapy on improvement of
infertility concerns. This study evaluated the different methods in order to achieve the best technique
for improvement of infertility stress, while answering
this question of whether CBT is a reliable alternative
method to fluoxetine in this regard.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted in Fatemeh Alzahra Infertility and Reproductive Health Research Center of the Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran, for nine
months during 2007.</p><p>After coordination and receiving confirmation
from Fatemeh Alzahra Infertility and Reproductive Health Research Center of Babol University of
Medical Sciences (Iran), infertile women who had
dossier the center, were recruited for this study. The
participated women had the following characteristics: less than 45 years of age, more than five years
of education, more than two years of infertility, having at least one <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization (IVF), no fertility treatment for a three-month interval after IVF, no
practicing in any relaxation techniques, no participating in any support group, no taking any psychotherapy, and no assisted reproductive therapy (ART).
Five midwives at the center conducted telephone
invitation with potential participants. Among 350
invitations, 200 patients accepted to enter the study,
so after giving the informed consent form, they were
referred to the center. Subsequent to completing the
demographic questionnaire and the Beck Depression
Inventory (BDI), a psychologist conducted a face-toface interview. Women either with a score &#x02264;9 or &#x0003e;47
on the BDI, or clinical diagnosis of severe depression
were excluded from the study. Thus, only women
with minimal, mild, and moderate depression (Beck
score 10-47) were included in the study. At the end of the interview session, participants were randomly selected for one of following three groups,
CBT, fluoxetine and control, through a computer program. The block randomization was by a
computer randomize list in which participants
were labeled randomly to number 1-124 by an
investigator with no clinical involvement in the
trial, like: numbers 1, 4, 7,&#x02026; for CBT; number
2, 5, 8,&#x02026; for fluoxetine; and numbers 3, 6, 9,&#x02026;
for control group. Figure 1 shows the flow diagram of participants through each stage of randomized controlled trial. Finally, 89 participants
were randomly divided among three groups as
follows: CBT (n=29), fluoxetine (n=30), and
controls (n=30).</p><p>Participants in the CBT group were engaged a
two-hour group cognitive behavior therapy session for 10 weeks. Progressive muscle relaxation
was added to the sessions 5-10. Groups consisted
of 8-12 members, and the therapist, as an expert
psychologist, was trained for the CBT program.
Therapy was conducted at the Psychiatry Department of the Babol University of Medical Sciences,
Babol, Iran. The first three sessions provided patients with a general orientation to cognitive therapy and the causes of infertility.</p><p>In the first three sessions, a gynecologist explained the cause of infertility for each woman.
Cognitive therapies included that dysfunctional
attitudes to social concerns, sexual concerns,
marital concerns, rejection of childfree lifestyle, and need for parenthood more required
challenged (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In sessions 4-6, irrational
beliefs about the infertility challenged. Finally, sessions 7-10 taught participants varying
techniques for maintaining the change of their
dysfunctional beliefs about infertility (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In
addition, session&#x02019;s 5-10 progressive muscle relaxation of Jacobson was added to the cognitive
therapy of Beck model (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of participants through each stage of randomized controlled trial.</p><p>*; Some of 40 depressed women refusing to participate in the study denied their mood disorders, while some of them believed
that they could find relief from depression without medication intervention. Some of them were concerned if they began their
treatment course, their family would mark them as mental patients.</p><p>**; Stressful events, like family death, heavy accidents, pregnancy, etc, affected the stress infertility or depression tests, so these
women were excluded from the analysis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="Int-J-Fertil-Steril-7-199-g01"/></fig><p>The pharmacotherapy group took a capsule of
fluoxetine (20 mg) daily for 90 days. After the
interview, 30 capsules, prescribed by a psychiatrist, were provided by the midwives of the center,
monthly. The control group didn&#x02019;t take any drug or
psychological intervention. They completed two
questionnaires at the beginning of the study and
three months after the interview. In CBT group,
subjects had therapy interventions, including IVF,
anti depression or psychological drug during three
months; however, some individuals with stressful
events such as family death were excluded from
analysis.</p><p>All participants completed the Fertility Problem Inventory (FPI) and BDI at the beginning
and end of the study. FPI used was a reliable
instrument to assess the infertility stress. This
instrument contains 46 items and 5 subscales
that cover infertile couple&#x02019;s stress such as social concern, sexual concern, marital relationships, rejection of child-free lifestyle, and need
for parenthood. Participants indicated their
degree of agreement with each item on a sixpoint Likert scale ranging from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree". Newton et al. (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>),
Cousineau and Domar (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) reported the internal consistency reliability was 0.22-0.66, testretest reliability was 83%, and its correlation
with Beck Inventory was 60%. Also, Persian
version of FPI is reported with high reliability
(&#x003b1;=0.91) (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). There was a meaningful positive
correlation (p&#x0003c;0.01) between Beck Depression Inventory and infertility stress test (0.75)
(<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In this sample, the internal consistency
reliability of FPI was 0.8. Also, its correlation
with BDI was 63%. The mean score of FPI for
infertile women was obtained after calculating
the scores in every subgroup. The least mean
score based on Likret index was 0, "strongly
disagree", and the highest one was 6, "strongly
agree". All aspects of this protocol were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Babol
University of Medical Sciences.</p><p>All analyses were performed using SPSS
software. Paired t-tests were used to compare
the mean scores of FPI and depression tests
in each study group, separately, before and
after interventions. Analysis of variance was
performed to compare the mean scores of the
tests in the three study groups at the beginning,
and also, at the end of the study. If there was
meaning difference among three groups, Posthoc (Turkey&#x02019;s test) test was used to compare
the mean differences. It should be noted that
results of this articles has been a part of extend project implemented for Fatemeh Alzahra
Fertility and Infertility Health Research Center
of the Babol University of Medical Sciences
(2007). Comparison pharmacotherapy and
psychotherapy in improvement depression,
anxiety, and general health reported in previous publications (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). This article focuses
on comparison of two types treatment in reducing of infertility problems in dimensions of
the social concerns, sexual concerns, marital
concerns, rejection of child-free lifestyle, and
need for parenthood.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The findings of research showed that there

and playing this role is suitable for women (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).
In different cultures, becoming a parent is a turning point, and is also assumed to be an important
occurrence in couple&#x02019;s life (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Inability to have a
child is a stressful condition for infertile couple (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>)
because both man and woman are frustrated, damaged and under too much pressure. They may also
pay less attention to each other&#x02019;s needs, so that
their relationship will be cold and damaged (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).
Alizadeh et al. (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) declared, "Infertile women
tolerate too much pressure and this pressure could
affect the couple&#x02019;s interpersonal relationships, and
also, can disrupt their marital and sexual relationship which finally leads to a critic condition". They
also suggested that CBT psychotherapy is significantly effective on infertility stress. Domar et al.
(<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) in a controlled clinical trial showed "the impact of group psychological intervention on distress in infertile women". </p><p>It evaluated CBT group and supportive psychotherapy group with control group. The results
showed that the different stressful subjects relating
to psychological indexes of intervention group,
especially the CBT group, decreased in comparison to that of control group (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Cousineau
and Domar (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) believed that psychological interventions, especially proper training for adapting
different skills in order to assess and mange the
stress, had beneficial effects on infertile women.
In a similar study by Gharaie et al. (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) the CBT trainings decreased stress and anxiety of infertile
women undergoing the infertility therapy. Wallace also showed that stress and anxiety of patient
decreased after counseling supports (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), while
women in the CBT sessions reached a better mood,
and their stress and anxiety decreased compared to
control group (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p><p>Our results revealed a significant decrease in all
infertility stress dimensions (social, sexual, marital
concerns, rejection of childfree lifestyle, and need
for parenthood) in CBT group, whereas in fluoxetine group, there was only a significant decrease
in sexual concern dimension. Faramarzi et al. (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>)
and Antonuccio et al. (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) reported that CBT is
not only a reliable alternative to pharmacotherapy, but also superior to fluoxetine in the resolving
or reducing of depression and anxiety of infertile
women. The other investigations also showed that
using CBT could decrease all physical and psychological symptoms such as anxiety, depression,
frustration, insomnia, etc (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In addition, they
declared that high level of distress is observed in
infertile women who had the least emotional supports from families and spouses (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). So, the infertility centers should provide different therapy
programs through which infertile women receive
proper support and necessary trainings in order to
learn how to manage the stress (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>-<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).</p><p>Our finding confirmed the management of depression in the both fluoxetine and CBT groups
that complete description was previously reported by Faramarzi et al. (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Some similar studies
know CBT as the effective therapy for depression
(<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Doing psychological interventions through
CBT and supportive counseling could not only
improve the depression, but also increase reproduction fertility in CBT group by 55%, supportive
group by 54%, and control group by 20% (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>).</p><p> Studies by Thorn reported that infertility counseling decreases the emotional burden of infertility
during treatment, while psychological counseling
not only supplies the vital emotional support, but
also diminishes the drop-out rate in infertility
treatment (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Also, there are results showing that psychological programs decrease negative
feelings through group interventions by training
necessary skills in order to decrease the depression (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). There were a number of limitations
in the current study. The first limitation was that 40
mild to moderate depressed women did not agree
to enter treatment protocol. The second limitation was the number of dropouts from experimental and control groups. Fortunately, demographic
characteristics of women were the same before
and after dropouts. We determined that the number of dropouts did not bias the data in favor of
the interventions. Third limitation was cultured
band difference in north of IRAN that was a variable response to CBT or compliance for treatment.
Forth limitation referred to the nature of two types
of treatment. CBT group received more treatment
than drug group, so the obtained positive results
may be due to more effective counseling programs
rather than anything specific about CBT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>CBT was effective on decreasing fertility stress
in dimensions of the social concerns, sexual concerns, marital concerns, rejection of child-free lifestyle, and need for parenthood. Also, CBT was superior to fluoxetine for resolving infertility stress.
Of course, more studies are needed to investigate
the effect of CBT on rate of reproduction fertility in infertile women. This project proposed that
it is necessary to investigate the effectiveness of
routine CBT to prevent infertility stress in infertile
couples.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to the Vice Chancellery for Research and Technology Committee of Babol University of Medical Sciences for financial support
