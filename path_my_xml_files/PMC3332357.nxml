Osteoporotic VCFs are associated with a significantly decreased quality of life and increased mortality in the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) has been performed for more than 10&#x000a0;years to treat painful osteoporotic VCFs. For patients with acute osteoporotic VCFs and persistent pain, PVP is effective and safe. Pain relief after vertebroplasty is immediate, sustained for at least 1&#x000a0;year, and is significantly greater than that achieved with conservative treatment, at an acceptable cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Nonetheless, clinical studies suggest patients who undergo vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty have a greater risk of new-onset VCFs in adjacent and non-adjacent spinal levels compared to patients with prior VCFs who did not undergo either procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Following vertebroplasty, patients are at an increased risk of new-onset adjacent-level VCFs, and when these fractures occur, they occur sooner than non-adjacent-level fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Most new adjacent VCFs occurred within 3&#x000a0;months of PVPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The relative risk of adjacent-level fracture was 4.62 times that of non-adjacent-level fracture. If treatment to prevent VCFs was not immediate and effective, new-onset VCFs occurred repeatedly within a few years after PVP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Further fracture prevention is as important as pain relief in treating severe osteoporotic VCFs. Vertebroplasty does not play a role in further fracture prevention.</p><p>Antiresorptive agents are widely used to treat osteoporosis. Data from clinical trials show that antiresorptive agents (raloxifene and alendronate) reduce the risk of vertebral fracture by 40% to 50% after 3&#x000a0;years of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Nonetheless, in the treatment of severely osteoporotic patients, the therapeutic effect of antiresorptive agents is too slow, and the use of these agents is associated with a high risk of new-onset fractures.</p><p>Teriparatide (rDNA origin) injection [recombinant human PTH(1&#x02013;34)] is the first bone anabolic agent for the treatment of osteoporosis. Teriparatide administered once daily through subcutaneous self-injection results in a rapid and greater increase in vertebral bone mineral density (BMD) and a decreased risk of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women and men with osteoporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Teriparatide, with a mechanism different from that of antiresorptive agents, preferentially increases bone formation through direct early stimulation of osteoblasts. This increase in new bone formation results in a positive bone balance at the level of individual bone multicellular units and improved bone microarchitecture and quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. We hypothesized that treating the adjacent VCF after PVP requires a faster increase in new bone formation and improved bone strength and quality. This prospective cohort study aimed to assess the immediate and mid-term efficacy and safety of teriparatide for treatment of new-onset adjacent compression fractures after PVP. We prospectively compared the therapeutic effects of teriparatide and combined vertebroplasty with an antiresorptive agent in fracture prevention, BMD increase, and sustained pain relief.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>All patients provided informed written consent before participating. We identified 50 patients who had adjacent VCFs after vertebroplasty from November 2007 to December 2010. VCF was diagnosed based on radiologic findings in all patients. All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations for definitive diagnosis of new-onset osteoporotic VCFs when they had their first painful VCF. The exclusion criteria were spinal cancer, neurologic complications, osteoporotic vertebral collapse of greater than 90%, fracture through or destruction of the posterior wall, retropulsed bony fragmentation or bony fragments impinging on the spinal cord, medical conditions that would make the patient ineligible for emergency decompressive surgery if needed, and a likelihood of noncompliance with follow-up.</p><p>All subjects completed a baseline questionnaire that inquired about use of alcohol and cigarettes, rheumatic arthritis, history of spine or other bone fractures, and history of corticosteroid use. The patients were randomly assigned to either group A or group B (if the last number of their identification card was odd, they were assigned to group A (24 patients); if the last number was even, they were assigned to group B) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Two patients in group A refused to accept daily subcutaneous injections of teriparatide and were excluded from this study. The remaining 22 patients in group A received subcutaneous injections of teriparatide (20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) once daily and daily supplementation with calcium (1,000&#x02013;1,500&#x000a0;mg) and vitamin D (800&#x02013;1,000&#x000a0;IU) throughout the study.

These four patients were excluded from the analysis. The remaining 22 patients in group B were given antiresorptive agents (alendronate or raloxifene) combined with calcium supplementation (1,000&#x02013;1,500&#x000a0;mg) and vitamin D (800&#x02013;1,000&#x000a0;IU) for osteoporosis treatment for at least 20&#x000a0;months after the occurrence of adjacent osteoporotic VCFs. The male patients were given alendronate treatment. For the female patients, if the last number of the medical record number was odd, raloxifene was used to treat the osteoporosis; if the last number was even, alendronate was used. The oral dosage of alendronate was 70&#x000a0;mg once weekly and that of raloxifene was 60&#x000a0;mg once daily. The antiresorptive agents were not combined. Patients who experienced side effects or had low compliance with their assigned antiresorptive agent were switched to the other agent. Two women had severe epigastric pain and nausea, and one woman had severe constipation after taking alendronate; these three patients were switched to raloxifene treatment. Two women had severe hot flashes, and one had intolerable leg cramps after taking raloxifene. These three women were switched to alendronate treatment. One of these antiresorptive agents had to be used for osteoporosis treatment for at least 18&#x000a0;months after an adjacent osteoporotic VCF occurred. If the patients in either group experienced new-onset VCFs, the painful vertebrae were located by a combination of local tenderness at the fracture site and the typical appearance of the fracture on radiographic (or MRI) evaluation. The indications for PVP were intense focal back pain, progressive kyphosis, and failure of conservative medical therapy in patients who had worn an orthosis for at least 1&#x000a0;month, if their visual analog scale (VAS) was less than 7. If the patient's VAS score was greater than 7 and conservative therapy for more than 2&#x000a0;weeks had failed, PVP was performed. The follow-up period for the 22 patients in group B was 24.63&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.48&#x000a0;months (range, 20&#x02013;36&#x000a0;months), beginning at the time post-PVP adjacent VCF was diagnosed.</p><p>Clinical data on patients in both groups included age, sex, number of pre-existing VCFs, baseline BMD, bone mass index (BMI), the volume of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) injected during the first PVP, and the duration between new-onset VCFs (including adjacent and non-adjacent). For the vertebral reduction ratio (using a quantitative assessment) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], we measured the anterior (Ha), posterior (Pa), adjacent posterior (Hpa), and middle (Hm) vertebral body height. In addition, the following ratios were calculated: anterior&#x02013;posterior ratio = Ha/Hp, middle-posterior ratio = Hm/Hp, and posterior&#x02013;posterior adjacent ratio = Hp/Hpa. The lowest value was defined as the vertebral reduction ratio.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Outcome assessment</title><p>Anteroposterior and lateral lumbar spine radiographs were obtained at baseline to determine whether at least two evaluable vertebrae in the lumbar spine region (L1&#x02013;L4) were present in each patient fulfilling BMD entry criteria.

Lumbar spine (L1&#x02013;L4) measurements were obtained, and vertebrae with structural change or artifacts were excluded. Diagnoses were not made based on single vertebral bodies. The densitometries for each patient consistently used the same DXA system, acquisition methods, software, and young normal databases.</p><p>The Huskisson VAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] was used to estimate pain perception at baseline and at 1, 6, 12, and 18&#x000a0;months after administration of teriparatide. The standard scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (intolerable pain) was used for pain analysis. The Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) low back pain scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] for clinical symptoms of patients with lower back pain were calculated at baseline and at 1, 6, 12, and 18&#x000a0;months. The JOA scores ranged from &#x02212;6 to 29 points; the higher the score, the more normal is the patient's overall status.

No additional VCF occurred, and the patient was symptom free at 33&#x000a0;months of follow-up. In group B, four (18.18%) patients developed new-onset VCFs (five vertebrae) after the second PVP, and received a third PVP. Among those four patients, one (25%) developed new-onset VCFs after the third PVP and required a fourth PVP (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

Muscle power in both legs of the patient who underwent decompressive laminectomy recovered gradually but not fully during a 6-month rehabilitation program. Overall, teriparatide reduced the risk of new-onset VCFs after vertebroplasty (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.21; 95% CI, 0.02&#x02013;2.10).

Studies show that VCFs are often not diagnosed, and only about 30% of VCFs come to medical attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are minimally invasive procedures for the treatment of VCFs and are used primarily for pain relief and restoration of vertebral body height. Nonetheless, recent studies have questioned the effects of vertebroplasty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Buchbinder et al. found vertebroplasty had no beneficial effect compared with a sham procedure in patients with painful osteoporotic VCFs at 1&#x000a0;week and at 1, 3, or 6&#x000a0;months after treatment. They demonstrated vertebroplasty did not result in a significant advantage in any measured outcome at any time point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

The lack of statistical significance between these two periods shows that pain relief was not sustained. Teriparatide reduced fracture risk, and in a published meta-analysis of clinical trials, teriparatide-treated patients had a reduced incidence of back pain relative to a placebo and antiresorptive drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Patients randomized to teriparatide had a reduced risk of new or worsening back pain compared with patients randomized to a placebo, hormone replacement therapy, or alendronate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Patients with osteoporosis treated with antiresorptive and anabolic agents, particularly those with teriparatide therapy, had a reduced risk of new or worsening back pain.

A randomized double-blind trial comparing the effect of teriparatide to that of alendronate sodium on BMD, non-vertebral fracture incidence, and bone turnover in 146 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis revealed that at 3&#x000a0;months, teriparatide was significantly more effective at increasing lumbar spine BMD than alendronate (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001).

Thus, the teriparatide-mediated BMD increase was much greater than that of antiresorptive therapy.</p><p>Currently, the extent to which the anti-fracture efficacy of antiresorptive drugs is related to changes in BMD is under debate. Wasnich and Miller have provided a model that predicted that treatments increasing spine BMD by 8% would reduce the risk of VCFs by 54% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].

Although antiresorptive agents increased BMD and improved the bone quality of the lumbar spine, they were slow acting and did not rapidly increase BMD and guard against the development of new-onset VCFs after PVP.</p><p>Investigators have suggested that the gain in BMD with alendronate and other antiresorptive agents may be achieved by a remodeling of spaces, that is, reducing bone turnover without a true stimulation of bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Teriparatide (rDNA origin) injection (recombinant human parathyroid hormone, PTH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]) directly stimulates bone formation via stimulating bone remodeling, increases BMD, and restores bone architecture and integrity. In contrast, bisphosphonates reduce bone resorption and increase BMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Studies have shown that teriparatide induces large increases in biochemical markers of bone formation after 1&#x000a0;month of therapy, followed by a delayed increase in bone resorption markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. These data show that teriparatide treatment for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis significantly increased cancellous bone volume and connectivity, improved trabecular morphology with a shift toward a more plate-like structure, and increased cortical bone thickness. These changes in cancellous and cortical bone morphology should improve biomechanical competence and are consistent with the substantially reduced incidences of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures during administration of teriparatide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>Two-dimensional histomorphometric and three-dimensional micro-computed tomography (CT) parameters were measured along with lumbar spine BMD at baseline and 12 or 18&#x000a0;months after teriparatide treatment. Since increases in BMD are correlated with improvements in trabecular microarchitecture in the iliac crests of patients taking teriparatide treatment, improvements in trabecular bone microarchitecture could be one of the mechanisms explaining how BMD increases improve bone strength during teriparatide treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Teriparatide treatment results in an increase in BMD and is a potentially useful therapy for osteoporosis in men and for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The subcutaneous daily dose of teriparatide (20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) decreased the occurrence of new VCFs in white women (70&#x000a0;years of age) by 65%, in a large randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Moderate-to-severe fractures and multiple vertebral fractures were reduced by 90% and 77%, respectively. These results indicate that the clinical effects of teriparatide were consistent in both older and younger women. Age does not affect the safety and efficacy of teriparatide in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In our study, teriparatide-mediated fracture risk reduction was 78.57%. Patients treated with teriparatide had a significantly lower risk of new-onset VCFs (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.21; 95% CI, 0.02&#x02013;2.1).</p><p>In order to evaluate therapeutic effect, serial measurements of BMD are necessary. There is no absolutely reliable skeletal site or region of interest for monitoring these changes.

Even though one patient in group A and three patients in group B had only one usable vertebral body from L1 to L4 for the DEXA examination, we still preferred to use the lumbar spine for BMD monitoring of treatment.</p><p>Furthermore, the beneficial effects of teriparatide on vertebral fracture prevention and BMD persisted after treatment cessation. Teriparatide had a sustained effect in reducing the risk of non-vertebral fragility fractures for 18&#x02013;30&#x000a0;months after discontinuation of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p>As teriparatide is expensive, its use at the moment should be limited to patients with more severe forms of osteoporosis, usually with the presence or history of one or more fractures, because those patients are at high risk for subsequent fractures. We used teriparatide to treat new-onset adjacent VCFs after vertebroplasty and had good therapeutic pain relief and fracture prevention. Teriparatide is generally well tolerated, and treatment compliance rates are favorable. However, current limitations on the length of treatment and the high acquisition cost mean that teriparatide is best reserved for the treatment of patients with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture, or for patients with osteoporosis that have unsatisfactory responses to or intolerance of other osteoporosis therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>The limitations of the present study include the patient selection criteria. Some conditions, including degenerative lumbar spine disorder, long-term systemic disease, and previous leg fracture could affect the outcome of VCF treatment. Some patients in Taiwan seek out herbal medicines or folk remedies for back pain or other diseases, and some of these folk prescriptions include steroid, which can impact the therapeutic effect. Sometimes, patients suffering from a second VCF will seek out treatment in other hospitals. Many patients in our two groups had also undergone PVP in other hospitals and visited our hospital for medical treatment when new-onset VCFs occurred. Precise data on previous treatment for osteoporosis and medical history were difficult to obtain. The cost of teriparatide is high, and it is offered by Taiwan's Bureau of National Health Insurance for 18&#x000a0;months to severe osteoporostic patients. Only a few patients continued with self-paid treatment after the 18&#x000a0;months. Therefore, the treatment period was limited. Since the administration routes for teriparatide (subcutaneous injection) and antiresorptive agents (oral intake) are different, it is difficult to perform a double-blind study. An evaluation of pain relief should consider the dosage of analgesics, but complicated pharmacodynamics, side effects, and drug compliance with different analgesics may flaw the evaluation. The result of such studies would help patients choose the procedure that is optimal for them in terms of pain relief, fracture prevention, treatment safety and cost.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Fracture prevention and pain relief are the primary treatment goals for patients with osteoporotic VCFs. Although PVP can provide immediate pain relief, the procedure accelerates the failure rate in the adjacent vertebral body. Antiresorptive agents do not significantly and rapidly increase BMD and reduce the risk for VCFs. Most post-vertebroplasty new-onset adjacent VCFs occur within 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;months, and antiresorptive agents do not protect against their development. In our study, teriparatide-mediated BMD was significantly increased by 21.7% after 18&#x000a0;months of treatment, and fracture risk reduction was 78.57%. Teriparatide therapy significantly increased JOA and decreased VAS scores. The therapeutic effect of teriparatide is better than that of vertebroplasty combined with an antiresorptive treatment and is a potentially useful therapy for new-onset adjacent compression fractures after vertebroplasty.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="d29e975"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>None.</p></sec><sec id="d29e980"><title>Open Access</title><p>This article is distributed
