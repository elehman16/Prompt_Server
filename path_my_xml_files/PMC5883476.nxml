Instrumental techniques eliminate the subjective interpretation inherent in a visual color comparison. Therefore, spectrophotometers and colorimeters are widely used tools to detect the color changes in dental restorative materials.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Color change (&#x00394;E) mathematically expresses the amount of difference between the L*a*b* coordinates of different specimens or the same specimen at different instances.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The aim of this <italic>in vitro</italic> study was to evaluate and compare the color stability of various esthetic restorative materials after surface finishing/polishing with different procedures.

</p><p>To reduce variability, the same investigator performed all finishing/polishing procedures. The force used in the polishing procedure was controlled with a dynamometer (Taylor Dynamometer Inc., Milwaukee, WI, USA). The instruments were used parallel on the surface and each polisher was used for 10 s.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Staining process</title><p>The staining solution used was coffee (Nescafe Classic, Nestle, Vevey, Switzerland). The coffee was prepared using a proportion of two spoons of powder for 250 ml of water at room temperature. The specimens were immersed in staining solution at room temperature over a 28-day test period. The control samples have not been subjected to the staining process and were stored in distilled water during the whole experimentation period. Staining solution was changed daily and put in vials with cover that prevent evaporation. Spectrophotometric analysis was made before staining, after staining, and after 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after the beginning of the experimentation. We indicate each time interval as D0, D1, D2, D3, and D4. Before each measurement, the specimens were rinsed with distilled water and air-dried.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Color testing</title><p>A blind trained operator performed the colorimetric evaluation according to the CIE L*a*b* system at six experimental periods: Immediately after light polymerization, after finishing/polishing procedures, and at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days of the staining process. To simulate the absence of light in the mouth, the color of the specimens was measured against a black background with a spectrophotometer (SP820&#x003bb;; Techkon GmbH, Konig-Stein, Germany). All specimens were chromatically measured four times and the average values were calculated; then, each color parameter for each specimens of the same shade was averaged. The total color differences (&#x00394;Eab*) were calculated as follows:</p><p>&#x00394;E<sub>ab</sub>* = [(&#x00394;L*)<sup>2</sup> + (&#x00394;a*)<sup>2</sup> + (&#x00394;b*)<sup>2</sup>]<sup>1/2</sup></p><p>Where L* is lightness, a* is green-red component (&#x02212;a* = green; +a* = red), and b* is blue-yellow component (&#x02212;b* = blue; +b* = yellow). A value of &#x00394;Eab* &#x0003c;3.3 was considered clinically acceptable in the present study. Color measurements of the experimental groups were compared with those of the control group.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using computer software (Stata 12.0, Stata Corp., Station College, TX, USA). Descriptive statistics including the mean, standard deviation, median, and minimum and maximum values were calculated for each color coordinate for all the groups. The distributions were assessed and found to be nonnormal (Shapiro&#x02013;Wilk Test). Nonparametric Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) by the factor of material was performed with the differences in color (&#x025b3;E*ab) and three-color coordinates (CIE L*, CIE a*, and CIE b*) between different immersion protocols in the specimen conditions such as before staining and after staining at the significance level of 0.05. Changes in color coordinates were calculated as &#x0201c;color coordinate of stained surfaces.&#x0201d; Means of the different polishing/finishing groups were compared with Scheffe's multiple comparison test at the 0.05 level of significance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The mean values and standard deviations of the color changes (&#x00394;E) for each material are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>. Every subsequent weekly measurement was collected to assess the color change in relation to the time of immersion. Thus, for each experimental group, every material has five mean values (D0, D1, D2, D3, and D4). Before immersion in staining solutions, the materials presented similar values (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). According to ANOVA, the restorative material, time of exposure to the staining agent, and polishing/finishing technique were found statistically significance (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in color change. The absence of any polishing/finishing technique as control caused a significant lower staining for Essentia, Admira Fusion, and Estelite if compared to the other restorative materials that significantly changed their colorimetric parameters in 4 weeks (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. The polishing/finishing technique used in Group 2 (three polishers interspersed with diamond grit) caused a significantly different color change for all the materials tested if compared to control group.

In fact, not only the time of exposure to the staining agent but also the polishing/finishing technique played a significant role in color change. Visually and/or specific instruments can be used to assess color change of dental materials.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Various studies reported the advantages of using the CIE L*a*b* coordinate system, such as its repeatability, sensitivity, and objectivity. This technique was chosen to evaluate the color variation (&#x00394;E) because it is well suited for the determination of small color variations.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Several authors have reported that &#x00394;E values ranging from 1 to 3 are perceptible to the naked eye and &#x00394;E values &#x0003e;3.3 are clinically unacceptable.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In this study, almost all the materials tested presented an unacceptable color variation (&#x00394;E &#x02265; 3.3) after 1 week of the staining process regardless of the finishing treatment performed.</p><p>According to Erta&#x0015f; <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] in this study, a long-term staining protocol of 28 days was performed. This time of exposure should simulate around 2 years of clinical exposure to the staining agents (24 h <italic>in vitro</italic> corresponds to about 1 month <italic>in vivo</italic>), which is considered sufficient for long-term staining susceptibility evaluation.</p><p>Coffee was selected as the staining agents, in accordance with the studies which demonstrated that certain substances (e.g., coffee) may cause more severe staining than other.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>The effectiveness of finishing/polishing procedures on composite surface is an important goal to be achieved in the restorative process; resin composite restoration can be imperceptible only if its surface closely resembles the enamel surface. It is well known that the smoothest obtainable surface is achieved by curing the material in direct contact with a Mylar strip.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] For recontouring restorations or removing excess material, some abrasive instruments such as flexible discs and finishing burs are used. Numerous studies indicate that rubber polishers with diamond grit produce smoother surfaces than diamond finishing burs, tungsten carbide burs, or mounted stones.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Similarly, in this study (except for Essentia), the finishing technique used for Groups 2 and 3 (polishers alone) tended to maintain lower staining when compared with Group 4 (tungsten carbide bur + polisher). Hence, we can say that rubber polishers created smoother surfaces and therefore lower staining susceptibility if compared to the use of carbide burs.</p><p>According to Paravina <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] a decrease in the particle size of the abrasive produces a superior surface. The grit in the polishing material should be smaller than the particle size of the restorative material that is being polished to produce better results. A recent study showed that polishers' capability of producing smooth surfaces was related to their ability to cut the filler particle and matrix equally.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In the present study, carbide burs produced higher color variations than the other groups. These instruments are necessary for contouring anatomically structured and concave surfaces such as the lingual surface of anterior teeth or the occlusal surfaces of posterior teeth.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Furthermore, while diamond burs were best suited for gross removal and contouring because of their high cutting efficiency, carbide burs would be best suited for smoothing and finishing because of their low cutting efficiency. However, various studies are in accordance with the findings of this study, underlying that finishing carbide produce rough surfaces and therefore higher discoloration compared with those produced by rubber polishers or aluminum discs.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>As regards the type of composite resin, in this study, in the absence of any finishing treatment (control group), the lower staining was recorded for the hybrid composites (Essentia, Admira Fusion, and Estelite) if compared to the other restorative materials. Without finishing procedure, these three different hybrid composites demonstrated lower staining susceptibility if compared to the other microfilled and nanofilled materials tested. Similar results were reported in our previous study, in which Estelite and Admira Fusion showed similar results, thus demonstrating the lowest &#x025b3;E.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Our results are also in accordance with recent studies which reported higher discoloration for nanofilled composites compared to nanohybrid ones.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Ayad showed for Ormocer composites significantly lower color susceptibility if compared to nanofilled resins.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>However, in this study, after the polishing/finishing protocols, the behavior of the materials tested changed. Finishing caused a significantly different color change for all the materials tested if compared to control group and the nanofilled composites Filtek Supreme XTE and Ceram.X Universal showed a significantly lower degree of staining. After finishing, the other restorative materials showed significantly higher values and particularly the microhybrid composite Essentia reported the highest values of discoloration after all the three different finishing protocols. This finding can be explained by the polishability of the resin composite, which is directly affected by the filler particle size. Generally, the smaller the average particle size, the easier it will be to polish the resin.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] The filler content of the composite affects its roughness; consequently, nanofilled composites showed smoother surfaces than microfilled composites.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] In addition to this, in the present study, polished nanofilled composites showed lower discoloration (and probably lower surface roughness) if compared to polished hybrid resins. As it was stated before, nanofilled composite resins contain fillers with size ranging from around 5 to 100 nm, and the particle size is similar.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] However, hybrid composite resins contain fillers with different particle sizes. The finishing burs or the polisher cut better particles with similar size while the presence of inhomogeneous fillers (as for hybrid composites) reduce the effect of polishing of the instrument used. For this reason, after the finishing procedures, the nanofilled composite resin tested in this study showed lower discoloration than hybrid composite resin materials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Within the limitations of this study, the finishing treatments used had a significant effect on the color stability of the esthetic restorative materials tested.
