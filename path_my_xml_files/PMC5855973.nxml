Such advice begins early in life and includes the avoidance of sedentary behaviors (e.g. television viewing) and the encouragement of physical activity. For example, in the United States, recommendations for &#x0201c;tummy time&#x0201d; occur at the 2-month well child visit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and the avoidance of television viewing and other screens (i.e. web-based programming, mobile/interactive technologies) is emphasized during infancy and early childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This early life guidance is intended to promote healthy long-term behaviors, given the numerous negative health consequences associated with screen time and sedentary behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], as well as the many positive outcomes associated with being physically active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. For example, screen time is associated with an increased body mass index (BMI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], reduced sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], social/emotional delays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], decreased parent-child interactions, and less joint active play [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Parent-child play is particularly important during early childhood, as this cultivates learning, fosters creativity, and encourages parent-child relationships that promote healthy development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Limited research has quantified infant screen time and interactive play (i.e. interactions that aid in physical and social development), particularly longitudinal patterns from infancy to early childhood. In a systematic review of children less than 2&#x000a0;years of age, average daily television exposure was widely variable (54.6&#x02013;330.9&#x000a0;min per day) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. To reduce screen time and promote interactive play, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends 1) limited screen time for children &#x0003c;&#x02009;2&#x000a0;years of age, 2) no screen time during meals, 3) no television in children&#x02019;s bedroom, 4) daily interactive play for children, ideally with parent engagement, and 5) limited time that infants are in restrictive devices (e.g. swings, bouncers) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Yet, little evidence has quantified parents and children&#x02019;s compliance with this anticipatory guidance provided by the AAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Further, this anticipatory guidance may not be common internationally; therefore, interventions can be designed to supplement this guidance and further promote associated, positive health outcomes. The Healthy Beginnings Trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], Prevention of Overweight in Infancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and Infant Feeding Activity and Nutrition Trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] are among the few interventions that have targeted secondary outcomes of increasing interactive play and reducing sedentary behavior during infancy. These interventions were delivered across infants first 1.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] to 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] years of life by nurse home visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] or group education sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] to first-time mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Both positive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and null [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] findings on increasing tummy time and/or physical activity resulted; therefore suggesting these as promising intervention targets that require additional research to increase effectiveness.</p><p id="Par13">The Intervention Nurses Start Infants Growing on Healthy Trajectories (INSIGHT) trial is a responsive parenting (RP) intervention, designed to prevent rapid infant weight gain and overweight during early childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. RP guidance provided to mothers included responding promptly, contingently, and in developmentally appropriate ways during different states of infant arousal, including fussing/crying, active/alert, drowsy, and sleepy. As one component of INSIGHT, guidance based on AAP recommendations was provided to reduce screen time and increase parent-child time spent engaged in interactive play. We have previously shown that INSIGHT reduced rapid weight gain during the first 6&#x000a0;months of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], reduced the prevalence of overweight at age 1&#x000a0;year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], increased sleep duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and improved the dietary patterns of formula fed infants in the RP condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The aims of these analyses were to 1) describe mothers and children&#x02019;s screen time, television exposure, and interactive play from infancy to early childhood and 2) examine the effects of INSIGHT on mother&#x02019;s and children&#x02019;s screen time, television exposure, and interactive play. We hypothesized 1) mother&#x02019;s screen time would decrease and children&#x02019;s screen time would increase from infancy to early childhood and 2) the RP group would have less screen time and television exposure, with greater time in interactive play, compared to the control group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants and study design</title><p id="Par14">Full details on the INSIGHT study design, eligibility criteria, and CONSORT diagram are published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Briefly, mothers were eligible for INSIGHT if they were primiparous, English-speaking, &#x02265;20&#x000a0;years of age, and had a singleton infant born full-term (&#x02265;37&#x000a0;weeks gestation) with a birth weight&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;2500&#x000a0;g. Mothers were recruited from the maternity ward at a single center (Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, PA, USA) from January 2012 to March 2014, then randomized 2&#x000a0;weeks after delivery into a responsive parenting (RP) or safety control group. Study groups were stratified by intended feeding mode (breast or formula) and birth weight for gestational age (&#x0003c;50th or &#x02265;50th percentile). Trained research nurses delivered the INSIGHT RP and control intervention material to mothers during one-on-one home visits when infants were 3&#x02013;4, 16, 28, and 40&#x000a0;weeks of age, and at a research center visit when infants were 1 and 2&#x000a0;years of age. Of the 316 participants enrolled, 291 were randomized, and a final cohort of <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;279 mother-infant dyads completed the first home visit. Participant retention was 83%, with <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;233 remaining in the study at 3&#x000a0;years. Mothers who dropped out of the study were more likely to be not married, Hispanic, Black, and younger than mothers who remained in the study.

In the context of these four states, the RP group received messages around promoting child self-regulation, while the control group received messages on child safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. INSIGHT&#x02019;s central focus was to encourage responsive feeding to promote self-regulation of food intake and reduce overweight; yet, this multi-component intervention also included messages on parenting practices regarding sleep, emotional regulation, and interactive play. The intervention messages relevant to these analyses on screen time, television exposure, and interactive play are described in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The control group received child safety messages at the same time points that were matched for content intensity. These safety messages were centered on the same four infant behavioral states (drowsy, sleepy, fussy, and alert/calm) and avoided any messages that could impact energy balance. For example, fire safety, prevention of falls, and toy safety were discussed. The RP messages on screen time reflected the 2012 AAP guidelines, which were current at the time of intervention delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Timing of screen time, television exposure, and interactive play messages in the responsive parenting intervention curriculum</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th colspan="5">Child age (weeks)</th></tr><tr><th>Intervention messages</th><th>3&#x02013;4</th><th>16</th><th>28</th><th>40</th><th>52</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="6">Screen Time and Television Exposure</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Limit screen time (i.e. televisions, computer)</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;No television in the child&#x02019;s bedroom</td><td/><td/><td/><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;No television on when infant is in the room</td><td/><td>X</td><td>X</td><td/><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Never have the television on during meals</td><td/><td/><td/><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6">Interactive Play</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Practice tummy time several times per day</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Encourage on-the-floor free play</td><td/><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Limit use of restrictive devices (i.e. swings)</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Interact and play with your infant</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Provide outdoor play time</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Model physical activity</td><td/><td/><td>X</td><td>X</td><td/></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Screen time and television exposure were assessed at infant age 44&#x000a0;weeks, and 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5&#x000a0;years.

Further, the duration in which the television was on in the home (i.e, either being watched or as background noise) was lower&#x000a0;for RP children (5.4&#x000a0;h/day) compared to control children (6&#x000a0;h/day). Reducing television exposure at a young age is important, due to its association with lower quality parent-child interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and reduced academic, psychosocial, and health behaviors in later childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. INSIGHT also reduced the reported television exposure during children&#x02019;s meals for the RP group compared to the control group. Feeding young children with the television on is thought to decrease responsiveness during feeding, which may override children&#x02019;s internal hunger and satiety cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. For example, among preschoolers who frequently watched television, their energy intake during a single meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and overall intake of discretionary foods high in saturated fat and/or added sugars was greater while television viewing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Educating parents on the importance of reducing television exposure at a young age can establish healthy habits early in life, with the potential for enduring benefits that prevent the development of unhealthy eating behaviors later in life.</p><p id="Par32">In our sample, greater maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, lower maternal age and family income, and not predominantly breastfeeding were associated with greater television exposure in the home. In a more diverse population, (e.g. minorities, non-married individuals, those experiencing depression), television exposure may be even greater [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] with differences in television content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. For example, in a sample of predominantly non-married, low-income African American mothers, Thompson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] found infants were placed in front of a television for an average of 2.6&#x000a0;h per day at 3&#x000a0;months of age, with greater infant television exposure associated with greater maternal television viewing and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Higher socioeconomic index is also associated with greater child-directed programming, as opposed to adult-directed programming, during infant television viewing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Lastly, among families enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, less parental viewing of electronic media and households with &#x0003c;&#x02009;2 televisions had children more likely to meet the 2012 AAP guidelines on screen time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Given these findings, interventions to reduce television exposure and screen time should consider tailoring intervention content for individuals with characteristics found to be associated with greater exposure. For example, family-centered interventions among low-income populations that aim to reduce parental media use and the number of televisions in the home may provide modifiable targets to limit screen time throughout infancy and childhood.</p><p id="Par33">INSIGHT had less influence on interactive play behaviors. The majority of all infants engaged in daily tummy time (&#x0003e;&#x02009;80%), daily mother-infant floor play (&#x0003e;&#x02009;84%), time in movement restricting devices (~&#x02009;95%), and did not engage in daily outdoor play when at home at 2&#x000a0;years of age (~&#x02009;80%). These findings are similar to other interventions that have aimed to increase time spent in interactive play, specifically during infancy and young childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. One explanation for this may be the high percentage of infants (&#x0003e;&#x02009;80%), regardless of study group, that engaged in daily tummy time, leaving little potential for improvement. Rather we suggest a greater emphasis on limiting time spent in movement-restricting devices and increasing outdoor play in future interventions, given the high percentage of children (&#x02265;80%), regardless of study group, that did <italic>not</italic> engage in this behavior. Perhaps the convenience and effectiveness of movement-restricting devices for soothing infants contributes to their frequent use, while parent&#x02019;s time-constraints, work schedules, and seasonality may limit their ability to supervise young children&#x02019;s outdoor play. To inform future interventions, qualitative research should explore parent&#x02019;s perceived barriers for complying with the recommendations around restrictive devices and outdoor play during infancy/young childhood. Another possible explanation for the lack of study group differences for interactive play is that INSIGHT was not powered a priori to detect study group differences in these secondary outcomes.</p><p id="Par34">To our knowledge, there are no valid and reliable questionnaires to quantify infant screen time, interactive play, or interactive play/screen time parenting practices; therefore, INSIGHT used existing literature to develop and modify existing measures in order to quantify these behaviors during infancy. We acknowledge the limitation of possible response bias in these self-reported data. RP mothers may have reported socially desirable behaviors that appeared compliant with the guidance they were provided, thus resulting in an overestimation of study group differences in our findings. To minimize this influence, mothers in this study completed the questionnaires independently and not in the presence of research staff; however, the development of objective measures for parent-child engagement in interactive play could be developed to further minimize response bias and improve the accuracy of characterizing these behaviors. In addition, the development of valid and reliable self-report questionnaires, specific to this population age, is needed for when objective measures are not feasible.</p><p id="Par35">This INSIGHT trial did not collect information on the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Given the importance of economic evaluation for scalability and dissemination of interventions, future work with INSIGHT will include analyses on its cost-effectiveness. Further, the screen time recommendations provided to RP mothers were based on the 2012 AAP guidelines, which were current at the time of intervention delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In 2016 the AAP updated their screen time recommendations for young children to 1) discourage screen media, other than video-chatting, for children &#x0003c;&#x02009;18&#x000a0;months of age, 2) choose high-quality media viewed with parents for children 18&#x02013;24&#x000a0;months of age, and 3) limit high-quality media to 1&#x000a0;h per day for children 2&#x02013;5&#x000a0;years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. We explored compliance to the 2016 AAP guidelines in our sample at age 2 and 2.5&#x000a0;years. As expected, a&#x000a0;lower percentage of children would have met the 2016 guidelines of &#x02264;1&#x000a0;h per day (34.5% - 49.1% at age 2; 15.7% - 18.2% at age 2.5) than children who met the 2012 guidelines of &#x0003c;&#x02009;2&#x000a0;h per day (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). More broadly, fewer children are likely meeting the 2016 screen time guidelines, as opposed to children who met the 2012 guidelines. Future research is needed to quantify compliance to the 2016 AAP guidelines after delivery of these specific recommendations to parents. Children&#x02019;s use of different types of screen devices (e.g. video-chatting, high versus low-quality media) with and without parents present should also be quantified and compared to the 2016 AAP screen time guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par36">Previous research has revealed that RP can promote self-regulatory skills, socio-emotional, and cognitive development in children; findings from this study support the efficacy of INSIGHT RP strategies to reduce children&#x02019;s screen time and television exposure beginning in infancy. Few other interventions have aimed to reduce screen time in young children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]; INSIGHT is unique in that it began during infancy and continued through the first 2.5&#x000a0;years of life. The delivery of this anticipatory guidance on modifiable behaviors related to screen time and television exposure was effective during a critical period of infant&#x02019;s development; yet, continued, more intensive anticipatory guidance beyond the first few years of life that also targets parent screen use may be needed to see persistent effects into childhood.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec17"><p>
