After the placement of eye speculum before the surgery, povidone-iodine disinfectant (Shanghai Likang Disinfection Technology Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China) was used in the conjunctival sac, and about 20&#x0200a;mL of BSS was used to wash away povidone-iodine. During the washing process, the patient was required to keep rotating the eyeballs. Subsequently, the patients in the study group received 1 drop of HPMC 2% to cover the corneal surface. The HPMC 2% was used at 3 time points: just after povidone-iodine was washed away, before the implantation of intraocular lens, and before removal of eye speculum at the end of the surgery. The HPMC 2% was required to cover the corneal surface completely while using. However, the patients in the control group received only BSS to keep the corneal surface smooth and moist during the surgery. The intraoperative exposure time of the ocular surface (time interval between the placement and the removal of eye speculum) and the time of phacoemulsification were recorded.

Postoperative factors could exert adverse effects on the ocular surface function, including increased inflammatory mediators induced in response to inflammation, topical ophthalmic remedy containing preservatives, and so on.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup></p><p>In recent years, owing to lubricating and corneal-wetting properties, the OVDs were widely applied to the corneal surface during ophthalmologic surgeries to maintain corneal moisture, clarity, and transparency. Also, the application of ocular lubricants to keep the ocular surface moistened is also 1 of the most common therapies for treating dry eyes.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Their ability to remain on the cornea surface and their effectiveness in protecting corneal epithelial cells against desiccation could decrease the dry eye exposure induced by persistent opening of the ocular surface through the placement of eye speculum. It could also effectively avoid the frequent BSS flushing of the ocular surface. Some studies suggested that frequent BSS flushing of the ocular surface during cataract surgery could result in a decline in goblet cell density.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> The loss of goblet cells is a characteristic of dry eye, and it is also associated with decreased expression of mucoprotein MUC5AC.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup></p><sec><label>4.1</label><title>Dry eye influenced by sex</title><p>In this study, the results of subjective symptom questionnaire, ST-I, BUT, and corneal staining were compared between the 2 groups. No significant difference in the aforementioned indicators was found between the 2 groups. However, further analysis showed that the ST-I value in male patients in the study group was obviously higher than that in male patients in the control group (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.019). For the patients diagnosed with dry eye before the surgery, the ST-I value in the male patients in the study group was superior to that in the male patients in the control group at 1 month after the surgery (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.035). The result suggested that the use of HPMC 2% during the surgery for male patients with and without dry eye could exert some protective effect on the ocular surface. Huge differences in incidences, etiology, risk factors, and response to treatment and prognosis could be observed between the female and male populations. Therefore, in recent years, a large number of basic and applied researches have been conducted to further investigate the sex differences. Women were found to have distinctly higher incidence and degree of severity of dry eye,<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> and the reduction in estrogen is related to the occurrence of dry eye.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> Sex-based differences exist in the lacrimal glands and Moll glands in terms of anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology, and this kind of difference is also reflected in conjunctival goblet cells.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> The ocular surface tissues are 1 of the specific targets of sex hormones. It was confirmed that estrogen and androgen receptors existed in human conjunctiva, cornea, and Moll gland.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> Therefore, sex hormones could influence a large number of cells and tissues in the ocular surface, and the pathways involved had sex-based differences also.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> In this study, compared with the male patients in the control group, the male patients in the study group showed different results. However, no similar findings were observed in female patients. This might be related to the different roles of reproductive hormones in patients of different sexes.</p></sec><sec><label>4.2</label><title>Dry eye influenced by surgical time</title><p>In this study, the results of the patients whose surgical time was higher than median were further statistically analyzed; no significant difference was observed between the 2 groups. However, further stratified analysis found that, in the preoperatively diagnosed dry eye patients whose surgery time was longer than the median, the corneal staining in patients in the study group was superior to that in the patients in the control group (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.032). Corneal staining is very important in the diagnosis of dry eye. It can show damage of ocular surface epithelial cells induced by dry eye visually and quantitatively.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> During cataract surgery, the surgical procedure can cause inflammation and release of inflammatory mediators such as oxygen-free radicals, proteolytic enzymes, and cyclooxygenase <sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>in the ocular surface. Thus, the ocular surface is damaged, resulting in decreased density of goblet cells.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> Cataract surgery itself can aggravate dry eye. The patients diagnosed with dry eye before the surgery had abnormalities of ocular structure and function. Their eye symptoms and signs worsened postoperatively, and the relatively longer surgical time could exert a negative impact on the original presence of dry eye disease. The results of this study suggested that the use of HPMC 2% during cataract surgery could protect the vulnerable ocular surface of the patients with dry eye from the damage induced by surgical procedures.</p></sec><sec><label>4.3</label><title>Dry eye influenced by lens hardness and incision cite</title><p>The cornea is a highly innervated organ. The incision made by cataract surgery can result in nerve fracture, leading to neurogenic inflammation. The inflammatory mediators can change the role of corneal nerves and reduce corneal sensitivity.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> After the change in normal corneal innervation, the rate of blinks and tears are reduced, resulting in unstable tear films, and a change in tear osmotic pressure.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> However, for right eye surgery patients, the nerve fracture caused by temporal corneal incision not only influences the incision region, but also exerts an adverse effect on the corneal tissues remote from the incision region.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> But in our study, no significant difference was found in the 2 groups in the measurements of dry eye between left and right eyes.</p><p>For a patient whose lens nucleus is hard, the surgeon should use relatively higher phacoemulsification energy and longer phacoemulsification time to smash the lens nucleus, further increasing the damage to the corneal nerve tissues.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> The patients of the 2 groups were further stratified and statistically analyzed according to cataract nuclear hardness &#x02265;NC4. However, no significant beneficial influence of the HPMC 2% was observed.</p></sec><sec><label>4.4</label><title>Dry eye influenced by medicines</title><p>Over use or improper use of drugs, which contained preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride, could trigger the expression of inflammatory cell markers on the ocular surface. Thus, this could result in epithelial cell injury and apoptosis, and also reduce the density of goblet cells.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> Pisella et al observed 4107 patients with glaucoma. They found that compared with patients who used preservative-free eye drops, the patients who used eye drops containing preservatives were prone to have ocular surface changes, and the occurrence rate increased 2 or more than 2 times. Meanwhile, the symptoms and signs were dose-dependent.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> This could significantly decrease the stability of the tear film and the number of mucin-expressing cells, which could be the reason for postoperative dry eye and corneal toxicity. In our study, the patients used only 1 kind of antibiotic and corticosteroid compound preparation 4 times every day for 1 week, which remarkably reduced the ocular drug use frequency and duration, and thus, greatly decreased the potential ocular surface damage caused by medicines and the results interference by long-term use of multiple drugs. There was only 1 male patient aged 51 years. He had an ocular inflammatory response 1 week after the surgery. The clinical manifestation showed that visual acuity was 0.6, intraocular pressure was 18&#x0200a;mm Hg, and mixed conjunctival hyperemia could be observed. The patient also had signs of positive keratic precipitate and aqueous flare. Then, he was administered TobraDex 4 times every day, and diclofenac sodium (Shenyang Xing Qi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Shenyang, China) was also added 4 times every day. The patient was observed for 1 week. His visual acuity returned to 0.8, and intraocular pressure was reduced to16&#x0200a;mm Hg; also, the inflammatory response disappeared. This patient was not enrolled in this study. Also, other patients did not have any abnormal inflammatory response.</p><p>This study had certain limitations. First, the follow-up time of the present study was relatively short; it only lasted for 1 month after the surgery. Second, the patients of this study did not undergo examination of the morphology and function of the meibomian glands.</p><p>The results of this study indicated that the use of OVD on the surface of cornea during cataract surgery could reduce the ocular surface trauma induced by surgery and intraoperative BSS flushing, especially in the patients diagnosed with dry eyes before the surgery, male patients, and patients whose surgical time was relatively longer. To some extent, the use of OVD during cataract surgery could exert a protective effect on postoperative ocular surface function.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: BSS = balanced salt solution, BUT = tear break-up time, HPMC 2% = hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, OSDI = Ocular Surface Disease Index, OVD = ophthalmic viscosurgical devices, ST-I = Schirmer test.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Funding: This work was supported by Public Welfare Scientific Research Project, National Health and Family Planning Commission of The People's Republic of China (Grant no. 201302015).</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>Conflicts of interest: The authors have no financial or proprietary interest in a product, method, or material described herein.
