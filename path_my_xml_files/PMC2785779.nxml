The intraoperative administration of blood products, including packed red blood cells, platelets and fresh frozen plasma (FFP), is often live saving. Complications of blood transfusions contribute considerably to perioperative costs and blood product resources are limited. Consequently, strategies to optimize the decision to transfuse are needed.</p><p>Bleeding during surgery is a dynamic process and may result in major blood loss and coagulopathy due to dilution and consumption. The indication for transfusion should be based on reliable coagulation studies. While hemoglobin levels and platelet counts are available within 15 minutes, standard coagulation studies require one hour. Therefore, the decision to administer FFP has to be made in the absence of any data. Point of care testing of prothrombin time ensures that one major parameter of coagulation is available in the operation theatre within minutes. It is fast, easy to perform, inexpensive and may enable physicians to rationally determine the need for FFP.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The objective of the POC-OP trial is to determine the effectiveness of point of care prothrombin time testing to reduce the administration of FFP. It is a patient and assessor blind, single center randomized controlled parallel group trial in 220 patients aged between 18 and 90 years undergoing major surgery (any type, except cardiac surgery and liver transplantation) with an estimated blood loss during surgery exceeding 20% of the calculated total blood volume or a requirement of FFP according to the judgment of the physicians in charge. Patients are randomized to usual care plus point of care prothrombin time testing or usual care alone without point of care testing. The primary outcome is the relative risk to receive any FFP perioperatively. The inclusion of 110 patients per group will yield more than 80% power to detect a clinically relevant relative risk of 0.60 to receive FFP of the experimental as compared with the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Point of care prothrombin time testing in the operation theatre may reduce the administration of FFP considerably, which in turn may decrease costs and complications usually associated with the administration of blood products.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>NCT00656396</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>In patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery there is no established way of monitoring coagulation in real time. In case of intraoperative bleeding, decisions to transfuse fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and procoagulatory drugs have to be taken clinically. Bleeding is a frequent complication during major surgery and can necessitate the transfusion of blood products and/or procoagulatory drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Complications of blood transfusions contribute considerably to patient morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and perioperative costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery there is no established way of monitoring coagulation during surgery. In case of intraoperative bleeding, decisions to transfuse fresh frozen plasma and procoagulatory drugs are based on clinical judgment only. In view of the risk associated with administration of blood products, the unsatisfactory decision making process and the scarcity of blood products, strategies to optimize intraoperative decision making are much needed.</p><p>A patient's bleeding risk may be anticipated based on the patient's diagnosis or on the underlying surgical problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, the extent of bleeding is not predictable before surgery. Intraoperative bleeding is a dynamic process and major blood loss can occur within minutes with potentially life threatening consequences. Major bleeding can lead to coagulation aberration due to dilution and consumption of coagulation factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. While hemoglobin levels and platelet counts are readily available within 15 minutes, standard coagulation tests have long turn around times of 45 minutes to one hour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Moreover, analyses of specific coagulation factors take up to six hours and results may only be available the next day. These analyses are not performed with emergency priority, some are not even available during night. An intraoperative control of laboratory values is always considered as emergency analysis. Due to the inexistence of intraoperative real time results of standard coagulation studies, the decision to transfuse fresh frozen plasma and procoagulatory drugs during non-cardiac surgery is based on clinical judgment in practice, depending on the experience and/or the subjective decisions of the attending physicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Point-of-Care (PoC) devices are considerably faster than the standard laboratory methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Several point-of-care tests for standard coagulation parameters and two different systems for thromboelastography are currently marketed. None of the PoC tests, however, is approved for intraoperative real time measurement of coagulation. One potential intra-operative bedside coagulation study system is thromboelastography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. It is a viscoelastic test of whole blood clotting, which provides information about the initiation of coagulation, about clot firmness and clot lyses. It is costly and needs trained personnel with a workload of about 15 minutes to get first results. Its use is suggested for cardiac surgery and liver transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. During major surgery the use of thromboelastography is limited by costs, workload, the need for trained personnel, analysis time, and difficulties in interpreting results.</p><p>The use of a coagulation test based transfusion algorithm leads to a reduction in the use of blood products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. There is no validated, standardized method for measuring intraoperative blood loss. Blood loss during an operation is difficult to quantify [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and its underestimation might be frequent. Coagulopathic bleeding has to be distinguished from surgical bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Therefore coagulation parameters must be measured intraoperatively when major bleeding occurs and decisions for or against the transfusion of blood products and procoagulatory drugs have to be made [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The availability of coagulation tests is crucial for any algorithm used for decision making on intra-operative substitution of blood products.</p><p>PoC devices could be used in the intraoperative setting to guide the use of the costly blood bank resources and/or procoagulatory drugs. In this study we will use a transfusion algorithm based on the ASA Guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and point of care measurement of prothrombin time.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Objective</title><p>To determine the effectiveness of an intraoperative decision algorithm based on PoC testing of prothrombin time in reducing the administration of fresh frozen plasma.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The POC-OP trial is an ongoing, patient and assessor blind, parallel-group, single-center randomized controlled trial. Patients are randomized to (1) current clinical treatment and perioperative care plus point of care prothrombin time testing or (2) current clinical treatment and perioperative care without point of care testing. Trials evaluating a combination of test strategies and subsequent treatments require a pre-specified link between test results and management decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In the POC-OP trial, the treatment options and their relation with the different PoC test results are specified in the algorithm (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Algorithm for the transfusion of fresh frozen plasma</bold>.

Surgical management of platelet aggregation inhibitors changed in 2007 for patients with cardiac diseases and/or coronary artery stents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Therefore, we will consider all patients scheduled for operation, even if anticoagulants or anti-platelet drugs were administered.</p><p>Patients are not eligible if they have a history of hereditary coagulopathies; are pregnant; have abnormal coagulation studies before surgery (based on normal values for prothrombin time: 70 - 130% and platelets: 140 - 380 G/l); undergo liver transplantation; or patients receiving a bolus of heparin intraoperatively (extracorporal circulation 400 - 500 IU heparin per kg bodyweight, vascular surgery 100 IU before clamping the artery). Prothrombin time in patients under unfractionated heparin &#x0003e; 1 IU per ml blood can impair the accuracy of the result of our PoC device [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Liver transplantation might pose a more complex problem for coagulation than dilution or consumption coagulopathy only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. During liver transplantation, coagulation should be monitored by rotation thrombelastometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. PoC prothrombin time monitoring might be helpful but not sufficient for complex coagulation aberrations. Anesthetic management (general-, regional or a combined anesthesia) is defined by the attending anesthesiologist. Prothrombin time is not influenced by anesthetic gases, propofol, opiates, muscle relaxants and local anesthetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Propofol, desflurane, sevoflurane or isoflurane are used for general anesthesia in our Department. Regional Anesthesia is only performed in patients with normal preoperative coagulation studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Allocation of patients</title><p>Informed consent of eligible patients is obtained on the day before surgery.

Prothrombin time is measured according to the randomization and transfusion of fresh frozen plasma based on available results of the prothrombin time test and clinical judgment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). For both groups, platelet counts are done in the central hematology laboratory of the University Hospital Bern and thrombocytopenia is treated according to the algorithm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Hemoglobin is measured PoC in the operating room by Hemocue (B-Hemoglobinphotometer Hemocue<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>AB, &#x000c4;ngelholm, Sweden) and/or in the central hematology laboratory. In case of anemia, erythrocytes are transfused according to the standard operating procedure of the Department of Anesthesiology based on ASA guidelines (1). Platelet counts and hemoglobin levels as measured by the central hematology laboratory are usually available within 15 minutes. The central hematology laboratory has an ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Postoperative care is the same for both groups.

However, in the absence of the PoC device, prothrombin time is measured in the central hematology laboratory by BCS coagulation systems (BCS, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, USA). Considering a turn around time which usually exceeds 40 minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], the results of intra-operative prothrombin time measurements in the control group are usually not available for decision-making.

Therefore, the indication for the administration of allogenic blood products has to be weighed up against the risks for the patient. Also, blood products are a scarce resource necessitating their efficient use. Until today there is no satisfying option to monitor the dynamic process of intraoperative bleeding without considerable delay and high costs.</p><p>The study project is designed to evaluate a simple method, which ensures that results of coagulation studies become available to the anesthesiologist in charge without delay. To reflect modern concepts of decision making, we created a transfusion algorithm, which follows ASA guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. PoC testing in the operation theatre in combination with this algorithm may reduce the administration of fresh frozen plasma considerably, which in turn may decrease costs and complications usually associated with the administration of allogenic blood products.</p></sec><sec><title>List of Abbreviations</title><p>POC-OP: Point Of Care in the Operating Room; FFP: Fresh Frozen Plasma; PoC: Point-of-Care; ASA: American Society of Anesthesiologists; Tc: Thrombocytes; PT: Prothrombin Time; PACU: Post Anesthesia Care Unit; ICU: Intensive Care Unit; aPTT: activated Partial Thromboplastine Time; TT: Thrombin Time; NSAID: Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drug.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>We receive the PoC devices, test stripes, quality controls and the training for the study personnel from Roche Diagnostics without costs.
