Psychological difficulties and inadequate self-management can amplify this picture.</p></sec><sec><title>Aims:</title><p>To compare a cognitive-behavioural manual versus information booklets (IB) on health service use, mood and health status.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Two hundred and twenty-two COPD patients were randomly allocated to receive either the COPD breathlessness manual (CM) or IB. They were instructed to work through their programme at home, over 5 weeks.

The odds of people in the IB group attending A&#x00026;E 12 months post-intervention was 1.9 times higher than for the CM group (CI 1.05&#x02013;3.53). Reduction in hospital admissions and bed days were greatest in the CM group. At 6 months, there were significantly greater improvements in anxiety (F (2,198)=5.612, <italic>P</italic>=0.004), depression (F (1.8,176.1)=10.697, <italic>P</italic>&#x02a7d;0.001) and dyspnoea (F (2,198)=18.170, <italic>P</italic>&#x02a7d;0.001) in the CM group.

It is a costly condition to the UK National Health Service (NHS). Mental health problems are estimated to exist in 30% of all people with a long-term condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> This figure is higher in COPD (34&#x02013;60%) for problems such as anxiety, panic and depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2 bib3 bib4 bib5">2&#x02013;5</xref></sup> and prevalence of panic disorder is up to 10 times higher in COPD compared with the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> Psychological comorbidity is associated with persistent smoking, greater Accident and Emergency (A&#x00026;E) visits, hospital admissions and readmissions, longer stays and increased NHS spending.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7 bib8 bib9 bib10 bib11 bib12">7&#x02013;12</xref></sup> Furthermore, individuals suffer worse quality of life, functioning and disease outcomes, which is unrelated to level of disease severity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13 bib14 bib15">13&#x02013;15</xref></sup></p><p>Breathlessness can be distressing and difficult to understand and control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> It is a defining feature of both COPD and panic attacks and can develop through a complex interaction between physical, psychological, emotional and behavioural factors. The cognitive-behavioural model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> explains panic via a vicious cycle of catastrophic appraisals of breathlessness, escalating fear and heightened sympathetic arousal. This pattern may be emphasised further through the reactions of observers, who may feel equally frightened and helpless. The culmination can often be an overreliance on medications, over-monitoring of symptoms and inappropriate presentation at emergency services. Individuals may start to mistakenly avoid activities due to fearful beliefs about the consequences of becoming breathless,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> leading to isolation, depression, continued smoking and a lack of motivation and energy for self-management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> This could have a knock-on effect on participation in pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), despite the demonstrated benefits of these programmes on dyspnoea, fatigue and control over the disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> Patients often value group support; however, in reality, encouraging attendance and adherence to PR/breathlessness groups can be an issue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup></p><p>There is promising evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) in addressing mental health difficulties in COPD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21 bib22 bib23 bib24 bib25 bib26">21&#x02013;26</xref></sup> over and above pharmacotherapy in the short term.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> It is also important to integrate a mental health model with a framework of adjusting to a physical health condition. Applying the self-regulatory model,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> which identifies people&#x02019;s idiosyncratic beliefs about their COPD, the emotional impact and their coping strategies, can help formulate and address a clients&#x02019; difficulties within this physical health context. For example, in a previous study, panic symptoms were most prevalent in participants with low perceived control over symptoms and the disease, negative beliefs about the life-limiting consequences of unpredictable breathlessness attacks and by those using emotional coping strategies such as denial and avoidance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup></p><p>The COPD breathlessness manual (CM) was developed as a guided self-help intervention that individuals complete in their own time at home, with support from a facilitator. It applies CBT techniques within a self-management framework and specifically targets the cognitive-behavioural aspects of breathlessness and panic, which, it has been indicated, may facilitate greater improvements in health outcomes than PR alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> A previous group cognitive-behavioural intervention targeting breathlessness and panic demonstrated a reduction in A&#x00026;E and hospital admissions as well as improved mood and health status in end-stage COPD patients, resulting in NHS savings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> The CM was adapted from this intervention. This randomised trial compares the effectiveness of the CM versus British Lung Foundation information booklets (IB) on health service use, mood and health status.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This was a prospective, randomised, single-blind, parallel-group trial comparing the CM with British Lung Foundation IB.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>COPD patients (<italic>n</italic>=1,217) were identified through 10 GP practices in North West London and invited by letter to participate in the trial. Inclusion criteria were: a diagnosis of COPD, verified by being on the COPD disease register at the GP practice (based on the NICE 2010 COPD guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup>&#x02014;i.e. a forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV<sub>1</sub>)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of less than 0.7, or if FEV<sub>1</sub> is equal to or above 80% predicted normal with other respiratory symptoms being present such as breathlessness or cough); a self-rating breathlessness score on the Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnoea scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> of 3 or more; willingness to participate; ability to provide informed consent; and ability to read and write in English or with assistance. Exclusion criteria were: known psychosis and personality disorders; receiving psychological therapy; participating in PR, or having had PR within the previous six months; cognitive impairment; dementia; and verbal and/or written communication problems.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation</title><p>Simple blocked random sampling was undertaken. Computerised random blocks of six at a time were randomised, three in each group. Participants were blind to group allocation. Primary and secondary care staff were aware of patients&#x02019; participation in the trial, but were unaware of group allocation and the trial was separate to any clinical care provided. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for trial profile.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>Patients who had opted-in were telephoned to discuss the trial, check whether they met the criteria and arrange a home visit. Both groups received a 90-min home visit involving obtaining signed informed consent, baseline measures, a semi-structured interview and introducing the intervention. Participants were encouraged to follow their programme for approximately 1&#x02009;h per day (broken up throughout the day) over a 5-week period. For example, for the CM, this could include reading a section, writing in a question response, practising a physical exercise (e.g., walking on the spot) and listening to a track from the relaxation CD. For the IB, this involved predominantly reading, but any practical techniques in the booklets (e.g., breathing control) were reinforced. Partners/carers were encouraged to be involved. Participants received two 30-min telephone call booster sessions at weeks 3 and 6.</p></sec><sec><title>The CM</title><p>The CM was developed by a health psychologist, with multidisciplinary team input and piloted with small focus groups of COPD patients over 6 months. The final version consisted of a 5-week intervention, with each week divided into six sections. For example, week 1: &#x02018;Understanding COPD and the experience of breathlessness&#x02019; was divided into the following six sections:</p><p>Section 1: What is COPD all about?</p><p>Section 2: Focus on breathlessness&#x02014;part 1</p><p>Section 3: How to control breathlessness and panic</p><p>Section 4: Daily exercises</p><p>Section 5: Relaxation CD: Introduction and exercise 1: Breathing control</p><p>Section 6: Summary and weekly record</p><p>The main theme was breaking the cognitive-behavioural maintenance cycle of breathlessness, panic, frustration and depression, with a specific focus on ways to manage distress (for both patients and carers) to ultimately prevent inappropriate A&#x00026;E attendance and hospital admissions. Education on distinguishing between a COPD exacerbation and a panic attack was provided alongside self-management guidance. Shifting unhelpful illness cognitions and encouraging adaptive behaviours using pacing and goal-setting was a central strategy. Breathing control and mobility exercises were demonstrated and trialled and participants were encouraged to practise these daily. Participants were asked to complete self-help tasks as well as a weekly mood and breathlessness rating. The manual was accompanied by a relaxation CD.</p></sec><sec><title>IB</title><p>Participants received a series of British Lung Foundation COPD booklets and were encouraged to work through them over 5 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Facilitator input</title><p>The facilitators (psychologists) were trained in applying CBT techniques within a physical health context to formulate common cognitive-behavioural maintenance patterns as well as utilising motivational interviewing to facilitate behaviour change. A one-day training workshop consisted of understanding the physical and psychological issues in COPD, the challenges of self-management in COPD, the theory and application of the CBT model for breathlessness, panic and prevention of A&#x00026;E attendance as well as managing frustration and low mood. In addition, practical role plays were conducted for enhancing skills in assessing patients&#x02019; current psychological status, explaining the interaction between emotions and COPD symptoms, motivation (and barriers) to participation, as well as demonstration of exercises and breathing techniques.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary outcome: health service use</title><p>Frequency of A&#x00026;E attendance and frequency and duration of COPD-related hospital admissions 12 months pre- and post-intervention were recorded from a district general hospital&#x02019;s electronic records. Health-care resource group tariffs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> were calculated for each activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>Mood and health status were measured at baseline, 6 weeks and 6 months using the following questionnaires:</p><p>&#x02013; The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> a validated, widely used measure to screen for anxiety and depression in medical settings.

Most useful aspects were discussions on the phone, managing breathlessness and panic, distinguishing anxiety and a flare up, pacing, breathing and relaxation. Improvements included increasing the programme length as well as combining it with group sessions to increase motivation and social contact.</p><p>Thirty-seven percent reported that the information booklets were useful and 28% reported an improvement in their quality of life. Participants appreciated the facilitator input, although as a programme, they generally wanted more practical elements in addition to reading information.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Main findings</title><p>The COPD breathlessness manual (CM) resulted in greater improvements in health-care use, mood and health status, with greater NHS savings, compared to IB. It appears that the latter plus facilitator input is beneficial up to a point, but does not result in long term sustained changes compared to the CBT component underpinning the CM. This is in keeping with previous evidence that providing information is important, but in itself does not lead to significant behaviour change.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup></p><p>Participants in the IB group were almost twice as likely to attend A&#x00026;E in the 12 months post intervention, compared to participants in the CM group. At 12 months, A&#x00026;E visits in the IB group had increased by 16%. Furthermore, the majority of IB participants were discharged from A&#x00026;E in the 12-month follow-up period, indicating potentially avoidable visits, perhaps due to almost a quarter remaining clinically anxious and reporting greater dyspnoea. In comparison, A&#x00026;E visits in the CM group had fallen by 42% along with a greater reduction in anxiety and depression.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation of findings in relation to previously published work</title><p>The results of this study replicate the findings from a previous breathlessness group CBT intervention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> and highlight the comparable benefits of delivering CBT in both group and home-based settings. The CM was a targeted intervention and not part of a wider PR or other exercise/education programme. The findings correspond to a recent meta-analysis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> which showed a small effect of CBT for anxiety and highlighted the need for adequately powered RCT&#x02019;s disentangling the contributions of exercise training, education and CBT.</p><p>This study highlights that providing no CBT intervention leaves potential for psychological problems to escalate and can lead to inappropriate health-care use and increasing NHS costs. It raises the importance of intervening early in COPD with brief targeted CBT interventions, to prevent the development and worsening of anxiety, panic attacks and panic disorder and associated hospital admissions, which has equally been emphasised in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup></p><p>The delivery of the CM intervention, i.e., brief with minimal telephone-based support appears feasible and relates to a similar study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> which found that six weekly sessions and three telephone booster sessions of CBT improved anxiety, depression, mastery and fatigue in COPD. Furthermore, a recent RCT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> provided evidence that a self-managed programme in primary care offering minimal telephone support can lead to health benefits similar to PR.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title><p>The CM is the first known &#x02018;manualised&#x02019; psychological intervention, targeting breathlessness, panic and prevention of hospital use in COPD. This programme demonstrated clinical and cost-effectiveness, was acceptable to participants, and has the potential to be used in both primary and secondary care.</p><p>A number of study limitations should be noted. The response rate to the mailed letters for recruitment was low (25%), making it a small study. A larger study would have enhanced the representativeness and generalisability of the sample to a wider COPD population. Hospital data were collected from a single hospital database, and hence did not account for attendance at hospitals elsewhere. Self-report measures were not collected beyond 6 months, and the moderate follow-up rates may have biased results. Anxious and depressed individuals were not selected <italic>per se;</italic> rather, COPD was considered to be an innately psychologically challenging condition and research has shown that psychological issues can often go unrecognised and remain untreated in COPD patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> It should be noted that a small proportion of participants were taking medication for depression and anxiety, which may have confounded the results, although these percentages were comparable in both groups (16 and 12% reported taking antidepressants from the CM and IB group, respectively; for anxiolytics, this was 4 and 5%).</p><p>It is appreciated that motivation and commitment are a prerequisite for patients engaging in guided self-help interventions; likewise, facilitator skills make a huge difference. Both groups received equal facilitator guidance, which in itself may have positively influenced results. The facilitators in the study were psychologists; however, this is not an integral requirement, and a facilitator training workshop has been developed and delivered. This is in keeping with the current emphasis on providing CBT skills training for respiratory nurses and community matrons to help address psychological issues in COPD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> It is recognised that levels of participation in the CM programme would have varied. Fidelity to completing the intervention was discussed during follow-ups, although was not recorded objectively and level of adherence rate would have enhanced the study rigour. Furthermore, it is not possible to state which particular aspect of the CM was most effective, which is necessary for future research.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications for future research, policy and practice</title><p>The CM is cost-effective and easy to deliver in different settings. It could be particularly beneficial for anxious/depressed individuals, frequent GP or A&#x00026;E attenders, post exacerbation or as an &#x02018;add-on&#x02019; to PR to increase adherence. It could also be implemented within a respiratory service or an Improving Access to Psychological Therapies service in accordance with government policy on addressing mental health in long-term conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> Future research intends to explore the delivery of the CM in different formats such as Telemedicine as well as interventions for carers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Results show that the CM provided psychological benefit, improved self-management and reduced costs to the NHS in an unselected group. It is emphasised that it should be considered as an option for the majority of COPD patients as a preventative measure, to help them cope better.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>Thanks to Mr Paul
