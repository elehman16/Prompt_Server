Because of slow recruitment rates, it became apparent that it would not be possible to recruit this sample size within the funded time period. The study design was therefore changed to one with a single primary end point of LV mass requiring 150 patients. Recruitment was completed on 31 December 2016, at which time 154 patients had been recruited. Investigations included cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, applanation tonometry, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and laboratory tests. Subjects are assessed before and after 40&#x000a0;weeks of randomly allocated drug therapy and at 46&#x000a0;weeks after discontinuation of the study drug.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><title>Background</title><p>Levels of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity are high in chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a graded inverse relationship with glomerular filtration rate.<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1.</xref>, <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2.</xref> This has a large public health impact because of the high prevalence of early-stage CKD which affects about 1 in 7 people in the United States.<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Although patients with CKD have a clustering of atherosclerotic risk factors, the majority of deaths are due to heart failure and arrhythmia.<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> This suggests that the underlying mechanism for heart disease in patients with CKD is not coronary atherosclerosis but myocardial disease, so-called uremic cardiomyopathy. In the early stages of CKD, sensitive markers of systolic (strain) and diastolic function are often abnormal, and there is an increased prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5.</xref>, <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6.</xref> Causative factors are thought to include increased arterial stiffness, hypertension, sympathetic neural influences, and circulating factors including mediators of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. These factors are already present in stage 2 to 3 CKD and provide potential targets for treatment aimed at preventing the development and progression of myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis.<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref></p><p>Aldosterone is as a key mediator of cardiovascular disease in many conditions including heart failure and CKD. This hormone causes vascular and myocardial injury and fibrosis, particularly in the presence of sodium excess as occurs in CKD.<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Mineralocorticoid receptor blocker (MRB) drugs ameliorate these actions in cellular and animal models and improve clinical outcomes in people with heart failure.<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Like heart failure, CKD is characterized by sodium overload and high aldosterone concentrations due to aldosterone escape (unsuppressed levels of aldosterone despite chronic sodium overload) and aldosterone breakthrough (high circulating aldosterone levels despite suppression with angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB] drugs).<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> In the CRIB-2 trial of 112 patients with stages 2 and 3 CKD, we showed that, compared with placebo, spironolactone reduced LV mass, arterial stiffness, and collagen turnover and improved myocardial diastolic function.<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9.</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10.</xref> As blood pressure was also reduced by spironolactone with a mean fall in systolic pressure of 11&#x000a0;mm Hg, it is possible that the effects of spironolactone on cardiovascular structure and function were nonspecific and mediated by blood pressure lowering alone. To address whether the benefits of spironolactone in CRIB-2 were specific to mineralocorticoid blockade or as a result of a reduction in blood pressure, we designed the Spironolactone in Chronic Kidney Disease (SPIRO-CKD) trial to include an active control drug to lower blood pressure to similar levels. Chlorthalidone was chosen as the control drug because of its proven antihypertensive action in patients with early-stage CKD with an effect size in the ALLHAT substudy in this patient group about equal to that of spironolactone in CRIB-2.<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> The SPIRO-CKD trial was initially designed to investigate the hypothesis that spironolactone is superior to chlorthalidone in the reduction of a co-primary end point consisting of LV mass and arterial stiffness. Recruitment was slower than anticipated because of smaller numbers of patients with early-stage CKD being reviewed routinely in a number of participating centers. Following discussions with the British Heart Foundation (funding body) and the Trial Steering Committee, it was decided that it would not be possible to recruit a sample size sufficient to provide adequate statistical power to detect a change in arterial stiffness. The study design has therefore changed to one with a single primary end point of LV mass.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><title>Study design</title><p>This multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end point (PROBE) clinical trial was initially designed to compare the effects of 40&#x000a0;weeks of treatment with spironolactone 25&#x000a0;mg once daily to chlorthalidone 25&#x000a0;mg once daily on the co-primary end point of change in LV mass using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) in patients with stages 2 and 3 CKD, without known cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus and on established treatment with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB with controlled blood pressure on study entry.

For patients not on ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy, after obtaining consent, an ACE inhibitor or ARB of the physician's choice is introduced and titrated to a well-tolerated therapeutic dose over a 4-week period.

A secure central randomization service was provided by the Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit (University of Birmingham) using a computer-generated program, using a minimization algorithm to ensure balance between the arms with regard to the important clinical variables of blood pressure, age, and gender.

All baseline investigations have now been completed, and patients are being followed as per the study schedule. The trial consists of a 40-week period of randomized treatment followed by a 6-week period designed to detect effects caused by prolonged treatment rather than direct pharmacological effects. At the baseline visit, informed consent is taken, and weight and heart rate are recorded. Office blood pressure is measured using a British Hypertension Society&#x02013;validated semiautomated device on 3 occasions in the seated position after 5&#x000a0;minutes of rest with research staff present during the measurement; the mean of the last 2 readings is used for analysis. Participants undergo 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring at baseline using a British Hypertension Society&#x02013;validated oscillometric recorder set to make measurements every 30&#x000a0;minutes between 8:00<sc>am</sc> and 10:00<sc>pm</sc> and hourly during the remaining hours. In addition, all patients undergo blood and urine tests, a cardiac MRI scan, and PWV and pulse wave analysis testing, after which the trial medication is given to the patient. More detail on the study investigations is given below. The measurement and analysis of end points are performed by observers blinded to treatment allocation.<fig id="f0005"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Trial procedure flowchart.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0005">Figure 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p><p>Participants are followed up at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 40, and 46 postrandomization.

Published randomized trials of treatments to reduce cardiovascular risk in subjects with early-stage CKD are few. In the SHARP trial, statins reduced atherosclerotic events but had a disappointing impact on total cardiovascular mortality, suggesting that much cardiovascular disease in CKD is not atherosclerotic.<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> This result is in line with epidemiological data suggesting that, in CKD, sudden death, heart failure, and stroke are much more common than myocardial infarction.<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Although ACE inhibitors are commonly used in subjects with CKD and may have risk-reducing effects similar to those seen in the general population, physicians have tended to avoid MRB drugs because of concerns about hyperkalemia.</p><p>In a previous study, we showed that LV mass and arterial stiffness were improved with spironolactone with few hyperkalemic problems in subjects with stages 2 and 3 CKD under close monitoring. This trial will further examine the use of spironolactone in a similar cohort and will specifically test the hypothesis that the effects of spironolactone on LV mass demonstrated in the CRIB-2 study were due to specific MRB-mediated effects and not to nonspecific blood pressure&#x02013;lowering effects. This hypothesis has biological plausibility in view of the known cardiovascular inflammatory, fibrotic, and hypertrophic actions of aldosterone and the antagonistic effects of MRB drugs on these processes.<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Furthermore, in the 4E study of subjects with LVH, the addition of eplerenone to enalapril caused significant reduction in LV mass with little effect on blood pressure.<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Cardiac MRI is the method of choice for determining changes in LV mass in response to treatment because of its high interstudy reproducibility, lack of dependence on geometric assumptions, and independence of changes in volume.<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">32.</xref>, <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">33.</xref> Spironolactone may be a powerful treatment to reverse or delay the onset of LVH and myocardial fibrosis in patients with CKD. As both hypertrophy and fibrosis are likely key intermediate phenotypic changes that result in an increased risk of heart failure and arrhythmia in many patient groups, the data will be of great value in establishing a mode of action of these drugs that may be relevant to subjects with CKD and other at-risk groups.<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> The range of secondary end points including arterial stiffness, aortic distensibility, LV fibrosis, systolic and diastolic function, kidney function, and biomarkers may also provide powerful evidence of differences in the effects of MRB and diuretic drugs.</p><p>The effect of thiazide-like drugs on LV mass in early-stage CKD has not previously been examined, although they are effective in lowering blood pressure in this group. The study will also provide evidence on the safety of both spironolactone and chlorthalidone in subjects with early-stage CKD, giving valuable data on the effects of both drugs on kidney function measured by eGFR and on changes in serum potassium and sodium concentrations. If safety and efficacy are confirmed, the rationale would be provided for a larger clinical trial designed to examine the effects of MRB drugs on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality end points. It is acknowledged that the nonblinded study design increases the risk of bias, but the PROBE design maintains the benefits associated with a strict randomization procedure, whereas the blinded end points help to eliminate bias. In a meta-analysis of trials of an ARB, changes in mean 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure in double-blind and PROBE trials were not significantly different.<xref rid="bb0175"
