To preserve sinus rhythm, ablation is undertaken in symptomatic patients. Observational studies show that patients with atrial fibrillation often report a low quality of life and are less prone to be physically active due to fear of triggering fibrillation. Small trials indicate that exercise training has a positive effect on exercise capacity and mental health, and both patients with recurrent atrial fibrillation and in sinus rhythm may benefit from rehabilitation in managing life after ablation. No randomised trials have been published on cardiac rehabilitation for atrial fibrillation patients treated with ablation that includes exercise and psychoeducational components.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim</title><p>To test the effects of an integrated cardiac rehabilitation programme versus treatment as usual for patients with atrial fibrillation treated with ablation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis design</title><p>The trial is a multicentre parallel arm design with 1:1 randomisation to the intervention and control group with blinded outcome assessment. 210 patients treated for atrial fibrillation with radiofrequency ablation will be included. The intervention consists of a rehabilitation programme including four psychoeducative consultations with a specially trained nurse and 12&#x02005;weeks of individualised exercise training, plus the standard medical follow-up. Patients in the control group will receive the standard medical follow-up. The primary outcome measure is exercise capacity measured by the VO<sub>2</sub> peak. The secondary outcome measure is self-rated mental health measured by the Short Form 36 questionnaire. Postintervention, qualitative interviews will be conducted in 10% of the intervention group.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The protocol is approved by the regional research ethics committee (number H-1-2011-135), the Danish Data Protection Agency (reg. nr. 2007-58-0015) and follows the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> After 40&#x02005;years of age, the lifetime risk of developing AF is 25%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> The annual cost of AF is high in comparison with other diseases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> Therefore, AF has become an economic burden that will continue to increase over the coming decades.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> Thus, AF has now become a health, social and economic challenge in the Western world.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></p><p>Primary treatment goals for individuals with AF are re-establishing and maintaining sinus rhythm, decreasing AF symptoms and preventing complications. In accordance with current national and international guidelines, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is often undertaken in symptomatic patients. RFA is an invasive treatment, intended to cure AF, and has a success rate of 77% versus 52% for antiarrhythmic medication.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> In Denmark, around 600 RFAs are conducted annually at two heart centres.</p><p>A cohort study of 655 patients from a randomised trial found that AF symptoms are a negative predictor for patients&#x02019; physical capacity,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> and in the presence of AF, patients do fewer physical activities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> Smaller observational studies and a randomised trial investigating the effect of exercise training on AF patients found increased exercise capacity and a decreased resting heart rate after training.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18 R19 R20">18&#x02013;20</xref></p><p>Previous studies show a significantly impaired quality of life in patients with AF compared with healthy controls measured by the questionnaire Short Form 36 (SF-36). The general health component (&#x000b1;SD) was 54&#x000b1;21 in AF patients compared with 78&#x000b1;17 in healthy controls.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> A qualitative study demonstrated that educational help after AF treatment is lacking, even though symptoms of distress and lack of self-management regarding symptoms like palpitations, dyspnoea and fatigue are common.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> Furthermore, small observational studies indicate a positive effect of exercise training on patients with AF in terms of mental health and physical activity (15% increase of VO<sub>2</sub>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> However, these findings need confirmation in larger randomised clinical trials.</p><p>Secondary prevention initiatives including cardiac rehabilitation are recommended by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> Studies exploring the effects of rehabilitation for patients treated for AF are lacking. As there is no evidence of its efficacy, rehabilitation is not systematically provided in Denmark and most often patients treated for AF with RFA are not offered any rehabilitation at all. The evidence for general cardiac rehabilitation is strong, but it is found that it is poorly implemented and only selected patient groups are offered full comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation programmes, even though ESC recommends such programmes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> Research has mainly been conducted within patients with coronary heart disease and heart failure, where rehabilitation has been proven to reduce hospital readmissions and mortality in a cost-effective way,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> as well as to improve the quality of life.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> More specifically, studies on the effect of exercise training have demonstrated an increase in exercise capacity of up to 38% in patients after valve replacement surgery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> and an increase in peak VO<sub>2</sub> of 2.3&#x000b1;2.2 (SD) ml/kg/min in the intervention group compared with &#x02212;0.3&#x000b1;2.1 (SD) ml/kg/min in the control group, as well as a significant change in the quality of life in older patients with heart failure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></p><p>Traditional cardiac rehabilitation has focused on physical training and standardised programmes, but studies now indicate that individualised content and supervised exercise components can improve outcomes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> In addition to exercise training, there is evidence to support interventions that include patient education, which in patients with coronary heart disease has shown to improve health-related quality of life and decrease healthcare costs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> and psychological support, which has been shown to improve psychological symptoms, such as depression and anxiety.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> Interventions designed to cover both physical and psychological problems may provide the best method for optimising functioning and enhancing the quality of life.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> We have not been able to identify randomised trials or observational studies in patients who have undergone RFA for AF that offer both psychoeducational intervention and physical training. Therefore, the CopenHeart<sub>RFA</sub> trial was undertaken with the aim of testing a rehabilitation programme consisting of physical exercise and a psychoeducational intervention versus treatment as usual for RFA-treated AF patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design</title><p>Major parts of the method section and trial design in this paper are similar to two other randomised clinical trials, CopenHeart<sub>VR</sub> and CopenHeart<sub>IE</sub>, and therefore sections from this paper will be copied in these trial protocols (Sibilitz KL <italic>et al Effect of integrated cardiac rehabilitation</italic> vs <italic>treatment as usual for patients with isolated heart valve surgery: the randomised CopenHeart valvular trial protocol</italic> drafted October 2012 and Rasmussen <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>).</p><p>The CopenHeart<sub>RFA</sub> trial is a multicentre, multidisciplinary randomised clinical superiority trial. Secondary qualitative data are also collected and the two methods are integrated by applying a mixed-method-embedded experimental design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012002377F1">figure 1</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref> Quantitative methods are applied, with specified quantitative premeasures and postmeasures, to evaluate the effect of the experimental intervention. Alongside quantitative measurements, qualitative data will be collected. The premise of mixed methods research is that the use of qualitative and quantitative approaches in combination provides a better understanding of the research problems than either approach alone, because different types of questions require different types of data and mixed methods research provides strengths that offset the weaknesses of both qualitative and quantitative research.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> The methods are integrated by applying a mixed-method-embedded experimental design and include qualitative data to develop the intervention and to examine the process of the intervention and the results of the trial (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012002377F1">figure 1</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref> The rationale for this approach is that the quantitative findings provide a general understanding of the research problem through statistical results, whereas the qualitative findings refine and explain the results by exploring participants&#x02019; views in greater detail and will be presented by themes of patient thoughts or concerns about the intervention. Evaluation using qualitative research methods is increasingly promoted in evidence-based rehabilitation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37 R38 R39 R40">37&#x02013;40</xref> Qualitative research alongside randomised controlled trials can contribute in several ways to the development and evaluation of complex healthcare interventions and may be particularly useful in evaluating interventions that involve social and behavioural processes that are difficult to explore or capture using quantitative methods alone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref> As patient participation is paramount for the efficacy of the rehabilitation,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref> we find it highly valuable to include the patients&#x02019; perspective in the development and evaluation of the intervention.

The estimate of 20% is based on findings from pilot studies including patients with permanent AF which found an increase of 15% in the VO<sub>2</sub> peak. We therefore expect a VO<sub>2</sub> peak in the intervention group of 18 and of 15&#x02005;ml/kg/min in the control group, corresponding to a difference of 20% (3&#x02005;ml/kg/min).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></p><p>The secondary hypothesis is that the rehabilitation programme increases the quality of life and self-rated mental health among AF patients treated with RFA after 6&#x02005;months by three points on the Medical Outcome Study SF-36 questionnaire mental component scale, compared with control participants receiving standard treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></p><p>Exploratory hypotheses are that the experimental intervention decreases AF recurrence; improves self-rated health and sleep-quality; reduces early retirement from work, use of healthcare services and mortality, and is cost efficient.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Trial participants</title><p>Consecutive patients hospitalised for AF and treated with RFA at two heart centres in Denmark (Gentofte Hospital and Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital) will be screened for inclusion and approached for trial participation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012002377F2">figure 2</xref>).

Participants are randomised 1:1 to the experimental intervention group or the control group and stratified according to sex and type of AF (persistent or paroxysmal). Thus, neither the investigators nor the patients or relatives can influence the group to which the patients are allocated. For both groups, the follow-up assessment will take place at 1, 4, 6 and 12&#x02005;months postdischarge, and a register-based follow-up assessment will be conducted at 24&#x02005;months (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012002377TB1">table 1</xref>). In case of complications to the RFA after enrolment in the trial, the patients will be handled individually (eg, arrhythmia or inguinal haematoma).</p><p>The patients answer questionnaires independently of the researchers, and before randomisation.

Here, we observed a significant impact of the intervention on peak VO<sub>2</sub>, physical capacity and self-assessed mental health. The intervention has been modified for patients treated for AF with ablation as described below. The CopenHeart physical exercise intervention meets European<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> and Danish guidelines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref> for physical exercise in patients with heart disease, and complies with The National Danish Board of Health recommendations for physical exercise in daily living for heart patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></p><p>The physical exercise starts 1&#x02005;month after ablation and after the first ergospirometry test and comprises the following three elements:</p><sec id="s2e1a"><title>Individually planned physical exercise by specially trained physiotherapists</title><p>Integrating detailed information concerning the AF symptoms and RFA, comorbidity, hospitalisation, activities of daily living and level of physical activity prior to RFA, a specially trained physiotherapist conducts a patient telephone consultation up to 30&#x02005;min. The consultation is based on initial testing of the patient including a cardiopulmonary exercise test, a 6-min walking test and a &#x02018;sit to stand&#x02019; test, described in the outcome section. For all patients, a rehabilitation plan is prepared as an individual training diary, and all patients are instructed in the use of a heart rate monitor (Polar Watch provided by Rigshospitalet). The heart rate monitor and diary are essential to ensure CopenHeart training protocol compliance, and they are returned for data collection at the end of the exercise training intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s2e1b"><title>Intensive exercise training programme</title><p>Physical exercise is initiated at Rigshospitalet 4&#x02005;weeks after RFA to ensure optimal rest and healing. Using wireless electrodes integrated into T-shirts (Corus-Fit, CardioCardio and Corus Exercise Assistant, CEA, V.2.0.16, Finland), potential cardiac arrhythmias, ECG abnormalities such as ST depression, ST elevation, Q wave or T wave altering, AF and ventricular arrhythmias and training intensity level are monitored.</p><p>After 1&#x02013;3 exercise training sessions at Rigshospitalet, the patient continues the programme at a local CopenHeart certified training facility supervised by physiotherapists or as supervised home-based training. Supervised home-based exercise training has shown similar results to hospital-based exercise training<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> and has been confirmed in a Danish setting.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></p><p>The physical exercise training continues for 12&#x02005;weeks, comprising three weekly sessions of 60&#x02005;min each, in total, 36 sessions. The training protocol consists of cardiovascular training and strength exercises to improve endurance and muscular strength.</p><p>An exercise session consists of 10&#x02005;min warm-up, 20&#x02005;min bicycling, 20&#x02005;min strength and a 10&#x02005;min stretching and cool-down period. Using the results from the cardiopulmonary exercise test performed prior to the initial training session, in combination with the Borg Scale measuring subjective exhaustion, the aerobic exercise is performed with gradually increasing intensity throughout the exercise intervention period, corresponding to 13&#x02013;17 on the Borg Scale and 50&#x02013;80% of the maximum heart rate. The anaerobic resistance training is initiated at 30&#x02013;40% of one repetition maximum (RM) for the upper body and 40&#x02013;50% of one RM for the lower body, with an increasing workload during the training sessions. To achieve cardiovascular adjustment and reduce the risk of malignant cardiac arrhythmias and ischaemia, the training session is initiated and terminated with a warm-up and a cool-down period to gradually increase and decrease the training intensity and heart rate. This cardiovascular adjustment has been proven to reduce the risk of ischaemia and arrhythmia in relation to exercise training.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref> Training is predominantly performed in the upright position to reduce left ventricle preload (diastolic volume) and the risk of ischaemia and arrhythmias due to heart failure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2e1c"><title>Sustained moderate physical exercise daily</title><p>Participants are instructed to perform moderate physical exercise for at least 30&#x02005;min a day during the intervention period, for example, bicycling, walking, gardening, jogging or recreational sports. Participants are encouraged to continue with moderate physical exercise throughout their lives.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2e2"><title>Psychoeducational component</title><p>The aim of the psychoeducational intervention is to provide emotional support and improve coping skills and illness appraisal in order to enable the patient to respond appropriately to physical and psychological symptoms. Education and information about the disease prepare the patient for expected symptoms and sensations. Dialogue and shared reflection facilitate strategies for coping with symptoms and experiences associated with the condition, for example, anxiety and fear. Cardiac care nurses with specific training will perform the psychoeducational intervention. Some of the most commonly reported concerns of patients treated for AF with RFA, such as recurrent AF, and concerns about being able to manage a working life are outlined in a guide which nurses use to address when and if relevant (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012002377TB2">table 2</xref>). The information given will also be based on the national guidelines and standard treatment of patients treated for AF. The consultations focus on managing life after AF treated with RFA by establishing a joint approach to disease management and coping strategies, taking a holistic view. The psychoeducational intervention is inspired by R.R. Parse's Human Becoming Practice Methodologies&#x02019; three dimensions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref> These are interpreted as: (1) to discuss and give meaning to the past, present and future, (2) to explore and discuss events and possibilities and (3) to move along with envisioned possibilities. According to this theory, there are three ways of changing health: creative imaging, that is to see, hear and feel what a situation might be like if lived in a different way, affirming personal patterns and value priorities and shedding light on paradoxes, that is, looking at the incongruence in a situation and changing the view held of something. The nurse is present in the process through discussions, silent immersion and reflection. The human becoming practice methodology was chosen to apply a holistic patient approach, focusing on the coping and transformation process of the individual person. Furthermore, the method is already extensively used in the outpatient heart clinics at the heart centre at Rigshospitalet, such as for patients with inherited heart diseases and adults with congenital heart disease, and is documented in the COPE-ICD trial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref> The consultations take place in a quiet setting at the outpatient clinic and will last for approximately 1&#x02005;h. The nurse is able to facilitate contact with or seek advice from a physician if needed. The first consultation will be approximately 1&#x02005;month after discharge, and then once every 4&#x02013;6&#x02005;weeks, with a total of four consultations. Consultations can be done by telephone, in accordance with the patient's wishes. The primary investigator will attend the consultations regularly to ensure protocol compliance.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2012002377TB2" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Guide to the psychoeducative consultation</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number visit</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ask the patient how he/she has been since the ablation.

This is chosen as a primary outcome since this is standard in exercise-based rehabilitation trails. The test is performed according to current guidelines for ergospirometry testing, and by an ergometer bicycle, simultaneously monitoring heart rhythm, blood pressure, ECG and measuring gas exchange during workload and in the following recovery period. The average test duration is 10&#x02013;15&#x02005;min including the pretest and post-test phases without workload. Before each session, calibration is performed to address changes in room temperature, humidity and air oxygen content. A standardised ramp protocol is used with an initial workload of 25 or 50 watts, increasing gradually by 12.5&#x02005;W/min until peak exhaustion. Peak exhaustion is evaluated by a respiratory exchange ratio&#x02265;T 1.10 or by subjective exhaustion of the patient. In order to encourage the patients equally, independent of the tester, a standardised guide has been developed. During the test period, clinical manifestations, ECG abnormalities (ST depression, ST elevation, Q wave and T wave changes, supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias), blood pressure response and several physiological variables are observed and documented. The test will be performed by either a cardiac care nurse or a physician.

A comparison between groups A and B, where missing values in group A are imputed using imputing quantities obtained from group A and missing values from group B are imputed using imputing quantities obtained from group B, is referred to as a best case analysis. If missing values in group A are imputed using imputing quantities obtained from group B and vice versa, the comparison is called a worst case analysis. The imputing quantities for the primary outcome are the group mean at T1 (X1-bar), the group mean at T4 (X4-bar), the group mean at T6 (X6-bar), the mean difference between the value measured at T4 and that measured at T1 (&#x003b4;1) and the mean difference between the value measured at T6 and that measured at T4 (&#x003b4;2). <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012002377TB3">Table&#x000a0;3</xref> explains how the quantities are used to impute missing values in a group (either the same group or the other intervention group).

All eligible patients will be informed about the trial verbally and in writing, and they are included after informed consent has been obtained. All data will be handled confidentially and patients ensured anonymity. The trial complies with the latest Declaration of Helsinki and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01523145). An independent international safety committee monitors the trial. All serious and adverse events will be registered and reported in accordance with the safety charter.</p><p>Not providing rehabilitation to the control group can be ethically justified as current national and international guidelines give no specific recommendations on cardiac rehabilitation for patients treated for AF with RFA. The scope and quality of rehabilitation offered to this population is unknown, but suspicions are that generally no rehabilitation is offered in Denmark. The only way patients can get supervised exercise training is if they voluntarily enrol in a programme, for example, through non-profit organisations. The survey-based complementary study, described previously in this paper, will hopefully provide more insight into this. In screening patients for participation, the enrolling nurse or physician will exclude those with a compelling rehabilitation need. Furthermore, patients are informed of the study design before giving their consent, and are free to decline participation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Owing to the difference in the three patient groups that are included in the overall CopenHeart trial, patients treated for infective endocarditis, heart valve surgery and for AF patients treated with RFA, the intervention and outcome measures differ slightly, most importantly in the case of the psychoeducational intervention, which is longer for patients treated for infective endocarditis and heart valve surgery, because of the complexity of the diseases and the longer hospitalisation. Similarly, biochemical markers are chosen differently to address the various comorbidities of the three diseases and some disease specific questionnaires are chosen to capture the specific disease-relevant issues.</p><p>To our knowledge, no previous randomised clinical trials or observational studies have been conducted that focus on integrated cardiac rehabilitation for AF patients treated with RFA, and therefore it is not known what effect, if any, rehabilitation has on these patients. However, in the light of evidence from other groups of patients with heart disease, a positive effect can be expected.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref></p><p>This trial is different from previous trials because we apply a comprehensive rehabilitation intervention which consists of both a physical training component and a psychoeducational component. This combination is hypothesised to strengthen the patient both physically and mentally even if the patient has AF. Also, we use a mixed-method approach, which has its strengths in using both qualitative and quantitative research designs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></p><p>The major strengths of this randomised clinical trial are that it includes consecutive patients with a reasonable number of inclusion and exclusion criteria securing external validity for the results. The trial employs central, stratified randomisation which secures against selection bias.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92 R93 R94">92&#x02013;94</xref> The primary outcome is assessed blinded to intervention and so are all statistical analyses, which should reduce detection and interpretation bias.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92 R93 R94">92&#x02013;94</xref> The long-term outcomes are based on data taken from public registry data, which are also likely to not include biased reporting of outcomes.</p><p>The secondary outcomes of self-rated mental health are subjective by nature and are likely to be biased.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92 R93 R94">92&#x02013;94</xref> The patients answer questionnaires independently of the researchers. Data management is handled independently of the researchers who interpret data. All questionnaires are distributed electronically. All data entry is stored electronically in a coded database, and in an independent spreadsheet, accessible only to the CopenHeart Group.</p><p>The trial limitations include the fact that it is known from previous rehabilitation trials<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> that patients in the control group have a tendency to do physical training due to the focus on the subject in the recruitment process. We will be aware of that when we recruit and not focus on giving extensive information about the exercise programme, or encourage patients to do physical training before knowing which group they are randomised to. Any difference between patients completing the intervention and those not completing (dropouts) will be carefully discussed when evaluating the intervention, results and the suitability for implementation. The trial is designed with multiple statistical comparisons, so results will be interpreted with caution. Further limitations of the trial and methods used are similar to those of other trials including physical exercise and physical testing, namely time-of-day and day-to-day variation using exercise testing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref> To ensure standard testing of all physical exercise tests in the trial, standardised instructions for patients have been developed as described in the methods section. Conversely, the trial population will be representative of the true RFA population, meaning that some patients will have AF and some sinus rhythm while exercising and testing, and this will facilitate implementation of The CopenHeart<sub>RFA</sub> trial rehabilitation programme in daily clinical practice. We are aware that patients treated with RFA are a highly select group of patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF, and they are more likely to participate properly and complete a rehabilitation programme, compared with patients with, for example, permanent AF, since patients with permanent AF are often older and suffer from comorbidity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> Therefore we do not expect to generalise the results to all AF patients.</p><p>The challenge with the set-up is that patients come from considerable distances, and therefore some will decline participation. Also, owing to the nature of rehabilitation trials, the patients have to meet at the hospital frequently, especially when randomised to the experimental intervention group.</p><p>The trial will, to our knowledge, be the largest trial conducted that deals with rehabilitation AF ablation recipients. If a positive effect of integrated rehabilitation is found, it may have an impact on the rehabilitation offered to patients treated for AF with RFA at the international level. The trial is expected to identify an intervention which can improve the health and quality of life of patients, and subsequently reduce healthcare utilisation and costs, as well as mortality.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d34e298" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-002377.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d34e300" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-002377.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The rehabilitation team responsible for the intervention programme and trial administration is Rikke Brandt Jakobsen, Lone Siersb&#x000e6;k-Hansen, Lars Tang, Helena Tjalk S&#x000f8;rensen, Signe Gills, Helle Tauby, Katrine Haase and Line Ellemann-Jensen.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> SKB and ADZ designed the trial in collaboration with SSR, JLH, MP, LCT, PW and CG.
