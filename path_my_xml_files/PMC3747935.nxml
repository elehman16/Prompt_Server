Current guidelines for type 2 diabetes recommend GLP-1 RA as effective therapeutic options to add to metformin and lifestyle management in patients not achieving glycemic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Currently available GLP-1 RA require subcutaneous (SC) injection either once (liraglutide) or twice (exenatide BID) daily or once weekly (exenatide LAR). The need for repeated self-injections as well as the inconvenience of having to reconstitute and refrigerate the once-weekly formulation may create a barrier to initial use as well as long-term patient adherence and compliance with therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Associated gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs), especially nausea, and injection site reactions/discomfort often lead to discontinuation or further impair adherence to therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In addition, the weekly formulation of exenatide LAR requires 6 to 7 weeks to reach steady state and cannot be retrieved quickly in the event of side effects, as circulating therapeutic drug concentrations persist &#x0223c;10 weeks after the drug is discontinued.</p><p>ITCA 650 is a miniature osmotic pump system that is designed to deliver zero-order, continuous SC release of exenatide at a precise predetermined rate for up to 12 months with a single placement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The sterile product with dimensions similar to a small match stick is inserted SC in the abdominal region with a placement tool using aseptic technique during a short office procedure that can be performed by a physician, physician's assistant, or other licensed practitioner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Removal requires skin preparation and a small (&#x0223c;5 mm) incision. The procedures to place, remove, and replace other nonbiodegradable drug delivery systems is reimbursed in the U.S. by insurance companies and other payers, and so it is expected to be the same with ITCA 650 in the future.</p><p>This novel delivery system for exenatide has several potential advantages for the treatment of type 2 diabetes such as more rapid attainment and maintenance of consistent therapeutic drug concentrations, 100% adherence with therapy, and improved glycemic control with improved tolerability, perhaps related to more constant and predictable exenatide levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Once ITCA 650 is removed, the pharmacological effect of exenatide abates within 24 h, allowing quick retrieval of drug if needed due to AEs or other clinical considerations. For a chronic condition in which medication adherence is linked to clinical results, the potential to mitigate poor adherence with once or twice yearly chronic dosing with ITCA 650 may improve long-term outcomes as well as patient satisfaction.</p><p>A phase 1b study evaluated the safety and tolerability of 10, 20, 40, or 80 &#x003bc;g/day of ITCA 650 for 28 days in subjects with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels decreased in all dose groups within 1 to 2 days, and reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub> and body weight were observed in all groups. ITCA 650 was well tolerated, with mild local changes at the insertion site, largely due to the healing process, and transient nausea and vomiting that was generally mild and seen most often with the highest dose. Based on these results, a dose ranging study was undertaken to further investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ITCA 650 in subjects with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>This was a randomized, two-stage, 24-week, open-label, phase 2 study with an initial 12-week active-controlled period and 12-week dose-ranging period conducted at 50 centers in the U.S. The study was approved by an appropriately constituted institutional review board and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.

One subject in the Ex-BID&#x02192;60 &#x003bc;g/day and 20&#x02192;20 &#x003bc;g/day groups experienced severe vomiting.</p><p>Several different observations were reported in about half of subjects related to the site of administration of the ITCA 650 that mostly reflect the result of the normal healing process. Events such as bruising, pruritis, or pain local to the site of administration were usually reported within days of the placement and were typically mild and transient, resolving without any need for intervention. No subjects had a severe AE related to the site of administration of ITCA 650 during the study.</p><p>Subjects taking Ex-BID injections reported hematoma (5.9%), hemorrhage (1.9%), and erythema (1.9%) at the injection site. No clinically meaningful safety findings or trends in safety laboratory parameters or vital signs were noted. No clinically relevant effects on serum calcitonin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, serum amylase, or serum lipase were reported during 24 weeks of study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-2410/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 2</ext-link>).</p><p>In stage I (week 12), high anti-exenatide antibody titers were observed in 0, 2.1, and 4.5% of subjects treated with 20 and 40 mg /day of ITCA 650 and Ex-BID, respectively. In stage II (week 24), high titers were observed in 5.3, 7.0, 7.3, and 10% of subjects receiving 20, 40, 60, and 80 mg /day of ITCA 650, respectively. Data from the three antibody-positive subjects with high titers (&#x0003e;7,500) did not reveal any apparent relationship between antibody titer and loss of activity. Two subjects with high titers had reductions in both HbA<sub>1c</sub> and body weight at the end of stages I and II, and the third subject had increases in both HbA<sub>1c</sub> and body weight, even as titer levels dropped in stage II. At the end of stage II, nine antibody-positive subjects had high titers. Of these, six subjects had reductions in both HbA<sub>1c</sub> and body weight. The other three subjects showed a reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> or a reduction in body weight. The magnitude of activity observed in the high antibody titer subjects, which was similar to that observed in antibody-negative subjects, suggests that the presence of anti-exenatide antibodies did not reduce the activity of ITCA 650 in this study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s12"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In this study, treatment for up to 24 weeks with ITCA 650 resulted in significant improvements in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, FPG, and body weight in subjects with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy. Stage I of the study established that both initial doses of ITCA 650 (20 and 40 &#x000b5;g/day) resulted in significant HbA<sub>1c</sub> reductions. However, the ITCA 650 20 &#x000b5;g/day dose resulted in less overall nausea from weeks 1&#x02013;12 compared with 40 &#x000b5;g/day and Ex-BID. In stage II, doses ranging up to 80 &#x000b5;g/day of ITCA 650 demonstrated incremental reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels at the higher doses. The 60 &#x000b5;g/day dose of ITCA 650 produced similar HbA<sub>1c</sub> reductions and appeared to be better tolerated than the 80 &#x000b5;g/day dose. Switching directly from Ex-BID to higher doses of ITCA 650 was explored and also resulted in incremental reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels with somewhat more nausea.</p><p>The most troublesome tolerability issue with GLP-1 RA is the incidence and duration of GI side effects, in particular nausea and vomiting, that may account in clinical practice for the low treatment adherence and higher withdrawal rates, which are a greater problem than what has been reported in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The reported incidence of nausea with Ex-BID and once-weekly injection was 34.5 and 26.4%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Vomiting has been reported in 18.6 and 10.8% with twice-daily and once-weekly dosing, respectively. A similar incidence has been reported in other comparative trials of once-weekly and Ex-BID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). However, during a 74-week open-label extension phase, nausea persisted in 12% of patients taking once-weekly exenatide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The incidence of nausea with liraglutide in phase 3 clinical trials ranged from 10&#x02013;40% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Nausea was dose-related and occurred at higher rates within the first weeks of treatment. In this study, the incidence of nausea with ITCA 650 and Ex-BID was generally comparable during the first week after treatment was initiated; however, the incidence declined rapidly over 12 weeks with the 20-&#x000b5;g dose of ITCA 650 compared with the other groups.</p><p>In this study, local placement site AEs were mild and transient, and no subjects had a severe local AE related to ITCA 650. Injection site reactions including pain, induration, erythema, and bleeding have been reported with exenatide once-weekly injections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Injection site nodules occurred in 77% of subjects in one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Pruritus of mild intensity was observed in 18% of patients on exenatide once weekly versus 1.4% with Ex-BID, which improved and resolved with continued treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Another study reported injection site pruritus and erythema in 18 and 7% of patients, respectively, taking exenatide once-weekly injections during 30 weeks of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). These effects persisted at an incidence of 4% during a 74-week open-label extension phase.</p><p>An important barrier to optimizing glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes is poor adherence and persistence with chronic long-term treatment. In general, poor adherence to medications is known to result in poor disease control and increased health care costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Major factors contributing to poor adherence to diabetes medications are concerns about the risks of therapy, inconvenience, fear of injections, and complex dosing regimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Rates of adherence to insulin injections in patients with type 2 diabetes were reported to range from &#x0003c;60&#x02013;80%, and poor adherence impacts glycemic control and patient satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Examination of persistence with injectable antidiabetes drugs over 12 months from a pharmacy claims database found a mean persistence of 7.8 months among patients on Ex-BID therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), and only two-thirds of subjects prescribed Ex-BID persisted on treatment 1 year after initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). The need for repeated injections of GLP-1 RA creates a barrier to long-term patient adherence and compliance with therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). ITCA 650 can provide continuous and controlled SC delivery of exenatide for up to 12 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The potential to ensure 100% adherence with ITCA 650 may improve long-term therapeutic outcomes.</p><p>The limitations of this study include an open-label study design, absence of a control arm during stage II, and small sample size. These limitations will be addressed in phase 3 clinical studies of ITCA 650.</p><p>ITCA 650 is an innovative delivery system for the GLP-1 RA exenatide, being investigated for once- or twice-yearly administration in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Results from this phase 2 dose ranging trial showed significant dose-related effects on HbA<sub>1c</sub>, FPG, and body weight that were maintained for up to 24 weeks. ITCA 650 demonstrated a tolerability profile that may offer important advantages over exenatide BID injections and other long-acting injectable GLP-1 RA compounds. ITCA 650 was generally well tolerated, and patient acceptance and placement/removal of the delivery system were well accepted. The most common drug-related AEs were GI and administration site events that were generally observed early in the course of treatment and transient. Uniquely, ITCA 650 offers the potential of ensuring rapid attainment and maintenance of stable therapeutic exenatide levels, 100% compliance of drug delivery, and adherence to the prescribed regimen. In addition, pharmacological effects can be terminated within 24 h of removal if necessitated by the presence of side effects or other clinical considerations. The results of this study support additional clinical development of ITCA 650 in subjects with type 2 diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
