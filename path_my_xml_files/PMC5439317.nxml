The study was a comparative trial to validate the efficacy of single injection of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for tennis elbow as compared with single injections of triamcinolone and placebo (normal saline) over a short term period.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Comparative trial with 3- and 6-month followup evaluated with visual analog scale (VAS) and facial pain scale (FPS). Our study included a total of eighty patients with unilateral or bilateral tennis elbows. The study population included patients between 20 and 40 years age group belonging to either sex with seventy unilateral and ten bilateral affections for more than 3-month duration. Patients suffering from elbow pain due to other problems or those who have received any form of injection were excluded from the study. One milliliter of 2% Xylocaine injection was given before injecting the proposed formulation under trial. VAS and FPS were used for scoring pain. Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test and Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-tests were used for statistical analyses at 12 and 24 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 49 females and 31 males were included with thirty elbows in each group.

Patients in the age group of 20&#x02013;50 years of either sex who were clinically having symptoms suggestive of tennis elbow were included in the study. Patients who had received any previous treatment in the form of local injections of steroid were excluded from the study. Patients who were suffering from symptoms of pain around the elbow due to other reasons such as inflammatory arthropathies, posterior interosseous nerve syndrome, osteochondritis dissecans of elbow, elbow pain referred from cervical spine, or ipsilateral shoulder were excluded from the study. Consent for the procedure was obtained. All patients were subjected to routine blood investigation including the markers for inflammatory arthropathy and radiographic examinations of cervical spine, ipsilateral shoulder, and the elbow under study. Patients clinically diagnosed to have tennis elbow and after excluding all other causes of elbow pain were subjected to ultrasonographic examination of the elbow under study to confirm the diagnosis of tennis elbow. The findings involve hypoechoic signal from the extensor tendons suggestive of edema of the extensor tendon in all cases. The patients were randomized into three groups according to the randomization software. First group of patients was given autologous PRP, the second group was given steroid triamcinolone, and the third group of patients was given normal saline injection as the placebo. The results were recorded by visual analog scale (VAS) score and facial pain scale (FPS). The scores were recorded in the prepared Pro forma on the day of injection before giving the injection, then after 12 weeks and after 24 weeks. The results were analyzed using nonparametric tests such as Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test and Mann&#x02013;Whitney U test. After giving injection, patients were given paracetamol for the initial pain relief in all the three groups. Patients were advised for rest during initial 2 weeks in the form of refraining from strenuous activities by the extremity under study after the injection. Bilateral cases were injected simultaneously, and the postinjection protocol was same.</p><p>To prepare PRP around 15 mL of patient's blood was obtained by drawing blood through a scalp vein catheter to avoid turbulence while drawing the blood. The PRP was prepared using differential centrifugation technique with two spins. The blood was collected in three citrate tubes having 0.9% sodium citrate as anticoagulant. The first spin was performed at 1500 rpm for 15 min using laboratory centrifuge. This spin separated the red blood cells from the rest of the components. The upper half of the supernatant was discarded. The lower halves of the supernatant from all the three tubes are transferred into another plain tube for the second spin. The second spin was performed at 2500 rpm for 10 min. The upper half of the supernatant was discarded. One milliliter of lower half was taken into a 1 mL syringe having 0.1 mL of calcium chloride. At the end of preparation of PRP the samples were sent for platelet count and the count compared with patient's platelet count. The second group was given 1 mL of triamcinolone, and the third group was given 1 mL of normal saline.</p><p>The site of injection was 5 mm distal to the lateral epicondyle in the extensor tendons, particularly extensor carpi radialis brevis tendon [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The skin was painted with povidone-iodine and ethyl alcohol. One milliliter of 2% lignocaine with adrenaline was injected at the injection site after giving test dose. After 10 min, the proposed injection was injected. The injection was given on and around the tendon and not inside the tendon. If any resistance was felt during the injection, the needle is withdrawn a bit and again injected. Patients were advised regarding postinjection care. The pain might increase during initial 2 weeks which was explained to the patient. Paracetamol was prescribed for pain relief.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>A clinical photograph showing injection site</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJOrtho-51-304-g001"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><p>Eighty patients including 49 females and 31 males in the age group of 20&#x02013;40 years with ninety elbows were included in the study. The study had thirty elbows in each group. Out of the 49 females with 53 elbows, 18 received PRP, 18 received triamcinolone, and 17 received normal saline. Out of the 31 males with 37 elbows under study, 12 received PRP, 12 received triamcinolone, and 13 received normal saline.</p><p>For statistical analysis, the three groups are numbered as No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 to represent PRP, triamcinolone, and normal saline. Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test was used to compare the result among all the three groups as shown in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. If we analyze the mean ranks, we can see that the mean ranks in all the three groups are similar on the day of injection for both VAS and FPS scores. At 12-week followup, the VAS score mean ranks in PRP group and triamcinolone group improved by 33% and 28.5%, respectively [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>]. Similarly, at 12 weeks, the improvements in FPS scores were 34% and 23%, respectively, in PRP and triamcinolone group. At 24-week followup, the VAS score mean ranks in PRP group and triamcinolone group improved by 49% and 5%, respectively. Similarly, at 24 weeks, the improvements in FPS scores were 50% and 3%, respectively, in PRP and triamcinolone group. The normal saline group showed worsening of results in VAS score and in FPS score at 12 weeks and 24 weeks. FPS was calculated using appropriate proforma using FPS diagram chart. Hence, the pain scores improved in both PRP and triamcinolone group but worsened in the normal saline group at both 12- and 24-week followup. At 24 weeks, the improvement in pain was more with PRP than with triamcinolone where most patients had a relapse of pain.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Kruskal-Wallis test to compare the result among all the three groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJOrtho-51-304-g002"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Kruskal-Wallis test to compare the result among all the three groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJOrtho-51-304-g003"/></table-wrap><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>A line diagram showing mean visual analog scale for different time points between groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJOrtho-51-304-g004"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>A line diagram showing mean facial pain scale for different time points between groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJOrtho-51-304-g005"/></fig><p>We calculated the <italic>P</italic> values in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> which showed that on the day of injection, it is not significant for both VAS score (<italic>P</italic> = 0.517) and FPS score (<italic>P</italic> = 0.960).
