Several studies have shown that spinal anesthesia is as safe and effective as general anesthesia for patients undergoing lumbar laminectomy.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The potential advantages of spinal anesthesia include decreased antiemetic and analgesic requirements and fewer complications. Spinal anesthesia avoids many of the deleterious physiological consequences of the prone position, which are seen under general anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia may reduce blood loss as an effect of decreased peripheral venous pressure. The use of spinal anesthesia has lower incidence of pulmonary complications compared with general anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia also allows the patient to position their extremities and chest as needed to avoid brachial plexus palsy or pressure necrosis.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The characteristics of block after spinal anesthesia are influenced by several factors including position of the patient during and after the injection of the spinal anesthetic solution, physical properties of cerebrospinal fluid, injection technique, dose and density of spinal anesthetic solution. The addition of adjuvants to local anesthetics has gained widespread popularity mainly due to decrease in the incidence of side effects of local anesthetics and increased duration of sensory and motor blockade seen with addition of adjuvants.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Clonidine, a centrally acting &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonist, when administered into subarachnoid space has been shown to produce dose-dependent analgesia without side effects of ventilatory depression, pruritus, nausea, and vomiting. It, however, has side effects of sedation, bradycardia, and hypotension. Fentanyl, which has strong agonist action on &#x000b5; opioid receptors, has been shown to increase the intensity and duration of spinal anesthesia when used as an adjunct. The aim of the study is to compare the effects of clonidine 75 &#x000b5;g and fentanyl 25 &#x000b5;g on onset, level, duration, and quality of sensory and motor blocks when added to hyperbaric 0.5% bupivacaine for subarachnoid block (SAB).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A prospective, randomized, parallel arm study was conducted over a period of 12 months in a tertiary care hospital, with prior permission from the Institutional Ethics Committee. Eighty-six continuous patients undergoing elective lumbar laminectomy were assessed for eligibility to be included in the study. Informed consent was taken from all the patients after describing the purpose of the study and explaining the anesthetic procedure in detail. The patients undergoing lumbar laminectomy, aged more than 18 years of either sex or body weight of 50 kg and above and the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status of I or II, were included in the study. Patients who were unwilling for the procedure, ASA physical status III and above, patients with a history of allergy to local anesthetics, bleeding disorders, or patients on anticoagulant therapy were excluded from the study.</p><p>Sixty patients, who met the inclusion criteria, were divided randomly into two groups, Group C and Group F [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Randomization was carried out by drawing any one of the two labeled cards (Groups C and F) from a sealed opaque envelope. Patients in Group C received 2.5 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine heavy mixed with 0.5 ml (75 &#x000b5;g) clonidine intrathecally, and patients in Group F received 2.5 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine heavy mixed with 0.5 ml (25 &#x000b5;g) fentanyl intrathecally. The total volume of solution administered in the subarachnoid space was 3 ml in both groups.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-10-618-g001"/></fig><p>In the operation theater, monitors were connected, and baseline parameters such as heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), respiratory rate (RR), oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), and electrocardiograph were monitored, and a secure intravenous (IV) line was established. 15 ml/kg of IV crystalloid solution was administered as a preload, and a SAB was performed under aseptic precautions with a 25-gauge Quincke's spinal needle. After intrathecal drug administration, the patient was made to lie in the supine position. The patient was turned prone for the surgery after confirming complete motor and sensory block.</p><p>The study parameters were recorded in the intraoperative period, and the patients were followed up in the postoperative period until the regression of the motor and sensory block. Intraoperative HR, SBP, DBP, MAP, RR, and SpO<sub>2</sub> were recorded at an interval of every 2 min for the first 30 min and thereafter at an interval of every 5 min until the end of surgery.</p><p>Sensory block was evaluated by Hollmen scale and recorded at an interval of every 2 min until the complete sensory block was achieved. Onset time of sensory block was taken as the time interval from the time of administration of SAB till sensory block, with a Hollmen score of 1, was achieved. Time for complete sensory block was taken as the duration of time in minutes from SAB till complete sensory block, with a Hollmen score of 4, was achieved. The total duration of sensory block was taken as the duration from onset of sensory block to the time when a Hollmen score of &#x0003c;4 was recorded in the postoperative period.</p><p>Motor block was evaluated using modified Bromage score for lower extremity, and the finding was recorded every 2 min from SAB till complete motor block was achieved. Onset time of motor block was taken as the time interval in minutes from SAB to the time, a modified Bromage score of 1 was achieved. Time for complete motor block was taken as the duration of time in minutes from SAB till complete motor block, with a modified Bromage score of 3, was achieved. Total duration of motor block was taken as the duration of time in minutes from onset to the time when a modified Bromage score of &#x0003c;3 was recorded in the postoperative period.</p><p>The maximum level of sensory block was also noted. The quality of SAB was recorded as &#x0201c;adequate&#x0201d; when the patient experienced total comfort and &#x0201c;inadequate&#x0201d; when there was patient discomfort, which required supplementation with analgesic agents. Block was considered as &#x0201c;failed&#x0201d; if complete sensory and motor block was not achieved even after 30 min.</p><p>All the patients were given IV midazolam 1 mg, and the level of sedation was assessed regularly. The duration of surgery was recorded, and intraoperative complications were noted.</p><p>Postoperatively, the patients were monitored for vital parameters, Hollmen score for sensory block, modified Bromage score for motor block, and visual analog scale (VAS) score for pain, every hour until the complete regression of sensory as well as motor block was achieved. When VAS score for pain was recorded more than 4, the patient was given systemic analgesics. Other complications such as neurological deficit were noted till the time of discharge.</p><p>Data was analyzed with statistical software &#x02018;IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0. (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp)&#x02019; and Chi square tests were applied for categorical variables and continuous variables were compared using one-way ANOVA test.

The advantages of using general anesthesia for lumbar laminectomies include the ability to carry out prolonged operations in the prone position, with adequate airway control. Alternatively, the advantages of spinal anesthesia are, decrease in intraoperative blood loss and consequently improved operative conditions, decreased postoperative hypoxemic episodes, decreased arterial and venous thrombosis, lesser incidence of brachial plexus injury and pressure necrosis, and better postoperative pain control.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Opioids and &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonists are used as adjuncts to SAB to improve the quality of block, quality of anesthesia, and prolongation of analgesia in the postoperative period. Efficacy of intrathecal opioid to relieve visceral pain and somatic pain is well established.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Antinociceptive action of clonidine also exists for both somatic and visceral pain. Clonidine being a lipophilic drug, it is possible to achieve analgesia, with its systemic, epidural, or intrathecal administration. However, clonidine is more potent after neuraxial than systemic administration, indicating a spinal site of action.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Literature search reveals that different studies have used different doses of clonidine, ranging from 15 to 200 &#x000b5;g intrathecally. Chiari <italic>et al</italic>. reported dose-dependent analgesia when 50&#x02013;200 &#x000b5;g clonidine was administered intrathecally as sole an agent in labor. They found that risk of hypotension is higher with use of higher doses.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The studies with higher doses of 2 &#x000b5;g/kg body weight of clonidine added to 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine for spinal anesthesia in children shows that intrathecal clonidine 2 &#x000b5;g/kg body weight is associated with extended duration of postoperative analgesia, but with moderate side effects.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Based on the review of literature, doses of 15&#x02013;37.5 &#x000b5;g were shown to be effective for surgeries requiring early ambulation or for elderly patients. Most studies with doses of 100&#x02013;200 &#x000b5;g reported minimal to moderate side effects of clonidine. Hence, a dose of 75 &#x000b5;g of preservative-free clonidine as an adjuvant to intrathecal bupivacaine for spinal anesthesia was chosen for this study.</p><p>Fentanyl, a highly lipophilic opioid, has been combined with bupivacaine for SAB. The synergism between intrathecal local anesthetic agents and opioids such as fentanyl is well established. Various doses from 10 to 30 &#x000b5;g have been used intrathecally for labor and postoperative pain relief for lower abdominal surgeries.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Lower doses do not enhance postoperative analgesia and doses higher than 30 &#x000b5;g cause mild to moderate side effects such as pruritus. Hence, a dose of 25 &#x000b5;g fentanyl for intrathecal administration was chosen for this study.</p><p>Clonidine is available as 150 &#x000b5;g/ml, and fentanyl is available as 50 &#x000b5;g/ml solution. Hence, clonidine 75 &#x000b5;g in 0.5 ml and fentanyl 25 &#x000b5;g in 0.5 ml solutions have been chosen, to be added directly to the local anesthetic, without any dilution, thus maintaining sterility.</p><p>In this study with clonidine 75 &#x000b5;g in 0.5 ml and fentanyl, 25 &#x000b5;g in 0.5 ml as adjuvants to SAB with bupivacaine, the difference in onset of sensory block, onset of motor block, and time to complete sensory and motor block were statistically not significant. The total duration of analgesia was also statistically not significant with the use of either adjuvant.</p><p>Singh <italic>et al</italic>. studied the effect of oral clonidine 200 &#x000b5;g and intrathecal fentanyl 10 &#x000b5;g on the onset and duration of hyperbaric tetracaine-induced spinal block.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In their study, intrathecal fentanyl 10 &#x000b5;g did not change the onset or duration of tetracaine-induced spinal block. However, oral clonidine 200 &#x000b5;g shortened the onset time of tetracaine's sensory block and prolonged the duration of sensory and motor block. However, clonidine premedication increased the risk of hypotension and bradycardia. However, in our study 75 &#x000b5;g clonidine and 25 &#x000b5;g fentanyl were administered intrathecally, and no difference was observed in complication rate in intra-operative and post-operative period between the two groups.</p><p>Islam <italic>et al</italic>. compared the complications, quality of anesthesia, and duration of postoperative analgesia with the use of adjuvant clonidine 75 &#x000b5;g or fentanyl 25 &#x000b5;g with hyperbaric bupivacaine in SAB for cesarean section.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The study revealed that subarachnoid clonidine and fentanyl, as adjuvant with low-dose hyperbaric bupivacaine, provides better quality of block, better quality of anesthesia, more hemodynamic stability, and longer duration of postoperative analgesia, compared to bupivacaine alone. It is also revealed that clonidine is a better alternative to fentanyl as an adjuvant with bupivacaine in SAB. However, in this study, we found that both clonidine 75 &#x000b5;g and fentanyl 25 &#x000b5;g as adjuvants to bupivacaine in SAB have comparable results in terms of duration of motor and sensory blocks and duration of analgesia.</p><p>Baseline hemodynamic parameters were also comparable, and no significant difference was observed between groups. Hypotension was the only intraoperative complication, which was treated with fluids. No major complications in the postoperative period were observed in any of the patients. Respiratory depression, the serious side effect of opioid administration, was not observed, possibly due to the dose of opioid used. In addition, bradycardia, a potential risk of clonidine administration, was not observed.</p><p>This study was conducted on patients undergoing lumbar laminectomies, and most of the patients had achieved height of sensory block up to T10 level. The quality of SAB was &#x0201c;adequate&#x0201d; in all cases. Hence, both clonidine 75 &#x000b5;g and fentanyl 25 &#x000b5;g, when used as adjuvants to bupivacaine in SAB, will also be beneficial to patients undergoing not only lumbar laminectomies but also any infraumbilical surgery. Both the adjuvants at these doses can be used interchangeably with each other for their beneficial effects, without encountering complications of either drug.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Both clonidine 75 &#x000b5;g and fentanyl 25 &#x000b5;g when used as adjuvants to bupivacaine in SAB have comparable results in terms of duration of motor and sensory blocks and duration of analgesia.
