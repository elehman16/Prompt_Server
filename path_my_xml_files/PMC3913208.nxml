The patients were instructed to perform three to four working sessions per week. The main outcome was EIB 24&#x02005;h after the last dosing of study medication.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After 6&#x02005;weeks of treatment with regular budesonide or budesonide+formoterol on demand the maximum post-exercise forced expiratory volume in 1&#x02005;s fall, 24&#x02005;h after the last medication, was 6.6% (mean; 95% CI &#x02212;10.3 to &#x02212;3.0) and 5.4% (&#x02212;8.9 to &#x02212;1.8) smaller, respectively. This effect was superior to inhalation of terbutaline on demand (+1.5%; &#x02212;2.1 to +5.1). The total budesonide dose was approximately 2.5 times lower in the budesonide+formoterol group than in the regular budesonide group. The need for extra medication was similar in the three groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The combination of budesonide and formoterol on demand improves asthma control by reducing EIB in the same order of magnitude as regular budesonide treatment despite a substantially lower total steroid dose. Both these treatments were superior to terbutaline on demand, which did not alter the bronchial response to exercise. The results question the recommendation of prescribing SABAs as the only treatment for EIB in mild asthma.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Asthma</kwd><kwd>Exercise</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float"><caption><title>Key messages</title></caption><sec><title>What is the key question?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Does on-demand treatment with the combination of budesonide/formoterol improve asthma control as assessed by exercise induced bronchoconstriction (EIB)?</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>What is the bottom line?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The combination of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and a long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist (LABA) on demand yields better asthma control than a short-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist (SABA) on demand and is non-inferior to regular ICS treatment.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Why read on?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Current recommendations of treating EIB with a SABA on demand as the only medication in patients with mild asthma does not improve bronchial response to exercise over time and could therefore be questioned.

Furthermore, the reduction in EIB after 6&#x02005;weeks of treatment with inhaled budesonide/formoterol on demand was non-inferior to daily inhalation of budesonide. This finding clearly indicates that treatment with three to four doses per week of the combination is sufficient to provide good asthma control, implying no need for regular treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in patients with mild asthma.</p><p>According to current guidelines, patients with EIB should inhale a rapid-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist prior to exercise and if reliever medication is needed more than twice a week, regular controller therapy with ICS should be considered.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Our study included patients with mild asthma in whom inhaled steroids were not indicated according to the treating physician and who inhaled reliever medication up to four times a week. These patients often inhale a &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist before exercise as routine, implying that the exact need for treatment is not known. In clinical practice these patients are frequently treated with a rapid SABA or LABA on demand as the only medication. In the present study all three groups of patients seemed have well controlled asthma from a clinical point of view, as their consumption of extra medication was approximately one inhalation per week or every second week. This shows that the favourable result obtained in the budesonide/formoterol group cannot be explained by a higher number of extra inhalations.</p><p>Although terbutaline protected against EIB when inhaled on demand throughout the study, as indicated by the low symptom scores even on exercise days, the bronchial response to exercise was unaltered, or even slightly increased, after 6&#x02005;weeks of treatment with inhaled terbutaline on demand as monotherapy. As the symptom scores did not differ between groups on the exercise days, the patients did not seem to perceive a difference in the protective effect between terbutaline and budesonide/formoterol when inhaled prior to exercise. However, the results clearly indicate that treatment with the combination on demand provides better protection for occasional, unplanned exertion than terbutaline on demand as monotherapy. Continuous treatment with a &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist may increase the bronchial response to methacholine<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and exercise.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In addition, the enhancement of bronchial response to methacholine induced by repeated low-dose allergen challenges is counteracted by inhalation of a combination of a steroid (budesonide) and a rapid-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist (formoterol) but not by inhalation of formoterol alone.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> There are thus a number of studies showing that regular treatment with a &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist alone has no beneficial effect on airway responsiveness over time. The present study is in agreement with these findings, as treatment with a &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist alone did not alter airways response to exercise over time. We conclude that monotherapy with a &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist on demand, which is not indicated for regular use in more severe asthma,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;22</xref> may also be avoided in patients with mild asthma.</p><p>In our study, the long-term protective effect on EIB was similar in the groups who received budesonide, demonstrating that budesonide+formoterol inhaled on demand was non-inferior to regular, daily corticosteroid therapy, despite a 2.5-fold lower total corticosteroid dose. The combination of budesonide and formoterol, used as maintenance and reliever therapy, prevents exacerbations and symptoms more effectively than regular inhalations of the combination with rapid-acting bronchodilators as reliever.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;26</xref> In all these studies the ICS/LABA combination has been given as maintenance and as reliever therapy. This treatment strategy has been used in subjects with more severe asthma, that is, in patients who need regular treatment with a combination of inhaled steroids and LABAs. For the first time it was shown that on-demand use of an ICS/LABA combination is non-inferior to regular treatment with an ICS in patients with asthma and EIB, indicating that treatment with the combination on demand is an alternative to regular corticosteroid treatment in patients with mild asthma.</p><p>It could be argued that 6&#x02005;weeks of treatment may be too short to achieve the full effect of the steroid on EIB and that the dose of budesonide may be too low to achieve maximal effect. In a 3-month study of children with a history of wheezing, but not documented EIB, a daily dose of 400&#x02005;&#x003bc;g of beclomethasone dipropionate totally abolished post-exercise bronchoconstriction after 1&#x02005;month of treatment.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Six weeks of inhaled budesonide, 1600&#x02005;&#x003bc;g daily, reduced EIB compared with placebo in adults.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In children with asthma EIB was reduced after 3&#x02005;weeks of treatment<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and in another paediatric study a daily dose of 200&#x02005;&#x003bc;g fluticasone reduced EIB within 4&#x02005;weeks of treatment.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The effect of inhaled steroids on EIB thus appears after a few weeks of treatment, indicating that 6&#x02005;weeks of treatment is sufficient for a study of this type.</p><p>A high dose of budesonide (1600&#x02005;&#x003bc;g/day) reduced EIB by 17% in adult patients with asthma who had a pretreatment post-exercise FEV<sub>1</sub> fall of 26%.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In our study the post-exercise FEV<sub>1</sub> fall prior to randomisation was 15&#x02013;18%, indicating that the patients had mild asthma and there was not much room for improvement. Although studies in children clearly indicate that the effect of inhaled steroids on EIB appears at low doses, we cannot exclude the possibility that a higher dose of budesonide in the group that received regular treatment would have improved the results further. The present data do not allow any conclusions to be drawn regarding possible dose&#x02013;response relationships between on-demand medication with the combination of budesonide/formoterol and the protection against EIB.</p><p>In conclusion, in mild asthma a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and a long and rapid-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist used on demand is superior to the use of an inhaled SABA alone in reducing EIB. In addition, inhalation of the combination on demand is not inferior to regular treatment with the corticosteroid alone in these patients, despite a 2.5-fold lower dose of the steroid. The results may have implications for treatment guidelines in patients with mild asthma.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> KL: study design.
