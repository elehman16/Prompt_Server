In addition to evaluating the impact of treatment on individual patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures, MCIDs can be used in number needed-to-treat (NNT) or predictive analyses to better understand the magnitude of treatment benefit. The NNT determines the number of patients that need to be treated in order to obtain the benefit of interest in one additional patient (small NNTs indicate a favourable treatment effect).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> Additionally, the predictive value of MCIDs can be evaluated by examining whether achieving improvements &#x02265;MCID earlier with active treatment result in better longer term clinical outcomes.</p><p>Certolizumab pegol (CZP), a PEGylated anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) for the treatment of RA, has demonstrated efficacy and safety in three phase III trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> When administered with methotrexate (MTX), CZP provided rapid, sustained and clinically meaningful improvements in physical function, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and all other PROs over 1 year.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> To further extend these observations, data from the Rheumatoid Arthritis PreventIon of structural Damage (RAPID) 2 trial were examined to investigate the NNT based on patients reporting improvements &#x02265;MCID, correlations between individual PROs and other clinical parameters, and times to onset of &#x02018;responses&#x02019; (improvements &#x02265;MCID) as predictors of disease activity at week 24.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Patients and study design</title><p>Study methods of the RAPID 2 trial have been published previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> Briefly, patients with active RA (by 1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) with inadequate responses to MTX therapy were randomised to receive CZP (400 mg at weeks 0, 2 and 4 followed by CZP 200 mg or 400 mg) plus MTX every 2 weeks, or placebo plus MTX for 24 weeks.

Both methods can provide patients and physicians with meaningful information on treatment effect, such as how likely an individual patient is to benefit from treatment with CZP and whether the level of response within the first 12 weeks can determine longer term clinical outcomes.</p><p>To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the benefit of an anti-TNF in RA by calculating the NNT using a variety of PROs. Previous work has investigated the NNT for other TNF inhibitors based on clinical responses such as ACR 20/50/70.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref> One study of TNF inhibitors (etanercept, infliximab or adalimumab), analysing NNT according to HAQ-DI, reported an NNT of 1.94.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref> In the present analysis, the NNT to achieve clinically meaningful improvements in up to five of six PROs was similarly low; only two to three additional patients needed to be treated to have at least one patient report simultaneous relief in five PROs, and the NNT for improvements in all six PROs was five to six patients. Further analyses indicated that it was more difficult for patients to achieve improvements &#x02265;MCID in SF-36 PCS and more particularly MCS than in pain, PtGA, fatigue and physical function. This is not surprising as SF-36 measures additional aspects of the burden of RA and reporting improvements in complex concepts included in the mental component score implies a broader and holistic relief.</p><p>Further support for the use of all PRO measures including individual SF-36 domains to fully assess treatment benefit is provided by the correlation analyses. There were high correlations between pain, disease activity, fatigue and physical function; however, these improvements were less well correlated with those reported for HRQoL. As expected, correlations between mTSS and the PROs or other clinical parameters were low. Physical function scores (HAQ-DI) showed strong correlations with SF-36 PF and PCS scores as expected, but also BP domain and only moderate correlations with fatigue (FAS) scores and low correlations with SF-36 domains assessing MH. High correlations were also observed between PF and BP, and between VT and SF and MH. Interestingly, strong correlations were observed between certain &#x02018;physical&#x02019; and &#x02018;mental&#x02019; domains (RP and RE; BP and SF). Evaluating treatment-associated changes across all PROs is thus a better method for assessing change in multidimensional function. Careful evaluation of all SF-36 domain scores offers more information than the summary scores alone. For example, correlations between FAS and SF-36 MCS scores were lower than those between FAS and SF-36 VT domain scores. As VT is one of the domains scored positively when calculating MCS scores, these results indicate that the other three &#x02018;mental&#x02019; domains (SF, and particularly MH and RE) provide the greatest contribution to changes in SF-36 MCS scores. FAS had high/marked correlations with pain VAS and PtGA followed by VT, which could indicate that FAS and SF-36 VT scores provide complementary assessments for measuring fatigue/tiredness; FAS may be more appropriate to evaluate physical aspects of fatigue, whereas SF-36 VT more fully assesses mental aspects such as pep, motivation and energy. Therefore, although SF-36 PCS and MCS scores provide a good summary metric of HRQoL, they do not fully reflect the overall magnitude of changes within individual domains.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> Physicians should consider data from all SF-36 domains as well as PCS and MCS scores in their decision-making process. To facilitate analysis and interpretation of treatment-related effects across the individual domains, &#x02018;spydergrams&#x02019; were used to depict SF-36 results, which allowed a more global comparison of disease-related decrements in HRQoL versus normative data.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></p><p>A limitation of the NNT analysis is that patients with active disease in the placebo plus MTX group were used as the comparator and, therefore, the analysis only relates to this comparison. Nevertheless, the low NNT confirms the efficacy of CZP regarding reported improvements in PROs, indicating that relatively few patients need to be treated with CZP to achieve relief from the burdens of RA.</p><p>More patients with responses by week 6 had LDA at week 24 than those with responses at week 12. Similarly, those patients achieving pain MCID by week 12 were more likely to have better outcomes than those patients who did not achieve pain MCID at week 12, including LDA, remission and acceptable HAQ-DI scores. Taken together these results indicate that early improvement in PROs predict both clinical and PROs at 6 months. They complement previous analyses from the RAPID 1 trial demonstrating that patients who reported more rapid improvements in disease activity had higher chances of achieving better clinical outcomes at 1 year.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></p><p>Overall, these results suggest that patients treated with CZP who achieve early responses according to either PROs or LDA have a greater chance of avoiding long-term disability. Because of the short 6-month study duration of RAPID 2, longer term data (1&#x02013;2 years) are needed to confirm the use of time to responses by PROs as a predictor of better clinical outcomes.</p><p>In conclusion, CZP 200 or 400 mg plus MTX administered every 2 weeks provides broad relief from the multiple burdens of RA. Significant and clinically meaningful improvements, low NNTs and increased likelihood of achieving longer term outcomes with an earlier PRO response indicate that CZP is an effective treatment option, offering substantial benefits to patients.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline PRO scores</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="(" span="1"/><col align="char" char="(" span="1"/><col align="char" char="(" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PRO (mean (SD))</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PBO+MTX (n=127)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CZP 200 mg+MTX (n=246)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CZP 400 mg+MTX (n=246)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pain VAS (range 0&#x02013;100 mm)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">59.7 (22.2)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.0 (19.3)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.5 (20.1)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PtGA VAS (range 0&#x02013;100 mm)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">59.7 (21.9)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.5 (20.3)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.0 (19.6)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HAQ-DI (range 0&#x02013;3)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.6 (0.6)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.6 (0.6)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.6 (0.6)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fatigue FAS NRS (range 0&#x02013;10)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.5 (1.8)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.7 (1.9)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.4 (1.8)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="4" rowspan="1">SF-36 (range 0&#x02013;100)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;PCS</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.1 (6.7)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30.6 (5.9)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.1 (6.3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;MCS</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40.1 (11.4)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">38.6 (10.9)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">39.6 (10.9)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="4" rowspan="1">&#x02003;Domains</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x02003;Physical functioning</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">34.5 (21.4)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30.5 (20.0)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">32.9 (20.0)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x02003;Role physical</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.8 (27.8)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.3 (24.4)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.2 (25.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x02003;Bodily pain</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30.8 (16.9)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29.2 (14.3)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30.8 (14.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x02003;General health</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">34.4 (15.8)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">34.7 (15.5)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">34.3 (14.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x02003;Vitality</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36.9 (18.7)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36.0 (17.7)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">38.1 (17.2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x02003;Social functioning</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">48.8 (25.0)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">46.2 (23.0)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">49.3 (24.4)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x02003;Role emotional</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">38.0 (41.6)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27.1 (39.3)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.4 (38.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x02003;Mental health</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">53.5 (19.3)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">52.1 (18.1)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">52.9 (18.2)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>CZP, certolizumab pegol;
