The prevalence of breast nodularity in a random population-based sample of women in the community and hospital is 62%.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> In FBC, breast nodularity is due to small breast masses (fibrosis) and breast cysts. Nodularity does not increase breast cancer risk, but it can make a mammogram more difficult to read or interpret. On clinical examination, cysts are palpable as discrete, rounded lumps, which cannot be reliably distinguished from solid tumors. Fibrosis is composed of fibrous and epithelial tissue and present as firm, nontender, palpable lumps. Nodularity is often associated with cyclic menstrual related breast pain, or cyclic mastalgia, giving rise to patient fear of breast cancer and discomfort severe enough to affect quality of life.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>Current treatment options for FBC are limited and not fully effective. Over-the-counter (OTC) pain medication (acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDS]) may be treatment options for breast pain. Prescription hormonal treatment medications&#x02014;tamoxifen (selective estrogen receptor modulator with estrogen agonist&#x02013;antagonist properties),<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> danazol (attenuated androgen),<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and goserelin (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analog)<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>&#x02014;are expensive, have short- and long-term adverse side effects, and can only be used for 2- to 6-month periods. Results of studies suggested benefits from nutritional interventions for treatment of cyclic mastalgia; dietary intake of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), usually as evening primrose oil,<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> or various forms of iodine were reported to reduce breast pain.<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> However, pain relief by iodine was only achieved by provision of iodine in a nondietary form and in amounts that exceed the recommended upper limit for safe dietary intake.<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>In this study, the hypothesis tested was that GLA and iodine may complement each other in providing relief from nodularity and mastalgia by modulating pathways associated with estrogen and/or thyroid hormone metabolism.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Selenium was added to help minimize potential adverse effects of increased iodine intake on the thyroid.<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Support for the proposed combination of these ingredients comes from <italic>in vitro</italic> studies that show a synergistic effect of GLA, iodine, and selenium. Modulation of the function of human endothelial cell intercellular tight junctions (TJs),<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and the complete reversal of the effects of estradiol on paracellular permeability and the function of TJ in human breast cancer cells were observed with the unique combination of GLA, iodine, and selenium.<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The underlying mechanism of strengthening the TJ function by these ingredients is to relocate properly the important TJ proteins (claudin-5, occludin, and ZO-1) to the cell&#x02013;cell junction, thus preventing tissue swelling and edema, the etiology of breast nodularity.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate a nutritional liquid formulation containing GLA (1&#x02009;g from borage oil), iodine (750&#x02009;&#x003bc;g in the form of potassium iodide), and selenium (70&#x02009;&#x003bc;g in the form of sodium selenate) compared to an isocaloric, isonitrogenous liquid formula without GLA, iodine, or selenium on nodularity and cyclic breast pain in women with FBC. Both control and experimental nutritional liquid formulations were made specifically for this trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s003"><title>Study design</title><p>The study was a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled parallel-group study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Women were instructed to consume 4 fluid ounces (fl oz) liquid nutritional formula daily of the allocated intervention beginning with visit 1. Patient assessments were performed 7 to 14 days after the start of menstrual cycles 1 and 2 and 10 to 20 days after the start of cycle 3 or at study discontinuation, and included intake of allocated intervention. Self-reported breast pain was documented using an 11-point Likert scale; peak pain sum scores were obtained by adding the five highest pain scores during the most painful, consecutive 10-day period of the menstrual cycle. Use of supplemental medications(s) for control of breast pain, type of medication and number of pills, and onset and duration of menses were recorded daily using an interactive voice response system (IVRS) (ClinPhone, Inc., Nottingham, United Kingdom). Breast nodularity was determined by physical breast examination performed by a healthcare professional at screening and baseline and was scored using a validated 4-point scale (none/no nodules, few/one nodule, several nodules, or numerous nodules) that supported the evaluation of danazol.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Other clinical assessments included determination of weight, medication/dietary supplement use, and adverse events. Women evaluated their gastrointestinal tolerance and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) at cycles 1, 2, and 3. Blood was drawn at baseline and cycles 1, 2, and 3 and analyzed by Quest Diagnostics (Collegeville, PA). The protocol received approval from the appropriate site Institutional Review Board.

A central randomization approach was used to assign subjects to treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio within each study site. As the primary outcome potentially could be influenced by hormonal contraceptive use, balance on treatment groups was assured through a dynamic allocation procedure. Allocation concealment was achieved through utilization of a validated centralized randomization system (ClinPhone, Inc., Nottingham, United Kingdom).</p></sec><sec id="s009"><title>Sample size</title><p>To detect a 2-point treatment group difference in change from baseline using an 11-point Likert pain scale, a total of 222 patients would be needed with an alpha of 0.01, two-sided test, and with 95% power.

Findings from this study provide additional knowledge and experience of nonpharmacological, nutritional interventions for women with FBC and associated cyclic mastalgia. In this study, the primary endpoint was not achieved, no differences were observed between the control and experimental groups with regard to reduction in cyclic breast pain, a finding possibly attributable to a placebo effect that is commonly reported in studies of cyclic mastalgia.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In an analysis of American trials of pain medications, where patients were asked to rate their pain, patients reported that drugs relieved their pain only 9% greater than placebo.<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The placebo effect was greater than expected in this trial and women in the control group may have rated their pain lower in response to an expected treatment response.</p><p>The more promising finding in this study was a significant reduction in breast nodularity in the experimental group, in particular, a 53% decrease in the number of women with the most severe breast nodularity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>) where breast pain is shown to be the greatest. In addition, the significant correlation between nodularity and breast pain indicated that greater number of nodules was associated with higher breast pain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>). Although the reduction in nodularity may have been anticipated from prior studies of iodine in preclinical models and in women with FBC, these studies were conducted using different forms of iodine at doses substantially higher than contained in this study formula.<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Reduced nodularity was also noted in an ormeloxifene trial.<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>In the trials of active hormonal agents such as danazol<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and goserelin,<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> breast nodularity was reduced before relief of pain. It may be that the current trial is showing similar early benefits of nodularity reduction. The clinical relevance of nodularity reduction may facilitate physical breast examination for fibrocystic changes and improve the screening value of mammograms in women with severely nodular breasts. This is in line with the well-known observation that the sensitivity of screening mammography increases with age, due to the reduction in breast density with increasing age. It is interesting to note that the reduction in overall breast nodularity in the experimental group corroborated with the previous demonstration of synergistic effects of GLA, iodine, and selenium on strengthening intracellular TJ function for preventing swelling and edema, the etiology of breast nodularity.<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>Both groups of women reported a reduced need for nonprescription medications for control of their breast pain; however, in those women who continued pain medication, the women in the experimental group used significantly less pain medication by the end of the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). The greater use of pain medication by women in the control group suggests that the reduction of breast pain attributed solely to the control nutritional formulation may have been overestimated. This difference was further demonstrated when the reduction in breast pain was reported as a function of the amount of pain medication taken (or APS). It is reasonable to assume that a reduction in analgesic requirements is a surrogate for a reduction in pain.</p><p>In further evaluation of overall impression of change in pain (PGIC), women in both groups rated their breast pain similarly by the end of the study. Approximately three-quarters of the women rated their pain as &#x0201c;improved&#x0201d; and half described their condition as &#x0201c;much or very much improved.&#x0201d;</p><p>The amount of iodine in the experimental nutritional formulation was based on the tolerable upper limit (TUL) for iodine intake of 1100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g per day.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The median intake of iodine from food for women in the United States is estimated as 190&#x02013;200&#x02009;&#x003bc;g per day, with the 90th percentile at 460&#x02009;&#x003bc;g per day (NHANES III).<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Based on these estimates and with the experimental product containing 750&#x02009;&#x003bc;g of iodine per daily serving (4 fl oz), the total amount of iodine from the diet and study formula was below the TUL in majority of women in the general population. The amount of iodine in the experimental formula was also significantly less than that in other forms of iodine used in the treatment of cyclic mastalgia.<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>In general, the experimental formulation was well tolerated with no serious adverse events compared to control. Moreover, there was no significant difference in weight changes between the groups at the end of the trial. Since the experimental formulation contained approximately fourfold more iodine relative to the typical daily dietary intake, elevated TSH levels in four women attributable to the study product was largely expected. The mild transient elevation of TSH levels would be anticipated by the Wolff-Chaikoff effect that allows the human thyroid to adapt to dynamic changes in iodine intake.<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> For most women, this change in TSH would be expected to resolve with continued intake of iodine, as was observed in the study.</p><p>The limitations of the study are that women in both groups had relatively low pain scores at baseline (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), making it less likely that pain scores would be substantially further reduced and more difficult to demonstrate a separation in pain reduction between control and treatment groups; the long duration of FBC symptoms in women before study entry (means of 8.5 and 9.5 years) may have contributed to the development of a greater level of pain tolerance resulting in low levels of pain scores at baseline, which allowed women to accommodate to the discomfort or develop pain tolerance; and failure of the chosen methodology to effectively measure the symptom described as pain, despite well-documented reduction in pain medication by IVRS. Reconsideration of the appropriate control formulation for this type of study may also be required. The choice of HOSO enriched with oleic acid in the isocaloric, isonitrogenous control formulation may have contributed to the reduction in breast pain in women in the control group. Recently, oleic acid has been shown to inhibit pain response in mouse models of sepsis<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and reduce proinflammatory cytokines associated with pain in humans.<sup><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p>Strengths of the study are the intervention, which for the first time combined the two ingredients, GLA and iodine, known to reduce mastalgia; the reduction in pain medication often associated with gastrointestinal symptoms; and the observed reduction in pain medication, which is more likely to be correct than in other studies where assessment was less rigorous than IVRS, such as recall or tablet counts at the end of the month.</p><p>Recommendations for future studies with similar endpoints include enrolling women with breast pain scores of 6.0 or greater with a duration of continuous pain of no more than 1 to 2 years. A generic Likert scale for pain may not be sensitive enough for cyclic breast pain analysis. In women with FBC, the variable nature of breast pain combined with a lack of specific standardized tools for its measurement complicates clinical trial design and outcomes. Thought should be given to the development of a pain scale specific for cyclic breast pain. Reconsideration of the appropriate control formulation without high-oleic-safflower oil or standard of care should be considered for the control group. Including subjects taking oral contraceptive pills could confound the pain results. Women on oral contraception (OC) achieved nonsignificant greater reductions in pain versus women on other forms of contraception, or who were not sexually active (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). Moreover, women on OC also appeared to have numerically higher pain scores at baseline. Future studies could a priori plan to balance randomization with regard to OC and/or analyze the group taking oral contraceptive pills separately. This study was initiated before the publication of the Lucknow-Cardiff breast nodularity scale, which should be used in all future studies determining breast nodularity. Some women attending clinic seeking reassurance for absence of cancer may benefit from a cooling down period of 2 months. Inclusion of only those women whose pain perseveres with severity after 2 months may be beneficial. Consider enrolling women willing to discontinue the use of OTC pain medication during the trial.</p><p>In conclusion, women with FBC who consumed the nutritional formula with GLA, iodine, and selenium showed significantly less breast nodularity, a condition associated with less cyclic breast pain. In women who continued to use nonprescription medications for breast pain, a decrease in the quantity of nonprescription pain medication was observed. A nonpharmacological, noninvasive, well-tolerated, nutritional approach with anti-inflammatory and antipain activity and few side effects is likely to be appealing to women experiencing mastalgia. A larger study that is focused on the ability of the experimental formula to reduce nodularity and mammographic density as primary outcomes in women with FBC is warranted.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s015" sec-type="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Fibrocystic Breast Changes Nutrition Study Group (alphabetical order): Suzanne Barbier, MD, FACOG, Northwest Hospital and Medical Center, Seattle, WA; Sidney Funk, MD, Northside Hospital, Alpharetta, GA; Charles L.
