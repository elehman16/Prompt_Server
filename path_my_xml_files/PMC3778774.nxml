</p></boxed-text><p>Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a dermatological condition characterized clinically by chronic, intensely pruritic nodules and histologically by marked hyperkeratosis and acanthoses with downward projections of the epidermis. PN occurs at all ages, but mostly between 20 and 60 years. Both sexes are equally affected by PN. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the role of oral ketotifen and topical antibiotic therapy in the management of pruritus in PN patients.</p><p>The aetiology of PN remains unknown. There is uncertainty as to whether PN is a primary cutaneous disease or whether it is a pathological reaction secondary to pruritus and scratching provoked by a different cause. A variety of systemic conditions have been reported to be associated with PN, including emotional stress, anemia, hepatic dysfunction, uremia, myxoedema, venous stasis, folliculitis, nummular eczema, lympjoma, HIV infection, perforating collagenoses, gluten-sensitive enteropathy, and contact dermatitis among others.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] It has been observed that approximately 65-80% of PN patients are atopic.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Because aetiology is unknown in majority of PN cases, it is difficult to manage. PN is notoriously resistant to therapy. Once the cycle of pruritus-excoriation-pruritus begins, it is difficult to stop it. The difficulty in treating this disease is reflected in the long list of treatment options. The main issue that PN patients experience is the intense pruritus associated with the PN lesions.</p><p>Topical agents recommended for PN includes emollients, oral antihistamines, ultrapotent topical steroid, intralesional corticosteroid injections, coal tar ointment, calcipotrial ointment, capsaicin cream, cryotherapy, pulsed dye laser. Systemic treatments used for PN includes phototherapy, anti-depressants (amitriptyline/doxepin), oral steroids, azathioprine, thalidomide, ciclosporin, acitretin, and naltrexone. Whichever treatment is followed, long remission of symptoms with presently available treatment is seldom observed. The mechanism that leads to the excessive pruritus in PN lesions is not completely understood. However, recent studies have shown that mast cells play an important role in the genesis of pruritus in PN. It has been noted that mast cells in PN lesions are increased in number and show characteristic morphological changes such as an enlarged cell body size and a dendritic shape compared with the round or elongated shape observed in the normal skin.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] The PN mast cells also have an abundant cytoplasm with a decreased number of granules inside, suggesting that many of the granules have been released into the surrounding tissue.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Mast cells in PN have been observed to produce more nerve growth factor (NGF) in the lesional skins. This high level of NGF causes neural hyperplasia in the PN lesions. Subsequently, this neural hyperplasia leads to strong itching caused by increased axon firing.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Apart from neural hyperplasia, there are other mast cell products that may contribute to pruritus in PN; these include histamine, tryptase, prostaglandins, and interleucins.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] In addition to mast cells, higher level of IL-31[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] has been detected in the lesional skin of prurigo nodularis. IL-31 is pruritogenic, can induce itch in atopic individual, and is upregulated by staphyloccal superantigens. Individuals with atopic eczema (AE) have frequent colonization and infection with <italic>S. aureus</italic>. It is important to note that approximately 65-80% of N patients are atopic.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Thus, theoritically, by preventing mast cell degranulation and by controlling PN infection, lesions by <italic>S. aureus</italic> may allow downregulation of pruritus in PN.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This study was a randomized, controlled, single-blind, parallel, 4-week study conducted in a dermatology clinic. Out of a total of 11342 skin patients who attended the dermatology clinic between August 2010 and August 2011, 51 PN patients (age range: 18-58 years) with personal/family history of atopy and raised IgE level were recruited by the investigator. Participant with recent or present history of worm infestation were excluded from the study. Pregnant and lactating women were not included in this study. Blinding was performed by the investigator. The trial was planned in a manner that the participants were unaware of whether they belonged to the study group or the control group. Concealment in allocation was not performed. The study was explorative and no sample size calculation was made. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board. A valid written consent was obtained from each patient.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Procedure</title><p>Skin swab were obtained from the skin lesions and dispatched for culturing (in nutrient agar media) and anti-microbial sensitivity testing for every patient. The PN lesions were located mainly on the extremities (<italic>n</italic> = 26), extremities and back (<italic>n</italic> = 23), and extremities and face (<italic>n</italic> = 2). Out of 51 patients, 27 showed growth of <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Patients who had positive growth of <italic>S. aureus</italic> were randomly divided into two groups. Randomization was performed (by a neutral person, not the investigator) by using a table of random numbers, and the participants were randomly allocated to one of the two groups: Study group orcontrol group. The allocation ratio was 1.07:1, i.e., approximately 1:1.</p><p>

Nine of 14 patients (64.28%) had complete relief from pruritus at the end of the first week. Patients were able to discontinue the oral hydroxyzine completely. This improvement was maintained until the end of 4 weeks in all 9 patients. Another patient had complete relief from pruritus by the end of third week and he was able to discontinue oral hydroxyzine. In the remaining 4 patients, pruritus was much reduced and they took oral hydroxyzine only on need basis.</p><p>On the other hand, only mild to moderate reduction in the intensity of pruritus in the skin lesions of all participants were noted by the end of first week in the control group. However, no further reduction in the level of pruritus were noted in the participants and the patients had to continue with oral hydroxyzine on demand basis during the trial period.</p><p>The present study is the first study of its kind. In this study, effort was made to reduce the severity of pruritus in PN patients by promoting oral ketotifen therapy with topical antibiotic to the patients.</p><p>Ketotifen is a second-generation noncompetitive H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamine and mast cell stabilizer. It has been successfully used in the management of asthma and atopic allergies because of its mast cell stabilizing property. It is important to note that low dose of ketotifen was used in this present study. In addition to ketotifen, anti-<italic>S. aureus</italic> antimicrobial topical agents were used based on the culture-sensitivity report. The purpose of these two was to reduce the intensity of pruritus in PN lesions by (1) preventing mast cell degranulation through oral ketotifen therapy and (2) by controlling infection caused by <italic>S. aureus</italic> through the topical application of anti-<italic>S. aureus</italic> antibiotics.</p><p>This study showed that oral ketotifen, even in a low dose of 1 mg/day and topical antibiotic therapy was helpful in the management of pruritus in PN patients. The treatment was well tolerated by the patients and the adverse reactions of drugs were minimal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study showed that oral ketotifen and topical antibiotic therapy can be helpful in the management of pruritus in PN patients. However, the present study is a single-blind, clinic-based study, and the study group is small.
