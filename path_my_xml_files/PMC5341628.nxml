Because of the restrictive ventilatory effects of obesity, these patients often show arterial hypercapnia, hypoxemia, and ventilation&#x02013;perfusion mismatch.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] An increase in the intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) to a variable degree is an additional factor worsens the ventilation during the procedure of abdominoplasty.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>The operation of abdominoplasty is usually carried out under general anesthesia. The use of volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) is common despite frequently seen high-pressure levels in obese patients. This high airway pressure may lead to volutrauma, barotrauma, and biotrauma. The mechanical consequences of reduced lung compliance and chest wall compliance, added to the reduction of functional residual capacity due to increased IAP explain impaired alveolar ventilation and the high airway pressures in those patients.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) is a time-cycled mode in which square waves of pressure are applied and released using a decelerating flow. The decelerating flow often results in a higher mean inflation pressure when compared with the constant flow of VCV. PCV has been proposed as an alternative to VCV in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome and in obese patients to achieve adequate oxygenation and normocapnia.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Evidence has been accumulating that PCV compared with VCV during anesthesia for bariatric surgery improves gas exchanges without increasing ventilation pressures or causing any hemodynamic side effects.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The aim of this study was to compare the use of PCV before and after VCV on respiratory mechanics and hemodynamics during abdominoplasty operations for obese patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>P<sc>atients and</sc> M<sc>ethods</sc></title><p>This prospective randomized study was carried out in Mansoura university hospital included forty patients American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical Status I and II subjected to abdominoplasty. Approval of the study protocol was obtained from the institutional ethics committee, and all patients gave written informed consent before the operation. Inclusion criteria were age between 25 and 50 years old and body mass index (BMI) 30&#x02013;45 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. All patients were randomly allocated in two equal groups (twenty patients each) by closed envelope method according to the intraoperative ventilatory strategy.</p><p>Exclusion criteria for this study were patient refusal, ASA physical Status III and IV, history of obstructive sleep apnea, and BMI below 30 or above 45 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Patients with any cardiac dysfunction, respiratory problems, renal, and hepatic dysfunctions were excluded from the study. Intraoperative exclusion criteria were inability to perform tracheal intubation in the conditions of usual practice, inability to maintain stable mechanical ventilation settings for 30 min, inability to maintain an appropriate end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (EtCO<sub>2</sub>), and inability to remove the tracheal tube in the operating room. The day before the operation, complete medical history, complete clinical examination, routine investigations (complete blood count, electrocardiogram [ECG], liver function, random blood glucose, serum creatinine, and coagulation profile), chest X-ray, and echocardiography were done.</p><p>After an overnight fasting, the patients were transferred to the anesthesia room and were premedicated with midazolam 0.03 mg/kg and metoclopramide 10 mg intravenous (IV) after insertion of 20-gauge IV cannula preoperatively, 2 h before the induction of anesthesia. In the operating room, following application of routine monitors (noninvasive blood pressure [NIBP], heart rate [HR], SpO<sub>2,</sub> and ECG), epidural catheter was inserted for intra- and post-operative pain control by injection of 8&#x02013;12 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine (marcaine vial 0.5%, AstraZeneca, Australia) via median approach at level L3-L4.</p><p>An arterial sample was obtained for arterial blood gases (ABGs) analysis as basal values. NIBP (mean), HR, and SpO<sub>2</sub> were recorded just before the induction of general anesthesia as a basal guideline.</p><p>Induction of general anesthesia was done by preoxygenation with 100% oxygen for 5 min, 1 &#x000b5;g/kg fentanyl followed by 2 mg/kg propofol mixed with 2 ml lidocaine 2% was injected to induce unconsciousness. The endotracheal tube was inserted using the direct laryngoscope after 1 mg/kg succinylcholine and its correct position was confirmed by EtCO<sub>2</sub> curves with the capnography monitoring. Maintenance of anesthesia was done using one minimum alveolar concentration isoflurane. Loading dose of 0.5 mg/kg atracurium was used to maintain adequate muscle relaxation then incremental doses of one-fifth of loading dose when was needed. Controlled ventilation through the operation was done as follows: Group I (P-V): started with PCV until the plication of rectus muscle changes into VCV through postplication period till the end of surgery. Group II (V-P): started with VCV until the plication of rectus muscle changes into PCV through postplication period till the end of surgery.</p><p>PCV parameters were as follows: tidal volume (V<sub>t</sub>): P<sub>plateau</sub> has been set so that V<sub>t</sub> = 10 ml/kg ideal weight (50 + [0.91 &#x000d7; (height in cm&#x02212;152.4)] for men and 45.5 + [0.91 &#x000d7; (height in cm&#x02212;152.4)] for women), respiratory rate (RR) = 12/min, the ratio of inspiratory-to-expiratory time (I: E) = 1:2, FiO<sub>2</sub> = 0.5, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) = 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. VCV parameters were as follows: V<sub>t</sub> = 10 ml/kg ideal weight, RR = 12/min, I: E = 1:2, FiO<sub>2</sub> = 0.5, and PEEP = 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. Plateau time was 20% of inspiratory time allowing the ventilator to measure plateau pressure.</p><p>Continuation of mechanical ventilation has been done according to EtCO<sub>2</sub>, if &#x0003c;40 mmHg decrease RR by 2/min every 5 min till 10/min, decrease V<sub>t</sub> by 1 ml/kg in VCV or decrease P<sub>plateau</sub> by 2 cm H<sub>2</sub>O every 5 min till V<sub>t</sub>6 ml/kg in PCV. If EtCO<sub>2</sub> was more than 40 mmHg increase RR by 2/min every 5 min till 18/min, increase V<sub>t</sub> by 1 ml/kg every 5 min till V<sub>t</sub>12 ml/kg in VCV or increase P<sub>plateau</sub> by 2 cm H<sub>2</sub>O in PCV (P<sub>Plateau</sub> limited to 40 cm H<sub>2</sub>O). If EtCO<sub>2</sub> still high adjust parameter as RR at 25/min, V<sub>t</sub> between 6 and 12 ml/kg in VCV, maintain P<sub>plateau</sub> limited to 40 cm H<sub>2</sub>O in PCV, and inspiratory and expiratory flow curves have to return to zero every breath cycle.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Fluid maintenance was done using 4-2-1 rule and according to intraoperative patient need.

Nonsignificant difference in the hemodynamics and ABGs was recorded between the studied groups. Switching from VCV to PCV induced better improvement of lung mechanics than when used before VCV.</p><p>Pathophysiological changes due to obesity may complicate mechanical ventilation during general anesthesia. The ideal ventilation strategy has not yet been established, but it is expected to optimize gas exchange and pulmonary mechanics and to reduce the risk of respiratory complications.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Although patients undergoing abdominoplasty have healthy lungs, the pathophysiological changes induced by obesity make these patients prone to perioperative complications, such as hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and atelectasis.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Immediately after the induction of general anesthesia, atelectasis develops, leading to a reduction in both ventilation&#x02013;perfusion ratio and pulmonary compliance. It has been demonstrated that in anesthetized patients, P<sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub> inversely related to BMI.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Obesity is characterized by several alterations in the mechanics of the respiratory system[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] that tend to further exaggerate impairment of gas exchange.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Intraoperative respiratory changes may extend to the postoperative period and may subsequently necessitate the use of supplementary oxygen. It may also delay discharge from the postanesthesia care unit, increase the need for respiratory physiotherapy or noninvasive ventilation, and also increase the probability of ICU admission. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that obesity is a risk factor for postoperative tracheal reintubation, morbidity, and mortality.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The selection of the optimal ventilation mode or the optimal control variable of ventilation for the obese patient is of interest to most of the anesthesiologists. VCV and PCV are not different ventilatory modes but are different control variables within a mode. During VCV, airway pressure increases in response to reduced compliance, increased resistance or active exhalation, and may increase the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury. During PCV, the inspiratory flow and flow waveform are determined by the ventilator as it attempts to maintain an inspiratory pressure profile. The clinician should titrate the inspiratory pressure to the measured V<sub>t</sub>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Although previous studies showed that both modes were likely equivalent in pulmonary mechanics[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and equally suited in morbidly obese patients,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] this study showed that the respiratory mechanics were significantly better during use the of PCV after VCV. The possible explanation for our results is the different inspiratory flow wave form as PCV characterized by decelerating pattern while VCV is characterized by constant pattern. The ability of the decelerating flow waveform to distend the lung at the selected peak pressure throughout the inspiratory time was described by Davis <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] This may facilitate alveolar recruitment, enhance diffusion, allow alveolar units with slow time constants to fill while preventing over distension of normal alveoli and augment collateral ventilation.</p><p>The change in dynamic lung compliance was associated with a change in gas distribution.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] However, in isovolumetric conditions, variation of dynamic lung compliance depended not only on the elastic properties of the respiratory system but also on the resistive (flow-dependent) component of the airways and the endotracheal tube. The main disadvantage of PCV included variability in delivered V<sub>t</sub>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In contrast to VCV, PCV resulted in a smaller delivered V<sub>t</sub> when respiratory system compliance was decreased. A smaller V<sub>t</sub> might lead to atelectasis and might go undiagnosed because there is no change in peak pressure when PCV is used.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>These results are in agreement with Davis <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] who compared PCV and VCV with different flow wave form. De Beer and Gould[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] published review article about principles of artificial ventilation and mentioned the same results. In contrast, De Baerdemaeker <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] concluded in his study that both VCV and PCV appear to be equally suited in morbidly obese patients. In addition, Karcz <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] demonstrated that both modes are likely equivalent in pulmonary mechanics.</p><p>The current results showed nonsignificant difference in the hemodynamics variables (HR and mean blood pressure) between groups. This result is in agreement with De Baerdemaeker <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] who found that VCV and PCV may improve intraoperative oxygenation and respiratory system compliance without adverse hemodynamic effects.</p><p>In this study, the effects of switching between VCV and PCV on gasometry (pH, P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>, arterial-EtCO<sub>2</sub> gradient, and HCO<sub>3</sub>) showed insignificant differences between two modes. The mechanical ventilation improves oxygenation parameters in obese patients[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] during both VCV and PCV explaining the significant increase in the P<sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub> recorded in our results when compared intraoperative values with basal values.</p><p>Karcz <italic>et al</italic>. concluded in his systemic review &#x0201c;State-of-the-art mechanical ventilation&#x0201d; that both modes are likely equivalent in supporting gas exchange.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Similarly, another systemic review and meta-analysis published by Aldenkortt <italic>et al</italic>. confirmed our results and it was performed for randomized trials testing ventilation strategies in obese patients undergoing surgery. This review included all the studies that were published between 1978 and 2011 and came from 10 different countries. He concluded that intraoperative arterial oxygenation remained unchanged with PCV and VCV.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The same result was reported also by Tugrul <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] who compared PCV and VCV during one-lung anesthesia.</p><p>Alteration of IAP during abdominoplasty is another problem affecting the respiratory mechanics.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The operative technique has at least two maneuvers that result in IAP elevation: plication of the rectus muscle and flap resection.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] In this study, we found no change in respiratory dynamics regardless the type of ventilatory mode in response to change in IAP after plication of the rectus muscle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Switching from VCV to PCV is preferred to improve intraoperative oxygenation and lung
