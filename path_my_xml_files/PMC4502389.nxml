After viewing each ad, respondents were asked a series of questions about their perceptions, beliefs, attitudes, and interest in trial.

These devices provide nicotine to users in the form of an aerosol vapor, which is promoted as a reduced risk form of delivery. Awareness of e-cigarettes and other electronic nicotine delivery devices is increasing. Recent nationally representative studies conducted among the U.S. adult general population have shown that awareness of e-cigarettes has risen from approximately 40&#x000a0;% in 2010, to nearly 60&#x000a0;% in 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A survey conducted from 2010&#x02013;2011 among current and former U.S. cigarette smokers reported that 73&#x000a0;% of responders were aware of e-cigarettes, denoting a heighted awareness of these products among this population subgroup [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>The increased awareness of e-cigarettes may be linked to a corresponding increase in media presence; including ads in magazines, television, and strategic product placement of e-cigarettes in Hollywood productions. For example, e-cigarettes have been used by celebrities in commercials, print ads, movies, and television shows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Availability of e-cigarettes is also increasing in a variety of retail outlets, including gas stations, convenience stores, mall kiosks, vapor lounges, and over the Internet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition to independent e-cigarette manufacturers, the tobacco industry has also expanded their product line to include e-cigarettes (e.g., RJ Reynolds&#x02019; production of Vuse, Altria&#x02019;s production of MarkTen). Using strategies similar to those they have successfully employed in the past to market and distribute conventional cigarettes, Lorillard was the first to market Blu e-cigarettes on TV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These ads showed celebrities using e-cigarettes in places where smoking is banned by clean indoor air legislation. Manufacturer investments in advertising and marketing for e-cigarettes are increasing. Recent reports have found that advertising and marketing of e-cigarettes by e-cigarette manufacturers across all media channels exceeded $82 million in 2013 and continues to increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. With increased awareness resulting from increased exposure, Lorillard expanded the distribution of Blu electronic cigarettes to over 50,000 retailers by the fourth quarter of 2012, resulting in net sales for this time period totaling approximately $39 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>While e-cigarettes may be beneficial for individual smokers as a harm reduction device, it is yet unclear if these devices yield a positive or negative public health impact. The use of e-cigarettes as a complete replacement for conventional cigarettes or as a quit aid could result in a net public health gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, use of e-cigarettes in conjunction with cigarettes or other tobacco products, or introduction of nicotine to non-smokers would have an overall negative impact on public health. For example, a recent study conducted among a sample of U.S. adults demonstrated that current daily and non-daily smokers are more likely to concurrently use e-cigarettes than those who had never smoked cigarettes, suggesting potential for dual-use in lieu of complete substitution. The authors of this study also found that nearly one-third of current e-cigarette users are non-smokers, including both former and never users of conventional cigarettes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Evidence from multiple U.S. Surgeon General&#x02019;s reports support the notion that tobacco advertising and promotion can influence risk perception, trial, and use of tobacco products in both adults and youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Such evidence contributed to the establishment of regulations to limit tobacco advertising and marketing in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Current restrictions on tobacco advertising in the U.S. include a bans on outdoor marketing (including billboards and public transit), advertising that targets youth (including use of cartoons), sponsorship of sporting or other public events, and ads on television and radio. Although e-cigarettes are planned for regulation as a &#x02018;tobacco product&#x02019; by the Center for Tobacco Products in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), currently, e-cigarette products are not subject to the same promotional restrictions as cigarettes. (For example, e-cigarettes advertisements are currently aired on television.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] As of November 2014, at least 40 state level authorities have banned the sale of e-cigarettes to minors, and over 200 jurisdictions have amended their clean indoor air legislation to include the prohibition of e-cigarettes in places where traditional cigarette smoking is not allowed. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] Forthcoming restrictions on e-cigarettes in the U.S. could include restrictions on advertising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>While an increasing number of recently published studies have described awareness and use of e-cigarettes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], very few studies have evaluated associations between advertising and e-cigarette perceptions and interest in trial. Such studies have largely focused among the impact of advertising and trial among smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], but we are not aware of studies that have expanded this concept to include non-smokers. With the increasing number of tobacco companies expanding their product lines to include e-cigarettes, as well as the increasing number of independent e-cigarette manufacturers in the market, there is concern that increased advertising, coupled with the sharp increase in availability, may influence current tobacco users and non-users (including never and former users) to consider trial and adoption of e-cigarettes.</p><p>This pilot study aimed to explore issues related to e-cigarette advertising and the potential impact such advertisements may have on the public&#x02019;s willingness to try e-cigarettes among current smokers and non-smokers. Namely, we sought to assess whether exposure to ads for e-cigarettes or a comparison product (snus), showed differences in interest to try e-cigarettes among both cigarette smokers and non-smokers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study procedures</title><p>This web-based survey was conducted in March 2013 among cigarette smokers and non-smokers, including current users of e-cigarettes (see schema, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Sample members were recruited through a web panel managed by Global Market Insite, an organization specializing in the administration of online surveys (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lightspeedgmi.com/">http://www.lightspeedgmi.com/</ext-link>). Eligible participants answered a series of preliminary questions to confirm that they were between ages 18 and 65, current United States residents, and able to read and write in English. After determining eligibility, participants were directed to an informed consent screen, clicking a button indicating consent. Respondents completed a core series of questions adapted from a similar study assessing tobacco use, past quit attempts, use of nicotine replacement therapies, and knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about nicotine-containing products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Next, respondents were randomized to one of two exposure groups to view magazine ads for (Blu) e-cigarettes or (Camel) snus. Advertisements belonged to one of three <italic>a priori</italic> themes discerned by raters prior to survey initiation (as described below). Once a participant was randomized to a condition, they were shown nine ads for that product. Within-product presentation sequence of ads was randomized to minimize ordering effects. Participants were asked a series of questions after viewing each ad, as well as a shortened list of product attitudes used in prior research (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. After viewing all ads in their assigned group, participants were asked, &#x0201c;If we had the opportunity to send you a free sample of one of the products listed below, which of the products would you choose?&#x0201d; (response options: an e-cigarette, a tin of smokeless tobacco, a pack of cigarettes, or &#x02018;please do not send me any of these&#x02019;). At this point, participants were not explicitly made aware by the research team that they would not receive a free sample product. Following the selection of a product, participants were debriefed and informed that ethical guidelines do not allow the researchers to mail free samples of products.

To indicate favorable perceptions toward each ad, we created a summary score from selected measures: (This ad&#x02026;was important to me, made me stop and think, made me curious to know if what the ad says is true, is one I would talk to other people about, told me something new; Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.98). These measures were chosen as a result of the high internal consistency for responses to the items. For each measure, responses were scored from 0 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), then summed together. The scores for each measure were then added to create the summary score for the individual ad. The summary scores for individual ads were then grouped by each of the three ad themes (less dangerous to health than cigarettes; circumvent clean indoor air restrictions; stylish alternative to tobacco cigarettes) and totaled to create an &#x0201c;ad receptivity score&#x0201d; for that set of ads (range: 0&#x02013;75).

The findings from this pilot study suggest that exposure to advertising for e-cigarettes may enhance interest in e-cigarette trial, particularly among cigarette smokers.</p><p>In this study, participants who were exposed to e-cigarette advertising were twice as likely to have reported an intention to use e-cigarettes in the future, consistently rated their product more favorably than those exposed to snus ads, and more frequently selected e-cigarettes as their product of choice when offered a free sample product. This could be a result of e-cigarette ad exposure in general, as ads provide a mechanism to communicate awareness of this product. Yet, in our product selection task, participants exposed to snus also more frequently selected e-cigarettes as their chosen sample product, albeit not as frequently as those exposed to e-cigarette ads. We conclude that this could simply indicate a general preference toward e-cigarettes relative to snus, given that e-cigarettes are a relatively novel product. There may be aspects of e-cigarettes (in terms of construction, utility, or other factors) that may enhance appeal as a product that may reduce harm to health. Such aspects are not currently addressed by the data presented in this report, and should be studied in greater detail.</p><p>These data suggest that more favorable perceptions toward e-cigarettes existed among all participants, but particularly among current cigarette smokers, who rated e-cigarette ads, interest in trial, and attitudinal measures on e-cigarettes more favorably when compared to snus, a similarly marketed harm reduction product. Smokers exposed to either form of advertising overwhelmingly chose the e-cigarette in the product selection task, yet this was much more frequently observed among smokers in the e-cigarette condition. This product selection occurred over other options, one of which was a pack of cigarettes. Such findings may suggest that e-cigarettes, often proposed as a product that may reduce harm to health, appear to be more favorable to smokers than snus, another frequently proposed harm reduction product. These pilot data do not measure specifically why this may be the case. Snus is a smokeless tobacco product, possessing a different mode of administration for nicotine than e-cigarettes, and smokeless products currently carry health warning labels as mandated by law. Our findings also support the notion of snus posing relatively low appeal to smokers for harm reduction, as demonstrated through previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Factors that may attract smokers to certain tobacco products should be examined more closely through future research.</p><p>While we observed more favorable ad receptivity scores for e-cigarette ads compared to snus among smokers, ad receptivity for either tobacco product was relatively similar among non-smokers in both conditions. Additionally, non-smokers in our study generally did not report intention to use either of the products they were exposed to, with 6&#x000a0;% of non-smokers in each group reporting intention to try the product after viewing ads. In the product selection task, non-smokers were more likely to reject the offer of a free sample tobacco product, compared to smokers. Interestingly, a small proportion of non-smokers who did not previously report intention to try e-cigarettes prior to the offer of a free e-cigarette opted to select a free sample e-cigarette. The broader implications of these findings among non-smokers are unclear. With the limited offering of products during product selection, coupled with the absence of measures to indicate reasons for selection of a particular product or participant follow-up over time, we cannot be sure whether non-smokers in our sample chose a free tobacco product for personal use or for some other reason. Future studies should examine such reasons in greater detail.</p><p>Our data did not allude to particular advertisement themes (e.g., using e-cigarettes in non-smoking situations) having a strong association with either use intention to use or willingness to receive a free product. It could be that other elements of advertisements not addressed in this study could play a determining factor in influencing interest in these products, a few of which have been demonstrated in other studies. For example, Pepper et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] conducted a study in 2013 among a sample of smokers who have never tried e-cigarettes. The group found that ads emphasizing differences between conventional cigarettes and e-cigarettes, along with ads that showed a person using an e-cigarette, were more likely to generate interest in trying e-cigarettes among smokers than ads that did not possess those features. Future research should examine what, if any other characteristics of ads for e-cigarettes may influence use intention, actual product use, and under what circumstances these products may be used.</p><p>There are potential negative and positive public health impacts of widespread promotion and advertising of e-cigarettes. If e-cigarettes are deemed by the FDA as a potentially reduced exposure product or a smoking-cessation aid, then advertising targeted to smokers to switch to these products completely for harm reduction or cessation could be beneficial for overall public health. The data for this study showed that smokers were interested in receiving a free sample e-cigarette, regardless of advertising condition; the data also showed that 3&#x000a0;% of non-smokers in the e-cigarette condition displayed interest in trying e-cigarettes. Yet, when offered a free sample tobacco product, 25&#x000a0;% of non-smokers in the e-cigarette condition selected an e-cigarette. The current marketing environment for e-cigarettes is saturated with promotions and price discounts for these products. Such an environment could result in a greater proportion of non-tobacco users to consider trying e-cigarettes. While our data do not directly speak to increased uptake among non-tobacco users, our findings suggest low interest, and more extensive research is needed to determine the appeal of e-cigarettes to nonusers of tobacco.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Limitations</title><p>The findings from our pilot study are subject to limitations.

When compared to the U.S. general population, our sample members more frequently reported having a college degree (34&#x000a0;% sample, 29&#x000a0;% population), were more likely to identify as being White, non-Hispanic (80&#x000a0;% sample, 64&#x000a0;% population), and had higher rates of cigarette (31&#x000a0;% sample, 18&#x000a0;% population) and smokeless tobacco use (8&#x000a0;% sample, 3&#x000a0;% population) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. This affects our ability to generalize our findings to the broader population, and future research should explore this issue among a larger and more broadly generalizable sample. Yet, this sampling method also allowed us to capture more tobacco users, which is important given our findings among cigarette smokers. The sample size also limited our ability to examine these data in greater detail using multivariate modeling. An additional limitation was the use of existing advertisements for one brand of each product (Blu e-cigarettes, Camel snus). This was a result of the minimal market presence of e-cigarette advertising for other brands at the time this pilot was conducted. We cannot account for influences in intention to try that may vary based on brand loyalty, perceptions of a specific branded product, or prior exposure to the ads shown in this pilot study. As e-cigarette advertising becomes more commonplace, future studies should examine use intentions among other e-cigarette brands or other novel tobacco products. This pilot was also limited to a sample of U.S. adults aged 18 to 65. Additional research is needed to explore the impact of e-cigarette advertising and trial among a sample of youth to better inform future directions on e-cigarettes. Additionally, our study did not include baseline measures assessing attitudes about e-cigarettes or snus prior to the ads being shown to participants. Such baseline measures would have utility in better isolating effects related to product advertising or product novelty. Future studies should assess attitudes about e-cigarettes at baseline in order to better disentangle advertising effects from product attitudes. Finally, we evaluated only one form of advertising among several that exist for these types of products. However, repeated exposure to marketing through other channels and modalities may have a greater impact on perceptions, so our estimates may be lower than what may be the case for additive effects of other advertising exposures. Despite these limitations, these data are among the first we are aware of that show associations between e-cigarette advertising and interest in trial among both smokers and non-smokers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Continued promotion and advertising may peak public interest in e-cigarettes compared to snus, and may have an impact on willingness to receive promotional products or intention to try e-cigarettes. Our study found that e-cigarette advertising may influence intention to try these products, particularly among current smokers. In addition to the absence of an established safety profile and regulation on the quality of e-cigarettes, additional considerations about product advertising should be considered in developing future regulatory actions.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec19"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12971_2015_39_MOESM1_ESM.pptx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1.</label><caption><p>
