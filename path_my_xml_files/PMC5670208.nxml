The precise neural and receptor basis of these effects have not been tested in man. Employing a combination of functional MRI (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), we investigated whether the effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC), the main psychoactive ingredient of cannabis, on anxiety and on amygdala response while processing fearful stimuli were related to local availability of its main central molecular target, cannabinoid-1 (CB1) receptors in man. Fourteen healthy males were studied with fMRI twice, one month apart, following an oral dose of either delta-9-THC (10&#x02009;mg) or placebo, while they performed a fear-processing task. Baseline availability of the CB1 receptor was studied using PET with [<sup>11</sup>C]MePPEP, a CB1 inverse agonist radioligand. Relative to the placebo condition, delta-9-THC induced anxiety and modulated right amygdala activation while processing fear. Both these effects were positively correlated with CB1 receptor availability in the right amygdala. These results suggest that the acute effects of cannabis on anxiety in males are mediated by the modulation of amygdalar function by delta-9-THC and the extent of these effects are related to local availability of CB1 receptors.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Cannabis is the world&#x02019;s most commonly used illicit substance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Although most recreational users smoke cannabis for its relaxing effects, the drug has a range of adverse effects including the induction of acute anxiety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and, development of anxiety disorders in regular users<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. While these effects of cannabis are mediated by its main psychoactive constituent, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, the extract of the cannabis plant has many other ingredients, some of which e.g. Cannabidiol may have anxiolytic effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Consistent with this, and evidence that many of the behavioural effects of exogenous cannabinoids can be linked to their effects on the endocannabinoid system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, a large body of preclinical evidence has accumulated implicating different components of the endocannabinoid system in emotional processing and anxiety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Preclinical studies suggest that contradictory evidence regarding the precise effect of exogenous cannabinoids on anxiety, in terms of an anxiolytic or anxiogenic response, may be linked to dose of the cannabinoid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> as well as its site of action<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, while there is less mechanistic detail from human studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Preclinical evidence also show that delta-9-THC is a partial agonist at cannabinoid-1 (CB1) receptors, which is also the main target of endocannabinoids in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> consistent with human evidence that a single dose of CB1 receptor antagonist Rimonabant is able to block the acute subjective intoxication caused by smoked cannabis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. However, whether the effects of delta-9-THC are related to the availability of CB1 receptors in the brain has not yet been demonstrated in humans.</p><p id="Par3">We recently reported that the anxiogenic effects of delta-9-THC in humans were related to its effect on neural activity in the amygdala<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, a region that plays a critical role in mediating anxiety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and is rich in CB1 receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In contrast, another study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> reported an attenuating effect of a smaller dose of delta-9-THC on amygdala function whilst processing social signals of threat. While inconsistent in terms of the precise direction of effect, results of both these studies were consistent with evidence regarding the biphasic nature of the effects of delta-9-THC on anxiety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, and highlighted the central role of amygdala as the neural substrate mediating the effects of delta-9-THC on emotional processing in man. Using neuroanatomically localized microinjection of drugs, studies in freely moving rodents have linked anxiogenic effects of delta-9-THC to a specific CB1 receptor-dependent effect in the amygdala, while anxiolytic effects have been linked to its effects in the prefrontal cortex or hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, it is unclear whether the effects of delta-9-THC on anxiety and on amygdala function during the processing of fearful stimuli are related to local availability of the CB1 receptor in humans.</p><p id="Par4">Hence, in the present study, we investigated whether the acute effects of delta-9-THC on anxiety and on amygdala function as measured using fMRI during the processing of fear were related to availability of CB1 receptors in the amygdala in an independent sample of healthy male volunteers, with minimal previous cannabis and other illicit drug use. CB1 receptor availability was studied using PET with [<sup>11</sup>C]MePPEP, a CB1-selective, inverse agonist radioligand with high and stable brain uptake <italic>in vivo</italic>, high selectivity and specificity for CB1 receptors and good-to-excellent reproducibility on test-retest scans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Our first hypothesis was to confirm that acute administration of delta-9-THC would be associated with increased anxiety and engagement of amygdala during the processing of fearful stimuli. Our second hypothesis, which was the main focus of the present study, was that magnitude of the effects of delta-9-THC on anxiety and on amygdalar activation would be related to the local availability of CB1 receptors. We specifically predicted that there would be a direct correlation between baseline CB1 availability in the amygdala and effect of delta-9-THC on anxiety and amygdala response during the processing of fear, with greater CB1 availability being linked to greater effect of delta-9-THC on anxiety and amygdala activity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p id="Par5">This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki after obtaining approval from the Joint South London and Maudsley and Institute of Psychiatry research ethics committee and radiation protection agency (ARSAC).

This dose of delta-9-THC was chosen as it is within the range used recreationally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and previous work suggested that the dose is sufficient to produce symptomatic and neural effects without the symptomatic effects being severe enough to affect compliance with study procedures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. It is well-known that delta-9-THC has a dose-dependent effect on anxiety in man, with lower doses generally having an anxiolytic effect and oral doses of 10&#x02009;mg or higher having an anxiogenic effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. As the focus of the study was to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the symptomatic/cognitive effects of cannabis, we decided to employ a dose delta-9-THC that would induce such effects without the effects being severe enough to interfere with participation in the study. In the present study, we employed the oral route of administration because it produces consistent and reliable effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> allowing a more sustained dose of delta-9-THC than the inhaled route, which results in faster onset and more severe but shorter lasting effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Functional neuroimaging studies suggest that the effects of cannabis in the brain are comparable between studies that employ various routes of administration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Participants were tested on two occasions separated by at least one month. The order of drug administration was pseudo-randomized across subjects, so that an equal number received each of the treatment conditions during the first or second session. On the day of each session, subjects were asked to have a light standardized breakfast after an overnight fast and advised to get at least six hours sleep the night before. They were asked to refrain from smoking for 4&#x02009;hours (if relevant), caffeine for 12&#x02009;hours and alcohol for 24&#x02009;hours. All subjects had a negative urine drug screen for opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, benzodiazepines and delta-9-THC on testing before each session using immunometric assay kits. Illicit substance use was assessed using a structured clinical interview and the Addiction severity index<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Psychopathological ratings (which included level of intoxication, anxiety, positive and negative psychotic symptoms) and venous blood samples (using an indwelling intravenous catheter inserted into a subcutaneous vein in the forearm of the non-dominant arm) were obtained immediately before, and at 1, 2 and 3&#x02009;hours post drug administration. Anxiety was measured using the Spielberger state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI-S)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, positive and negative psychotic symptoms were assessed by an experienced clinician using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, while subjective intoxication was measured using the self-rated Analogue Intoxication scale (AIS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">MRI scans were acquired between 1 and 2&#x02009;hours after drug administration, as previous work indicated that an identical dose of orally administered delta-9-THC produced sustained blood levels over this period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, and that the neural and behavioral effects of delta-9-THC during the emotional (fear) processing task, and its symptomatic effects were evident within this period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

The blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) haemodynamic response was measured while subjects viewed fearful faces, which were contrasted with faces with neutral expressions, in an event-related design. Over a 6-minute period, participants viewed 60 facial stimuli in total (30 different facial stimuli each presented twice) presented for 2-seconds each, from a list of 10 different facial identities. The order of presentation of facial identities and expression type was pseudo-randomized, such that the same identity or expression type was not presented in successive trials. Subjects viewed a fixation cross during the inter-stimulus interval, which was varied from 3&#x02013;8&#x02009;seconds according to a Poisson distribution, with an average interval of 5.9&#x02009;seconds. They were asked to indicate the gender of the face by pressing one of two buttons. The speed and accuracy of responses was recorded on-line throughout image acquisition. Autonomic arousal related to the presentation of fearful faces was recorded on-line throughout image acquisition by measuring the electrodermal response (described below).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Image acquisition</title><p id="Par11">All MR images were acquired on a 1.5 Tesla Signa system (GE) at the Institute of Psychiatry, London.

The emotional (fear) processing task was studied using a TR of 2000 msec and TE of 40 msec. To facilitate anatomical localization of activation, a high-resolution inversion recovery image dataset was also acquired, with 3mm contiguous slices and an in-plane resolution of 3 mm (TR 16000 ms, TI 180 ms, TE 80 ms).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Image analysis</title><p id="Par12">fMRI data were analysed using XBAMv4 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/ioppn/depts/neuroimaging/research/imaginganalysis/Software/XBAM.aspx">http://www.kcl.ac.uk/ioppn/depts/neuroimaging/research/imaginganalysis/Software/XBAM.aspx</ext-link>), employing a non-parametric approach that we have used previously with the same paradigm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. This method does not assume a Gaussian population distribution, as such an assumption is very difficult to test in small groups with neuroimaging data and when tested, is often found to be violated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Instead, this method uses median statistics to control for outlier-effects and employs permutation rather than normal theory-based inference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. According to this method, the test statistic is computed by standardizing for individual differences in residual noise before embarking on a second-level, multi-subject testing, using robust permutation-based methods, employing a mixed-effects approach. Data from all subjects met criteria for image quality and movement (&#x0003c;1 mm displacement in any one direction) and were included for analysis. Images were realigned to correct for head motion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and smoothed with a Gaussian filter (full width at half maximum 7.2 mm). Individual activation maps were created by convolving the experimental design with two gamma variate functions to model the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response. The best fit between the weighted sum of these convolutions and the time series at each voxel was computed using the constrained BOLD effects model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Following a least squares fitting of this model, the sum of squares ratio (SSQ) was estimated at each voxel, followed by permutation testing to determine significantly activated voxels specific to each condition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. The detection of activated voxels was then extended from voxel to cluster level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. SSQ ratio maps for each individual were transformed into standard stereotactic space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> using a two-stage warping procedure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Group activation maps were computed for each treatment condition by determining the median SSQ ratio at each voxel. These maps were compared using nonparametric-repeated measures ANOVA, with a voxel-wise threshold of <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05 and the cluster-wise threshold set such that the total number of false positive clusters per brain volume was &#x0003c;1: the <italic>p</italic> value at which the latter occurred is quoted. Only areas of activation that survived this correction threshold are reported.</p><p id="Par13">The principal advantages of cluster-level testing are that it confers greater sensitivity by incorporating information from more than one voxel in the test statistic and also substantially reduces the search volume or number of tests required for a whole-brain analysis, thereby mitigating the multiple comparisons problem.</p><p id="Par14">For each treatment condition (delta-9-THC and placebo), we contrasted the active task (fearful faces) condition against the baseline (neutral faces) condition to identify the brain regions engaged by the processing of fear.

The principal findings of this study are that a modest dose of delta-9-THC resulted in the acute induction of anxiety symptoms in the healthy volunteers studied here and the severity of anxiety induced by delta-9-THC was directly correlated with the baseline availability of CB1 receptors in the amygdala, a region that has been linked to anxiety and fear processing both in health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, and under the influence of delta-9-THC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Furthermore, these symptomatic effects of delta-9-THC were associated with enhanced engagement of the amygdala and adjoining hippocampus during the processing of fearful facial stimuli and this effect of delta-9-THC on amygdala activation was directly correlated with the availability of CB1 receptors in the same region. Although the amygdala has previously been implicated as the substrate mediating the effects of delta-9-THC on emotion in man<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, the precise nature of these effects and their molecular underpinnings were unclear. This is the first evidence that the effects of delta-9-THC on anxiety and on the physiological response of amygdala, a key neural substrate for anxiety during the automatic processing of fearful stimuli in humans are related to the local availability of CB1 receptors and is consistent with independent recent evidence suggesting greater CB1 receptor availability throughout the brain including amygdala in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) relative to healthy controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup> and an association between amygdala CB1 receptor availability and attentional bias to threat and threat-related symptoms in those presenting with trauma-related psychopathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. It is also consistent with evidence that direct administration of delta-9-THC to the amygdala in rats induces fearful behaviors, whilst CB1 receptor blockade using an inverse agonist has the opposite effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Moreover, this relationship between the effects of delta-9-THC and the availability of CB1 receptors appeared to be both region- and symptom-specific. It was not evident in other brain areas, in line with reports that in rodents, application of delta-9-THC to the amygdala, but not the prefrontal cortex or hippocampus, induces fearful behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Similarly, neither the response to fearful faces nor CB1 availability in the amygdala were related to other phenomena induced by delta-9-THC, such as psychotic symptoms, consistent with evidence that application of delta-9-THC to the amygdala in rats is associated with fearful behaviours, but not hyperlocomotion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, a feature of animal models of psychosis. However, it is worth noting that within individual binding of [<sup>11</sup>C]MePPEP is strongly correlated between various brain regions. Hence, it is possible that the association observed between amygdala CB1 receptor availability and the effects of delta-9-THC may be secondary to association with whole brain CB1 receptor availability rather than reflecting a specific association with the amygdala, which merits investigation in future studies with larger samples.</p><p id="Par40">Acute and transient symptoms similar to that induced by delta-9-THC in the present study have also been reported in the context of recreational cannabis use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup> and in experimental studies involving the administration of delta-9-THC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> in healthy human volunteers. However, doses of orally administered delta-9-THC lower than that used here, have been associated with either a reduction in anxiety or no clear anxiogenic/relaxing effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. It is well known that there is a great deal of variability in the effects of delta-9-THC or cannabis in a given individual. While a number of different factors, in particular genetically mediated differential sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, dose of delta-9-THC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, and the presence of other cannabinoids such as Cannabidiol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, are likely to contribute to this variability between different individuals in their response to cannabis, results of the present study suggest that baseline availability of CB1 receptors, the central molecular target of delta-9-THC, may also partly explain differential sensitivity to the anxiety experienced under the influence of cannabis.</p><p id="Par41">While making a gender decision during the event-related implicit fear processing fMRI task, participants performed comparably across the two drug treatments as well as emotional valence conditions, suggesting that they were attending to the task stimuli across all conditions. Across drug conditions, response latency was faster for neutral faces relative to fearful faces consistent with previous studies employing negative facial stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Shorter response latency to all facial stimuli while making a gender decision under delta-9-THC is consistent with evidence of faster responding under its influence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Consistent with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>, there was no significant interaction between drug treatment and emotional valence on response latency. Hence, any effects of delta-9-THC on neural (BOLD response) or electrodermal (SCR) measures are unlikely to be related to its effect on performance or attention during the task. Viewing fearful faces was associated with increase in SCR fluctuations suggesting that the fearful faces were indeed associated with changes in measures of autonomic arousal characteristic of anxiety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. Effect of delta-9-THC on amygdala engagement while processing fearful stimuli were directly related to its effect on a concomitantly recorded arousal measure (SCR fluctuations) linked to the presentation of fearful stimuli. Enhanced engagement of amygdala while processing fearful faces relative to neutral faces under the influence of delta-9-THC as noted in the present study is however different from its attenuating effect on amygdala reactivity during the processing of a different set of negative emotional stimuli as previously reported by Phan <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Use of a lower, and hence potentially anxiolytic dose of delta-9-THC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup> as well as an explicit emotion processing task [linked to attenuation of amygdala activity] employed by Phan and colleagues, unlike the present study may partly explain this. Additionally, they<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> compared threatening (angry/fearful) with non-threatening (happy) facial stimuli, which may have resulted in a greater effect of the lower dose of delta-9-THC during the control condition (happy faces) compared to the active (angry/fearful faces) condition, thereby resulting in the attenuation of amygdala response. Consistent with this, they also reported that amygdala reactivity to happy faces was greater under the influence of delta-9-THC relative to the placebo condition when they employed a different control task (matching geometric shapes), which was interpreted as indicative of the pro-social effects of delta-9-THC, unlike the anxiogenic dose employed in the present study.</p><p id="Par42">It is worth noting that in the present study there was greater amygdala engagement in response to neutral faces relative to fearful faces under placebo condition. Engagement of amygdala whilst making a gender decision in response to neutral faces is consistent with a prominent role for amygdala in adaptive social behaviours such as face perception and evaluation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. While the relatively lesser amygdala engagement to fearful faces under placebo condition may appear counterintuitive, it is perhaps not entirely unexpected, as the probability of amygdala activation is lower whilst performing emotion-processing tasks requiring additional effort, such as making a gender decision<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup> linked to inhibitory effect of prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex on amygdala function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par43">Another important aspect of the present results relate to the right lateralization of the neural effects of delta-9-THC. While not predicted <italic>a priori</italic>, it is consistent with a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and in accordance with current understanding regarding hemispheric lateralization of emotional processing with unconscious processing of emotional stimuli (as required in the present study) in the right amygdala and a more conscious processing of emotion in the left amygdala<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup> and evidence from meta-analyses of neuroimaging studies of emotional processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. Lateralization of emotional processing has been shown to be more prominent in men than in women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup> and the present study involved only male participants. Another issue that is worth noting in this context relates to our previous cannabinoid challenge fMRI study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, where we observed net activation in the left amygdala under the placebo condition using the same fear processing task in contrast to the net deactivation in right amygdala under placebo condition observed in the present study. In the previous study our analysis aimed to selectively identify brain areas where the effects of delta-9-THC and Cannabidiol were in the opposite direction relative to the placebo condition for each task condition studied there, including the fear processing task. Hence, it is very likely that difference in left amygdala activation between the drug conditions observed in that study was driven by the effect of Cannabidiol, which was observed in the left amygdala when it was contrasted directly with the placebo condition, as we have also reported in a related study investigating the same dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In contrast, in the present study, we have directly compared the effects of delta-9-THC and placebo (as opposed to carrying out a 3-condition analysis) in a separate group of healthy volunteers whilst processing fearful compared to neutral faces. This may underlie the difference in lateralization of fear processing observed under the placebo condition in the two studies, driven by differences in the brain effects of Cannabidiol, an anxiolytic and delta-9-THC, having anxiogenic effects. The difference in the direction of effects in the two amygdalae under placebo may reflect greater right amygdala activity in response to neutral faces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup> as well as faster habituation of right amygdala activity compared to the left<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup> and is consistent with evidence suggesting that while the left amygdala functions as a specific detector<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup> and sustained evaluator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup> of fearful faces, the right amygdala functions more as a non-specific detector of change initiating a rapid, automatic but general level of response to all types of facial stimuli (whether neutral or fearful)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. To summarize, while the amygdala lateralization difference between the two studies using the same fMRI paradigm are likely a result of differences between the effects of CBD and delta-9-THC (which have opposing effects on anxiety), differences in the net effects in the amygdalae under placebo condition in these two studies likely reflect inherent differences in their role in the processing of fearful and other facial stimuli.</p><p id="Par44">However, the results of the present study need to considered together with certain caveats. It is particularly important to note that the interval between PET and fMRI scan acquisition was 25.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;16.9 months. Multi-modal imaging studies such this, especially those that also involve pharmacological challenge are logistically complex. The rather long delay between the two types of imaging in the present study was also a result of delays in securing funding, obtaining necessary regulatory approval and delays in the production of the PET tracer that passed quality control as well as in securing PET scanning slots. As the stability/variability of CB1 receptor levels in man over such long periods is unclear, arguably, this may be a particular concern given the relatively high test-retest variability of [<sup>11</sup>C]MePPEP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>. For example, using rank-shaping regularization of spectral analysis, the median test-retest variability of [<sup>11</sup>C]MePPEP has been reported to be at least 14% (ranging from &#x02212;48.5 to 34.9%) when scans were repeated a median of 24 days apart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>. Other work has also pointed towards high between-subject variability of<sup>11</sup>C]MePPEP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. However, it is worth noting that any such variability is more likely than not to have resulted in increased noise and thereby weakened the association between CB1 receptor V<sub>T</sub> and the effects of delta-9-THC on symptoms (anxiety) and brain activation (amygdala BOLD signal). Furthermore, variability in CB1 receptor V<sub>T</sub> as measured using PET may not necessarily reflect variability in CB1 receptor density over time, but may also be related to the specific tracer. The test-retest variability of the volume of distribution (V<sub>T</sub>) of [<sup>11</sup>C] ligands measured with PET in humans with current scanning technology varies between 6% in medium to large cortical areas, for well characterized tracers, to 12% in less well characterized ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>. Hence, median variability of 14% as in the case of [<sup>11</sup>C]MePPEP is particularly at the higher end for PET radioligands. However, the intra-class correlation coefficient on [<sup>11</sup>C]MePPEP data analyzed with some form of spectral analysis, and rank shaping in particular that is better able to control the variance given the very slow kinetic of the tracer, on average is greater than 0.8, which makes [<sup>11</sup>C]MePPEP a very sensitive/accurate PET ligand perfectly suitable for the experimental design that we have employed here. In light of above, whilst it is very unlikely that the interval between fMRI and PET systematically affected the direction of our results, we cannot completely rule out this possibility. Hence, future studies may need to employ simultaneous PET-MR designs to acquire such data.</p><p id="Par45">A further consideration while interpreting these results relate to challenges in accurately delineating the amygdala despite the use of label-based maximum probability atlas that we have employed in this study for the anatomic parcellation of V<sub>T</sub> maps. This is further compounded by limitations imposed by MRI scanner resoultion particularly on the delineation of smaller structures such as the amygdala. However, it is worth noting that while these effects may have affected absolute CB1 quantification in the amygdala, this would have affected all participants in an identical manner rather than introduced any systematic bias and hence is unlikely to have affected the direction of the association between CB1 V<sub>T</sub> and effects of delta-9-THC on anxiety and the BOLD signal reported here. It also worth noting that we did not correct the results of our correlational analyses for multiple comparisons. However, it is important to note that we had two specific hypotheses based on previous literature regarding the relationship between CB1 availability and effects of delta-9-THC on anxiety and amygdala activation, which we tested in our correlational analyses, focusing specifically on the right amygdala as that is where the acute effect of delta-9-THC was observed using fMRI whilst processing fearful faces. As these were hypothesis-driven correlational analyses and not strictly independent because they examine the relationship between CB1 V<sub>T</sub> in the same brain region (amygdala) with two different effects produced by the same intervention (effect of delta-9-THC on brain activation and anxiety), we have not corrected them nor the post-hoc correlational analyses for multiple comparisons.</p><p id="Par46">While one may question the generalizability of these results as street cannabis has many different ingredients, unlike pure delta-9-THC administered here, it must be noted that delta-9-THC produces subjective effects similar to that of an extract of the cannabis plant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>. Generalizability of these results in occasional cannabis users to regular cannabis users may also be questioned in light of evidence of downregulation of CB1 receptors across several cortical regions in chronic cannabis users relative to control subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup>. While alteration of CB1 receptor availability is definitely likely to affect the acute behavioural and neural response to cannabis in regular users, results reported here provide preliminary evidence that, if replicated in independent samples, may explain variable sensitivity to the adverse effects experienced by regular users when they start experimenting with cannabis, as well as the huge majority of individuals who only use it occasionally and never go on to use regularly. Furthermore, one needs to be careful in terms of generalizing these results to those with anxiety disorders, as cannabis is often used in an attempt to seek relief from anxiety, unlike the relationship with anxiogenic effects tested here. It is important to also recognize that we tested only males and gender difference in the effects of cannabinoids is well-recognized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup> and have also been demonstrated recently with regard to CB1 availability in both healthy individuals and those with PTSD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Another caveat relates to the use of V<sub>T</sub> to quantify binding of [<sup>11</sup>C]MePPEP to CB1 receptors, as it incorporates both specific as well as non-displaceable binding. While directly estimating binding potential (BP<sub>ND</sub>), a measure of specific binding would have been ideal, this has not been possible for CB1 receptors to date<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup> owing to lack of a brain region devoid of CB1 receptors that may be suitable for use as a reference region. A previous attempt to use the Pons, a region with relatively low CB1 receptor concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> as a pseudo-reference region yielded inconsistent and unreliable results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Hence, the most definitive way to address this issue would entail a blocking study in man using a selective CB1 receptor antagonist. However, such data are currently unavailable owing to lack of availability of a selective antagonist suitable for human experimentation. Animal studies however suggest high specific binding with values of over 85% in the monkey brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par47">Notwithstanding these caveats, the present multimodal imaging study firstly demonstrates that a single modest dose of delta-9-THC induced transient anxiety symptoms in healthy volunteers with minimal previous expsoure to cannabis and that this effect was associated with its effect on two concomitantly acquired physiological parameters linked to autonomic arousal and anxiety measured while processing fearful stimuli, fluctuations in skin conductance and amygdala BOLD response as evident using a robust whole-brain image analysis approach, which themselves correlated with each other. Finally, this study links both the symptomatic and neural effects of delta-9-THC to the baseline availability of its main central molecular target. Together, these findings suggest that the anxiogenic effects of cannabis in humans are mediated by CB1 receptors in the amygdala. This raises the possibility that the endogenous cannabinoids that normally act on these receptors play a role in modulating anxiety, independent of cannabis use. The endocannabinoid system thus represents a logical pharmacological target for the development of novel treatments for anxiety disorders.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Oliver D.
