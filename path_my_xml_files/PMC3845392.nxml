<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> Research also shows that perceived stress decreases following participation in a mindfulness intervention, with the decrease maintained at follow-up (between 1 and 3&#x02005;months).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20 R21 R22 R23">20&#x02013;23</xref></p><p>Although there are helpful interventions available for stress, anxiety and depression, it has been observed that the National Health Service (NHS) cannot handle the need for mental health resources in the UK.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> The availability of mindfulness courses across the UK is variable, with lengthy NHS waiting lists only serving certain health problems, such as recurrent depression or chronic fatigue syndrome. Private courses can be expensive, ranging between &#x000a3;200 and &#x000a3;350. There are numerous other reasons why people may be unable to attend a course such as disability, childcare, course location and the times that the courses are available.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> Online interventions are being created and studied to provide helpful mental health resources which may be inaccessible otherwise. By offering treatment via the internet, providers are delivering interventions with reduced cost to the health services and patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> and allowing the provision for patients to complete courses in their own comfortable, familiar surroundings.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>

Although previous studies have found that an online mindfulness course can decrease anxiety and depressive symptoms, so far no research has examined the change in a non-clinical sample using an online mindfulness course based directly on MBSR and MBCT courses. This study presents a follow-up of our earlier study on an online mindfulness course that examined change in perceived stress.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref> It extends our previous study by examining the effect of the course on depression and anxiety symptoms, benchmarking the effects against other studies by using measures that are now widely used in primary care practices in the UK. More significantly, these measures are used in the IAPT initiative, a major roll-out project in England that supports the NHS in implementing National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines for people suffering from depression and anxiety disorders by offering a realistic and routine first-line treatment.</p><p>Although the mechanisms of change at work in mindfulness interventions are unclear, many researchers agree that the meditation practices taught during mindfulness courses cultivate awareness and acceptance, which lower levels of anxiety, depression and stress.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref> This seems logical when a greater level of trait mindfulness equates to lower levels of stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref> and when larger amounts of practice increase trait mindfulness and decrease low mood.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> However, there are mixed results when investigating the amount of mindfulness practice as a mediator of change. Other investigations of face-to-face mindfulness courses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref> and an online course<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref> have reported that a greater amount of meditation practice is associated with greater decreases in stress, but we did not find this in our preliminary investigation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref> The study gives the opportunity to re-examine whether the amount of practice mediates degree of change in outcome, using a larger sample size where it should be easier to detect a significant effect if it is present.</p><p>The hypotheses are (1) that perceived stress, anxiety and depression will significantly decrease at course completion, (2) that the decrease will be maintained at follow-up; that is, the size of the change at follow-up will remain significantly different from pretest levels, (3) that participants who practice more will have a larger decrease in negative mood and (4) that the decrease will be comparable to other types of intervention. The time taken to complete the course will also be explored for any effect on the outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Method</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Study participants were self-referrals to an online mindfulness course. Participation in the online course was on a self-pay basis. Self-report data were collected prior to the start of the course and there was an opportunity to give feedback 1&#x02005;month after course completion. Consent for participant data to be used for course audit and research was taken when registering for the online course as part of the terms and conditions (see online supplementary appendix 1).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Procedure</title><p>The online intervention was a modified mindfulness course comprising elements of MBSR and MBCT. The online course costs &#x000a3;60 (&#x0223c;US$90), and follows the same class sequence as the 8-week mindfulness course. The course is run by the Mental Health Foundation and Wellmind Media and was developed in conjunction with leading UK mindfulness instructors. The participants access instructional videos which guide the formal meditations through the website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bemindfulonline.co.uk">http://www.bemindfulonline.co.uk</ext-link>).</p><p>The online course consists of 10 interactive sessions led by two mindfulness instructors, one male and one female. Participants learn to use formal meditation skills (body scan, mindful movement, sitting meditation, 3&#x02005;minute breathing space) and informal mindfulness techniques (incorporating mindfulness into daily activities, such as mindful eating) through videos, assignments and emails. The course lasts for a minimum of 4&#x02005;weeks, depending on when participants are able to complete the practice and homework logs. Participants are able to have a break from the course and receive email reminders to continue from the point at which they last participated.</p><p>Participants were asked to practice one formal meditation exercise using the audio and video clips supplied and one informal practice every day of the week (or as much as they can), plus one extra practice or task. For example, during week 1 participants are guided in the use of the body scan and asked to practice this during the following week as well as eating a meal &#x02018;mindfully&#x02019; and bringing awareness to a chosen activity, such as brushing teeth. There was no contact with a mindfulness teacher or other course participants.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Measures</title><p>Perceived stress using the PSS,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref> anxiety using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref> and depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref> were measured before the course, immediately on completion and at 1&#x02005;month follow-up.</p><sec id="s2d"><title>Perceived stress</title><p>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref> is a widely used and validated scale which measures how much the individual perceives events as uncontrollable and overwhelming during the previous month.

For analysis, practice scores were calculated for formal practice on a scale from 1 (Every Day) to 4 (Never). Informal practice responses were converted in the same way where 1 was &#x02018;Yes&#x02019; or &#x02018;Always&#x02019;, 3 was &#x02018;Sometimes&#x02019; and 4 was &#x02018;No&#x02019; or &#x02018;Never&#x02019;. Practice scores were averaged across informal and formal practice and across weeks 1 to 4, producing a mean practice score ranging between 1 and 4, with 1 equating to the participant practicing as much as possible and 4 equating to no practice. Participants were grouped according to level of practice into those who practiced 0 to 2 (Every Day or Most Days), 2.01 to 3 (Sometimes) and 3.01 to 4 (Rarely or Never).

Earlier studies had shown promise, but had not examined the change in these variables in a non-clinical sample using an online mindfulness course based directly on MBSR and MBCT courses. This study was also the first, to our knowledge, to evaluate the amount of practice as a mediator of change with a mindfulness course delivered in this mode.</p><p>The people choosing to use the course in this mode of delivery appear to be finding it helpful. That the levels of negative emotion reduced significantly on completion of the online mindfulness course and further decreased at 1&#x02005;month follow-up is suggestive of significant improvements. People with higher levels of stress, anxiety and depression self-reported less practice and took longer to complete the course. A longer course time predicted less of a change in stress, anxiety and depression. More mindfulness practice significantly improved stress, anxiety and depression outcome when accounting for baseline severity.</p><p>The current study does have limitations. First, there is no control comparison so although negative mood decreases significantly, we cannot be sure that the course was responsible. There may be other reasons why stress, anxiety and depression decreased over this period of time; it may be due to regression to the mean. The sample consisted of people who completed the course and follow-up, so there may be bias; however, the sample did include people who had not finished the course but still logged on to report their follow-up.</p><p>Second, clinical status was not assessed. Participants who were feeling more stressed, depressed and anxious at baseline may have been suffering from particular disorders, making them less motivated, therefore practicing less and taking longer to complete the course. One of the benefits of this online course is anonymity, so the only data requested are date of birth, gender, measures and self-report practice. The current research suggests that a self-referred (and therefore perhaps more motivated) non-clinical sample of participants who are &#x02018;highly stressed&#x02019;, &#x02018;moderately depressed&#x02019; and &#x02018;moderately anxious&#x02019; do benefit from the course, but we do not yet know how beneficial the course would be for samples with particular disorders or clinical symptoms or who are referred by clinicians. Self-referral and willingness to pay for a course may make these study outcomes less generalisable for the UK where people do not have to pay, but more generalisable to other health systems in the world.</p><p>Finally, self-reported practice may not be accurate. That the course can be taken at a preferred pace is beneficial, but means that the weekly reported practice levels may not reflect how much actual practice is being completed; for example, the total amount of practice may be higher for those who completed the course over a longer time period. In future, it might be beneficial to ask more specifically about whether practice was completed in minutes or a number of days, or to collect the data for when participants completed practice logs so that the time they spent on each week could be determined. This information was unavailable at the time of this investigation but is something which could be implemented in future.</p><p>Despite these limitations, it is encouraging that the changes in perceived stress, anxiety and depression are comparable to other online interventions, to mindfulness courses delivered in person and to IAPT interventions. This result is surprising as having group and therapist interaction during a course is expected to be an important factor in recovery. Yet the comparative large effect sizes may be actually due to the mode of delivery, whereby those participants signing up to an online course of their own accord prefer to access the mindfulness exercises from their homes or other familiar surroundings, enabling them to use the learned skills in situations where they might be more readily recalled and more effectively used. That there was a further significant decrease in negative mood 1&#x02005;month on is encouraging and suggests continued use of the skills learnt.</p><p>Participants who were more stressed, depressed and anxious at baseline tended to practice less and take more time to complete the course. These participants may have been less motivated and less able to complete the exercises in the weekly time frames because of their low mood. This result contrasts with our previous preliminary study where participants who were more stressed tended to practice more. It is unclear why the result differs from the previous finding, except that these are two different samples, recruited at different time points and with different advertising. When the second sample was signing up to the course, the website was more popular, so perhaps more people tried it who actually felt too low to complete the course or do as much practice as their healthier counterparts. However, despite the lower levels of practice, these participants had outcomes comparable to those who practiced more.</p><p>In conclusion, the results for the effectiveness and feasibility of this online mindfulness course look promising. The mode of delivery seems to be an acceptable way of completing a mindfulness course and appears to decrease stress, anxiety and depression. That the effects shown compare to those found for mindfulness courses delivered in person shows potential for future internet interventions delivered to those otherwise unable to receive helpful interventions. Further research is warranted to investigate the mechanisms of change, to examine the change compared to a control group and compared to face-to-face mindfulness interventions and to explore potential benefits for other populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e154" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003498.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e155" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003498.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Richard Latham and Scott King of Wellmind Media Ltd, for their help in developing the online intervention, and Paul Bristow of the Mental Health Foundation, for his continued support.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> EC and MW contributed to the first draft, which was written by AK.
