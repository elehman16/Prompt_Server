Atorvastatin was manufactured by Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, Inc.(trade name Lipitor) and was administered orally to the patients for at least 12 months until completion of the second clinical visit. There were 21 patients with TIA and 99 patients with cerebral infarction. All patients were diagnosed with dyslipidemia with 75 cases of hypertension, 23 cases of diabetes and 49 cases of smoking history. The body mass index (BMI) was (23.41 &#x000b1; 2.05) kg / m<sup>2</sup>, LDL- HDL-C (3.95 &#x000b1; 0.21) mmol / L and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (7.31 &#x000b1; 0.65) mg /l.

Drug was administered to control the blood pressure and blood sugar in patients with hypertension and diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical follow-up</title><p>Periodic follow-up, clinical follow-up, and clinical end points were assessed by full-time neurologists. The cerebrovascular end point events recorded included cerebral infarction and TIA. CTP was performed 1 week after the end of cerebrovascular event and 12 months after the administration of statin drug. Some patients underwent CTA examination at the same time.</p></sec><sec><title>CTP Examination</title><p>Examination methods: GE's 64-layer Light speed VCT scanner was used. Scanning parameters: 120 Kv, 300 &#x0223c; 350 mA, pitch 0.984, layer thickness 0.625 mm. First, 30 &#x0223c; 40 ml of iohexol (350 mgI / ml) was injected through the elbow vein and 20 ml normal saline was infused at a rate of 4.0 ml/s. The dynamic perfusion scanning was performed after 5 seconds. The images obtained were transferred to AW4.3 standalone workstation and analyzed by Perfusion 2 software, generating pseudo-color function charts of perfusion parameters such as the cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV) and time to peak (TTP).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Image analysis</title><p>All patients underwent CTP examination to have CBF, CBV, TTP pseudo-color images and gray-scale map obtained. The images were read by two senior radiologists. Region of interest associated with blood vessels with lesions were selected on the gray-scale map. Using the center line as the mirror, a mirror image of the region of interest was set on the opposite side. CBF, CBV and TTP were measured at four points of interest, and the values on the lesion side were divided by the corresponding values on the control side. The local relative values were therefore obtained, which include the relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF), relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and relative time to peak (rTTP). The average values at the four points were used to analyze the changes of cerebral blood perfusion before and after treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>SPSS 17.0 (Chicago, IL, USA) statistical software package was used for statistical analysis of data.

SICAS is a risk factor for recurrent cerebral infarction and TIA. Its pathogenesis is related to instability of stenotic plaques leading to thrombosis or exfoliation, distal arterial stenotic hemodynamics and stenotic perforator vessel occlusion (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Despite the best treatment regimens, the risk of stroke in patients with sICAS is still very high. SICAS often progresses, which is an important cause of the occurrence of vascular events or death. Therefore, the choice of treatment for safe, reasonable and effective secondary prevention has a very important clinical implication.</p><p>Statins in addition to a lipid-regulating effect, inhibit cell proliferation in smooth muscles and promote apoptosis, inhibiting inflammatory responses. Statins can also improve vascular endothelial cell function, reduce lipid deposition in the vascular endothelium, reduce the formation of foam cells and inhibit the activity and aggregation of platelets to stable plaques and reduce the volume of atherosclerotic plaques (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Studies of intravascular ultrasound evaluation of rosuvastatin on coronary atherosclerotic burden confirmed for the first time that intensive statin (atorvastatin 80 mg/d) treatment can reverse the coronary atherosclerotic plaques, reducing vascular stenosis (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>There was no clinical death case reported in this study. At the 1-month follow-up, the incidence of cerebrovascular end points in group A, B and C was 10.0%, 5.0% and 5.0%, respectively, which was similar to the one mentioned in the literature. At the 12-month follow-up, the incidence of cerebrovascular end points in group A, B and C was 26.3%, 13.5% and 5.4%, respectively. Compared to group A, group C has an incidence rate that is significantly lower. The results suggest that group C can significantly lower the incidence of cerebrovascular end-point events compared to group A. However, when group A and B or group B and C are compared, there was no significant difference. The reason might be that the follow-up was relatively short. With the extension of follow-up time, it may further reflect the advantages of intensive statin therapy in the reduction of cerebrovascular end points. In group C, the incidence of end-point events at the 1-year follow-up was lower than that reported in the literature (12.2%). However, considering that the level of intracranial arterial stenosis in the study group was 50% to 99% with an average vessel stenosis rate at (63.5 &#x000b1; 14.76) %, which was lower than the level reported in the literature (70% &#x0223c; 99%), the results cannot be statistically compared.</p><p>Acute ischemic cerebrovascular disease is ultimately caused by low perfusion leading to ischemic brain changes, while atherosclerosis and cerebral artery stenosis or occlusion are the direct causes. CTP is the functional imaging that reflects the cerebral hemodynamics, which shows abnormal blood perfusion in the brain and evaluates the status of cerebral ischemia. There are still different views regarding the sensitivity of CTP parameters to ischemia. CBF is the best indicator that shows the size and location of infarction (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Some studies have shown that TTP is highly sensitive to cerebral ischemia, suggesting that TTP prolongation is related to the collateral circulation or slow blood flow and can be used to evaluate the collateral circulation (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In addition, the high specificity of CBV diagnosis of infarction is reported (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). This study shows that, compared with time before treatment, the rCBF, rCBV of group C were significantly increased and the rTTP was significantly shortened 12 months after the treatment. Although no improvement in intracranial arterial stenosis was observed in group A and B, the cerebrovascular of the two groups may have different degrees of collateral circulation compensation, which would explain why rTTP was prolonged. Group C significantly improved the degree of stenosis in intracranial artery, lowered the average rate of arterial stenosis. Therefore, even without the collateral circulation compensation, the rTTP value is still shortened.</p><p>For patients with sICAS, atorvastatin therapy that lasts one year may delay the progression of atherosclerosis, improve cerebral blood perfusion, and reduce the incidence of clinical end-point cerebrovascular events. Radiology provides a more direct observation of how statins reverse plaques, improve intracranial artery stenosis and improve cerebral blood perfusion. However, this effect cannot be completely explained by its lipid-lowering function. It is also related to the multifunctionality of statins, such as inhibition of plaque neovascularization, reduction in the activity of metalloproteinases, anti-inflammatory effect that raises the nitric oxide bioavailability, repair of damaged blood vessel endothelium and its antithrombotic, fibrinolytic and neuroprotective effects (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Since this study was initiated by a single institute, it was limited by the low number of samples and short observation time period, which may affect the results. In future studies, joint research can be done by collaborating with other institutes to expand the sample size and extend the observation and follow-up time to further validate the role of statins in sICAS.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by Xiangyang Research and Development Plan (Xiangkeye (2014) No. 11) Education Guidance Project of Hubei
