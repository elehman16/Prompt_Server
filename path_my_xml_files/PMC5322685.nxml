It was registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials, which is a Primary Registry in the WHO Registry Network (IRCT-ID: IRCT201302061434N8). Written informed consent was obtained from participants; they were reassured about the confidentiality of the data.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study area</title><p>Isfahan is the second largest city and the most industrialized city in Iran with a population of near two millions. It is located in the center of the Iranian plateau, with a latitude of 32&#x000b0;37&#x02032;N, longitude of 51&#x000b0;40&#x02032;E, and an average altitude of 1500 m from the sea level bounded by NW&#x02013;SE mountain range of 3000 m. It has a moderate and dry climate on the whole with sunny weather in most days throughout the year. The air of this city is predominantly affected by industrial emissions and motor traffic.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Moreover, it has many industries, including a large iron foundry, a steel plant, an ordnance plant, and a cement plant. The soil of this area is contaminated by different toxic metals.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Study participants</title><p>The participants included women who were eligible for the studies who were healthy-looking, with a singleton and full-term pregnancy, and who were living for at least 1 year in areas of Isfahan City with different levels of air pollution that had air pollution monitoring station. Those with a history of any of the following conditions were excluded from the study: tobacco use before or during pregnancy or lactation, having a household member using any kind of tobacco, having any chronic disease, receiving any medications, and following a special diet. These inclusion criteria were considered to reduce the confounding factors, and to increase the similarities in exposure to environmental pollutants. The exclusion criteria consisted of low adherence of mothers to continue the study, occurrence of any health problem, medication use by the mother or not following exclusive breast milk feeding during the trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Study procedure</title><p>One week after the delivery, 10 mL of breast milk was obtained from mothers and was stored at &#x02212; 18&#x000b0;C in clean polyethylene containers, which were previously soaked in 1:1 nitric acid for 1 day and well rinsed with double-distilled water (dd H<sub>2</sub>O). The study participants were randomly assigned to two groups of equal number (<italic>n</italic> = 20 in each group). One group received 15 g/day of jujube fruit for 8 weeks, and the other group received usual care. Plant material was collected from Kuhpayeh district in Isfahan Province, Iran. It was taxonomically identified by an academic herbal botanist.</p><p>Jujube fruits were purchased from a local provider in Isfahan, Iran. These fruits were authenticated in the herbarium department of the School of Pharmacy, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. By every 2 weeks of telephonic follow-ups, we ensured the consumption of jujube fruit by the first group. After 8 weeks, the milk samples of participants were collected during a home visit by the project team.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Laboratory methods</title><p>First, in the stage of digestion, milk samples were collected and digested according to the wet method. At a temperature of 85&#x000b0;C, 10 mL of each sample was dried to reach a stationary weight, and then 7 mL of pure nitric acid was added, and the samples were stored overnight. Later, they were heated at a temperature of 120&#x000b0;C for better digestion. During digestion, 7 mL of hydrogen peroxide (30%) was added to the samples, and they were stored at the same temperature for an hour. During the time, the samples were all digested. Then each digested sample was 10 mL with deionized distilled water in a volumetric flask of 25 mL. To ensure the accuracy of the experiment, all samples were tested three times, and their mean values were recorded, and to ensure the validity of the test, the recycling percentage was assessed. Standard solutions were added to the samples to evaluate the recycling percentage of lead, cadmium, and arsenic. For the measurement of the three elements, we used atomic absorption with furnace method. Atomic absorption spectrometer (PERKIN ELMER 4100, (FIAS 4100, Perkin Elmer, Foster City, CA, USA)) was used; it is equipped with Graphite furnace system to measure lead, cadmium, and arsenic as the atomization source of elements in the product using HCL production source of the cathode ray. The method of samples preparation for furnace system was as follows: 5.0 g of the samples was weighed and after adding 5 mL of 25% nitric acid, it was kept in Teflon coated containers. They were heated for 5 min with 300 W of power inside the microwave (Berghol MWS-1), and the samples were digested. Thereafter, the samples reached to the volume of 25 mL in volumetric flasks. For measuring elements, initially, 5 mL ammonium pyrrolidine carbamate was added to 10 mL solution of digested samples. The samples were shaken for 20 min until the elements changed to complex as an organometallic form in the product. Then, 2 mL of methyl isobutyl ketone was added to the samples and then shaked for 30 min. After 10 min, they were centrifuged at 2500 rpm, and the elements were moved to the organic phase.</p><p>After setting up the furnace, the device lamp and optimizing the atomic absorption spectrometer, we draw the calibration curve of these elements by assistance of standards for these elements, a matrix of palladium modifier and by using the Winlab 32 software (Perkin Elmer Instruments LLC, Shelton). The values of these elements were measured in the prepared solutions.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The normal distribution of variables was checked by Shapiro&#x02013;Wilk test and Q-Q plot. As the concentrations of toxic elements had nonnormal distribution, we applied nonparametric tests. Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-test was used for comparing the baseline concentrations of toxic elements, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test for comparing them before and after 8 weeks. The effects of jujube fruit on concentrations of toxic elements were assessed by quantile regression test. Quantileregression is used to model the effects of covariates on the conditional quintiles of a response variable.</p><p>Ordinary least square linear regression was used for comparison of variables. For data analysis, SPSS (version 20.0, Chicago, IL) and R statistical software (version 2.11.1, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna) were used.

Although many previous studies have been conducted regarding the level of toxic elements in breast milk,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] limited experience exist on the interventions considering the reduction of these harmful elements in milk.</p><p>Jujube fruit or <italic>Ziziphus jujuba</italic> Mill from <italic>Rhamnaceae family</italic> is one of the most important <italic>Ziziphus</italic> species, which is cultivated in several areas including Iran. Fresh and dried fruits have been widely used among Iranians as a functional fruit and remedy for the treatment of constipation, cough, asthma, and atherosclerosis. It is a well-known cooling remedy in the Iranian Traditional Medicine for preparing of several healthy prescriptions.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Jujube fruit is one of the useful and healthy fruits of Iran that can be used during lactation. The fruit contains natural substances such as triterpenoids such as betulinic acid, oleanolic acid, and maslinic acid, phytosterols such as beta-sitosterol and stigmasterol, flavonoids such as puerarin and quercetin, alkaloids, tannins and polyphenolic compounds, essential oils, proanthocyanidins, fatty acids, amino acids, trace elements, pectin, sugars, and vitamins. Each of these diverse natural health compounds of the jujube fruit has unique properties.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] To the best of our knowledge, no previous study exists on the effects of this fruit on milk contaminants; we considered it because of its beneficial effects in our previous studies.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] In this study, the effect of consuming jujube fruit by lactating mothers in reducing the concentration of some toxic trace elements in their higher quintiles. Possibly, future studies with longer follow-up might reach better results.</p><p>It should be acknowledged that regardless of the effects of jujube fruit, the milk concentrations of lead, cadmium, and arsenic decreased in breast milk after 2 months of lactation in both intervention and control groups. One of the reasons of such reduction might be the change in the composition of human milk over time, for example, its fat and protein content.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Moreover, it is suggested that as we conducted the study shortly after childbirth, the contaminants have mainly entered to the maternal body during pregnancy, and the baseline levels of toxic trace elements in breast milk are an indicator of likely prenatal exposures.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] However, compared to the control group, high concentrations of lead and cadmium, but not that of arsenic, decreased in the milk of those mothers who received jujube fruit; therefore, it can be assumed that in addition to the change in the usual content of human milk over time, jujube fruit had some beneficial effects in decreasing its lead and cadmium content.</p><p>In the current study, the mean (SD) concentrations of lead, cadmium, and arsenic were 29.49 (16.6), 4.65 (3.51), and 1.23 (0.63) &#x000b5;g/L, respectively.

However, the comparison between different studies has limitations because of differences in geographical location, methods of measurement, and the time of each study.</p><p>It is noteworthy to mention that the milk concentrations of lead and cadmium in the current study were substantially higher than the levels reported from the same city 3 years before the current study.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] These findings suggest that the environmental contaminants have increased in this industrialized city, which along two other cities in Iran are actually included in the top ten air-polluted cities of the world (Iran-times.com/Iran-has-most-polluted-cities-in-world/). Moreover, it is documented that the vegetables grown in this area are contaminated with different toxic heavy metals.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] Our findings are also consistent with high levels of blood cadmium and lead found in a recent study in the Iranian adolescents living in various cities in Iran,[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] which shows such environmental pollutants are not limited to this study area, and studies in other cities of the country might reveal similar results.</p><p>In spite of the existence of some toxic trace elements in human milk, because of its numerous beneficial effects, breastfeeding must be encouraged, and it should be taken into account that most of these elements also contaminate drinking water and may exist in formula cans; therefore, their levels might be even higher in formula than in human milk.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</p><p>Although the health effects of toxic trace elements in human milk need to be determined, reducing the concentrations of these pollutants might have long-term beneficial effects.
