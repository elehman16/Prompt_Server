Ibandronic acid is effective for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women with increased risk of fractures, and a reduction in the risk of vertebral fractures has been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>The absorption of ibandronic acid in the upper gastrointestinal tract is rapid after oral administration. In fasted state, the maximum observed plasma concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) is reached within 0.5&#x02013;2&#x000a0;hours (median 1&#x000a0;hour). The oral bioavailability after oral administration is low (~0.6&#x000a0;%) and highly variable. Bioavailability is reduced by 90&#x000a0;% in the presence of a standard breakfast and by approximately 75 and 30&#x000a0;% when is administered 2&#x000a0;hours after a standard meal and 30&#x000a0;minutes before a meal, respectively. There is no meaningful reduction in bioavailability provided ibandronic acid is taken 60&#x000a0;minutes before a meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>There is no evidence of dose-dependent pharmacokinetics in the range of 2.5&#x02013;50&#x000a0;mg oral dosage. The exposure following administration of 50, 100 or 150&#x000a0;mg was not dose proportional, with area under the serum concentration&#x02013;time curve (AUC) and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> presenting greater increase in exposure with increasing dose. The reason for these dose-dependent pharmacokinetics is not fully elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>In humans, the apparent terminal volume of distribution is high (~90&#x000a0;L), which is most likely related to substantial distribution within skeletal tissue: the amount of dose removed from the circulation via the bone is estimated to be 40&#x02013;50&#x000a0;% and the remainder is eliminated unchanged by the kidney. The unabsorbed fraction of ibandronic acid is eliminated unchanged in the faeces. Protein binding in human plasma is approximately 87&#x000a0;% at therapeutic concentrations, and drug&#x02013;drug interaction due to displacement is unlikely. There is no evidence that ibandronic acid is metabolized in animals or humans. The observed apparent elimination half-life (<italic>T</italic><sub>&#x000bd; el</sub>) for ibandronic acid is generally in the range of 10&#x02013;72&#x000a0;hours. Total clearance of ibandronic acid is low with average values in the range of 84&#x02013;160&#x000a0;mL/min. Renal clearance (about 60&#x000a0;mL/min in healthy postmenopausal females) accounts for 50&#x02013;60&#x000a0;% of total clearance and is related to creatinine clearance. The difference between the apparent total and renal clearances is considered to reflect the uptake by bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>The present study aimed to compare the rate and extent of absorption of ibandronate acid (as sodium ibandronate) 150&#x000a0;mg from a test medicinal product (test formulation; Treatment A), manufactured by Tecnimede (Sintra, Portugal) and that of the reference medicinal product (reference formulation; Treatment B; Bonviva<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), a surrogate for therapeutic equivalence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Volunteers and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Protocol</title><p>The clinical study protocol and related documents were approved by an independent ethics committee (International Review Board Services) and a No Objection Letter (NOL) was obtained from Canadian authorities.

The statistical model included sequence, period, treatment and subject within sequence as fixed factors. The sequence effect was tested using the subject-within-sequence effect as the error term. The treatment and period effects were tested against the residual mean square error. Within-subject coefficient of variation (CV<sub>WR</sub>) was calculated for the reference product using analysis of variance (ANOVA), on reference data only, with sequence, subject within sequence, and period as fixed effects. The point estimate and the 90&#x000a0;% geometric confidence interval for the test-to-reference geometric mean ratio (<italic>T</italic>/<italic>R</italic>) were calculated for AUC<sub>0&#x02013;<italic>t</italic></sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> using the least-squares means statement. <italic>K</italic><sub>el</sub> and <italic>T</italic><sub>&#x000bd; el</sub> were also analysed using the GLM Procedure. Wilcoxon&#x02019;s test was performed on the mean <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> for both treatments. All statistical tests were performed at the alpha level of 0.05.</p><p>According to the regulatory requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] translated into the study protocol, the hypothesis of bioequivalence between a generic medicinal product and a reference medicinal product is accepted if the 90&#x000a0;% geometric confidence intervals of the ratio of least-squares means of the test to reference product of ln-transformed AUC<sub>0&#x02013;<italic>t</italic></sub> is within the acceptance range of 80.00&#x02013;125.00&#x000a0;%. For <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>, the protocol established a scaled average bioequivalence approach. This approach is based on the CV<sub>WR</sub>: if the CV<sub>WR</sub> is inferior or equal to 30&#x000a0;% (&#x02264;30&#x000a0;%), the 90&#x000a0;% geometric confidence intervals of the ratio <italic>T/R</italic> of least-squares means of the ln-transformed <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> should be within the acceptable range of 80.00&#x02013;125.00&#x000a0;% to conclude bioequivalence. On the other hand, if the CV<sub>WR</sub> for the reference product was superior to 30&#x000a0;% (&#x0003e;30&#x000a0;%) for <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>, the bioequivalence acceptance limits for this pharmacokinetic parameter had to be scaled to the within-subject variability of the reference product (to a maximum of 69.84&#x02013;143.19&#x000a0;%).</p><p>For scaled average bioequivalence, the applicant should justify that the calculated CV<sub>WR</sub> is a reliable estimate and that it is not the result of outliers. Therefore, a box plot analysis using the studentized intra-subject residuals from the ANOVA model including only data for the reference treatment was done using the univariate procedure in SAS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. A box plot was constructed from studentized intra-subject residuals corresponding to the first administration of reference product in each subject. Values that were further away from the box by more than three interquartile ranges were considered outlying observations and these values are indicated by an asterisk in the box plot. The detected outlying observations were excluded, and within subject standard deviation of the log transformed parameter (S<sub>WR</sub>) was re-estimated and used to widen bioequivalence limits (if eligible) as specified above.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Drug Analysis</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Pharmacokinetic Analysis</title><p>One hundred and fifty-three subjects (47 females and 106 males) were randomized to three sequences of treatment (TRR, RTR and RRT), and received at least one dose of the investigational medicinal products under study.

The absorption in the upper gastrointestinal tract is rapid after oral administration with an absolute bioavailability of about 0.6&#x000a0;%.</p><p>A generic medicinal product is considered to be bioequivalent to a reference medicinal product when the 90&#x000a0;% confidence interval around the estimated ratio of geometric means of AUC and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> is between 0.80 and 1.25 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. As per regulatory and scientific requirements, when a generic medicinal product and a reference medicinal product are compared, a single-dose, crossover design is recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>In studies with crossover design, the amplitude of the confidence interval is proportional to the within-subject SD of the pharmacokinetic parameter and reciprocally proportional to the square-root of the number of subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Consequently, the regulatory bioequivalence limits of 0.80 and 1.25 are frequently penetrated when the intra-individual variation is high unless the number of subjects is also large.</p><p>Ibandronic acid is a highly variable drug and, although the reference literature confirms acceptance of widening of confidence intervals in Europe, based on non-replicate designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], the latest update in the bioequivalence guideline requires that, in order to widen the intervals for <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>, a replicate design must be used. Besides the fact of allowing for the widening of the intervals for <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>, replicate designs possess the advantage of reducing the sample size of subjects required to demonstrate bioequivalence between the two formulations.</p><p>However, one of the main issues with a replicate design is the increased duration of the clinical phase of the study, since a full replicate study with four periods will require three washout intervals and a partial replicate with three periods will require two washout intervals. This represents more than three or two times, respectively, the required amount of time to conduct a simple crossover study. Therefore, by increasing the duration of the study and the number of dosing periods, replicate designs normally exhibit a higher dropout rate, which impacts negatively on the required sample size.</p><p>The issue with the higher dropout rates is evident by analysing the bibliographic references, which shows 15.8 and 12.5&#x000a0;% dropout rates for full replicate studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], while, according to our experience, we achieved a dropout rate of 7.2&#x000a0;% for this partial replicate study and a 4.2&#x000a0;% dropout rate in a pilot crossover study (data on file).</p><p>So, in trying to achieve a compromise between an extended duration of the clinical phase and reducing the sample size without much impact from the dropout rate, we decided to conduct this study as a partial replicate design with three periods, including two administrations of the reference formulation in each sequence. This turned out to be a favourable decision since, according to the guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], the replicate design allowed for the scaled bioequivalence approach for <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and the duration of the clinical phase was contained and acceptable (37&#x000a0;days as opposed to the required 54&#x000a0;days in a four-period full replicate design), which led to a dropout rate lower than the one observed for full replicate studies. Further to this, the results of the study demonstrated that the within-subject variability for <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> of the reference formulation was more than 30&#x000a0;% and this value was not the result of the presence of outliers.</p><p>However, it is important to point out that a replicate design may not be the solution if high within-subject variability is observed for the AUC parameter, which was not the case for ibandronic acid, since the bioequivalence guideline does not allow for the widening of intervals for that pharmacokinetic parameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The treatment periods should be separated by a washout period of at least five <italic>T</italic><sub>&#x000bd; el</sub> in order to guarantee that the drug concentrations are below the lower limit of quantification at the beginning of each period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In this study, the treatment periods were separated by a washout of 14&#x000a0;days. When reviewing the published data on ibandronic acid pharmacokinetic properties, the authors noticed that the published half-life of ibandronic acid ranges from 10 to 60&#x000a0;hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and, in one study in postmenopausal women that received a single oral dose of ibandronic acid150&#x000a0;mg, a mean <italic>T</italic><sub>&#x000bd; el</sub> of 72&#x000a0;hours was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In the current study, the <italic>T</italic><sub>&#x000bd; el</sub> of ibandronic acid was approximately 10&#x000a0;hours for both formulations, which is in line with published studies but also in the lower limit of the range of values published. This may be explained by the fact that the participants in the study were healthy volunteers since similar half-life values were observed in phase I pharmacokinetic studies with the reference product in healthy subjects.</p><p>The mean residual area was less than 20&#x000a0;% for all treatments indicating that a sampling over a period of 48&#x000a0;hours was sufficient.</p><p>A statistically significant period effect was detected for AUCs. A statistically significant period effect could be an indication of an equal carryover effect. However, since there was no detectable pre-dose concentration at any of the study periods and there was no sequence effect, there is no indication of carryover effect. As the intra-subject variability was smaller for the AUCs as compared with <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>, the power of the study was higher for these parameters. Consequently, small differences between periods could be detected which should not be clinically meaningful.</p><p>In this bioequivalence study, all the ratios and 90&#x000a0;% geometric confidence intervals were within the acceptance ranges. The conventional acceptance range of 0.80 and 1.25 was even met for <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Based on these results, it can be concluded that the test formulation of ibandronic acid is bioequivalent to the test reference Bonviva<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> following a 1&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;150-mg dose under fasting conditions.</p><p>The number of subjects reporting TEAE and the number of TEAE reported after intake of reference medicinal product (Treatment B&#x02014;Bonviva<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) is higher than the number of subjects reporting TEAE and the number of TEAE reported following intake of the test medicinal product (Treatment A&#x02014;test formulation). These differences between treatments can be explained by study design, a reference-replicate crossover study, since all subjects who completed the study received two doses of the reference medicinal product and only one dose of the test medicinal product.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><sec id="d30e1556"><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p>Tecnimede is the Sponsor of this study.
