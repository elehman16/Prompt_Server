Ongoing evaluation of the long-term safety profile of these agents is essential to ensure their effective and appropriate use.

This paper presents an updated and long-term safety analysis of all CZP-treated patients in RA clinical trials, with CZP exposure of up to 7&#x02005;years in some patients. The evaluation and review process was led by an external, independent safety steering committee, who identified and defined key AE types, and with expert input performed a manual review of these events.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Data sources and patient populations</title><p>A pooled safety analysis was performed on one open-label, single-dose pharmacokinetic study (n=16), 10 randomised controlled trials (RCT) and several open-label extensions (OLE) or other open-label periods of clinical trials in RA (see supplementary table S1 and figure S1, available online only). Data up to 30 November 2011 were included.</p><p>Trials included monotherapy, combination therapy (receiving CZP concomitantly with methotrexate or other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs) and mixed populations (monotherapy and combination therapy) (see supplementary table S1, available online only). Two formulations of CZP were used, a lyophilised powder for solution or a solution for injection provided in a pre-filled syringe. CZP was administered at a dose of 200&#x02005;mg once every 2 weeks (Q2W) following a loading dose of 400&#x02005;mg at weeks 0, 2 and 4 (registered dose), CZP 400 mg once every 4 weeks (additional registered dose in USA only) or 400&#x02005;mg Q2W (dose used in the two pivotal trials (RAPID 1<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and RAPID 2<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and their OLE).</p><p>In RAPID 1<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and RAPID 2<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> the protocol specified early, mandatory escape to OLE CZP for patients failing to achieve an ACR20 response at weeks 12 and 14. In the RAPID 1 and RAPID 2 OLE all patients initially received CZP 400&#x02005;mg Q2W before switching to CZP 200&#x02005;mg Q2W after at least 6&#x02005;months.</p><p>As the study designs (including patient inclusion and exclusion criteria) and baseline populations of the included trials were largely similar, patient data were pooled without application of corrective factors. Data from two patient populations are presented: (1) the placebo-controlled population (RCT) includes all patients participating in RCT with data presented for placebo and CZP treated patients; (2) the all studies population (RCT&#x02009;+&#x02009;OLE) reports data for any patient exposed to CZP, and includes all patients who withdrew from the RCT and were treated thereafter with CZP. For patients treated with CZP in RCT, events from the RCT are included in both the RCT and RCT+OLE populations.</p><p>As well as a general safety update, AE reported here include serious infectious events (SIE), opportunistic infections (OI), tuberculosis, malignancies, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), gastrointestinal perforations, demyelinating disorders, anaphylactic disorders and lupus-like syndromes, as well as data on laboratory parameters.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Safety assessments</title><p>AE and serious adverse events (SAE) were recorded and categorised according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) V.9.0. In some cases, individual symptoms as well as overall diagnoses were each recorded and counted separately, which could lead to overestimation of AE incidence (eg, a patient diagnosed with pharyngitis could also be counted as simultaneously experiencing laryngitis and pyrexia). AE were defined as taking place between the first dose and 84&#x02005;days after the last dose of the study drug (84&#x02005;days being six times the half-life of CZP).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>The definition of SAE was broad, encompassing the regulatory definition of medical occurrences that were life threatening or led to death, hospitalisation, congenital anomalies or birth defects, or resulted in persistent or significant disability.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In addition, all OI, malignancies (excluding some basal-cell carcinomas at the discretion of the investigator) and any medical events deemed important by the investigator were considered SAE. The latter criterion was subject to individual investigator interpretation and no guidance was provided in the study protocols.</p><p>MACE included fatal and serious non-fatal myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events and congestive heart failure, based on MedDRA terms and medical review.</p><p>Gastrointestinal perforations were identified using the high-level term &#x02018;gastrointestinal ulcers and perforation, site unspecified&#x02019; and a manual search to capture other potential cases of gastrointestinal perforation (perforation, abscess, appendicitis, diverticulitis and fistula). A medical review was subsequently performed.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Exposure to CZP</title><p>Total CZP exposure was defined as the time from the first dose to 84&#x02005;days after the last dose. Exposure to CZP as used in the incidence rate calculation was defined as the time from the first dose until the first occurrence of a particular AE.</p><p>Both exposure-adjusted event rates (ER) and incidence rates (IR) per 100 patient-years (PY) are presented in this analysis. When AE occur in individual patients more than once, ER are usually appropriate as all events and the full duration of drug exposure are accounted for (see supplementary figure S2, available online only). When AE typically occur in individual patients only once (eg, in the case of tuberculosis), IR are more appropriate as data are censored after the first occurrence of a particular event in an individual patient.</p><p>All statistics were performed using the STAT V.9.1 program.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Centralised external medical review of selected AE</title><p>A retrospective central review led by external experts was performed in order to increase the consistency of evaluation of selected AE. The steering committee (VB, JC, RvV, XM) identified AE of concern to patients treated with biological agents (including SIE, OI, malignancies, demyelinating events, gastrointestinal perforations and death) and oversaw the centralised medical review process. The steering committee manually reviewed the database records for the predefined AE, including the investigator description of each event used by the sponsor for coding the sub committee proposals, in a blinded fashion using predetermined rules, and provided a final diagnosis of each case. The classification rules were developed by consensus with the input of specialist subcommittees of independent clinicians. The subcommittees applied the rules to each case initially and decisions were validated by the steering committee.</p><p>The subcommittees for SIE and OI (KW, OL, LC, JC and XM) classified SIE by the regulatory definition of SAE of infection,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> with an additional criterion of the need for intravenous antibiotics. A list of OI, including strict diagnosis criteria, was developed and validated by the steering committee. The list of OI and criteria for diagnosis were predominantly derived from validated and published sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and were consistent with the RATIO registry (see supplementary table S3, available online only).<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>The malignancies committee (RvV and an oncologist) categorised malignancies as solid tumours (including melanoma), lymphoma or non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC).</p><p>The committee for deaths (VB and two cardiologists) categorised deaths as primarily due to cardiovascular events, infectious events, malignancies or other causes.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Tuberculosis screening</title><p>In CZP studies before 2007, screening for tuberculosis was conducted according to the respective national guidelines of the recruiting centre (criteria for purified protein derivative (PPD) positivity varied between &#x02265;5&#x02005;mm and &#x02265;20&#x02005;mm). In 2007, protocols were amended mandating that all patients be treated prophylactically for tuberculosis if PPD positivity of 5&#x02005;mm or greater was observed at baseline.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>

Grade 3 abnormalities were generally infrequent and occurred similarly between groups within RCT. Changes in lipid profile were not measured in these studies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The safety of CZP in RA has been comprehensively evaluated based on 4049 CZP-treated RA patients, collectively comprising 9277 PY, with individual patient exposures of up to 7.6&#x02005;years.</p><p>As previously reported,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> AE and SAE peaked during the first 3&#x02013;6&#x02005;months of both CZP and placebo treatment. These rates decreased after the initial 6&#x02005;months of therapy. This may be due to a &#x02018;survival bias&#x02019; whereby patients who are intolerant to the drug do not continue into the OLE. The overall rate of AE reported is, therefore, influenced by the CZP exposure period over which the rate is calculated.</p><p>Patients with RA are at an increased risk of infection compared to the general population.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Furthermore, there is an increased risk of SIE associated with biological agents, predominantly during the first months of treatment, and which some studies have identified with TNF inhibitors particularly.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>

<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In line with this, and the recent meta-analysis of SIE performed by the Cochrane Collaboration,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> there was an initial increase in the rate of SIE in patients receiving CZP compared to placebo patients, and infections were the most common SAE. Mandatory early withdrawal of patients without an ACR20 response at weeks 12 and 14 in RAPID 1 and RAPID 2 studies resulted in higher withdrawal rates for placebo compared to CZP-treated patients, resulting in a fourfold increased total exposure of patients to CZP versus placebo. Therefore, comparisons between these groups in RCT should be interpreted with caution.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Moreover, patients in these two studies received higher than indicated doses of CZP, but the effect of dose was not analysed in this integrated safety update.</p><p>As in most OLE, the rate of SIE did not increase with prolonged exposure to CZP and is in line with that reported in the literature for other TNF inhibitors (ER range from 2.6/100 PY to 6.4/100 PY).<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Caution is necessary, however, when making indirect comparisons between biologics or when reviewing meta-analyses, as study populations differ across trials in terms of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, risk factors, geographical regions and standards of care. Furthermore, the definition of SIE differs between studies and it is not always transparent if IR or ER are being reported. ER are particularly relevant for long-term extension studies, when more than one SIE can be reported in an individual patient. Treatment with any biologic, including CZP, should not be started in a patient with an active infection and patients should be continuously monitored for the development of infections.</p><p>Tuberculosis rates in RCT and RCT+OLE (IR 0.69/100 PY and 0.47/100 PY, respectively) are in line with those reported for other monoclonal TNF inhibiting antibodies, including adalimumab (reported as being 0.50/100 PY in the ReAcT study,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> and 0.29/100 PY in a recent analysis of long-term safety data from clinical trials in RA).<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Cases of tuberculosis, which were predominantly reported in central and eastern Europe, fell significantly after the introduction of standardised tuberculosis screening (PPD &#x02265;5&#x02005;mm) across CZP clinical trials in 2007. These data highlight the fact that routine tuberculosis screening applying strict PPD criteria is a critical component of management for patients being considered for TNF inhibitor therapy, and that clinical vigilance during long-term treatment is essential. No non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections have been reported with CZP but the included trial populations had relatively few comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus. No cases of multifocal leukoencephalopathy have been reported, and the frequency of non-tuberculous OI with CZP appears to be low.</p><p>There is no signal showing an increased risk of malignancy with CZP in general and over time compared to the general population, with no cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma reported. The incidence rate of all malignancies excluding NMSC with CZP in RCT+OLE (0.76/100 PY) is similar to data from a US observational database (1.30/100 PY).<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> The rate of lymphoma cases reported with CZP (IR 0.05/100 PY) is also in line with that reported in the Swedish Biologics Register for patients treated with TNF inhibitor therapy (0.096 events/100 PY) and RA patients naive to TNF inhibitor therapy (0.092 events/100 PY).<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p><p>RA is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular deaths.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Some studies have suggested that the use of TNF inhibitors may reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in RA patients.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> The risk of MACE with CZP did not increase with increased exposure duration.</p><p>Five out of six patients who developed gastrointestinal perforations while receiving CZP had previous risk factors. The event rate of gastrointestinal perforations observed with CZP is within the range reported by Curtis <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> for TNF inhibitor users concomitantly exposed to oral corticosteroids.</p><p>Evidence has recently emerged indicating that many biological agents may be associated with an increased risk of demyelinating disease.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>
<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Lupus-like reactions and anaphylactic reactions were rare events with the use of CZP. A detailed search of the safety database, using validated terms such as multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis and other demyelinating conditions, did not identify any demyelinating events in patients receiving CZP in RA clinical trials to date. Lupus-like reactions and anaphylactic reactions were also rare events with the use of CZP.</p><p>Similarities in recruited patients and study design in the clinical trials allowed pooling of data and a more comprehensive safety assessment. The external medical review allowed an independent (although retrospective) review of data reported by investigators. The limitations of the dataset include the fact that clinical trials are subject to strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, with rigorous patient monitoring throughout treatment; therefore this patient population likely have fewer comorbidities than those seen in daily clinical practice. Differential reporting of AE, particularly OI also highlights the need for clear instructions and definitions of AE for investigators for optimal data collection. There is a need for the ongoing monitoring of the safety profile of CZP within the clinical practice environment.</p><p>No new or unexpected safety signals have emerged in this long-term safety analysis of RA clinical trials, and the data are consistent with those reported in the post-marketing use of CZP. There were no increases in the event rate of AE, SAE or SIE with prolonged exposure. This updated longer-term safety analysis for CZP in RA is in line with the AE profile previously reported and with other biologics, including TNF inhibitors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2013-203660-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1705" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Naveed Sattar, cardiologist, and colleagues (Glasgow) and Anders &#x000d6;sterborg, oncologist (Stockholm), for their contribution to the external medical review; Marine Champsaur, UCB Pharma, Brussels, Belgium for publication coordination; and Costello Medical Consulting, UK, for writing and editorial assistance.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The CZP safety analysis was funded by UCB Pharma.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Competing interests:</bold> VB, KW, LC and OL have no conflicts to declare.
