Two recent vector control products have been developed: a long-lasting insecticidal net that incorporates a synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and a long-lasting indoor residual spraying formulation of the insecticide pirimiphos-methyl. We evaluated the effectiveness of PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets versus standard long-lasting insecticidal nets as single interventions and in combination with the indoor residual spraying of pirimiphos-methyl.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We did a four-group cluster randomised controlled trial using a two-by-two factorial design of 48 clusters derived from 40 villages in Muleba (Kagera, Tanzania). We randomly assigned these clusters using restricted randomisation to four groups: standard long-lasting insecticidal nets, PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets, standard long-lasting insecticidal nets plus indoor residual spraying, or PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets plus indoor residual spraying. Both standard and PBO nets were distributed in 2015. Indoor residual spraying was applied only once in 2015. We masked the inhabitants of each cluster to the type of nets received, as well as field staff who took blood samples. Neither the investigators nor the participants were masked to indoor residual spraying. The primary outcome was the prevalence of malaria infection in children aged 6 months to 14 years assessed by cross-sectional surveys at 4, 9, 16, and 21 months after intervention. The endpoint for assessment of indoor residual spraying was 9 months and PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets was 21 months.

In the first search on long-lasting insecticidal nets treated with piperonyl butoxide (PBO), we used the search terms &#x0201c;malaria&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;long lasting insecticidal net&#x0201d; in combination with &#x0201c;piperonyl butoxide&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Olyset Plus&#x0201d;, or &#x0201c;PermaNet 3.0&#x0201d;, which produced no references that were randomised controlled trials (RCTs). In a 2015 review of PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets, WHO concluded that although they appeared to have an increased efficacy the evidence was too inadequate to justify a switch from pyrethroid only to PBO nets across all settings. Because of the potential for an antagonistic effect between PBO and organophosphates, WHO also recommended that PBO nets should not be used in areas programmed for indoor residual spraying with pirimiphos-methyl capsule suspension.</p><p id="para40">In the second search on combined vector control interventions, we included the search term &#x0201c;malaria&#x0201d; with one or more of the following: &#x0201c;long lasting insecticidal net&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;insecticide treated net&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;indoor residual spraying&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;vector control&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;pirimiphos methyl&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;combined interventions&#x0201d;. We identified three other RCTs that have examined combined intervention of long-lasting insecticidal nets and indoor residual spraying. The Gambian RCT, which used DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) as the indoor residual spraying component showed no additional protection compared with long-lasting insecticidal nets alone. This finding could be explained by the high usage of nets or the properties of the sprayed insecticide used. In Benin, there was no advantage to combining indoor residual spraying and long-lasting insecticidal nets; however, suboptimal coverage of nets and the short residual effect of the spray used (bendiocarb) might have affected the effectiveness of the combination intervention. In an earlier Tanzanian study, where coverage of long-lasting insecticidal nets was moderate and pyrethroid resistance present, two rounds of indoor residual spraying with bendiocarb combined with long-lasting insecticidal nets were more effective than long-lasting insecticidal nets alone.</p><p id="para50"><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p id="para60">Our study is the first RCT to report that PBO-treated long-lasting insecticidal nets were more effective than standard pyrethroid long-lasting insecticidal nets against malaria infection and transmission. It also provides the strongest evidence to date of the negative effect of high-level pyrethroid resistance on the use and efficacy of standard nets. This study is also the first RCT to provide evidence for the effect of long-term malaria control of the first long-lasting organophosphate formulation to be developed specifically for indoor residual spraying. The RCT provides new evidence on the added value and risks of combining indoor residual spraying and long-lasting insecticidal nets, particularly PBO nets.</p><p id="para70"><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p id="para80">This study provides justification for the increase in deployment and use of PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets. As a direct consequence of this trial, WHO revised its policy on long-lasting insecticidal nets in September, 2017, gave interim endorsement to pyrethroid-PBO nets as a new WHO class of vector control product, and recommended that PBO nets be deployed for prevention of malaria where vectors are resistant to pyrethroids provided that vector control coverage is not compromised. This endorsement would include many endemic areas in Africa where standard long-lasting insecticidal nets are currently used. The demonstration that long-lasting insecticidal nets with an appropriate change of active ingredient can continue to tackle transmission by pyrethroid-resistant vector populations will ensure the viability of this approach as well as justifies the continued investment and search for alternative insecticides for use on nets.</p><p id="para90">Finally, the organophosphate indoor residual spraying formulation is the first long-lasting, non-pyrethroid insecticide to provide malaria control for at least 9 months over two transmission seasons in the same year. This finding justifies the scale up and use of indoor residual spraying in sub-Saharan Africa and the 12-year investment into long-lasting alternatives to pyrethroid and DDT for indoor spraying between private and public sector organisations.</p></boxed-text></p><sec id="cesec10"><title>Introduction</title><p id="para100">Long-lasting insecticidal nets and indoor residual spraying are the cornerstones of malaria control in sub-Saharan Africa. Together with effective treatment, these interventions are estimated to have globally reduced malaria morbidity by 41% and mortality by 62% between 2000 and 2015.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Despite this public health success, recent wide-scale selection of insecticide resistance in the mosquito vectors across Africa threatens to reverse the present gains.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Development and evaluation of new strategies and tools are needed to address the threat of resistance and will accelerate progress towards elimination.</p><p id="para110">The range of insecticides available for indoor residual spraying is limited. For long-lasting insecticidal nets, the range is particularly restricted because pyrethroids are the only class of insecticides recommended by WHO for nets. Evidence from indoor residual spraying programmes suggests that pyrethroid resistance can contribute to operational control failure&#x02014;eg, in South Africa, control was only restored once the pyrethroid was replaced by an insecticide to which vectors were susceptible.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> By contrast, the negative effect of pyrethroid resistance on the effectiveness of long-lasting insecticidal nets has been less clear and harder to quantify than indoor residual spraying.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Although entomological evidence suggests that these nets are becoming less effective at killing mosquitoes in household conditions when resistance develops,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> the physical barrier provided by the net, especially when new and intact, might mitigate some of the loss in bioefficacy due to resistance.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Cohort studies have shown that long-lasting insecticidal nets remain protective against malaria infection in areas of moderate insecticide resistance in Malawi<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> and Kenya,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> whereas no reduction in incidence was observed after the distribution of these nets in Uganda.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref></p><p id="para120">Anticipating the possible failure of current control tools due to resistance, WHO has encouraged the industry to develop new types of long-lasting insecticidal nets and new insecticides for indoor residual spraying. One of these developments is a new long-lasting insecticidal net that uses piperonyl butoxide (PBO). PBO is a chemical synergist that acts by inhibiting enzymes involved in the natural defense mechanisms of insects, which results in pyrethroid not being detoxified in the insect and the pyrethroid on the long-lasting insecticidal net remaining potent against mosquitoes despite resistance. Such PBO-pyrethroid-treated long-lasting insecticidal nets appear to have similar or better efficacy against resistant mosquitoes under controlled household conditions than standard long-lasting insecticidal nets that do not have PBO.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In September, 2015, a WHO expert group reviewed the evidence for PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets to define their deployment. Despite awaiting for more conclusive evidence from community randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with epidemiological outcomes, WHO, nevertheless, has recommended a small rollout in specific situations.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p><p id="para130">Although the range of insecticide classes suitable for indoor residual spraying use is wider than long-lasting insecticidal nets, few insecticides are effective for more than a few months when sprayed onto walls and this limitation has been a constraint on their adoption and use. The organophosphate pirimiphos-methyl is an exception, and the recently developed long-lasting formulation, Actellic 300CS (Syngenta, Switzerland), is effective for up to 10 months when used for indoor residual spraying.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> It is now being deployed in several African countries instead of carbamates.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref></p><p id="para140">In attempts to accelerate malaria control progress, long-lasting insecticidal nets and indoor residual spraying have been deployed together in several countries.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The advantage of combined intervention has, however, been the focus of considerable debate because both observational and RCTs have produced contradictory evidence. In The Gambia and Benin, no difference in malarial outcomes were reported when both control strategies were deployed together compared with long-lasting insecticidal nets alone,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> whereas in Tanzania an increased effectiveness was observed when they were used in combination.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> On the basis of these data, the effect observed would seem to depend on the insecticide combination used, the vectors present, the coverage and quality of the intervention, and the level and type of insecticide resistance in the vectors.</p><p id="para150">To develop an improved strategy for control of malaria transmitted by pyrethroid-resistant mosquito vectors, we aimed to compare the effectiveness of PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets with standard long-lasting insecticidal nets as single interventions and in combination with the long-lasting indoor residual spraying of pirimiphos-methyl.</p></sec><sec id="cesec20"><title>Methods</title><sec id="cesec30"><title>Study design and participants</title><p id="para160">We did a cluster RCT of four groups using a two-by-two factorial design.

WHO then reset the policy agenda declaring that new types of long-lasting insecticidal nets (such as the PBO net) should be effective for at least two transmission seasons or 2 years. The primary endpoint for the indoor residual spraying was 1 year, based on reports of duration of residual activity. Because the two intervention products were being assessed separately and in combination, the main endpoint for assessment of the indoor residual spraying was 9 months and the PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets was 9 months and then 21 months.</p><p id="para270">The secondary main outcome was malaria transmission or entomological inoculation rate, defined as the mean number of infective mosquito bites per household per month, during the first year and second year after intervention. Other secondary endpoints were the proportion of children with moderate-to-severe anaemia (defined as haemoglobin &#x0003c;8 g/dL), the sporozoite rate (the proportion of anopheline mosquitoes collected that were infected with malaria sporozoites), and anopheline population density.</p></sec><sec id="cesec70"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="para280">This study had 80% power<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> to detect a relative reduction in prevalence of infection of at least 28% (prevalence ratio 0&#x000b7;72) for each of the two main effects (ie, indoor residual spraying <italic>vs</italic> no indoor residual spraying, and PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets <italic>vs</italic> no PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets) and a 40% difference between any of the individual groups, with 24 clusters of 80 individuals per cluster being tested in each of these comparisons, and assuming a mean prevalence of 20% in the reference groups and a coefficient of variation of 0&#x000b7;3 (based on data from the earlier study).<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref></p><p id="para290">Statistical analysis was done using Stata (version 12).

The additional effect of the PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets on malaria prevalence was evident at the end of the first year with a 44% protective efficacy and at the end of the second year with a 33% protective efficacy compared with the standard long-lasting insecticidal nets. These findings were supported by the entomological outcomes, which showed a significant reduction in malaria transmission, with entomological inoculation rates being reduced by 87% during the first year and 67% during the second year in areas receiving PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets compared with standard long-lasting insecticidal nets. At 9 months, the addition of pirimiphos-methyl indoor residual spraying to the standard long-lasting insecticidal nets provided similar protection against malaria (44% protective efficacy) relative to the standard nets alone, whereas the addition of indoor residual spraying to PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets did not significantly improve protection based on the interaction observed when both indoor spraying and PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets effect were at their strongest. The impact of indoor residual spraying on the entomological inoculation rates was more than 95% in the first year. This effect on malaria transmission occurred shortly after implementation of indoor residual spraying whereas the effect of PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets took longer. This rapid impact of indoor residual spraying is one reason why this intervention is sometimes more favoured than long-lasting insecticidal net distribution during malaria epidemics, although there has been a paucity of evidence to justify this advice.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Our cluster RCT would support this recommendation, provided high indoor residual spraying coverage can be quickly achieved. Residual insecticidal activity of pirimiphos-methyl on the sprayed walls was observed up to 12 months after a single round of spraying. Following the decay in residual activity during the second year when no spraying was done, the effect of indoor residual spraying on entomological inoculation rates diminished and malaria prevalence increased but not to the level observed in the standard long-lasting insecticidal net control group, which had not received indoor residual spraying in year 1. A sustained effect on malaria transmission would require recurrent annual campaigns of indoor residual spraying.</p><p id="para420">This trial is the first to provide evidence to suggest that incorporation of the synergist PBO to long-lasting insecticidal nets provides improved community protection compared with standard pyrethroid-only nets against malaria transmission by pyrethroid-resistant vector populations. Previous small-scale experimental hut studies of PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets measured entomological outcomes such as mosquito mortality and biting rates. In Benin, these studies showed that Olyset Plus was more effective than standard Olyset Net against pyrethroid-resistant <italic>A gambiae</italic>, both before and after multiple washing of the nets.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> In Tanzania where <italic>A gambiae</italic> was still susceptible to pyrethroids, the differential effect between Olyset Plus and standard Olyset Net was less evident.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Parallel studies with a different type of PBO long-lasting insecticidal net (PermaNet 3.0) showed improved outcomes with the unwashed PBO net compared with the standard long-lasting insecticidal net, but in some studies the efficacy was lost after several washes.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Although these small-scale studies<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> indicate the potential of PBO nets, they could not capture the full effect of this new class of net on transmission, which is only understood at high coverage levels and in community randomised trials because of the additional community protection that arises from the reduction in mosquito life-span and population density, often called the vectorial mass effect.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> With the relatively high coverage and usage of long-lasting insecticidal nets achieved in the present trial (77% usage in the first year and 60% in the second year), we were able to observe a mass effect of the PBO nets on transmission, with concomitant reductions in mosquito density, sporozoite rate, and entomological inoculation rates.</p><p id="para430">Despite the 83% loss in PBO content after 21 months, the PBO and permethrin retained on the net remained highly effective against malaria infection and entomological inoculation rates throughout. By contrast, the loss of residual activity of the single round of indoor residual spraying of Actellic 300CS led to resumption of transmission and to increasing entomological inoculation rates and malaria prevalence in the second year. The PBO nets will be monitored during a third year to assess whether effectiveness is maintained at low PBO content. There was also a 42% loss of permethrin content in Olyset Plus and 22% in Olyset Net over the two years. The differential release rate of permethrin in the two nets has been observed in other studies, and it has been suggested in an earlier WHO review of Olyset Plus that the more effective performance of the PBO net is due to the higher release rate and surface concentration of permethrin in this net compared with Olyset Net.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Although this argument cannot be completely refuted by our data, the <italic>A gambiae</italic> and <italic>A funestus</italic> vectors in the Muleba area are highly resistant to pyrethroid and any difference in surface permethrin between Olyset Plus and Olyset Net in our trial is unlikely to result in differential mortality rate. A study has shown that under household conditions a 20-times increase in the surface content of permethrin on hand-treated nets causes no increase in mortality to free-flying pyrethroid-resistant <italic>A gambiae</italic>.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Furthermore, synergy tests with PBO showed that pyrethroid-resistant <italic>A gambiae</italic> from our study area are killed by a permethrin concentration they would normally survive if it were not mixed with PBO.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref></p><p id="para440">The more effective performance of PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets compared with standard long-lasting insecticidal nets in reducing the prevalence of malaria infection, together with no change in prevalence following the initial distribution and high usage of standard nets, suggests that insecticide resistance of the magnitude reported is compromising the effectiveness of standard pyrethroid nets in northwest Tanzania. A recent study in neighbouring Uganda reported no change in incidence of malaria before and after the distribution of standard long-lasting insecticidal nets.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Other studies have reported the failure of these nets to reduce entomological indicators after the standard long-lasting insecticidal nets developed holes.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> From our study design, it is not clear whether the standard nets still provide some degree of protection. Although a previous study in Muleba done in 2012 showed that users of standard long-lasting insecticidal nets were slightly better protected (OR 0&#x000b7;83) against malaria infection prevalence than non-users of nets,<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> this finding should be contrasted with the much larger effect of PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets versus standard nets (OR 0&#x000b7;37) in the present study. In areas with more moderate levels of pyrethroid resistance, standard nets still provide personal protection. A study in Malawi, for example, showed that standard nets reduced malaria incidence by 30% in children in an area where pyrethroid-resistant <italic>A funestus</italic> was the main vector.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> In Kenya, the use of standard nets provided 45% protection against the incidence of malaria infection as compared with those not using long-lasting insecticidal nets, but incidence still remained high in net users.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> The strength or intensity of resistance in the local primary vector species might be the factor defining the level of protection to be derived from standard long-lasting insecticidal nets.</p><p id="para450">Our study provides further insight into the question of whether indoor residual spraying and long-lasting insecticidal nets should be combined to accelerate the control of malaria. In a previous cluster RCT in Muleba, where conditions of high pyrethroid resistance and moderate usage of long-lasting insecticidal nets (50%), indoor residual spraying with the carbamate bendiocarb provided an added benefit (OR 0&#x000b7;43).<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> In the present study, a single round of indoor residual spraying with the long-lasting pirimiphos-methyl capsule suspension in combination with standard nets was sufficient to give long-term additional protection over two transmission seasons (OR 0&#x000b7;33), whereas the bendiocarb required two rounds to achieve an effect of similar size, owing to its shorter residual activity on walls.</p><p id="para460">The combination of indoor residual spraying of pirimiphos-methyl and PBO long-last insecticidal nets have been suggested to be antagonistic.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> This concern arose because pirimiphos-methyl requires oxidation by cytochrome P450 enzymes within the mosquito before it becomes toxic. Uptake of PBO from previous contact with Olyset Plus nets might potentially inhibit this activation process. Although the present cluster RCT neither confirmed nor disproved any antagonistic effect, it showed there was limited benefit to be gained from adding this indoor residual spraying product to PBO nets. Whether another indoor residual spraying insecticide, which does not require activation by cytochrome P450s, would prove an effective partner to PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets is not known. The present cluster RCT also implies that where indoor spraying with pirimiphos-methyl is being applied annually, the substitution of PBO nets for standard nets would provide little or no additional benefit. Considering the focal coverage of indoor residual spraying compared with the much wider coverage of long-lasting insecticidal nets in Africa, an important question from a public health standpoint is which strategy should be adopted in areas where standard long-lasting insecticidal nets might be losing effectiveness because of high intensity of pyrethroid resistance in the local vector? The substitution of PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets in such areas would provide a substantial benefit, similar to that which annual indoor residual spraying campaigns might provide.</p><p id="para470">This trial has several potential limitations. Buffer areas of 300 m were small compared with what has been used in other trials,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> which might not have totally prevented contamination. However, any spill-over would have lessened rather than increased the effect size between intervention groups. Additionally, the community was not masked to the indoor residual spraying allocation, which might have led to reduced child attendance at clinic sessions. However, such bias has not been observed and attendance was similar across all intervention groups. Furthermore, we used vector density in CDC light trap collections as a proxy to estimate entomological inoculation rate, rather than vector biting rate in human landing catches. The light trap approach is becoming more common in trials for pragmatic and ethical reasons; and although it could have led to error in the estimation of transmission intensity, it would not have affected the relative difference in entomological inoculation rates observed between the study groups. Finally, our trial was not powered to detect interactions.</p><p id="para480">In conclusion, this trial shows the residual efficacy of indoor residual spraying with pirimiphos-methyl for malaria control of over 1 year, and provides strong evidence for increasing the coverage of PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets over standard long-lasting insecticidal nets of pyrethroid to meet the increasing challenge of pyrethroid resistance and to improve personal and community protection from malaria, particularly in areas of intense pyrethroid resistance. As a consequence of the trial, WHO has made this policy recommendation.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref></p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref
