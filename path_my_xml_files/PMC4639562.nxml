This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose, four-period crossover study in opioid-dependent subjects with chronic pain receiving &#x0003e;100 mg oral morphine equivalents daily who experienced withdrawal following a naloxone challenge dose. The objective of the study was to determine if intravenous (IV) naloxone doses of 0.1 and 0.2 mg would produce a withdrawal response when coadministered with a 0.75 mg IV dose of buprenorphine. Fifteen subjects receiving 90&#x02013;1,260 mg oral morphine equivalents per day enrolled and completed the study. Precipitated withdrawal occurred in 13% (2/15) of placebo-treated subjects and 47% (7/15) of buprenorphine-treated subjects. When combined with the 0.75 mg dose of buprenorphine, a 0.1 mg dose of naloxone increased the incidence of precipitated withdrawal to 60%, and a 0.2 mg dose of naloxone increased the incidence to 73%. By 15 minutes postdose, the mean change in Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score from predose was 3.0 for placebo, 6.9 for buprenorphine, 9.8 for BN 0.1 mg, and 12.4 for BN 0.2 mg. The mean COWS score with each active treatment was significantly greater than placebo (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001), and the mean COWS score for each of the naloxone-containing treatments was significantly greater than for buprenorphine alone (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). Naloxone doses as low as 0.1 mg added an abuse-deterrent effect to a 0.75 mg IV dose of buprenorphine.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>opioid dependence</kwd><kwd>withdrawal symptoms</kwd><kwd>abuse-deterrent</kwd><kwd>buprenorphine</kwd><kwd>nalox-one</kwd><kwd>intravenous</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Opioid use and dependence has reached epidemic proportions in the United States.

In order to deter efforts to extract buprenorphine from commercial products for intravenous (IV) abuse, buprenorphine is combined with naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist that is poorly absorbed from the oral mucosa, but completely active on IV administration. Coadministration of IV naloxone and buprenorphine occupies the &#x000b5;-receptors first and reduces the pleasant effects of buprenorphine. In subjects receiving full &#x000b5;-agonists, IV naloxone will displace the substance from the &#x000b5;-receptor with resultant precipitated withdrawal. The inclusion of naloxone in buprenorphine&#x02013;naloxone (BN) combinations reduces the potential for parenteral abuse while maintaining the benefits of buprenorphine alone.<xref rid="b10-jpr-8-791" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-jpr-8-791" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Buprenorphine/naloxone buccal film (BBN; Bunavail<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc., Raleigh, NC, USA) consists of a small, bilayered dissolvable polymer film that adheres to the buccal mucosa, using the BioErodible MucoAdhesive (BEMA<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc.) technology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-8-791">Figure 1</xref>). The BEMA<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> technology considerably increases buprenorphine bioavailability and, compared with other routes of administration, BBN requires substantially lower doses of buprenorphine to manage patients with opioid dependence. Unpublished research associated with the development of BBN suggested that a buprenorphine dose as low as 0.75 mg may produce plasma concentrations comparable to published concentrations with a 2 mg dose of BN sublingual tablets (~1.0 ng/mL). Such a dose of buprenorphine would require the use of a naloxone dose lower than the 0.5 mg dose that is combined with the 2 mg dose of buprenorphine. This study was conducted to determine 1) the minimum effective dose of naloxone that produces a withdrawal response when administered with buprenorphine 0.75 mg in opioid-dependent subjects and 2) whether administration of buprenorphine 0.75 mg without naloxone produces a withdrawal response in opioid-dependent subjects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p>Men and women at least 21 years of age and generally in good health (ie, American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System Class I or II<xref rid="b12-jpr-8-791" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) were enrolled between July 18, 2011 and September 9, 2011.

An appropriate mixed-effect model was fit to the data, and model-based statistics (eg, least squares means and standard errors) were obtained and used to construct 95% confidence intervals for mean differences between the treatment groups. These comparisons were performed at each time point, as well as across time. The full model included factors for the overall mean, fixed effects due to sequence, treatment, period, time, and a random effect for subjects nested within sequence. Prior unpublished clinical research indicated that peak plasma buprenorphine concentrations &#x02265;1.5 ng/mL will be obtained from a 0.3 mg intramuscular dose and decline to &#x0003c;0.1 ng/mL 12 hours later.

The 0.75 mg dose of buprenorphine was selected after the results of developmental research suggested that this dose in the BEMA<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> delivery system could produce plasma concentrations similar to a 2 mg dose of BN sublingual tablets. Naloxone doses of 0.1 and 0.2 mg were chosen based on the precipitated withdrawal symptoms observed at these doses in methadone-maintained opioid-dependent subjects.<xref rid="b18-jpr-8-791" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b20-jpr-8-791" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>In our clinical experience, we have noted that there is often an inverse relationship between the opioid maintenance dose and the withdrawal-inducing naloxone dose; higher maintenance doses require lower doses of naloxone to induce withdrawal. There is, however, a minimum dose of antagonist required, and that may vary based on the type and dose of opioid; the duration of dependence; concomitant medications; age; and probably genotype.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that in opioid-dependent subjects, precipitated withdrawal can occur with a 0.75 mg IV dose of buprenorphine and that the frequency and intensity of withdrawal are enhanced by coadministration of naloxone doses of 0.1 mg (an 8:1 ratio) and 0.2 mg (a 4:1 ratio). Combining naloxone 0.1 or 0.2 mg with buprenorphine 0.75 mg appears to substantially decrease the potential for abuse compared with buprenorphine alone. During the initial 15-minute post-dose treatment period, the median change from baseline in COWS scores for both naloxone-containing treatments was similar (14.0 and 16.0) and greater than both buprenorphine alone (6.0) and placebo (0.0). The mean COWS total score changes were significantly superior to placebo for each of the active treatments (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001), and the naloxone-containing regimens (9.8 and 12.4) were significantly higher than buprenorphine alone (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).</p><p>The outcomes of the safety analysis were predictable. With respect to the incidence of AEs, BN 0.1 mg and buprenorphine alone were similar, and the risk of having an AE with both was slightly higher than placebo and slightly lower than BN 0.2 mg. Adding naloxone 0.1 or 0.2 mg to buprenorphine increased the incidence of moderately severe AEs and drug withdrawal syndrome compared with buprenorphine alone. While subjects in the naloxone-containing treatment groups had numerically higher Bad Effects scores than those receiving buprenorphine alone at 15 minutes postdose, overall results trended toward more AEs with higher naloxone doses, and the result was probably due to small sample size.</p><p>Our pharmacodynamic results partially align with prior work. For the naloxone-containing treatments, this study concurs with Strain et al,<xref rid="b19-jpr-8-791" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> who found significant withdrawal effects from naloxone 0.1 and 0.2 mg in methadone-maintained subjects. On the other hand, Strain et al<xref rid="b19-jpr-8-791" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> did not identify intramuscular buprenorphine (dose range 0.5&#x02013;8.0 mg) as an opioid agonist or antagonist and suggested a low potential for abuse, whereas our findings indicate that a 0.75 mg IV dose of buprenorphine can precipitate withdrawal. Since subjects in Strain et al&#x02019;s study<xref rid="b19-jpr-8-791" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> used methadone 20 hours before taking buprenorphine and took no other treatments in the predose period, it is possible that buprenorphine acted primarily as an opioid replacement for methadone. Although both studies demonstrated that small amounts of naloxone can induce withdrawal in opioid-dependent subjects, it is important to note that because our study included subjects on several different opioids, while Strain et al<xref rid="b19-jpr-8-791" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> studied subjects taking only methadone, the results are not directly comparable.</p><p>This study has some limitations. Specifically, no physiological measurements were made, and neither the Drug Effects Questionnaire nor the Opioid Agonist Scale was administered, immediately before the administration of IV rescue medication. Assessments for these parameters were made only at the protocol-specified time points even though many subjects were rescued before the 15-minute assessment. Therefore, potentially meaningful results &#x02013; such as the ratings for Turning of Stomach and Nervous for the active treatments versus placebo on the Opioid Agonist Scale, which might signal precipitated withdrawal &#x02013; probably reflect the combined effects of study treatment with hydromorphone and midazolam.</p><p>The results of this study demonstrate that among opioid-dependent chronic pain subjects who were receiving at least 100 mg oral morphine equivalents per day, a 0.75 mg IV dose of buprenorphine can precipitate withdrawal, and the incidence of buprenorphine-associated precipitated withdrawal increases over a period of hours after administration. However, a naloxone dose as low as 0.1 mg increases the incidence and severity of precipitated withdrawal over buprenorphine alone, providing an additional abuse-deterrent effect that is most significant in the first 15 minutes postdose. With respect to safety, the incidence of AEs with BN 0.1 mg was similar to buprenorphine alone, slightly greater than placebo, and slightly lower than with BN 0.2 mg. Compared with buprenorphine alone, the addition of naloxone to buprenorphine increased the incidence of moderately severe AEs (eg, fatigue, chills) and drug withdrawal syndrome.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. funded this study and paid consulting fees to LW, MS, and CU for its conduct and analysis.
