Preoperative preparation strategies, such as mechanical bowel preparation may disturb the well-established functional balances between enteric flora and normal large bowel function [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Bowel disorders may directly or indirectly affect health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and this may be reflected to proportional alterations in the scoring of standardized measurement tools, such as HRQoL questionnaires [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A validated instrument that assesses gastrointestinal function is the Gastro-Intestinal Quality Life Index (GIQLI) [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. GIQLI may offer valuable insight in rating postoperative gastrointestinal function status at CRC patients. The 30-item questionnaire (QLQ-C30) of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) has already widely assessed CRC patients&#x02019; HRQoL and it includes items on gastrointestinal function, such as the symptom domains &#x0201c;diarrhea&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;constipation&#x0201d; [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. HRQoL instruments may offer &#x0201c;functional surveillance&#x0201d; by monitoring, ranking and quantifying the &#x0201c;subjective&#x0201d; patient&#x02019;s symptoms.</p><p>Initial HRQoL postoperative deterioration and postcolectomy gastrointestinal disturbances are expected to be temporary enduring 3-6 months [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Interventional strategies and enhancing therapeutic regimens at the immediate postoperative period may have a soothing effect on patients&#x02019; symptoms. Probiotics are cultures of live microorganisms that might beneficially affect the host by improving the composition and the equilibrium of indigenous microflora [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Prebiotics are nondigestible ingredients (fibers) that reach the colon and serve as substrate for fermentation by probiotics and indigenous colonic bacteria to nutrients beneficially improving host health [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Synbiotics are the combination of probiotics and prebiotics and are believed to be more efficient in terms of gut health and function [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Administration of pro- and/or synbiotics may serve as one of the supportive modulating dietary supplement-based strategies in CRC patients [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Studies reporting on the effects of pro-/synbiotics on functional outcome, gastrointestinal symptoms and HRQoL after CRC surgery are rather scarce [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In an effort to clarify the effects of early postoperative administration of synbiotics on bowel functional outcome, as this is measured by gastrointestinal-oriented HRQoL instruments and domains, we prospectively carried out a randomized trial in a selected cohort of patients undergoing colorectal resection for cancer. This study aimed to justify the early postoperative use of oral synbiotics for the minimization of the adverse effect of surgery on the short- and mid-term gastrointestinal symptoms-associated HRQoL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a prospective, double-blind, randomized controltrial (RCT) of two groups.

The same standard peri-operative antibiotic chemoprophylaxis appropriate for colorectal resection (2<sup>nd</sup> generation cephalosporin and metronidazole first dose pre-operatively and additional doses until the end of the first POD) was delivered to both groups. Inpatient diet was controlled and did not differ between the groups. The percentages of patients subjected to adjuvant treatment were not different between the groups and none of the patients had pre-operative radiotherapy.

The beneficial action of probiotics supplementation in gastrointestinal disorders has been recognized. Restoration of gut balance, inhibition of the epithelial and mucosal adherence of pathogens, introduction of lower colonic pH favoring the growth of nonpathogenic species, and stimulation of immunity during or after antibiotic treatment through receptor competition may be related to the positive gastrointestinal traits and properties of pro-/synbiotics [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In keeping with our results, the use of pro-/synbiotics to postoperative CRC patients has been reported to be beneficial in alleviating gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, the first defecation time, abdominal pain and flatulence [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

Only one other group of investigators has utilized a general, non-specific HRQoL questionnaire in assessing probiotics effects at colectomized patients [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

Another limitation of our study is its complete clinical orientation in regards to outcome measures and the lack of any theoretical explanation that could be provided by associated laboratory or microbial assays. Albeit, it would be more compelling if supporting data regarding actual changes in the bowel microbiota had been included. It has been, though, sufficiently demonstrated that the use of probiotics after surgery has markedly improved intestinal microbial populations [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Although local immune function restoration by synbiotics is easily conceivable, improvement infunctional state may not be fully explainable. An explanation could involve immune-mediated neural local and systemic mechanisms [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Dendritic cells in the gastrointestinal tract are able to interact with commensal bacteria and the nerves embedded in the gut wall [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The vagus nerve has an important role in signaling from the gut to the brain and can be stimulated by bacterial products or inflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Synbiotics-induced modulation of vagal responses indirectly affecting the brain function itself may be speculated. Indeed, in our study, non-gastrointestinal GIQLI domains, such as emotional and social function were improved after synbiotics supplementation. Administration of a probiotic formulation has significantly attenuated psychological distress in human volunteers and reduced anxiety-induced behavior in a rat model [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><boxed-text position="float"><caption><title>Summary Box</title></caption><p><bold>What is already known:</bold></p><p>

</p></boxed-text><p>Probiotics may alleviate irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Bowel resections may induce an IBS-like transient gut dysfunction, both due to sensitive and motor disruptions of the visceral nerves, as well as changes in the bacterial ecosystem of the intestine. Implicating pathophysiological mechanisms may be similar. It has been suggested that the generation of nitric oxide (NO), a gas with immuno-modulating but also neuron-modulating properties, by lactobacilli could play an important role [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Synbiotics positive effects on neuro-motor/sensitive locoregional transmission may be more complex and needs further evaluation. The sustained positive effects of synbiotics over time in our study may be related to the early &#x0201c;conditioning&#x0201d; of bowel to a better state of function via its repopulation by the &#x0201c;non-pathogenic&#x0201d; microbiota and the restoration of a &#x0201c;better&#x0201d; mucosa. Nevertheless, these tempting speculations need further confirmation by additional studies.</p><p>Despite the tantalizing multitude of trials on the potentially positive role of pre-/pro-/synbiotics, a straightforward translation into a clinical evidence-based strategy remains still unlikely. Incorporation of pre-/pro-/synbiotics formulations in the perioperative management of the CRC patient could be fully supported if further evidence from RCTs with all clinical relevant end-points will be accumulated in the future.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>Conflict of Interest: None</p></fn></fn-group><bio id="d36e71"><p>Athens Medical School,
