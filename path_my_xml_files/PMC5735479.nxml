Thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB), a locoregional anesthetic technique, has been proven successful for postoperative pain management in different thoracic surgical procedures, such as thoracotomy, breast cancer surgeries. Clonidine, an adjuvant, in TPVB may enhance the quality and prolong the duration of analgesia. This prospective study was to evaluate the effectiveness of clonidine; administered with TPVB; in addition to conventional local anesthetic solution.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Fifty-two patients (25&#x02013;55 years) scheduled for breast cancer surgery under general anesthesia were randomly divided into Group A (<italic>n</italic> = 26) receiving preoperative TPVB at T<sub>3</sub> with clonidine added to local anesthesia solution and Group B (<italic>n</italic> = 26) receiving identical TPVB with local anesthesia but without any adjuvant. This was followed by balanced general anesthesia. A visual analog scale was used to assess pain postoperatively up to 48 h. Meantime to administration of the first dose of rescue analgesic was noted. Total dose of fentanyl consumption, hemodynamic parameters, and side effects were all recorded for each patient.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The dosage of fentanyl required in the intraoperative period was significantly lower in Group A. Mean time to administration of rescue analgesic was found to be significantly longer in clonidine group. Hemodynamics and side effects were quite comparable among two groups.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Clonidine as adjuvant in TPVB provided profound analgesia for up to 48 h postoperatively for patients undergoing breast cancer surgery without any appreciable side effects.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Anesthesia general</kwd><kwd>anesthesia local</kwd><kwd>clonidine</kwd><kwd>thoracic paravertebral block</kwd><kwd>visual analog scale</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>Postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery is strongly associated with increased morbidity, prolonged hospital stay, and hence, higher economic burden and patient's suffering.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] This excruciating pain is very often associated with chronic pain syndrome.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The paravertebral block is a popular analgesic modality for intraoperative and postoperative pain management in inguinal herniorrhaphy, lithotripsy, nephrectomy, hepatectomy, ventral hernia repair, gastrectomy,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and thoracotomy[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] with no opioid and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as side effects.</p><p>General anesthesia is currently the standard technique used for surgical treatment of breast cancer. However, general anesthesia alone has not sufficient control over postoperative pain.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) is a successful alternative to general anesthesia for breast cancer surgery.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Benefits include a prolonged postoperative pain relief, potential for early discharge, and reduction in postoperative opioid consumption and hence postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] It shortens the duration of hospital stay and hence cost constraints.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Chronic postsurgical pain is a common complication after breast cancer surgery. Preincisional paravertebral block before breast cancer surgery causes a significant reduction in acute as well as chronic pain.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The most commonly used drugs for PVB are bupivacaine, lignocaine, levobupivacaine, ropivacaine, and combination of these drugs.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Various adjuvants such as opioids,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] epinephrine,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] dexamethasone,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] magnesium,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] clonidine,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] etc., were added to local anesthetics in TPVBs to achieve quick, dense, and prolonged block, but the results are either inconclusive or associated with side effects.</p><p>Clonidine is a selective &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenergic agonist with some &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> agonist property. In clinical studies, the addition of clonidine to local anesthetic solutions when used in caudal block,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] brachial plexus block,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] axillary plexus block,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] paravertebral block,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] a reduced onset time, improved efficacy of the block during surgery, and extended postoperative analgesia is obtained.</p><p>Very few published clinical studies have evaluated clonidine in preincisional TPVB to assess its efficacy in prolonging duration of action of local anesthetic agents. The aim and objective of our placebo-controlled study were to compare the analgesic efficacy of clonidine as adjuvant to local anesthetic agent in TPVB for the patients undergoing general anesthesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>On getting approval from the Institutional Ethical committee, written consent was obtained from every patient. Totally 52 adult patients were randomly allocated into two equal groups (<italic>n</italic> = 26 in each group) using computer-generated random number list. From December 2013 to June 2015, female patients having American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II, aged 25&#x02013;55 years undergoing breast cancer surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled in the study. Patients of both the groups received a 19.5 ml of mixture of local anesthetic agents (lignocaine [2%] 6.5 ml; lignocaine [2%] with adrenaline 6 ml; bupivacaine [0.5%] 7 ml) as paravertebral block (TPVB). Group A received 0.5 ml (75 &#x003bc;g) clonidine with the above-mentioned local anesthetic mixture. Control means, Group B received 0.5 ml of normal saline instead of clonidine. In Group A, 6.5 ml lignocaine (2%), 6 ml (lignocaine [2%] + adrenaline [1:200,000]) solution, 7 ml bupivacaine (0.5%), and 0.5 ml clonidine mixture was prepared in the presence of resident doctor not taking part in the study. A similar process was maintained for Group B patients.</p><p>Patient refusal, noncooperative patients, pregnant or lactating mothers, patients with known allergy or contraindication to lignocaine, bupivacaine, clonidine; or with hepatic, renal or cardiopulmonary abnormality, alcoholics, and diabetics were excluded from the study. Patients having a history of significant neuropsychiatric or neuromuscular disorders were also excluded. Patients having infection at the site of injection, coagulopathy, and platelet count &#x0003c;100,000 mm<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>, or having seizure disorder were excluded from the study. Patients having gross anatomical abnormality of thoracic spine or vasomotor disturbances were also excluded from this study.</p><p>In preoperative assessment, patients were enquired about history of previous anesthesia, drug allergy. General and systemic examinations and assessment of the airway and spine were done. Preoperative fasting of minimum 6 h was ensured before operation in all cases. All patients received premedication of tablet alprazolam 0.5 mg and ranitidine 150 mg orally at the night before surgery.</p><p>Patients were brought to the observation room; baseline parameters such as heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial blood pressure (MBP), and oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were measured. After that, patient were shifted to operation theater and continuously monitored using Philips IntelliVue (MP20) monitor. A standard technique of paravertebral block was followed in every patient in the sitting position. The skin was infiltrated with 2.5 ml of 2% lignocaine, 2.5 cm lateral to the spinous process of third thoracic vertebra. A 17-guage Tuohy needle was inserted through the skin wheal till it contacted the transverse process of the thoracic vertebra. Needle was then redirected and walked off the cephalad edge of the transverse process and advanced till it reached paravertebral space which was identified by loss of resistance technique using air. This technique was applied in three consecutive levels (T<sub>3</sub>, T<sub>4</sub>, and T<sub>5</sub>). Previously, prepared local anesthetic mixture; drawn in identical looking syringes; was injected in the desired positions in divided doses. The anesthesiologist who performed the ipsilateral TPVB was not aware of the group allocation or the exact composition of the local anesthetic mixture that was being injected. He was also not involved in data collection. The study drug mixture was injected in small aliquots with repeated aspiration. The patient was then turned supine, and a standard technique of general anesthesia was performed in all patients.</p><p>Intravenous (i.v.) Ringer lactate started with the help of 18-guage cannula done previously. After 5 min, preoxygenation with 100% O<sub>2</sub>, premedication was given with injection glycopyrrolate (0.02 mg), injection fentanyl (100 &#x003bc;g) 3 min before induction. Induction was done with i.v. injection propofol (2 mg/kg). After that, atracurium (0.5 mg/kg) was given to facilitate laryngoscopy and intubation. Laryngoscopy, intubation, and cuff inflation were completed within 20 s in all cases. Muscle relaxation was maintained with intermittent i.v. atracurium (0.2 mg/kg) as and when required and controlled ventilation was maintained with 70% N<sub>2</sub>O in O<sub>2</sub> and isoflurane up to 1&#x02013;2 minimum alveolar concentration (under the guidance of bispectral index (BIS) monitoring) using anesthesia workstation. After completion of surgery, neuromuscular block was reversed with injection glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg and injection neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and extubated when adequate spontaneous ventilation was established and BIS &#x02265;70. After extubation, all patients were transferred to postanesthesia care unit (PACU) for observation.</p><p>The presence of hypertension or tachycardia (&#x0003e;20% of baseline) during anesthesia, while BIS was 40&#x02013;60 (i.e., within desired range), was attributed to insufficient analgesia and a bolus dose of fentanyl 1 &#x003bc;g/kg was given.</p><p>The time for PACU stay (admission-discharge from PACU) and hospital discharge (eye opening-discharge from hospital) and the incidence of adverse events were also recorded. Patients were considered ready for discharge from the PACU when the modified Aldrete post anesthesia score was &#x02265;9. Patients were transferred to ward after being discharged from PACU. For nausea and vomiting, ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg i.v was administered. All the patients were operated by the same surgeon.</p><p>The primary outcome of the study was the clinical efficacy of the paravertebral block during operation. Paravertebral block efficacy is defined as the intraoperative absence of significant (&#x0003e;20%) change in HR and MBP. This is measured with help of intraoperative fentanyl requirement. The time of administration of the first dose of rescue analgesic (injection diclofenac sodium 75 mg i.m.) following the performance of paravertebral block was taken as the duration of block. The magnitude of postoperative pain is assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS: 0 = &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; and 10 = &#x0201c;worst possible pain&#x0201d;) for postoperative 48 h. Postoperative pain was assessed using a VAS (VAS: 0 = &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; and 10 = &#x0201c;worst pain imaginable&#x0201d;). Hemodynamic changes and perioperative adverse reactions were also observed.</p><p>The sample size was estimated using first rescue analgesic requirement among two groups as the main primary variable. The average duration in each group was 29 h and to detect a difference of 10% (i.e., 2.9 h), at the <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 level, with a probability of detecting a difference, if it exists, of 80% (1&#x02212;&#x003b2; = 0.80). On the basis of the previous study assuming within-group SD of 7.5 h and we needed to study at least 24 patients per group to be able to reject the null hypothesis which will be increased to 26 patients for possible dropouts. Raw data were entered into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and analyzed using standard statistical software SPSS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> statistical package version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Values were expressed as number (%) or mean &#x000b1; standard deviation and/or standard error. Categorical variables were analyzed using the Pearson's Chi-square test. Normally distributed continuous variables were analyzed using the independent sample <italic>t</italic>-test. One-way anova test was used to determine the difference between the means of different independent groups. Nonparametric alternative Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-test was used to compare other variables in the study and control groups in different points of time. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS AND</sc> A<sc>NALYSIS</sc></title><p>We recruited 26 subjects per group, slightly more than the calculated sample size.
