Adalimumab is a recombinant IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to the tumour necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;) cytokine to block its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab has been shown to reduce disease symptoms for all approved therapeutic indications, to inhibit the progression of structural damage in rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis, and to induce and maintain clinical remission in adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, plaque psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Although targeted biologics, including adalimumab, have demonstrated safety and efficacy in the treatment of autoimmune disorders, their widespread application may be limited due to their high cost.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> With the expiration of patents on several biologics and more expirations anticipated soon, there is growing interest in the development of biosimilars, which are expected to be less expensive therapeutic alternatives to branded biologics.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The US Food and Drug Administration has developed an abbreviated and expedited pathway&#x02014;the 351(k) pathway&#x02014;for the approval of biosimilars<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and has released guidance for industry to support their development.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;8</xref> The European Union (EU) previously published guidelines for the development and approval of biosimilars.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>According to the guidance, biosimilars should be &#x02018;highly similar&#x02019; to the reference product with respect to quality attributes, notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and should have no clinically meaningful differences with respect to safety, purity and potency. Biosimilar guidance recommends a totality-of-evidence approach focused on stepwise development of a proposed biosimilar, which starts with the demonstration of similarity to the reference product based on analytical characterisation, pharmacological activity, pharmacokinetics (PKs) and pharmacodynamics (PD).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> This is followed by comparative clinical evaluation of the proposed biosimilar candidate in a sensitive population to demonstrate similar efficacy and safety at the same approved dose and route of administration as the reference product. Demonstration that the proposed biosimilar is not more immunogenic than the reference product is also required.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>There are several biosimilar candidates for inflammatory disease currently under development, including: SB2 infliximab biosimilar, SB4 etanercept biosimilar, SB5 adalimumab biosimilar (Samsung), BI 695501 adalimumab biosimilar (Boehringer Ingelheim), CT-P10 rituximab biosimilar (Celltrion), ABP 501 adalimumab biosimilar, ABP 798 rituximab biosimilar and ABP 710 infliximab biosimilar (Amgen). An infliximab biosimilar, CT-P13 (Remsima/Inflectra, Celltrion), has been approved for use in the EU, USA and Canada.</p><p>ABP 501 is a fully human recombinant monoclonal antibody with the same amino acid sequence, pharmaceutical form and dosage strength as adalimumab. It is, however, not formulated with the same excipients as adalimumab and includes different buffer components and stabilisers. ABP 501 is being developed for the same indications, dosages and route of administration as approved for adalimumab; the drug product is supplied as a sterile, preservative-free solution for administration by subcutaneous (SC) injection. Biologic products (proteins and their formulations) may have different bioavailability; the purpose here is to demonstrate PK similarity between the biosimilar and its reference product.</p><p>The totality of evidence available to date suggests that ABP 501 is similar to adalimumab. Results from analytical studies that evaluated identity, general properties, primary and higher-order structure, carbohydrate structure, isoelectric profile, purity and impurities, and thermal-forced degradation profiles have confirmed ABP 501 to be structurally similar to adalimumab.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Results from functional characterisation studies have demonstrated that ABP 501 and adalimumab have similar binding affinity to TNF&#x003b1; and comparable inhibition of TNF&#x003b1; activities in vitro.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Additionally, ABP 501 and adalimumab have shown comparable induction of effector functions as seen from the results of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-mediated cytotoxicity assays.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> ABP 501 has also been shown to be similar to adalimumab with respect to binding to a panel of Fc receptors, including Fc&#x003b3;RIa, Fc&#x003b3;RIIa, Fc&#x003b3;RIIIa (158V), Fc&#x003b3;RIIIa (158F) and FcRn.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The similarity in binding to FcRn is particularly relevant because binding of mAbs to FcRn affects their clearance.</p><p>This phase I study was conducted to evaluate the PK similarity of ABP 501 with adalimumab. The adalimumab comparator product was sourced from the USA and the EU; both are manufactured by the same company and are structurally and functionally equivalent.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The purpose of this phase I study was to demonstrate the PK equivalence of ABP 501 to adalimumab (USA) and adalimumab (EU) in healthy subjects after a single 40-mg SC dose. The secondary objectives were to assess safety, tolerability and immunogenicity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><p>Healthy adults, 18&#x02013;45&#x02005;years of age with a body mass index of 18&#x02013;30&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> at screening were eligible. Subjects were excluded if they had an infection (bacterial, viral, parasitic, systemic fungal or other opportunistic pathogen) &#x02264;30&#x02005;days of investigational product (IP) administration, had tuberculosis (latent or active) &#x02264;6&#x02005;months of screening, or reported a current malignancy or a malignancy &#x02264;5&#x02005;years (with the exception of excised nonmelanoma skin cancer), were receiving or had received any investigational drug or device &#x02264;30&#x02005;days (USA) or 90&#x02005;days (EU) or five half-lives (whichever was longer), or had previously received adalimumab or any product considered to be a biosimilar to adalimumab. All subjects provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a randomised, single-blind, single-dose, three-arm, parallel-group study conducted at one clinical pharmacology unit (CPU) in the USA and one CPU in the EU using adalimumab sourced from each region. The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with good clinical practices and EU clinical trial directives. The study protocol was approved by an independent ethics committee or institutional review board at each site prior to study initiation. A total of 203 subjects were enrolled in the study. Screening occurred &#x02264;28&#x02005;days before dosing. Eligible subjects were admitted to the CPU on day 1 and randomised in a ratio of 1:2 by the two regions such that the ratio of subjects to receive ABP 501 40&#x02005;mg (Amgen), adalimumab 40&#x02005;mg (USA; AbbVie) or adalimumab 40&#x02005;mg (EU; AbbVie) was the same before dosing on day 1. Subjects were discharged from the CPU on day 2, and returned to the CPU over the next 63&#x02005;days for safety evaluations and blood sampling for PK and antidrug antibody (ADAb) assessments. Subjects were monitored throughout the study for adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory results, concomitant medication use and vital signs. Samples for PK assessments were collected on days 1 (predose, 1, 4, 8, 12&#x02005;hours post dose), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 16, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57 and 63 (end of study). ADAb tests were performed at prespecified visits, including days 1 (predose), 16, 29 and 63. Serum concentrations of adalimumab and ABP 501 were determined using validated electrochemiluminescent (ECL) assays. The ECL assay method was based on the Meso Scale Discovery platform using an anti-ID mAb to capture ABP 501 and adalimumab reference product from test samples and a second ruthenium-labelled anti-ID to detect the bound test products. The binding ADAbs were determined using a validated ECL assay that detects all antibody classes.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;15</xref> A cell-based assay was used for detecting neutralising ADAbs using a TNF&#x003b1;-responding cell line that results in a TNF&#x003b1;-induced phosphorylation of nuclear factor &#x003ba;B (NF&#x003ba;B). TNF&#x003b1; was added to induce phosphorylation of NF&#x003ba;B in the cell line, which was inhibited by addition of known amount of drug. In the presence of the neutralising ADAbs the phosphorylation of NF&#x003ba;B is restored. Briefly, cells were incubated with the drug, serum sample and recombinant human TNF&#x003b1; and lysed, followed by measurement of the phospho-NF&#x003ba;B. This bridging assay could detect all subclasses of bivalent or multivalent ADAbs; the ADAb response to ABP 501 and adalimumab occurred with a wide range of subclasses. Whereas the assay may not detect the monovalent IgG4 isotype, there are other subclasses of ADAbs present in much higher concentrations in the serum than monovalent IgG4 antibodies. The assay was validated with a tolerance of 25&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/mL of drug; the highest observed maximum observed concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) in this study was below 6.0&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/mL. Therefore, drug interference was not expected from the collected samples. Additionally, the neutralising antibody cell-based bioassay developed for this study was expected to detect all classes of antibodies that inhibit the biological activity of the drug, including monovalent IgG4 subclass antibodies. Assay validation included determination of drug tolerance by adding excess drug as described by Shankar <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The specificity of the assay was tested with a rabbit-positive control; other anti-TNF biologics do not interfere with the assay. The assays were validated using both adalimumab (USA) and adalimumab (EU) and shown to be of equal sensitivity to both materials. Serum concentrations of each of the three test molecules were determined and summarised for all subjects who received any IP and had at least one reported serum concentration of adalimumab reference products or ABP 501.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Investigational product</title><p>All subjects receiving adalimumab (USA) or adalimumab (EU) received the IP from a single lot for each region. All subjects in the ABP 501 study arm received IP from a single lot in each region although different lots were used between the USA and the EU.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate that the PK of ABP 501 is similar to adalimumab (USA) and adalimumab (EU), as assessed by the area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC<sub>inf</sub>) and the C<sub>max</sub>. Secondary objectives included assessment of the time to C<sub>max</sub> (t<sub>max</sub>), AUC from time 0 to the last quantifiable concentration (AUC<sub>last</sub>) of ABP 501 compared with adalimumab (USA) and adalimumab (EU), as well as evaluation of safety, tolerability and immunogenicity.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Sample size was estimated using previous bioavailability studies with adalimumab; &#x0223c;198 subjects were to be enrolled in this three-arm study (66 per arm). The PK parameter population consisted of all subjects with an evaluable adalimumab or ABP 501 serum concentration-time profile; this population was used for the primary analysis of PK equivalence. Sensitivity analyses were planned to assess PK equivalence using the per-protocol PK parameter population, and in subpopulations of region and binding ADAb-negative and ADAb-positive subjects. The safety analysis set consisted of all subjects who received any amount of IP.</p><p>PK parameters were calculated using non-compartmental techniques (WinNonlin Professional Network Edition, V.5.2, Pharsight, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) for all subjects with an evaluable adalimumab or ABP 501 serum concentration-time profile. PK similarity was assessed by comparing the 90% CIs for the geometrical mean (GM) test-to-reference ratios for AUC<sub>inf</sub>, C<sub>max,</sub> and AUC<sub>last</sub> with the protocol-specified bioequivalence criteria of 0.80 and 1.25; AUC<sub>last</sub> was evaluated to fully assess exposure to the IP. Prior to statistical modelling, PK parameters were log-transformed. Point estimates and 90% CIs for the mean difference in logarithmic PK parameters were estimated using an analysis of covariance model for comparisons of ABP 501 and adalimumab (USA), ABP 501 and adalimumab (EU), and adalimumab (USA) and adalimumab (EU), adjusted for region (USA and EU) and weight. Point estimates and 90% CIs for GM ratios (GMRs) were then calculated by transforming back to the original scale. To establish PK similarity, the 90% CIs of the GMRs were to be within the standard equivalence criteria of 0.80 and 1.25.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
