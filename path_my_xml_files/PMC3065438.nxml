Approximately 25% of breast cancer patients develop lymphoedema following breast cancer treatment, and the risk increases every year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Thus, breast cancer-related lymphoedema is one of the main complications and most dreaded sequela of breast cancer and its therapies, and can have long-term physical and psychosocial consequences for patients. It consists of the accumulation of lymph in the interstitial spaces, principally in the subcutaneous fatty tissues, caused by a defect in the lymphatic system. It is marked by an abnormal increase of tissue proteins, oedema, chronic inflammation and fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Three stages of lymphoedema have been described. Stage I presents with pitting and is considered reversible; some women in this stage have no increased arm girth or heaviness and no signs of pitting oedema. As the oedema progresses, it becomes brawny, fibrotic, non-pitting and irreversible (stage II). In advanced lymphoedema (stage III), which rarely occurs following breast cancer treatments, cartilaginous hardening occurs, with papillomatous outgrowths and hyperkeratosis of the skin. Problems associated with lymphoedema include: pain, altered sensations such as discomfort and heaviness, difficulties with physical mobility, physiological distress, recurrent infections and social isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Lymphoedema has been shown to significantly negatively affect quality of life, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and it is a traumatic condition because apart from the inconveniences and functional impairment that starts at the arm level, the aesthetic factor plays a determinant role in the loss of self-esteem, which causes psychological sequelae in many patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Some quality of life scales are available to determine how the affected patients define, admit and explain their personal experience regarding the symptoms they experience and in which way these symptoms have an influence on the degree of functionality regarding daily activities and interpersonal relationships. In 1980 The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORT) created a group to study the quality of life in patients with cancer and developed the EORT Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORT QLQ-C30). Subsequently EORT QLQ-BR 23 was developed to assess the specific aspects of lymphoedema in patients with breast cancer. The latter evaluates the influence of surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormone therapy on the homolateral arm of the treated breast, the corporal image, sexuality, perspectives of future, symptoms of the disease and function of the upper extremity, evaluating a total of 23 items. Both questionnaires are validated for the Spanish population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In a study in which 744 patients with breast cancer were assessed with these quality of life scales, some imbalances regarding the quality of life in those patients with lymphoedema were found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Definitively, lymphoedema is one of the most severe sequelae that affects health-related quality of life in treated breast cancer patients.</p><p>Lymphoedema treatment remains a problem even with modern treatment modalities, since clear therapeutic protocols do not exist. Several methods have been used with varying results. Among them the physical treatment introduced by Winiwarter (1892), improved by Vodder (1932-1960) and later named Complex Physical Therapy (CPT) by Foldie, has been recommended by several groups of experts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Complex Physical Therapy, also called Complex Decongestive Physiotherapy, is a treatment regimen that includes meticulous skin hygiene, manual lymph drainage, bandaging, exercises and supportive garments. This therapy is carried out in two phases; in the first phase (treatment), the aim is to mobilize the lymph accumulated, reduce the fibrous tissue and improve the health of the skin using mainly daily Manual Lymph Drainage (MLD) during a variable period of time. In addition, patients receive instructions regarding skin care, prophylactic measures and the use of multilayer bandages. In the second phase (maintenance), compression bandaging, regular physical exercise and weight control are used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Although the first results have been optimistic, in randomized controlled clinical trials, the CPT has not clearly demonstrated any superiority when compared with other simpler alternatives and no study has evaluated patients' treatment preferences or the effects of the treatment on quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Several authors suggest that this technique should be reserved only for selected cases. The proof of concept for using CPT to stimulate the lymph drainage has a profound physiological basis, but the quality of evidence on the relative effectiveness of therapies is poor. On the other hand, the fact that CPT implies several techniques (manual lymph drainage, skin care and multilayer compression bandaging followed by a compression garment to reduce oedema and therapeutic exercises) makes it difficult to recognize which of them is the truly effective one in the treatment of lymphoedema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Manual Lymph Drainage (MLD) is a massage technique that involves the skin surface only and follows the anatomic lymphatic pathways of the body. A session of manual lymph drainage starts centrally in the neck and trunk to clear out the main lymphatic pathways, thereby facilitating drainage from the arm. Unlike other types of massage, it produces neither blush nor pain and it does not even have a stimulant effect. To successfully complete this technique, a knowledge of the anatomical distribution of the lymphatic and superficial ganglions and of their interconnections is necessary. The MLD is carried out in a descending manner to facilitate the flow of the lymph from the affected areas to those not affected. It is possible to carry out MLD in the case of late or latent lymphoedema three days postsurgery if contraindications do not exist. There are several schools (Vodder, Leduc, Foldie), but they all agree on the fundamental aspects. The MLD must be applied by a physical therapist trained for it. Its application demands a long period of time (from 45 to 60 min.) and it is usually performed once a day (four or five times a week) for 2 to 4 weeks. A study carried out by Leduc and Colls demonstrated that the greatest reduction of the oedema is obtained in the first week of treatment; during the second week the results became stable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The results from several case studies (including over 400 patients) clearly showed that treatment with MLD and compression bandaging had a volume-reducing effect. However, the interpretation of these results is limited due to the methodology used, and their design did not offer the possibility to investigate the extent to which MLD treatment contributed to the reduction of lymphoedema.</p><p>Only three small, randomized, controlled trials have assessed MLD for arm lymphoedema but contradictory results have been found. Two of the studies showed statistically significant differences in the reduction of oedema that favored the group on combined treatment with MLD, despite the fact that in one of the studies, MLD was only administered for one week. The first study, conducted in 35 women, compared compression bandaging plus MLD with compression bandaging alone (level III evidence) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. There was a trend in mean volume reduction and a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in the percentage reduction in volume in favour of the combined treatment. In the second trial, Manual Lymph Drainage plus a compression garment use was compared with sequential pneumatic compression plus compression garment use; no difference was detected between the treatment groups (level II evidence) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The third published randomized trial, involving 42 women with modest stage I or II lymphoedema compared standard therapy alone with standard therapy plus MLD and training in self-massage (level I evidence). Standard therapy included the use of a custom-made sleeve-and-glove compression garment worn during the day, instruction in physical exercises, education in skin care, and information and recommendations about lymphoedema. Both groups obtained a significant reduction in limb volume, a decrease in discomfort and increased joint mobility over time. However, no significant differences in objective measures regarding change in arm volume or subjective measures of symptoms related to lymphoedema were found between the 2 groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This study investigated the effect of eight sessions of MLD over two weeks, so the MLD course was relatively short and the study group was limited to those with mild to moderate swelling (20-30% of difference). Information about quality of life was gathered using the questionnaire EORT QLQ-C30, but the results were not considered in the final evaluation. On the other hand, there is no evidence that shows that the effect of MLD is permanent - because previous studies measured the volume directly after the conclusion of MLD - or if the MLD can be effective in decreasing the symptoms, in spite of not obtaining an improvement in volume reduction. Therefore, the utility of MLD as part of the Physical Complex Therapy has turn out to be relevant, given the exclusive dedication of the therapist that it entails and the extra cost in relation to the potential health benefits for patients.</p><p>The aim of this study is to analyze the short-term and long-term effectiveness of Manual Lymphatic Drainage (MLD) in the treatment of postmastectomy lymphoedema in order to reduce the volume of lymphoedema and evaluate the improvement of the concomitant symptomatology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>Single centre, randomized, controlled study of two Physical Complex Therapies.

The condition is considered to be lymphoedema when there is a difference of at least 200 ml between the volume of the affected arm (measured by circometry and calculated using the formula of the truncated cone) and the volume of the contralateral arm. A response is considered to be good when a reduction of at least 20% of the volume is achieved after the treatment of lymphoedema in the affected extremity compared to baseline.

Take measurements of both upper extremities. If the response to the treatment is good, the patient will be encouraged to continue complying with treatment. The patient's diary is reviewed. A second quality of life questionnaire is provided. The treatment is continued at home. If the response to the treatment is poor, the patient is included again in an outpatient treatment for a month so that if the patient has previously received TH now he/she would be treated with TH + DL and if he/she has been previously treated with TH + DL now she would be treated with DL.

If it is proven to be effective, more staff trained in this technique should be provided to health centres so that affected patients can have access to it easily.</p></sec><sec><title>Relevance of the project in terms of its bibliometric impact</title><p>The systematic review of literature on the management of lymphoedema was limited by the lack of prospective randomized trials evaluating different treatment options. In 2006, a Cochrane systematic review about physical treatments for reducing and controlling lymphoedema of the extremities selects only three of the articles reviewed on the basis that they are randomized controlled trials that had a follow-up period of at least six months. However, because they did not study the same treatment intervention, the data could not be subsequently pooled. Some evidence suggests that treatment involving a combination of MLD and compression therapy yields reduced oedema volume compared to compression therapy alone if volume is measured directly after the conclusion of MLD (Evidence grade 3 = limited scientific evidence). The existing randomized clinical trials are conducted with small samples and only a few studies include long term monitorization. None of the studies performed are blind and only rarely is an analysis of the rate of "lost to follow-up" patients performed. Before this therapy can be recommended, more randomized controlled trials with an adequate sample size, where MLD short-term and long-term treatment effects could be more closely studied, are needed (SBU Alert Report 2005-04. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.SBU.SE/ALERT">http://www.SBU.SE/ALERT</ext-link>).</p><p>Moreover, groups of experts have highlighted the lack of interest in researching the impact of the physical and psychosocial difficulties of these patients and their quality of life. In conclusion, the need for performing well-designed, randomized trials of the physical treatments and their health impact is a priority.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MLM and MAH, physicians specialized in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, contributed with the initial approach of the idea and literature review.
