Treatment can be classified into operative (open or minimally invasive/percutaneous) and non-operative. Post operative splintage can be divided into cast immobilisation and functional bracing.</p><p>Traditionally open surgical repair of a ruptured Achilles tendon has been the first choice of treatment due to low re-rupture rates and the possibility for functional post-operative splintage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. But, 34% of patients treated with open repair suffer from complications other than re-rupture, especially wound infection and adhesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In general, the outcome after treatment of a re-rupture is poor, but results following treatment of a deep infection are devastating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Therefore an effort should be made to prevent infectious complications. Many articles on different types of minimally invasive repair techniques (using limited incisions or performed percutaneously) of ruptured AT's have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. But to date, only two 2 randomized trials have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In Khan's review on randomized trials complications other than re-rupture were substantially reduced with percutaneous repair techniques but data were very limited. Data on complications using limited incision techniques are even more scant. As minimally invasive techniques differ it is hard to compare other techniques with these numbers. An advantage of most minimally invasive techniques is smaller scars and less damage to the delicate blood supply of the AT. Importantly, in most patients minimally invasive surgery does allow functional rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Patients treated by functional rehabilitation after operation rather than cast immobilisation are reported to have a shorter in-patient stay, less time off work and a quicker return to sporting activities. In addition, lower complication rates, including re-ruptures, are reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The main advantage of conservative, i.e. non-operative treatment is elimination of wound complications and intra-operative sural nerve damage. Complications other than re-rupture are reported to reduce to 3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. But, conservative treatment with cast immobilisation has shown to increase the re-rupture rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and cast immobilisation induces delayed recovery due to calf muscle weakness as a result of long immobilisation of the ankle joint. In contrast, conservative treatment by functional bracing does allow immediate weight bearing, preventing calf muscle weakness and enabling fast recovery. In three studies conservative treatment of AT rupture with functional bracing did not result in increased re-rupture rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. But since only one of these is a randomized trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], more high quality data from randomized prospective studies is needed. We hypothesized that compared to surgical treatment, conservative treatment with functional bracing will reduce the absolute risk of complications other than re-rupture with 30%.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Design of study</title><sec><title>Context</title><p>The efficacy of minimally-invasive surgery versus functional conservative treatment of acute subcutaneous Achilles tendon ruptures will be studied in a randomized trial.

The same protocol for the operative procedure was used by all surgeons and residents in the participating hospitals. Also, before study participation all surgeons were familiar with the operative procedure. A less than 5 cm longitudinal incision is made over the posterior aspect of the affected leg just proximal to the rupture site. The incision is slightly medially placed. The subcutaneous fat is divided and the peritendineum opened. Then a Bunell type suture is placed though the proximal end of the Achilles tendon (PDS 1.0). With a hollow mandarin the suture is tunnelled to the lateral aspect of the calcaneal bone and guided out through a 5 mm stab incision. A hole is drilled through the calcaneal bone 1 cm distal to the tendon insertion (exit through 5 mm stab incision medially). The PDS in guided though the hole. Now the mandarin is used to guide the suture back to the proximal site of the tendon. After the foot is placed in plantar flexion the suture is tied. After wound closure a cast is applied with the foot still in plantar flexion. After one week a tape bandage is applied for a total period of 6 weeks. In the first two weeks the tape bandage is supported by a 2 cm heel raise. The following 2 weeks the heel raise is reduced to 1 cm. The last two weeks the heel raise is removed (tape bandage will be renewed every time the heel raise is changed). Full weight bearing is allowed during the 6 weeks of tape bandage, not allowing sporting activities or walking stairs on tiptoes. Crutches are advised in the first week of casting, thereafter for maintenance of balance, but only if necessary.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Surgical repair technique.

After one week a functional bracing system (Vacoped, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] is applied for 6 weeks. The Vacoped bracing system (Company OPED, Valley, Germany) is a multifunctional splint consisting of several components. The essential parts are the dorsal and ventral shell, the vacuum cushion with changeable terry cloth covers, the belts with security locks and the removable sole. Prior to study use the brace was successfully used in a small pilot series and an instructions meeting on brace application was held in all participating hospitals. In the first two weeks the brace is fixed in 30&#x000b0; plantar flexion. The following 2 weeks in is in rigid 15&#x000b0; plantar flexion. The last two weeks the brace is dynamic from neutral position to 30&#x000b0; plantar flexion.

With conservative treatment using this new type of functional bracing we hypothesized a 30% reduction in the absolute risk for complications other than re-rupture. This risk reduction is similar to the risk reduction obtained in the systematic review on open versus conservative treatment by Khan: risk of complications for open repair being 34% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Prospective data on the risk of complications of minimally invasive repair is very scant. The Khan review provides the best empirical estimate for the complication risk associated with surgical repair. Therefore we decided to use this risk estimate of complications of open repair for the sample size calculation. With a one-sided &#x003b1; of 0.05, a statistical power of (1-&#x003b2;) of 0.80, and an attrition rate of 10% we need to randomize at least 36 patients per treatment arm.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study is primarily designed to evaluate the effectiveness of conservative treatment of acute AT ruptures, using a functional bracing system, in reducing complications other than re-rupture. A comparison is made between this functional bracing system and a minimally invasive operative repair of acute AT ruptures. Both treatment options used in this comparison allow immediate full weight bearing so none of the patients is denied the purported advantage of a functional after treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>There have been randomized clinical trials on treatment of acute Achilles tendon rupture but the methodological rigour is often low. There is a need for more rigorous designed studies on AT rupture treatment as this subject is still very much under debate. By publishing our protocol we wish to show our care for a profound design and methodological quality of our protocol. Moreover, when the design of a study is published it will help to achieve transparency about why and how studies are undertaken. The publication of a study design may help to reduce the problem of publication bias, i.e. selective publication of positive associations and disregarding negative and weak associations, prevent unnecessary duplication of research efforts and duplicate publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. To our knowledge, there has never been a design study published regarding treatment of AT ruptures. By making this design study we wish to contribute to more profound research on AT rupture treatment and prevent publication bias for this open-labelled randomized trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>RM main author of study design.</p><p>GK first initiated the trial and participated in designing the treatment protocol for operative and non-operative treatment.</p><p>EV first initiated the trial.
