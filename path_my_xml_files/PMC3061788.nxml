The aim of this study was to determine the impact of continuous control of cuff pressure (P<sub>cuff </sub>) on microaspiration of gastric contents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Patients requiring mechanical ventilation through a PVC-cuffed tracheal tube &#x0003e;48 hours were eligible. Patients were randomly allocated to continuous control of P<sub>cuff </sub>using a pneumatic device (Nosten<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) (intervention group, <italic>n </italic>= 61) or routine care of P<sub>cuff </sub>(control group, <italic>n </italic>= 61). Target P<sub>cuff </sub>was 25 cmH<sub>2</sub>O in the two groups. The primary outcome was microaspiration of gastric contents as defined by the presence of pepsin at a significant level (&#x0003e; 200 ng/ml) in tracheal secretions. Secondary outcomes included incidence of microbiologically confirmed VAP (tracheal aspirate &#x0003e;10<sup>5 </sup>cfu/ml), incidence of tracheobronchial colonization, and tracheal ischemic lesions as defined by a macroscopic score. Pepsin was quantitatively measured in all tracheal aspirates during the 48 hours following randomization. A patient was considered as having abundant microaspiration when &#x0003e;65% of tracheal aspirates were pepsin positive. Patients remained in a semirecumbent position in bed, and a written enteral nutrition protocol was used. All analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patient characteristics were similar in the two groups. The pneumatic device was efficient in controlling P<sub>cuff</sub>. Pepsin was measured in 1,205 tracheal aspirates. The percentage of patients with abundant microaspiration (18% vs. 46%, <italic>P </italic>= 0.002, OR (95% CI) 0.25 (0.11 to 0.59)), pepsin level (median (IQ) 195 (95 to 250) vs. 251 (130 to 390), <italic>P </italic>= 0.043), and VAP rate (9.8% vs. 26.2%, <italic>P </italic>= 0.032, 0.30 (0.11 to 0.84)) were significantly lower in the intervention group compared with control group. However, no significant difference was found in rate of patients with tracheobronchial colonization (34% vs. 39%, <italic>P </italic>= 0.7) or in tracheal ischemia score (4.5 (1 to 6) vs. 4.5 (1 to 7), <italic>P </italic>= 0.9) between the two groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Continuous control of P<sub>cuff </sub>is associated with significantly decreased microaspiration of gastric contents in critically ill patients.</p></sec></body></article>
