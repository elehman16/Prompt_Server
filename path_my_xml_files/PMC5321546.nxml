Integrating CBT for depression with adherence counseling using the &#x0201c;Life-Steps&#x0201d; approach (CBT-AD) has an emerging evidence base. The aim of the current study was to test the efficacy of CBT-AD.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Methods</title><p id="P3">We conducted a three-arm RCT (N=240 HIV-positive adults with depression), comparing CBT-AD to Life-Steps integrated with information and supportive psychotherapy (ISP-AD) (both 12 sessions), and to ETAU (1 session Life-Steps). Participants were recruited from three sites in New England area, two being hospital settings, and one being a community health center. Randomization was done via a 2:2:1 ratio, using random allocation software by the data manager, in pairs, stratified by three variables: site, whether or not the participant was prescribed antidepressant medications, and history of injection drug use. The primary outcome was adherence assessed via electronic pill caps (MEMs) with correction for &#x0201c;pocketed&#x0201d; doses. Secondary outcomes included depression, plasma HIV RNA and CD4. Follow-ups occurred at 4, 8 and 12 months. We used intent-to treat analyses with ANCOVA for independent-assessor pre-post assessments of depression and mixed effects modeling for longitudinal assessments. Clinical Trial Registration: NCT00951028, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00951028">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00951028</ext-link>), closed to new participants.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Findings</title><p id="P4">The period of recruitment was February 26, 2009 to June 21, 2012, with the 12-month follow-up period extending until April 29, 2013. There were no study-related adverse events. CBT-AD (n=94 randomized, 83 retained) had greater improvements in adherence (Est.=1&#x000b7;00, CI=0&#x000b7;34, 1&#x000b7;66, p=0&#x000b7;003) and depression (CES-D Est.=&#x02212;0&#x000b7;41, CI=&#x02212;0&#x000b7;66, &#x02212;0&#x000b7;16, p=0&#x000b7;001; MADRS Est.=&#x02212;4&#x000b7;69, CI=&#x02212;8&#x000b7;09, &#x02212;1&#x000b7;28, p=0&#x000b7;007; CGI Est.=&#x02212;0&#x000b7;66, CI=&#x02212;1&#x000b7;11,-0&#x000b7;21, p=0&#x000b7;005) than ETAU (49 randomized, 46 retained) at post-treatment (4-month). Over follow-ups, CBT-AD (84 retained) maintained higher adherence (Est.=8&#x000b7;93, CI=1&#x000b7;90, 15&#x000b7;97, p=0&#x000b7;013) and lower depression on the CES-D (Est=&#x02212;3&#x000b7;56, CI=&#x02212;6&#x000b7;08, &#x02212;1&#x000b7;05, p=&#x000b7;005) and CGI (Est.=&#x02212;0&#x000b7;39, CI=&#x02212;0&#x000b7;77, &#x02212;0&#x000b7;18, p=&#x000b7;04) than ETAU (86 retained); however, not for the MADRS. There were no significant differences between CBT-AD and ISP-AD (97 randomized, 87 retained) for the post-treatment or follow-up (86 retained) analyses. There were no intervention effects on HIV RNA or CD4, though a higher percentage (91&#x000b7;4%) than expected was virally suppressed at baseline.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Interpretation</title><p id="P5">Integrating evidenced-based treatment for depression with evidenced-based adherence counseling is helpful for individuals living with HIV/AIDS and depression.

The arms were 1) CBT-AD, 2) ISP-AD and 3) ETAU as described below. Major assessments were conducted at baseline, 4 months (post-treatment / acute outcome, after all of the intervention sessions ended), 8 months, and 12 months. Visits took place at one of three HIV clinics (two hospital-based, one community health center) in New England. All participants completed an informed consent process with a study clinician prior to undergoing any study procedures. All procedures were reviewed and approved by the respective Institutional Review Boards: Massachusetts General Hospital, Fenway Health, and The Miriam Hospital.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P10">To be eligible, individuals needed to: a) be 18 years of age or older; b) be HIV-positive, c) have been prescribed ART for at least 2 months, and d) have either a current diagnosis of depression (i.e. current major depressive episode) or carry a diagnosis of depression in that they were prescribed an anti-depressant medication for depression and have at least some residual clinically significant depressive symptoms (having met full clinical criteria prior to antidepressant initiation, having a baseline CGI rating of at least 2). Participants were excluded for the following conditions: active, untreated, unstable, major mental illness (i.e., untreated primary psychosis or mania) that would interfere with study participation, any primary psychotic disorder, or a past year history of either CBT or intensive intervention for medication adherence. A total of 381 individuals enrolled in the study, with 7 either lost to retention or withdrawn and 134 excluded prior to randomization per inclusion/exclusion criteria (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Recruitment was conducted at each of the participating HIV treatment clinics, as well as through community self-referral via advertisements in newspapers and on-line venues. Two of the HIV clinics (MGH and Fenway) also utilized a depressive screening instrument (i.e., PHQ-2)<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> with their patients, with scores of 2 or greater indicating possible depression, and therefore an invitation to be contacted to assess interest in participating. Interested participants completed an initial telephone screen, with those potentially eligible scheduled for a full baseline assessment to determine eligibility with a study assessor.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Randomization and masking</title><p id="P12">Randomization was conducted for 240 adults (94 CBT-AD, 97 ISP-AD, 49 ETAU). The randomization scheme was 2:2:1, such that the CBT-AD and ISP-AD conditions would have twice as many participants as the ETAU condition. We stratified randomization based on three variables which could potentially affect study outcomes so that they were relatively equally distributed across study conditions 1) current or prior problem with injection drug use (because our prior study of those with injection drug use histories had slightly different outcomes in follow-up than our initial trials of patients in HIV care), 2) whether or not participants were prescribed medications for the treatment of their depression, and 3) study site. The randomization sequence was generated by the study data manager using Random Allocation Software,<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> that generated block-randomized lists of condition and unique identifier pairs based on parameters provided by the study.

Life-Steps involves problem-solving and cognitive behavioral steps to facilitate adherence, as well as provision of tools including programming an electronic device (i.e., study provided watch or participant&#x02019;s own cell phone) that would sound alarms as a dosing reminder and other reminder techniques.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> For all participants, a provider letter was also mailed documenting results of the baseline psychiatric evaluation and discussing involvement in the study (blinded to randomization status).</p><p id="P14">All study clinicians (Masters or Doctoral-level psychologists) were trained to administer each of the three conditions and attended weekly clinical supervision where cases were discussed and adherence to condition protocols was reviewed, including via audio review of sessions.</p><sec id="S12"><title>Comparison condition 1: ETAU</title><p id="P15">All participants had three enhancements to their usual care: 1) a single-session adherence counseling intervention following the Life-Steps,<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> approach 2) a provider letter sent after the baseline visit and, 3) at follow-up visits, assessors would make referrals for depression treatment if clinically indicated. The Life-Steps approach involves a brief discussion about the patient&#x02019;s adherence leading up to the visit, beliefs about medications, education about the importance of adherence and how medication resistance can develop, and making a plan and a back-up plan for 11 problem-solving / cognitive-behavioral steps needed for optimal adherence.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Comparison condition 2: ISP-AD</title><p id="P16">The second comparison condition was designed to examine whether CBT-AD would be different from a time-matched, alternative psychosocial treatment for depression that also integrated Life-Steps for adherence counseling. We chose information with supportive psychotherapy because it can be useful in the management of depression concurrent with medical illness.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The 11 session ISP-AD manualized intervention developed by our group, with each session lasting up to 60 minutes, included first reviewing the patients&#x02019; medication adherence from the time since the last visit, continuing any problem-solving or revisions to the plans via Life-Steps, providing information on healthy living with HIV and then supportive psychotherapy for depression. The goals of supportive psychotherapy were to provide a participant-guided treatment that focused on participants current concerns and aimed to help build self-esteem and enhance adaptive coping using strategies such as normalization, containment and encouragement.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Informational topics also included nutrition, sleep, and depression in the context of HIV, as well as topics related to managing HIV such as an overview of HIV, managing HIV medication side effects, and the impact of risky behaviors, such as drug use, on adherence.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>CBT-AD</title><p id="P17">The 11-session counseling modules, each lasting up to 60 minutes, included 1) introducing the patient to the nature of CBT and motivational interviewing for behavior change (&#x02248; one session); 2) increasing pleasurable activities and mood monitoring (&#x02248; one session); 3) thought monitoring and cognitive restructuring (i.e., adaptive thinking; &#x02248; five sessions); 4) problem-solving as a skill to aid in decision-making processes, particularly those related to HIV self-care (&#x02248; two sessions); and 5) relaxation training (&#x02248; two sessions). The therapist and participant were able to structure the number of sessions spent on each module to meet the participants&#x02019; individual needs. For all modules participants were encouraged to apply these skills generally (i.e., via the use of home practice), but they were linked to HIV-care whenever possible.

All depression assessments were conducted by a study assessor (Masters or Doctoral-level psychologist, clinical social worker) trained via audio-tape supervision in the assessment protocols. An independent assessor (IA), blinded to treatment condition, conducted the interviewer-administered assessments of depression (see below) at the 4-month, 8-month, and 12-month outcome assessments.</p><p id="P19">Adherence was measured using electronic pill caps (MEMS, AARDEX) as an index of medication adherence following procedures that we have done in our prior trials.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> MEMS cap data were read and reviewed at all study visits and allowed for participants to add any doses taken where the participant knew they did not use the cap, and a dose was considered missed if the participant did not take it within two hours of their designated target time. A percentage was calculated via proportion of meds recorded as taken. MEMs caps were given at the baseline assessment, and baseline MEMs scores were calculated at the randomization visit, approximately two weeks later. Follow-up visits used MEMs data for two weeks prior to that visit.</p><p id="P20">The interviewer-administered MADRS<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and the clinical global impression scale (CGI)<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> were used to assess for severity of and distress/impairment due to depressive symptoms at baseline, and months 4, 8, and 12.

With a two-tailed p-value of 0&#x000b7;05, and assuming a standard deviation in change in adherence outcome of 19% over 4 months, group sample sizes of 80 patients per arm (i.e., the experimental intervention and the time-matched control) would give 90% power to detect a 10% or greater difference in adherence at 4-months in a pair-wise comparison. Additionally, unequal group sample sizes of 80 (CBT-AD and ISP-AD) and 40 (ETAU) would provide at least 88% power to detect a between arm difference of 12% or greater. Given that the ISP-AD arm is more intensive than the E-TAU arm, fewer participants were needed for the comparison to ETAU. Attrition was lower than had been anticipated, and hence the ultimate sample size was greater than 80, 80, and 40, respectively. For viral load, all values less than 75 copies/ml were reclassified as 75 copies/ml. The outcome was then log transformed for continuous analyses as well as categorized as detectable (&#x0003e;75 copies/ml) vs. undetectable (&#x02265;75 copies/ml).</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Analytic strategy</title><p id="P24">We conducted two sets of analyses (using SAS 9&#x000b7;3) for each of the two planned comparisons (CBT-AD to ISP-AD, and CBT-AD to ETAU) to correspond to the two study steps: 1) Acute outcome (month 4, when the interventions ended), 2) Follow-up: whether benefits would be maintained post-intervention. Comparing CBT-AD to ISP-AD and to ETAU separately allowed for maximizing power with the 2:2:1 randomization scheme. To fully allow for intent-to-treat principles, we conducted Markov Chain Monte Carlo multiple imputation (with 100 imputations) to provide conservative estimates for missing data. Analyses that did not impute missing values revealed an identical pattern of results. For acute outcomes, missing data was less than 10% across all variables and time points. For follow-up outcomes, missing data was larger (&#x0003c;20%) due to study attrition.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Acute outcome analyses</title><p id="P25">For the MEMs-based adherence and CES-D scores, which were collected at each study visit (13 assessments for the CBT-AD and ISP-AD arms [randomization visit, 11 treatment visits, 4-month outcome], and 7 assessments for ETAU arm [randomization visit, 6 visits prior to 4-month outcome, 4-month outcome]), mixed effects models with indicators for random intercept and slope were used in order to model the correlation between time points for each participant.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> First, the models contained a term for treatment condition and time. In these models, the parameter estimate for condition refers to the difference in unstandardized units between the two conditions and the parameter estimate for time refers to the change in units from one measurement time point to the next. Second, the mixed effects models included an interaction term. In these analyses, a significant effect for the interaction would indicate superiority of one condition over the other.

In these analyses the parameter estimates refer to the magnitude of difference in unstandardized units between the two conditions. For each set of analyses, model-adjusted means or proportions and standard errors were estimated and presented.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Follow-up analyses</title><p id="P27">We evaluated the follow-up data using mixed effects modeling with the 4, 8, and 12 month data for all study outcomes with indicators for random intercept and slope.</p><p id="P28">These models first contained terms for baseline values, treatment condition, and time. Then, the interaction of time by condition, which measured whether the differences between treatment conditions were maintained over time, was added to each model. Accordingly, during follow-up, a non-statistically significant difference for the interaction term would indicate that the intervention condition maintained its gains over the comparison group, in that any changes post-treatment would be similar across the two conditions.

While CBT is the most widely studied psychosocial treatment for depression, there is also evidence that supportive psychotherapy and other structured short-term psychotherapies can also be useful approaches.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> In fact, in one of the original NIMH trials of CBT for depression, interpersonal psychotherapy was originally designed as comparison condition<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and now it is considered a validated treatment.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Those who were assigned ISP-AD received adherence counseling via the Life-Steps approach in each and every treatment session, and problem-solving and brief cognitive restructuring about pill-taking-- cognitive behavioral techniques &#x02013; were allowed for regarding adherence goals. Hence, while we may conclude that CBT-AD is better than a less intensive single-session adherence intervention for individuals with HIV and comorbid clinical depression, the results of the current study do not support the specificity of CBT-AD compared to another psychotherapy for depression that takes the same time and integrates active adherence counseling with depression treatment. It may be that integrating Life-Steps, a cognitive behavioral intervention for adherence, with whatever psychotherapy one is receiving for depression, could result in adherence gains that are parallel with depression improvements.</p><p id="P52">The present study also did not find effects on viral load or CD4. This may be due to the relatively high proportion of participants in the trial who were virally suppressed at baseline, and hence there would be a ceiling effect on improvement. Additionally, the sample size was based on studies of the association of adherence to viral load in samples not selected for depression, and this may have affected the original power analysis. In the past several years, we have seen in the U.S. larger rates of viral suppression in individuals in HIV care, likely due to the increased potency of ART.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> One study of a similar approach employed here, but delivered via computer<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> that selected only individuals with detectable viral loads, did find effects on viral load. Accordingly, future studies of this intervention should target subjects who are currently not suppressed or those with recent virologic failure due to non-adherence. CD4 counts, high at baseline, did not significantly improve here, contrary to our prior study of individuals with HIV and a history of injection drug use.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p id="P53">There are several limitations to note. As described above, the inclusion of persons with suppressed virus at baseline, limited our biological findings. A second limitation is that the MEMS caps, although an objective but imperfect indicator of adherence, could underestimate adherence if participants did not use the cap, or overestimate adherence if participants opened the cap but did not take their pill. Regarding the potential to underestimate adherence, our approach involved querying participants at the visits to learn if they recalled times when they took pills but did not open the bottle.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Additionally, for individuals that were previously using pill-boxes, having to put one medication in the MEMs container could have been disruptive, which could result in the intervention effects being mitigated. All of the sites were medical centers in the Northeast, all of which have services available to enhance adherence as part of standard of care. This may limit generalizability. Treatments were also delivered under the supervision of PhD-level therapists with extensive knowledge of the intervention. This may limit the exportability of the treatment, and hence implementation studies are needed.</p><p id="P54">This adequately powered trial demonstrated that CBT-AD is a useful approach to improving adherence and decreasing depression in individuals with HIV. Though a brief intervention from the perspective of psychotherapies, it may be considered an intensive intervention when integrated into HIV care settings where patients have limited resources, competing priorities for care, and comorbid conditions. Accordingly, a cost-effectiveness analysis is another important next step in examining the utility of the intervention. Given the high prevalence of depression with HIV, and the demonstrated association of depression with non-adherence, approaches that address both of these problems may help both the quality of life as well as the ability to adhere to self-care regimens for those living with HIV.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S26"><p id="P55">Funding for this project came from a National Institute of Mental Health grant R01MH084757 to Dr. Steven A.

Cognitive behavioral therapy is a well-studied non-pharmacotherapy treatment for depression. However, there is a general lack of efficacy studies on psychosocial treatments for depression and adherence in individuals living with HIV. We conducted literature review searches at various time points using Pubmed and Psychinfo, searching for terms such as &#x0201c;HIV and depression treatment&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;HIV and CBT&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;HIV and behavior therapy&#x0201d; &#x0201c;HIV and psychological treatment&#x0201d; during the study planning phases, and also kept track of emerging studies as they were available while planning and implementing this trial.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Added value of this study</title><p id="P76">This study found that for individuals living with HIV who have a clinical diagnosis of depression, 12 sessions of counseling integrating cognitive behavioral therapy for depression with a cognitive behavioral approach to enhancing antiretroviral medication adherence (Life-Steps), was more effective than a single session of adherence counseling and a provider letter documenting one&#x02019;s depression. These gains were evident at the end of treatment (approximately 4 months), as well as over follow-up (8- and 12-month follow-up). This approach was not superior, however, to another manualized 12-session treatment for depression (information with supportive psychotherapy) that also integrated the same cognitive behavioral approach to adherence counseling. The current findings support the utility of integrating this cognitive-behavioral adherence counseling (Life-Steps) into evidenced-based psychosocial treatments for depression. Accordingly, mental health providers who treat patients living with HIV may wish to integrate this counseling into their treatment in order to improve medication adherence, which may, in turn, improve HIV outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Implications of all the available evidence</title><p id="P77">Mental health care providers should consider adding adherence counseling into their psychiatric treatment of patients with HIV who have comorbid depression and poor HIV medication adherence. Policy implications require cost-effectiveness analyses as this study showed that a more intensive treatment for adherence/depression was more effective than a less intensive approach. Implementation and effectiveness trails are also needed.</p></sec></boxed-text></floats-group></article>
