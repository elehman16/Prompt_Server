The BP monitor linked to a mobile phone wirelessly, via Bluetooth. The components of the intervention were</p><p><italic>Home BP monitoring</italic>: Participants were asked to record their BP as agreed with the healthcare team, or more frequently as they wished. Guidance was initially to record BP twice in the morning and twice in the evening for a week in line with the European guideline on BP monitoring,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref> to build a baseline average. Thereafter, they were asked to take weekly measurements preferably at different times of day if their average BP was within the recommended range; however, if they had made any lifestyle or medication change which would impact on their BP, they were asked to measure their BP for a more intensive period of monitoring to allow the rolling average to change and to more quickly assess the effect.</p><p><italic>Transmission of data</italic>: This simply required the phone to be switched on and to have a signal when the BP measurement was taken. Participants just had to apply the cuff and press a button on the BP monitor. The reading and transmission occurred automatically. Mobile phone problems did not lead to the loss of data because all readings were stored in the monitor and any untransmitted readings were sent when the next reading was taken.</p><p><italic>Feedback to patient participants (closed loop feedback)</italic>: In addition to optionally accessing their BP record on-line, participants could also opt to receive reports via text message or email. These gave advice on the current status of their BP based on the average of the last 10 readings, and whether they should contact their doctor or nurse. Reports were generated every 10 readings or weekly, whichever was sooner, with a reminder to check BP if this had not been done. These reports could reassure them that their average BP was within target (&#x0003c;135/85 mm Hg) or tell them that their BP average was improved on the last report, but not yet to target and to maintain current therapy, or that their BP was not at target and that they should contact their clinician. If an individual BP reading was very high (&#x0003e;220/120 mm Hg) an immediate text or email report was generated reinforcing the written advice in the patient information leaflet to rest for 30 min, check again and contact the practice if BP remained very high.</p><p><italic>Sharing the readings with the healthcare team</italic>: Members of the healthcare team were able to access the records of their patients online via a secure login to a summary screen which listed their patients, their average BP over the last 10 readings and the date of their last reading. Average BPs outside the recommended limits (set at 135/85 mm Hg for the study) were highlighted. Clicking on the each individual patient led to lists or graphs of all their readings. Clinicians could then check their patients' electronic general practitioner (GP) record to see if there had been recent advice regarding medication or lifestyle change and if not, could contact the patient to make a change. Clinicians were recommended to check the website weekly, but the frequency of log-on could be chosen by them.</p><p><italic>Usual care</italic>: Participants allocated to the usual care group were asked to continue to attend the practice for BP checks according to the usual routine of the practice. If they were already home monitoring they were not discouraged from continuing.</p><p><italic>All participants</italic>: For all participants, the GP/practice nurse were informed that the ambulatory monitoring used to screen for eligibility for the HITS trial had shown that their average BP was above the target range, but they were not given the actual reading. All participants were given an information pack containing a range of publicly available leaflets on hypertension management and lifestyle modification.</p></boxed-text></p><p>Patients allocated to the usual care arm were told that the ABPM showed that their BP was uncontrolled and that they should see their general practitioner (GP)/practice nurse for further management, otherwise they should receive standard care for hypertension from their GP or nurse who were asked to aim for a target surgery BP of &#x0003c;140/90&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg based on UK guidelines (current at the time).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></p><p>In order to maintain blinding of outcome assessment, the patients were asked not to reveal their treatment group allocation to the research nurse undertaking the assessment; however, it is not possible to rule out unblinding where the patients did not adhere to this.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Cost estimation</title><p>Mean costs per patient were estimated from an NHS perspective. The trial collected the data of the number of consultations with a GP, practice nurse or district nurse (separately for practice, telephone or home visits), NHS24 (emergency out-of-hours telephone helpline) contacts, out-of-office consultations with the Lothian Unscheduled Care Service and accident and emergency visits. These were collected at follow-up by a research nurse with access to patient records. If the patient did not attend the follow-up, but agreed for the data to be collected, the research nurses completed the data from the records in their absence. Data on each drug issued to each patient, the dose per day and the number of days issued were taken from GP records from randomisation until 6&#x02005;months after randomisation.

The decision therefore was made not to include these costs in the base-case analysis as there was a risk of overwhelming the more robust estimates of other cost factors with unreliable, and likely unrelated, admission costs.

The only other significant cost element difference was approximately half an additional practice nurse phone consultation. No other cost element was significantly different between the groups.

The increase in costs was predominantly driven by the estimated intervention costs (&#x000a3;70.77) and increased costs associated with telemonitored patients using on average approximately one additional GP surgery consultation and half a practice nurse surgery consultation. Although telephone consultations with the practice nurse and their costs also significantly rose (by approximately half a call on average), the costs for these were relatively small and had little impact on total cost.</p><p>The trial found a significant increase in the dosages of medication issued<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> which may explain some of the additional consultations as they were likely to have been required for prescribing and monitoring of patients during transition to a new drug/dose. Interestingly, however, medication costs did not rise significantly in spite of this intensification. This is due to higher dosage pills often costing less per dose than lower dosage pills when costs of generic treatments are used for these estimates.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> There is a risk that the way in which the medication costs were estimated (selecting a generic where available and selecting the lowest cost option that matched dosing recommendations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) could have contributed substantially to this finding. However, such an approach does at least attempt to estimate the difference in costs attainable under best practice assuming this includes the selection of the lowest cost drug based on active agent.</p><p>It should be noted that our accompanying qualitative study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> suggests that over the trial, clinicians found face-to-face communication with patients was not necessary to support BP telemonitoring and that they substituted some of these forms of consultation with other modes of communication: mainly telephone and on two occasions email. Both patients and clinicians thought that in the longer term, BP telemonitoring would reduce the need for surgery visits. Thus, a reduction in the GP consultations element of the overall costs may be realised in the longer term. This has been found in previous studies of telemonitoring where consultation costs were lower.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28 R29 R30">28&#x02013;30</xref></p><p>The remaining cost elements were also non-significantly different between groups and played relatively minor roles in the overall total cost differences.</p><p>In sensitivity analysis, hospital costs were non-significantly higher on average in the intervention group than in the control by &#x000a3;105.47 raising differences in mean total costs to &#x000a3;214.70. However, the differences in costs of hospital admissions were exaggerated by the inclusion of an outlier patient in the intervention arm unrelated to BP management. With these excluded, hospital costs were similar in both arms with an insignificant difference of &#x000a3;16.56. In both cases, uncertainty surrounding hospital cost dominated uncertainty surrounding total cost figures. Hence, when hospital admissions are included in total costs estimates, we are no longer confident that the cost of resource use outside of the intervention service itself was higher or lower in the intervention group because secondary care costs have the potential for the largest financial impact on the NHS. However, there are strong reasons to doubt that any of the hospital admissions observed during the trial were related to the patient's current BP, even those of cardiovascular nature. This is because it is possible that the events resulting in hospital admission may well have been set in motion prior to the onset of the study though we lack data to confirm this either way. A recent meta-analysis also found no link between home BP telemonitoring and short-term rates of adverse events.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></p><p>Dividing per patient mean differences in costs by per patient mean differences in blood-pressure reduction yields an ICER of &#x000a3;25.56/mm&#x02005;Hg. While on the face of it modest, there are to our knowledge no criteria available to assess the cost-effectiveness of the value of a BP-point reduction, hence no formal assessment of whether this constitutes evidence that the intervention is cost-effective or not can be offered. It should also be recognised that &#x000a3;25.56/mm&#x02005;Hg is a ratio rather than a tariff. It is perhaps more accurate to say that over the first 6&#x02005;months of the intervention we estimate that BP will reduce on average by 4.51&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg at a cost of around &#x000a3;115.32/patient.</p><p>It is not known if the improved BP control found in the trial would be sustained once telemonitoring ceased. However, if sustained over 10&#x02005;years, this type of reduction would be expected to lead to a &#x0003e;15% reduction in risk of stroke and &#x0003e;10% reduction in risk of coronary heart disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> The costs incurred in the intervention period were low relative to the several thousand pounds likely to be spent on a cardiovascular event.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> For example, Youman <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> calculated the cost of a stroke to the NHS in 2001 to be &#x000a3;15&#x02005;306 over 5&#x02005;years. Should the BP-point reduction be sustained beyond the observed 6&#x02005;months examined here, the expected reduction in cardiovascular events<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> may mean that the intervention is dominant over usual care in the long term that is to say, both more effective and cost saving. Estimating this would require a study with a much longer follow-up or, perhaps more realistically, mathematical modelling of longer term health costs and benefits. Longer term follow-up of the participants is planned to determine the extent to which the difference in systolic BP persists after the end of the trial, which will be vital data to underpin such modelling.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Unlike many previous studies, we used ABPM to measure BP. This is a considerable strength as ABPM is considered the gold standard for BP measurement and lends greater generalisability to the results as it is now a recommended practice in the UK to diagnose high BP with ABPM.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> The generalisability is further strengthened by the pragmatic setting, intention to treat analysis, the broad socioeconomic profile of participants and the absence of restrictions on participant age (oldest patient was 95) or exclusion on the basis of maximal treatment. The results may be less generalisable outside of a UK context as this is beyond the scope of this analysis.</p><p>The analysis was not part of the original trial protocol. It was, however, conceived prior to the start of the primary clinical analysis; the usual limitations of post hoc analysis are less relevant. This did, however, mean that the cost analysis was restricted by the variables available in the dataset and that some cost elements have not have been accounted for, most notably outpatient visits. On the other hand, the variables that were collected were similar to those used in other trials and are likely to be robust as surveys were completed with access to medical records.</p><p>It was not possible to control for baseline cost in multivariate analysis as these were not recorded. Instead, the analysis relies on baseline SABP and health-related quality of life and on the randomisation process in its place. While it is possible that a different result may have been observed had baseline costs been available for use, we do not anticipate that this would have differed considerably from the results presented here as it is not unreasonable to expect both of these factors to be highly correlated with baseline costs. Selection bias is very unlikely to have occurred during the randomisation/minimisation process as this service was provided remotely by clinical trials unit.</p><p>It was not possible to determine if &#x000a3;25.56/mm&#x02005;Hg reduced would be considered cost-effective or not. Using the NICE criteria for cost-effectiveness, the value of interventions is interpreted in terms of long-term cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> The EuroQol EQ-5D survey from which QALYs can be calculated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> was included in the trial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> However, without sufficient power or follow-up to detect major cardiovascular events, differences in quality of life observed in the trial period would be unlikely to manifest themselves in an asymptomatic condition. Moreover, given that the participants were not blind to the intervention, this might be open to bias. Hence, QALYs could not reliably be estimated in this context. They are arguably better left to be determined by longer term modelling.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Comparisons to similar studies</title><p>Caution is advised when comparing studies of telemonitoring as the services within which the telemonitoring is nested often vary substantially and it is the combined effect of the telemonitoring and other interrelated services which are observed.</p><p>Two recent systematic reviews of BP telemonitoring found few studies which included measures of healthcare utilisation and/or cost. Of those which did, office visits are frequently the only healthcare resource considered outside of the direct cost of the technology issued<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref> and none were based in a UK setting, though a UK study by McManus <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> suggests that an accompanying cost-effectiveness analysis is forthcoming.</p><p>Meta-analyses of home BP telemonitoring versus usual care by Omboni <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> find home BP telemonitoring to be associated with increased medication use, reduced office visits and increased overall healthcare costs, though medication use and overall healthcare casts suffered from heterogeneity between studies. While the increased prescribing is in line with our own findings, the decreased office visits are not. As a result, Omboni <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> attribute the rise in healthcare costs to the cost savings in terms of office visits being more than offset by equipment costs where our findings suggest an increase in both.</p><p>An explanation for this disparity may come from the heterogeneity of the services being delivered alongside the telemonitoring. For example, McManus <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> showed that adding a medication self-titration plan to BP telemonitoring produced similar reductions in BP to our study, but found no increase in face-to-face consultations with physicians. This lends strength to the possibility that many of the increased GP surgery visits observed in this trial were required for prescribing.</p><p>Comparisons of healthcare costs with studies outside of the UK can also be problematic as different social insurance systems jeopardise cross-border generalisability; indeed, Omboni <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> attribute the heterogeneity in their analysis of healthcare costs to this issue.</p><p>Madsen <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> compared the cost-effectiveness of a similar intervention with usual care from a Danish health service perspective. In contrast to our findings, they found higher consultation and medication costs in their control arm. Again, these were more than offset by equipment costs leaving total costs significantly higher in the intervention arm; however, SABP was non-significantly higher in the intervention arm by 2.8&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg. The authors attribute the raised medication costs to significantly increased prescribing of AT2-antagonists in the control arm. This intensification in prescribing in the usual care group rather than the intervention group as in our trial may go some way to explaining the lower reduction in BP observed. However, the fact that point estimates for SAPB improvement in Madsen <italic>et al</italic>'s study were still in favour of the intervention suggests that medication prescribing may not be the only factor influencing BP.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, although more expensive to the NHS than usual care, telemonitoring of BP in primary care was more effective at reducing BP during the 6&#x02005;months of intervention. These costs may be recuperated in the long term as a result of prevention of future cardiovascular events if the reduction in BP is maintained. Further research is required to determine if the BP improvement is sustained and, if so, what impact this has on cost-effectiveness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e231" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-002681.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e232" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-002681.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> BMcK, JH, SW, CP and PP designed the trial.
