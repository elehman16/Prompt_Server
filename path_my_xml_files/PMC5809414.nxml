To evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of SR-0379 for the treatment of leg ulcers, a physician-initiated, phase I/IIa, first-in-patient clinical study was designed. A multi-center, double-blind, randomized clinical study was conducted from October 2015 to September 2016. The inclusion criteria for leg ulcers were (1) diabetes or critical limb ischemia and (2) wound size &#x0003c;6&#x02009;cm in diameter. Twelve patients were randomized into four groups and administered 0.02%, 0.1%, or 0.5% SR-0379 or placebo treatment on skin ulcers once per day for 28 days. Efficiency was evaluated by determining the rate of wound size reduction as a primary endpoint at 4 weeks after the first treatment compared with the pre-treatment wound size. As a secondary endpoint, the DESIGN-R score index, time to wound closure, and the 50% wound size reduction ratio were also evaluated. The safety of SR-0379 was evaluated during the study period. In the evaluation of efficiency, the skin ulcer reduction rates at the last evaluation were 44.73% for the 0.02% SR-0379 group, 68.25% for the 0.1% group, and 71.61% for the 0.5% group, compared with 9.95% for the placebo group. Six adverse events were reported in four patients, of which one occurred in the placebo group, and causal relationships to study drugs were denied for all six events. Treatment with SR-0379 for chronic leg ulcers was safe, well tolerated, and effective.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Dermatology: peptide drug development for skin ulcers</title><p id="Par2">Chronic leg ulcers result in substantial impairment of patient quality of life with a socioeconomic impact both in terms of medical care and missed work days. A teams led by Hironori Nakagami at Osaka University originally identified a functional peptide, SR-0379, and evaluated the safety and efficacy of SR-0379 for the treatment of leg ulcers in a physician-initiated, first-in-patient, a multi-center, double-blind, randomized clinical study. In the evaluation of efficiency, the skin ulcer reduction rates were improved for the SR-0379 treated groups in a dose-dependent manner, compared for the placebo group with no causal adverse events. Since treatment with SR-0379 for chronic leg ulcers was safe, well tolerated, and effective in this initial clinical trial, the clinical trial on next stage will be designed toward peptide drug development.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Chronic leg ulcers have a significant socioeconomic impact both in terms of medical care and missed work days and result in substantial impairment of patient quality of life.

Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> displays the study flow chart. All patients fulfilled the eligibility criteria. However, because one patient was excluded due to contracting pneumonia before treatment with SR-0379, 12 patients were randomized to receive treatment with the placebo or one of three doses of SR-0379 (0.02%, 0.1%, or 0.5%) for 28 days. One patient stopped skin ulcer treatment with SR-0379 (0.02%) on day 23 and was withdrawn; SR-0379 efficiency, safety, and pharmacokinetic was still evaluated at day 24. Ultimately, the patient was judged to be included in the full analysis set (FAS) for the efficiency. Thus, all 12 patients provided data for the FAS.

In our case, the percent decrease in wound size after 4 weeks of treatment was defined as a primary endpoint because a previous report suggested that early changes (1 week or 4 weeks after treatment) in wound area reduction (%) were predictive of complete healing at 16 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> According to another report, 58% of patients demonstrating size reduction greater than the 4-week sample median achieved final healing, compared with only 9% of patients below the 4-week median, and wound area was reduced by 82% at 4 weeks in patients who achieved healing, compared with a 25% decrease at 4 weeks in patients who did not heal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> In this study, the average wound size decreased in the SR-0379-treated group in a dose-dependent manner, which strongly supports the potential effects of SR-0379 on wound healing. In this study, several secondary exploratory endpoints were assessed to identify reliable biomarkers for wound healing. Among them, the DESIGN-R score was more reliable than the quantification of local bacterial cultures or the evaluation of general improvement. The Japanese Society of Pressure Ulcers originally developed this system as a tool to score the severity of pressure ulcers and monitor their healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> As it is useful to evaluate wound healing, clinical evidence for the DESIGN-R score will be required to predict wound healing together with clinical trials of SR-0379. We also sought to evaluate the management of local infection; however, the quantification of local bacterial cultures was not useful in this study because infectious wounds with clinical signs (erythema, edema, warmth, etc.) were excluded. According to guidance from the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF), clinically infected diabetic foot wounds require anti-microbial therapy with systemic or topical treatment for foot care management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> To evaluate the potential anti-microbial action of SR-0379, the inclusion criteria will be expanded to include wounds with signs of mild clinical infection</p><p id="Par14">In the safety assessment, there were no concerns in the closed patch test, and four patients had a total of six adverse effects after SR-0379 treatment; however, a relationship with SR-0379 treatment was denied. Treatment with SR-0379 did not induce any local adverse effects (i.e., pain, rubor, or calor) or yield any systemic blood data because serum levels were very low. This suggests that SR-0379 is a very safe drug for patients. Recently, another anti-microbial peptide, LL-37, was similarly evaluated for venous leg ulcers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> The study design consisted of a 4-week randomized double-blind treatment phase with LL-37 (0.5, 1.6, or 3.2&#x02009;mg/mL) or placebo. Similarly, there were no safety concerns regarding local or systemic adverse events. In terms of efficiency, the healing rate constants for 0.5 and 1.6&#x02009;mg/mL LL-37 were higher than those for placebo (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.003 for 0.5&#x02009;mg/mL and <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.088 for 1.6&#x02009;mg/mL). However, the healing rate constants for 3.2&#x02009;mg/mL LL-37 were similar to those of the placebo. An inverted dose&#x02013;response efficacy was hypothesized due to increased inflammation at high doses of LL-37.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> In this study, bell-shaped dose&#x02013;response curves for SR-0379 were not observed, suggesting the impact of SR-0379 for wound healing resembles that of similar anti-microbial peptides. Furthermore, in this study, SR-0379 treatment was administered to ulcers of patients with Werner Syndrome, which is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> caused by the WRN gene,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> whose protein resembles DNA helicase, that involves unusual chronic leg ulcers.

Although there were no obvious associations between ulcer size reduction and baseline characteristics (i.e., ulcer size, duration of ulcer, and ulcer position) in this study, larger clinical studies with prolonged treatment times will be required to confirm the effects of SR-0379 until complete skin ulcer closure is achieved.
