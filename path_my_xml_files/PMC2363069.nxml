Dose levels of cisplatin 60 mg m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, 70 mg m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> and 80 mg m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> were studied. Treatment objective of hyperthermia was the achievement of a tumour temperature of &#x02265; 42&#x000b0; for 60 min, during cisplatin administration. The protocol advised six weekly cycles of combined treatment. Nineteen patients, median age 47 years (range 26&#x02013;71), were treated. A total of 89 cycles of combined treatment were administered. Even at the highest dose level of cisplatin, 80 mg m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> weekly, no dose-limiting toxicity was observed. Leucocytopenia at scheduled retreatment resulted in 1 or 2 weeks postponement in five cases. Neurotoxicity and renal toxicity were mild or absent. Maximum tumour temperatures achieved ranged 39.7&#x02013;43.6&#x000b0;C, mean 41.6 &#x000b1; 0.7&#x000b0;C. All 19 patients were evaluable for response. One patient achieved a complete response that lasted 20 months, and nine patients achieved a partial response for a median duration of 6 months (range 4&#x02013;50+ months), for an overall response rate of 53&#x00025;. One patient subsequently underwent salvage surgery and currently remains free of disease at 4 years. We found that this combined hyperthermia- dose-intensive cisplatin regimen was well-tolerated. The true impact of the combination of cisplatin and locoregional hyperthermia can only be answered in a randomized study. Nonetheless, based on existing data on the poor efficacy of cisplatin in pelvic recurrent cervical cancer, we believe that the combined modality approach of weekly hyperthermia plus dose-intensive cisplatin is an attractive regimen, particularly if subsequent salvage surgery is available. &#x000a9; 1999 Cancer Research Campaign</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cervical cancer</kwd><kwd>cisplatin chemotherapy</kwd><kwd>hyperthermia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></article>
