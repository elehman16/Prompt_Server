<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> A cow's milk-based infant formula is most commonly used if a breast milk substitute is needed during the first year of life.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> However, allergy to cow's milk protein affects 2.2&#x02013;2.8% of all infants.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> Diagnostic confirmation of cow's milk allergy (CMA) is based on clinical history, physical exam and controlled elimination of cow's milk protein followed by challenge procedures, including double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> Quantification of specific IgE to cow's milk is used to diagnose IgE-mediated CMA and may eliminate the need to perform a DBPCFC for confirmation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> A child may be considered allergic to cow's milk with no need for DBPCFC confirmation if the specific IgE concentration by CAP RAST is greater than or equal to the 95% positive predictive value as established in earlier studies (5 and 15 kU<sub>A</sub>/l for children &#x02264;1&#x02005;year of age and &#x0003e;1&#x02005;year of age, respectively).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> Management of CMA is based on complete avoidance of intact cow's milk protein. One alternative, soy-based formula, is generally not recommended, particularly for infants younger than 6&#x02005;months of age with non-IgE-mediated manifestations of CMA, who are more likely to develop concomitant soy allergy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> Thus, formulae with reduced allergenicity, such as those with extensively hydrolysed (EH) protein, are recommended for formula-fed infants with CMA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> EH casein formula has a long history of demonstrated efficacy and safety to manage infants and children with CMA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11 b12 b13">11&#x02013;13</xref></p><p>Determination of &#x003b2;-lactoglobulin (&#x003b2;LG) level, a major cow's milk allergen, is a first assessment of the suitability of a substitute infant formula for infants and children with CMA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> The minute amount of &#x003b2;LG detected in EH casein formula<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> is in the lower range of the amounts detected in breast milk (0.9&#x02013;150&#x02005;&#x003bc;g/l).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> According to the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) and the American Academy of Pediatrics, a formula must be tested in a properly designed DBPCFC and can be considered hypoallergenic when demonstrated with 95% confidence that at least 90% of infants and children with confirmed CMA would have no reaction to the formula under double-blind, placebo-controlled conditions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> To control for possible false negatives, a negative DBPCFC should be followed by an open challenge (OC) with the tested formula.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> After negative challenges, further assessment of tolerance to the tested formula during a 7-day feeding period to detect potential late-onset reactions is also recommended.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>

<italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> GG (LGG) is the most studied probiotic, with demonstrated benefits when added to an EH formula, including decreased severity of atopic dermatitis (AD),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> An EH formula with the same casein hydrolysate and many years of clinical experience of safety use in children with CMA was demonstrated to be hypoallergenic in those children in a DBPCFC trial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> However, the hypoallergenic status of the EH casein formula with added LGG has not yet been demonstrated. In the current study, we evaluated if LGG addition to this EH casein formula affected its hypoallergenic status for use in management of confirmed CMA in infants and children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design and participants</title><p>A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled prospective crossover trial was conducted at two study sites to assess the hypoallergenicity of an EH casein formula with the same formulation of a previously existing formula (Nutramigen&#x000ae;; Mead Johnson &#x00026; Company, Evansville, Indiana, USA; control, EHF) that differed only in supplementation with LGG at 10<sup>8</sup> colony-forming units per gram of powder (EHF-LGG). Each powdered formula provided 2.8&#x02005;g protein/100&#x02005;kcal. The LGG raw material used in the formula demonstrated absence of &#x003b2;LG, as determined by an ELISA test with a detection limit of 0.1&#x02005;&#x003bc;g/g (data on file).</p><p>Infants and children &#x02264;14&#x02005;years of age with confirmed CMA were eligible for this study if their allergic manifestations were under sufficient control, so that a positive response to a food challenge would be recognisable. In addition, participants should have successfully consumed the control formula within 1&#x02005;week of study enrolment. Exclusion criteria were presence of systemic disease or illness that could compromise participation in the study, use of &#x003b2;-blockers within 12&#x02005;h of DBPCFC, use of short-acting, medium-acting or long-acting antihistamines more than once within 3, 7 or 21&#x02005;days of DBPCFC, respectively, or oral steroids within 21&#x02005;days of DBPCFC. Adverse events were recorded throughout the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Confirmation of CMA</title><p>Confirmation of CMA required one of the following criteria: (1) a positive DBPCFC to cow's milk or cow's milk-based formula within 6&#x02005;months of study enrolment; (2) a positive confirmatory value of CAP RAST (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) to cow's milk within 6&#x02005;months of study enrolment (&#x02265;5&#x02005;kU<sub>A</sub>/l in participants &#x02264;1&#x02005;year of age or &#x02265;15&#x02005;kU<sub>A</sub>/l in participants &#x0003e;1&#x02005;year of age); (3) a documented significant adverse reaction to inadvertent ingestion of cow's milk or cow's milk-based formula within 6&#x02005;months of enrolment plus a positive DBPCFC or a confirmatory CAP RAST value to cow's milk within 12&#x02005;months of enrolment or (4) a physician-documented anaphylaxis to cow's milk or cow's milk-based formula within 6&#x02005;months of study enrolment plus a confirmatory CAP RAST value to cow's milk within 12&#x02005;months of enrolment.</p></sec><sec><title>DBPCFC and OC</title><p>The hypoallergenicity of the EHF-LGG formula was evaluated in a DBPCFC and OC, as described previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> A 7-day period of strict elimination of cow's milk protein and other suspected food allergens preceded the DBPCFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">figure 1</xref>). On study day 1 prior to the beginning of the DBPCFC and OC, participants underwent a physical examination and medical history and status of allergic diseases was recorded. Participants were either asymptomatic or allergic manifestations had been stabilised for a minimum of 7&#x02005;days prior to the DBPCFC. The study sponsor had issued a list of 6-digit participant numbers to each study site and the study coordinator sequentially assigned a participant number to each participant. The sponsor also created a separate computer-generated randomisation list of participant numbers that indicated the order in which each study formula should be offered in the DBPCFC challenge. At both study sites, the participant number was provided to a third-party pharmacist who referenced the number against the randomisation list in order to prepare the EHF and EHF-LGG formulae in the assigned randomised order for each participant.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow of participants through the double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC), open challenge (OC) and home feeding period (EHF, control formula; EHF-LGG, intervention; CM, cow's milk; CMP, cow's milk protein; CMA, cow's milk allergy).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen-2011-000637fig1"/></fig><p>In the DBPCFC, the EHF and EHF-LGG formulae fed in randomised order were administered in an initial 5&#x02013;10&#x02005;ml aliquot followed by gradually increasing volumes over a maximum period of 120&#x02005;min to provide a cumulative volume of 150&#x02005;ml. A minimum interval of approximately 120&#x02005;min between the end of the challenge with the first formula separated the beginning of the challenge with the second formula. Times of consumption and amounts of study formula consumed during each challenge were recorded. Any signs or symptoms present before (baseline), during, or after the DBPCFC and OC were recorded using a scoring system to rate severity. The skin was observed for rash, urticaria/angioedema, or pruritus, with the percentage of body area affected recorded. The upper respiratory system was assessed for sneezing/itching, nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, or laryngeal symptoms, and the lower respiratory system was assessed for wheezing. The gastrointestinal system was evaluated for subjective symptoms such as nausea and abdominal pain and objective symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhoea. Any changes in signs or symptoms from baseline would have resulted in classifying the challenge as positive and discontinuing the participant from the study. If the DBPCFC was negative, an OC with 150&#x02013;250&#x02005;ml of the EHF-LGG followed.</p></sec><sec><title>Home feeding period</title><p>To assess long-term tolerance and reveal any false-negative results to the challenges, all participants with negative responses to both the DBPCFC and OC consumed a minimum of 240&#x02005;ml of EHF-LGG formula/day during a 7-day home feeding period. Participants' parents recorded in a daily diary volume of formula consumed: presence and severity of vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, runny nose, wheezing or any other symptoms (rated as mild, moderate or excessive); number of bowel movements and overall formula acceptance and tolerance (rated as satisfactory or unsatisfactory). The investigator completed a final evaluation at the end of the 7-day home feeding period.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size determination</title><p>In a study with a binomial outcome (reaction versus no reaction), the sample size can be determined by calculating a binomial CI for p, the probability of having a reaction, as demonstrated previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> In the case of 0 observed reactions, the upper 95% CI for p is &#x0003c;0.10 when the sample size is 29 participants. Thus studying at least 29 participants and having none classified as positive in the DBPBFC allows the conclusion that the study provided 95% confidence that at least 90% of children with confirmed CMA who ingest the tested formula would have no reaction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>

The DBPCFC and OC were thus classified as negative for all participants. Parent-recorded diaries during the home feeding period were returned for 30 participants and indicated that overall acceptance and tolerance of the EHF-LGG formula was generally good.

In this study, all 31 study participants with confirmed CMA had a previous history of experiencing one or more types of allergic symptoms in the skin, respiratory and/or gastrointestinal systems or had systemic anaphylaxis after ingestion of cow's milk protein, meeting recognised criterion to confirm CMA using a combination of convincing symptoms upon exposure to cow's milk protein and a strongly positive confirmatory value of specific IgE to cow's milk by RAST.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> allergy to one or more foods in addition to cow's milk was reported in 94% of participants in this study. After 7&#x02005;days of strict cow's milk protein elimination from the diet, 29 of 31 participants had no allergic symptoms and remained asymptomatic throughout the DBPCFC and OC, whereas the other two had mild symptoms that either did not change or improved during the challenges. No serious adverse events were reported during the DBPCFC, OC or the 7-day home feeding period.</p><p>The addition of probiotics in formula used for management of CMA requires that they be proven safe and are well tolerated.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> To justify use, addition of a probiotic must also be shown to be of benefit. Early gut microbial colonisation is associated with modulation of inflammation and expression of allergy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> LGG administration to atopic pregnant women followed by postnatal administration to their infants was associated with lower incidence of AD at 2, 4 and 7&#x02005;years of age compared with placebo.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> Additionally, anti-inflammatory effects of LGG accompanied by amelioration of symptoms were observed in infants experiencing AD as a manifestation of CMA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> In a study using fecal calprotectin as a marker of intestinal inflammation, infants with presumptive allergic colitis were randomised to receive an EH formula with or without LGG and the same casein hydrolysate as the formulae in the current study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> After a 4-week feeding period, blood in stools, characteristic of allergic colitis, disappeared in all infants in the LGG-supplemented group versus only 63% in the non-supplemented group. The LGG-supplemented group also experienced a larger decrease in fecal calprotectin level. In a recent study, EH casein formula with LGG was demonstrated to accelerate the time of acquisition of tolerance to cow's milk protein in infants with CMA after 6 and 12&#x02005;months of feeding.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref></p><p>We previously demonstrated that LGG added to an EH casein formula was well tolerated and transiently colonised the intestinal tract of healthy term infants.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> Growth and other nutrition parameters, including circulating fatty acid levels, were demonstrated to be normal in healthy term infants who received this formula up to 4&#x02005;months of age.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> Available data suggest that the LGG-supplemented EH casein formula assessed in the current study provides additional benefits of better management of allergic colitis, as well as faster tolerance acquisition, in infants with CMA that are not observed with the non-supplemented formula. We tested the EH casein formula supplemented with LGG according to established criteria and demonstrated that its hypoallergenic status is maintained. Therefore, this formula can be recommended for infants and children with CMA who require an alternative to formulae containing intact cow's milk protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supporting Statement</title></caption><media xlink:href="bmjopen-2011-000637-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d33e862" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><caption><title>Supporting Statement</title></caption><media xlink:href="bmjopen-2011-000637-s2.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d33e867" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d33e181" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2011-000637.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d33e182" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2011-000637.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank study site staff for their cooperation.
