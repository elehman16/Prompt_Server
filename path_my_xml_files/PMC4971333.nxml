Oral bisphosphonates are a commonly prescribed treatment for osteoporosis (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), but inconvenient dosing regimens and side effects can lead to low adherence (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Suboptimal adherence to osteoporosis medication can reduce antifracture efficacy (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and increase health care use and costs (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Although more extended dosing intervals can improve adherence (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), efficacy remains an influential determinant of patient preference for and adherence with osteoporosis medications (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>Once-yearly iv bisphosphonate therapy with zoledronic acid (ZOL) has been shown to reduce the risk of hip, vertebral, and nonvertebral fractures (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Although parenteral bisphosphonates, such as ZOL, have become a treatment option for osteoporosis, there is no evidence that cycling through bisphosphonate agents offers therapeutic benefit to patients with osteoporosis, whether assessed by bone mineral density (BMD) or bone turnover markers (BTMs). Although patients in one clinical trial expressed a preference for once-yearly ZOL over a weekly bisphosphonate regimen, switching from oral bisphosphonates to ZOL did not further increase BMD (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Denosumab (Prolia; Amgen Inc) is a fully human monoclonal antibody against RANKL administered sc every 6 months. In a 3-year, placebo-controlled, pivotal osteoporosis trial, denosumab significantly reduced BTMs, increased BMD, and reduced the risk of hip, vertebral, and nonvertebral fractures (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Three studies have shown that individuals who received prior bisphosphonate therapy and transitioned to denosumab had greater BMD gains at all measured skeletal sites compared with continuing alendronate or initiating ibandronate or risedronate (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>This study assessed whether transitioning from an oral bisphosphonate to a parenteral therapy in the same treatment class (iv bisphosphonate [ZOL]) or an antiresorptive therapy with a different mode of action (sc RANKL inhibitor [denosumab]) was associated with greater efficacy and comparable safety profile in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Study subjects</title><p>Ambulatory postmenopausal women aged 55 years or older who received oral bisphosphonate therapy for 2 years or longer immediately before screening were eligible if they had a T-score of &#x02212;2.5 or less at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck, two or more lumbar vertebrae, and one hip evaluable by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and baseline serum C-telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX) of 500 pg/mL or less. Subjects were excluded if they had received denosumab or ZOL at any time; fluoride, strontium ranelate, or iv bisphosphonate other than ZOL within the previous 5 years; PTH or PTH derivatives within the year before enrollment; or other bone-active drugs in the 3 months before screening. All subjects provided written informed consent prior to enrollment in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This was a 12-month international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, parallel-group study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>; number NCT01732770) conducted at 37 study centers in Belgium, Denmark, Poland, Spain, Canada, the United States, and Australia. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to one of two treatment arms. Subjects in the denosumab arm received sc denosumab 60 mg and iv saline (ZOL placebo) on day 1 and sc denosumab 60 mg at the month 6 visit. Subjects in the ZOL arm received iv ZOL 5 mg and denosumab placebo sc on day 1 and denosumab placebo sc at month 6. Subjects were required to take 1000 mg or greater elemental calcium and 800 IU or greater vitamin D daily. Of 643 subjects enrolled, 117 subjects from 11 centers consented to the increased frequency of sample draws and enrolled in a substudy assessing serum BTMs, intact PTH (iPTH), and albumin-adjusted calcium.</p><p>The study protocol was approved by an institutional review board or ethics committee for each site. The study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All authors had access to the data, participated in drafting or revising the manuscript, and approved the final version for submission; N.P. and C.W. take responsibility for the integrity of the data analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Study assessments</title><p>DXA scans were performed in duplicate at baseline and month 12 or early termination visit for the lumbar spine (L1&#x02013;L4); left proximal femur (for total hip and femoral neck), unless the left was unsuitable for analysis, in which case the right was used; and nondominant forearm (one-third radius) using GE Lunar or Hologic scanners. The same side was used for the proximal femur or forearm scan at baseline and month 12 or early termination visit. DXA scan data were submitted to a central imaging vendor (BioClinica) for blinded analyses. BMD values obtained at early termination were carried forward as the month 12 value. The analysis was based on the mean BMD values from duplicate DXA scans.</p><p>In subjects enrolled in the substudy, serum CTX and procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) were assessed at day 1, day 10, and months 1, 3, 6, 6 + 10 days, months 7, 9, and 12 using electrochemiluminescence immunoassays. Albumin-adjusted calcium was assessed at the same time points on a Roche Modular clinical chemistry analyzer. Serum iPTH was assessed at months 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, and 12 using an IMMULITE iPTH chemiluminescence assay (Siemens Healthcare). Blood samples were collected after an overnight fast and prior to study drug administration and analyzed centrally by Quintiles Laboratories.</p><p>Evaluation of antidenosumab antibodies in subjects receiving denosumab was performed on day 1 and month 12 or end-of-study visit by the study sponsor. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded at each study visit.</p></sec><sec><title>End points</title><p>The primary end point was mean percentage change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD at month 12. The secondary end point was the mean percentage change from baseline in total hip BMD at month 12. Additional end points included the mean percentage change from baseline in the femoral neck and one-third radius BMD at month 12 in the overall population and the median percentage changes from baseline in serum BTMs, iPTH, and albumin-adjusted calcium in subjects participating in the BTM substudy. Safety end points included AEs.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The primary hypothesis was that treatment with denosumab was not inferior to ZOL for the mean percentage change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD at month 12 based on a margin of &#x02212;0.46%. Secondary hypotheses included the following: 1) noninferiority in total hip BMD with denosumab vs ZOL based on a margin of &#x02212;0.51%, 2) superiority of denosumab for the mean percentage change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD at month 12, and 3) superiority of denosumab for the mean percentage change from baseline in total hip BMD at month 12. A stepdown sequential testing procedure was used to maintain the overall type I error rate at 5% among BMD end points. Specifically, only if the primary noninferiority hypothesis was demonstrated was the individual secondary hypothesis tested in the prespecified sequence.</p><p>To derive the noninferiority margins, the effect of ZOL treatment at 12 months on the lumbar spine and total hip BMD relative to placebo in postmenopausal women previously treated with oral bisphosphonates was needed. Due to the paucity of relevant data, the ZOL and placebo effects in similar pretreated populations were estimated separately (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://press.endocrine.org/doi/suppl/10.1210/jc.2016-1801/suppl_file/jc-16-1801.pdf">Supplemental Material</ext-link>). A 50% preservation of the net ZOL treatment effect was deemed clinically meaningful, which led to noninferiority margins of &#x02212;0.46% for the lumbar spine and &#x02212;0.51% for the total hip end points. A sample size of 310 subjects per group, assuming a 10% dropout rate through month 12, was estimated to provide 99% power for the primary analysis.</p><p>The primary analysis population included all randomized subjects who had a baseline BMD measurement and one or more postbaseline measurements. An analysis of covariance model assessed the treatment difference in the primary efficacy analysis and included treatment, screening serum CTX category (&#x0003c;300 pg/mL or 300&#x02013;500 pg/mL), baseline BMD, DXA machine type, and baseline BMD value-by-machine type interaction. Data are least squares means of the treatment difference and two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI was compared with the noninferiority margin for assessing noninferiority.</p><p>Precision errors based on duplicate DXA scans from individual subjects were pooled to derive an estimate for the least significant change (LSC) in BMD measurements at each skeletal site assessed (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The proportions of women with a BMD response less than the LSC or equal to or greater than the LSC at each skeletal site were evaluated using a logistic model with treatment as the explanatory variable. The estimated odds ratio (OR) of achieving a BMD gain of equal to or greater than the LSC for denosumab vs ZOL was also provided along with the 95% CI and the corresponding <italic>P</italic> value.</p><p>The BTM analysis subset included all randomized subjects enrolled in the substudy and had a baseline measurement and one or more postbaseline measurements. Descriptive statistics were calculated and expressed as a median and interquartile range. The significance of treatment difference at each visit was assessed using a Wilcoxon rank sum test.</p><p>The safety analysis population included all subjects who received one or more doses of the study drug. Subject incidence of treatment-emergent AEs and events of interest were summarized. MedDRA version 17.1 was used to code AEs. All potential cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) and atypical femoral fracture (AFF) were reviewed by separate independent blinded external adjudication committees. Available x-ray images of femoral fractures were reviewed by a panel at the central radiographic vendor (BioClinica). The major criteria established by the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research and reported in the second report of the Atypical Femoral Fractures Task Force were used for adjudication (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). A finding of indeterminate was not permitted.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Of 1297 women screened, 643 were enrolled in the study, and 625 (97.2%) completed 12 months of follow-up.

Approximately 5 months after her first denosumab dose, the subject lost her balance and tripped and fell on slippery ground while wearing a walking boot foot brace and using crutches due to a previous metatarsal fracture, sustaining a subtrochanteric fracture of the left femur. The subject discontinued denosumab and the fracture was reported as healed; although the investigator did not specify the duration of time to heal, the report of healed was received within 15 months of the event. The AFF in the ZOL group involved a woman previously treated with risedronate followed by alendronate for a total of approximately 6 years. The subject had prodromal pain over the fracture site at rest. Approximately 9.3 months after receiving ZOL, the subject stumbled and sustained a right distal femur fracture.

Previous head-to-head studies of women who had received oral bisphosphonate therapy for several years showed that those who were transitioned to denosumab also experienced greater increases in BMD at the lumbar spine, hip, and one-third radius compared with those who remained on oral bisphosphonates, including alendronate, risedronate, or ibandronate (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In the current study, BMD changes with denosumab and ZOL were of a lesser magnitude than in studies of subjects na&#x000ef;ve to previous osteoporosis therapy (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), consistent with reduced remodeling space from prior bisphosphonate therapy at the time of initiating the parenteral osteoporosis treatments. The impact of prior bisphosphonate therapy also seemed evident by low baseline BTM concentrations. Despite prolonged bisphosphonate therapy, baseline BMD in this population was low, and the early decrease in BTMs after transitioning to denosumab or ZOL suggests a potential for an additional increase in bone mass by further control of remodeling activity.</p><p>The early reduction in BTMs upon transition to denosumab persisted throughout the 6-month denosumab dosing interval, whereas BTMs began to increase, after the initial decline, within 3 months of ZOL administration. The transience of BTM reductions after transition from oral bisphosphonate to ZOL may explain the relatively minor BMD gains observed 12 months after transitioning to ZOL. These findings are generally consistent with those from a study in postmenopausal women previously treated with oral alendronate, which showed that transition to ZOL was associated with an early reduction in BTMs followed by progressive increases with minimal BMD gains over the 12 months after ZOL administration (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In the current study, BTMs were persistently reduced upon transition from oral bisphosphonates to denosumab, and BMD was significantly increased at each measured site. Significantly more subjects in the denosumab group achieved BMD gains exceeding the LSC threshold at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck, compared with the ZOL group. These data suggest that denosumab may be a more potent antiresorptive than ZOL in patients transitioning from long-term oral bisphosphonate therapy.</p><p>Consistent with greater reductions in BTMs, the denosumab group also exhibited significantly greater increases in endogenous PTH at months 3 and 9 compared with ZOL. A similar observation has been noted in a comparative study of denosumab-, alendronate-, and placebo-treated subjects, in which subjects treated with denosumab showed increases in PTH and decreases in cortical porosity, which were not observed with alendronate (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The prolonged yet oscillatory pattern of endogenous PTH exposure induced by the 6-month denosumab regimen has uncertain but potentially positive implications for BMD. Studies in rodents and cynomolgus monkeys showed that prolonged oscillatory exposure to exogenous PTH, which persisted for several days per treatment interval, increased cortical and cancellous BMD (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). A recent bone histomorphometry study, however, that explored the anabolic potential of the endogenous PTH response to denosumab, did not find absolute increases in bone formation (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), consistent with the lack of absolute increases in the formation marker serum P1NP in the current study's denosumab group. The PTH hypothesis as an explanation for the efficacy response with denosumab remains under evaluation.</p><p>AEs and serious AEs were similar in the two treatment groups. No events were adjudicated as consistent with ONJ. Two fractures were adjudicated as consistent with AFF with denosumab and one with ZOL. With the short time to onset of the AFF in the study subjects, the AFF is likely a result of prior long-term bisphosphonate use (from 3 to 6 y on average) and not related to the initiation of denosumab or ZOL because four other studies did not report any AFF with transition to denosumab after prior oral bisphosphonate use of varying duration or with suboptimal adherence (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>Strengths of the study include a robust sample size, a low dropout rate, and a reflection of the clinical practice setting wherein many patients switch osteoporosis therapies. Limitations of the study include the relatively short-term follow-up.</p><p>In summary, in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who were previously taking oral bisphosphonates, transitioning to denosumab was well tolerated and more effective at increasing BMD at all sites measured than transitioning to ZOL. Greater BMD gains with denosumab may relate to persistent inhibition of bone turnover throughout the 6-month dosing interval. This study completes a suite of head-to-head clinical trials indicating greater clinical benefits, in terms of greater BMD increases at all sites measured and larger decreases in BTMs, of transitioning from one osteoporosis therapeutic class to another (oral bisphosphonates to denosumab), compared with cycling through the same therapeutic class (from one bisphosphonate to another).</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="abbreviations"><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations:
