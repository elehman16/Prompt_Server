These guidelines advocate personalizing targets for glycemic control, generally defined by a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level &#x0003c;7.0% (53&#x000a0;mmol/mol) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] or &#x02264;6.5% (48&#x000a0;mmol/mol) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, treatment with metformin is associated with gastrointestinal (GI) events, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These symptoms limit its tolerability and may result in approximately 5% of patients discontinuing metformin treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. GI disturbances may also reduce therapeutic adherence, potentially contributing to inadequate glycemic control. Therefore, metformin is initiated at a low dose (LD) and up-titrated to the maximum tolerated dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Some guidelines advocate initial treatment with combination therapy in patients with baseline HbA1c levels of &#x02265;9% (75&#x000a0;mmol/mol) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] or &#x02265;7.5% (58&#x000a0;mmol/mol) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This approach may also offer advantages when drug tolerability is a concern. For example, using lower doses of one or both drugs in the combination may minimize the adverse events (AEs) associated with the respective maximum dose monotherapies but without compromising the overall glucose-lowering efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Initial treatment with LD metformin plus another glucose-lowering drug could mitigate the tolerability issues associated with higher doses of metformin. LD metformin in combination with a dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitor is an attractive treatment option due to their complementary mechanisms of action which, together, target multiple pathophysiological defects of T2DM, with low additional risk for hypoglycemia and weight gain. Studies have shown that linagliptin plus metformin administered twice daily as add-on or initial combination therapy was effective and well tolerated for up to 2&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This combination did not increase the risk for hypoglycemia or weight gain, and GI tolerability was similar to that of metformin monotherapy. These results suggest this combination might be a valuable alternative treatment, especially for patients who do not tolerate higher or the maximum dose of metformin. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of linagliptin 5&#x000a0;mg in combination with LD metformin once daily versus high-dose (HD) metformin twice daily in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients with T2DM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design and Patients</title><p>This phase 4, randomized, double-blind, active-comparator controlled, parallel-group comparison study was performed at 88 trial centers in 13 countries (Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, Spain, India, Bangladesh, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru, Taiwan, Lebanon, and the Philippines; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01438814). The study enrolled patients with a diagnosis of T2DM who were aged &#x02265;18 and &#x02264;80&#x000a0;years, with a body mass index (BMI) &#x02264;45&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and HbA1c &#x02265;7.0% (53&#x000a0;mmol/mol) and &#x02264;10.0% (86&#x000a0;mmol/mol). Patients were drug-na&#x000ef;ve, defined as an absence of any oral or injectable antihyperglycemic therapies for &#x02265;12&#x000a0;weeks before randomization.</p><p>Patients were ineligible if they had uncontrolled hyperglycemia [glucose level &#x0003e;240&#x000a0;mg/dL (13.3&#x000a0;mmol/l) during screening or placebo run-in after an overnight fast, confirmed by a second measurement]; acute coronary syndrome, stroke, or transient ischemic attack within 3&#x000a0;months before consent; indication of liver disease or impaired hepatic function; impaired renal function, defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &#x0003c;60&#x000a0;mL/min/1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup> (determined during screening or placebo run-in); bariatric surgery within the past 2&#x000a0;years or other GI surgeries that induce chronic malabsorption; and a medical history of cancer or treatment for cancer within the last 5&#x000a0;years. Further exclusion criteria included blood dyscrasias or any disorder causing hemodialysis or unstable red blood cell; known history of pancreatitis or chronic pancreatitis; contraindications to metformin; treatment with anti-obesity drugs within 3&#x000a0;months before consent or any other treatment at the time of screening leading to unstable body weight; and treatment with systemic steroids at the time of informed consent or change in dosage of thyroid hormones within 6&#x000a0;weeks before informed consent or any other uncontrolled endocrine disorder except T2DM. Pre-menopausal women who were nursing, pregnant, or not practicing an acceptable method of birth control were also ineligible.</p><p>All patients gave written informed consent before participation. The trial protocol was approved by the independent ethics committees or institutional review boards of the participating centers. The study was carried out according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Guideline for Good Clinical Practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Treatments</title><p>Following screening, patients underwent a 2-week placebo run-in period. Treatment assignment was determined using an interactive voice/web response system and was stratified by HbA1c at screening [&#x0003c;8.5% (69&#x000a0;mmol/mol) or &#x02265;8.5% (69&#x000a0;mmol/mol)]. Eligible patients were randomized (1:1) to double-blind treatment with either linagliptin 5&#x000a0;mg and LD metformin once daily or HD metformin twice daily for 14&#x000a0;weeks, followed by a 1-week follow-up period. Metformin (immediate release formulation) was initiated at 500&#x000a0;mg/day and was up-titrated within 2&#x000a0;weeks to a maximum daily dose of 1000&#x000a0;mg in the LD group and a maximum daily dose of 2000&#x000a0;mg in the HD group. During this 2-week period, metformin was up-titrated in multiples of 500&#x000a0;mg every 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;days if, in the opinion of the investigator, no major GI or other events occurred. If these events occurred, metformin was down-titrated to the previous tolerated dose. For the following 12&#x000a0;weeks, the dose of metformin was unchanged.</p><p>Rescue therapy (antihyperglycemic drug selected by the investigator and taken in accordance with local prescribing information) was initiated if the following criteria were met: during the first 8&#x000a0;weeks, the patient had a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level &#x0003e;240&#x000a0;mg/dL (13.3&#x000a0;mmol/L) after an overnight fast; from Weeks 8 to 14, the patient had an FPG level of &#x0003e;210&#x000a0;mg/dL (11.6&#x000a0;mmol/L) after an overnight fast. To initiate rescue medication, these criteria had to be confirmed by two measurements, of which at least one was to have been performed after an overnight fast at the investigational site. If the patient&#x02019;s hyper- or hypoglycemia could not be controlled and the investigator anticipated no further effect from rescue therapy, the patient was discontinued from the trial. Glucagon-like peptide-1 analogs, DPP-4 inhibitors, and metformin were not allowed as rescue therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Endpoints</title><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c after 14&#x000a0;weeks of treatment in patients who tolerated a daily metformin dose of &#x02265;1000&#x000a0;mg after 2&#x000a0;weeks. The first key secondary endpoint was a composite endpoint comprising the proportion of patients who achieved HbA1c &#x0003c;7.0% (53&#x000a0;mmol/mol) at Week 14 and without the occurrence of pre-specified moderate or severe GI events; the second key secondary endpoint was the occurrence of pre-specified moderate or severe GI events during 14&#x000a0;weeks of treatment. The list of pre-specified GI events included AEs of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and decreased appetite. Exact definitions of pre-specified mild, moderate, and severe GI AEs are outlined in Table S1 in the electronic supplementary material (ESM). Other secondary endpoints included: change from baseline in FPG after 14&#x000a0;weeks; change from baseline in HbA1c over time; percentage of patients who achieved HbA1c &#x02264;6.5% (48&#x000a0;mmol/mol) after 14&#x000a0;weeks and without the occurrence of pre-specified moderate or severe GI events; percentage of patients who achieved a &#x02265;0.5% (6&#x000a0;mmol/mol) reduction in HbA1c after 14&#x000a0;weeks; composite endpoint comprising the percentage of patients who achieved a &#x02265;0.5% (6&#x000a0;mmol/mol) reduction in HbA1c after 14&#x000a0;weeks without the occurrence of pre-specified moderate or severe GI events; percentage of patients who achieved a &#x02265;0.8% (9&#x000a0;mmol/mol) reduction in HbA1c after 14&#x000a0;weeks; composite endpoint comprising the percentage of patients who achieved a &#x02265;0.8% (9&#x000a0;mmol/mol) reduction in HbA1c after 14&#x000a0;weeks without the occurrence of pre-specified moderate or severe GI events; intensity (mild, moderate, or severe) of pre-specified GI events during 14&#x000a0;weeks of treatment as assessed by investigators; intensity scores (based on visual analog scale) of pre-specified GI events during 14&#x000a0;weeks of treatment as assessed by patients; and change from baseline in body weight over time. Other efficacy endpoints included the percentage of patients who achieved HbA1c &#x0003c;7.0% (53&#x000a0;mmol/mol) and HbA1c &#x02264;6.5% (48&#x000a0;mmol/mol) after 14&#x000a0;weeks, and the use of rescue therapy. Safety assessments included the frequency and intensity of AEs, including hypoglycemia and AEs of special interest, and changes from baseline in vital signs, electrocardiogram, and clinical laboratory values.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The primary endpoint was evaluated using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with &#x02018;treatment&#x02019; as a fixed classification effect and &#x02018;baseline HbA1c&#x02019; as a linear covariate. This pre-specified primary analysis was performed on the full analysis set (FAS<sub>1000mg</sub>), which comprised all randomized and treated patients with a baseline HbA1c measurement and &#x02265;1 on-treatment HbA1c measurement, who tolerated a daily metformin dose of &#x02265;1000&#x000a0;mg at the end of the titration phase. A last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach was used to replace missing data. Non-inferiority (with a margin of 0.35%) followed by superiority for the primary endpoint in a hierarchical sequence was used to test for the treatment effect of linagliptin&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;LD metformin compared with HD metformin. The overall significance level was 5%. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of missing data, important protocol violations, and premature discontinuation of trial medication on the primary endpoint. Sensitivity analyses utilized the FAS (LOCF), FAS<sub>1000mg</sub>-completers (LOCF), and per-protocol set (PPS)<sub>1000mg</sub> (LOCF) using the same model as for the primary analysis. Pre-specified subgroup analyses for the primary endpoint based on FAS<sub>1000mg</sub> were performed on several baseline variables including race, ethnicity, geographical region, baseline HbA1c, age, gender, time since diagnosis of diabetes, baseline BMI, and renal function. For the first key secondary endpoint, the non-completers considered failure (NCF) approach was used (e.g., patients who did not complete 14&#x000a0;weeks were counted as having not achieved an HbA1c of &#x0003c;7% and no pre-specified GI AE). For the second key secondary endpoint, original results were used [original data as collected, with no imputation or exclusions (e.g., due to rescue therapy or repeat values)]. A logistic regression model with treatment and continuous baseline HbA1c was fitted on the binary response variable to calculate the estimate of the odds ratio (OR) of the two treatment groups. The remaining secondary endpoints were exploratory. Safety data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and were based on the treated set (TS), defined as all patients treated with &#x02265;1 dose of randomized study medication. AEs were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Drug Affairs (MedDRA) version 15.0 and are presented by system organ class and preferred term. AEs of special interest were analyzed using standardized MedDRA queries (SMQs; narrow versions) and included hypersensitivity reactions, skin lesions, hepatic AEs, renal AEs, and pancreatitis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Patient Disposition, Demographics, and Baseline Clinical Characteristics</title><p>The first patient was enrolled on November 24, 2011 and the last patient visit occurred on March 5, 2013.

The most common reasons for discontinuation were &#x02018;lost to follow-up&#x02019; (1.2%) and &#x02018;refusal to continue trial medication&#x02019; (1.2%) in the linagliptin&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;LD metformin group, and &#x02018;other&#x02019; reasons (1.2%) in the HD metformin group. Of the patients in the FAS, 42&#x000a0;patients (12.4%) in the linagliptin&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;LD metformin group were excluded from the FAS<sub>1000mg</sub> as they did not tolerate a daily metformin dose of 1000&#x000a0;mg after 2&#x000a0;weeks; by contrast, no patients were excluded in the HD metformin group. The imbalance in the exclusion of patients from the FAS<sub>1000mg</sub> was due to the design of this study, which specified different rules of discontinuation for the two groups. During the titration phase, patients who were unable to tolerate the starting dose of metformin (500&#x000a0;mg/day; both treatment groups) or tolerate metformin 1000&#x000a0;mg/day (HD metformin group only) were withdrawn from the trial.

Slight decreases in body weight were observed in both groups: the adjusted mean (SE) change from baseline after 14&#x000a0;weeks was &#x02212;0.44&#x000a0;(0.14)&#x000a0;kg in the linagliptin&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;LD metformin group and &#x02212;1.05&#x000a0;(0.13)&#x000a0;kg in the HD metformin group; the treatment difference was 0.62&#x000a0;(0.19)&#x000a0;kg (95% CI 0.25, 0.98, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0011). There were no clinically relevant changes in vital signs or laboratory parameters in either group, and no patient had any cardiac or cerebrovascular event confirmed by the clinical event committee. No patient had any confirmed case of hospitalization due to heart failure.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Metformin is predominantly recommended as first-line therapy for the treatment of T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], unless it is contraindicated. In clinical practice, metformin can be up-titrated to a maximum daily dose of 2550&#x000a0;mg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], with maximum efficacy achieved at 2000&#x000a0;mg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Metformin is well tolerated in the majority of patients; however, GI events are common and can occur in up to 30% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These complications tend to occur soon after initiation of therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and in particular when metformin is used at higher doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. To minimize GI events and improve tolerability, guidelines recommend that metformin is initiated at a low dose and is gradually up-titrated to the maximum tolerated dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although in many patients GI events tend to resolve upon continued treatment, or with a reduction in metformin dose, the symptoms can be severe enough to limit or complicate optimal dose titration and therefore negatively impact treatment adherence and long-term glycemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>This trial evaluated whether linagliptin 5&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;LD metformin once daily is a potential alternative treatment to HD metformin twice daily with a focus on glycemic control and pre-specified GI events in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients with T2DM and insufficient glycemic control. The results show that linagliptin&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;LD metformin and HD metformin were equally effective and both substantially reduced HbA1c and FPG levels. Furthermore, more than half of patients in both arms achieved a clinically relevant HbA1c target of &#x0003c;7.0% (53&#x000a0;mmol/mol). Since glycemic efficacy was similar in the combination group in the context of a substantially lower dose of metformin, linagliptin&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;LD metformin may be an appropriate treatment alternative, especially in patients who cannot tolerate higher doses of metformin. In contrast to the design of the present study, the effects of combination therapy with linagliptin&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;metformin have been investigated previously in the setting of equivalent doses of metformin monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and linagliptin monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In the study by Haak et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], initial combination of linagliptin (2.5&#x000a0;mg twice daily) with LD (500&#x000a0;mg twice daily) or HD (1000&#x000a0;mg twice daily) metformin achieved superior glucose-lowering efficacy compared with the equivalent doses of metformin monotherapy. In the study by Ross et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], initial combination therapy with linagliptin (5&#x000a0;mg once daily) and metformin (up-titrated to 1000&#x000a0;mg twice daily) significantly improved glycemic control compared with the equivalent dose of linagliptin monotherapy. Studies of other DPP-4 inhibitors have also shown significant clinical benefit when administered as initial combination therapy with metformin and compared with the equivalent dose of metformin monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Therefore, the combination of linagliptin and metformin may be an appropriate choice if glycemic control is not achieved with metformin monotherapy.</p><p>Although controlling hyperglycemia is the most important property of glucose-lowering therapies, consideration should be given to overall tolerability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This is a particular concern when using combination therapy due to the potential increase in AEs. When administering multiple oral antihyperglycemic drugs, one approach to avoid excessive AEs is to use a LD combination strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This strategy could be especially useful in patients who do not tolerate maximum effective doses of one drug, such as metformin. In this study, about 30% of patients assigned to HD metformin could not achieve the maximum dose of 2000&#x000a0;mg. The proportion of patients who had pre-specified GI events of moderate or severe intensity during treatment was similar in both groups. However, the number of patients who had pre-specified GI events of any intensity was lower in the linagliptin&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;LD metformin group, mainly due to fewer patients experiencing mild GI events. Diarrhea and abdominal pain were the most commonly reported GI events, with lower incidences occurring with linagliptin&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;LD metformin. One possible explanation for the modest difference in GI events is that forced titration to maximal dose was not employed. GI events are more likely to occur soon after initiation of metformin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], an observation supported by this study. Previous studies have shown that even at equal metformin doses, patients receiving a DPP-4 inhibitor&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;metformin single-pill combination tend to experience fewer GI AEs compared with those receiving metformin alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The potential mechanism of this effect is currently unknown.</p><p>Despite significant improvements in glycemic control in both treatment groups, the incidence of hypoglycemia was low with no episodes of severe hypoglycemia requiring assistance. In addition, small decreases in body weight were seen in both groups.</p><p>This study was based on a relatively short duration of 14&#x000a0;weeks, which did not allow for assessments of long-term safety or durability of treatment efficacy. However, in a previous phase 3 study, the largest decrease in HbA1c occurred during the first 12&#x000a0;weeks of treatment for both the linagliptin&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;metformin combination group and the metformin monotherapy group. Furthermore, in this study the maximum effect for the change in FPG was achieved in both groups by Week 2, which suggests that most of the expected reduction in HbA1c was achieved by Week 14. The combination of linagliptin plus metformin has also been shown to provide durable HbA1c reduction for up to 2&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This study did not assess whether patients receiving HD metformin and who were experiencing GI AEs would benefit from switching to linagliptin&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;LD metformin, which may have minimized the GI AEs without compromising the overall glucose-lowering efficacy. In the present study, patients received immediate release metformin; however, extended release formulations of metformin are available which are associated with fewer GI AEs compared with immediate release metformin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Other limitations include the lack of a forced titration scheme to up-titrate the dose of metformin and, because the study was conducted primarily (74%) in Asian and American Indian/Alaska native patients, the possible underrepresentation of white patients could affect the applicability of these results to the wider T2DM patient population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows that treatment with linagliptin&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;LD metformin once daily provided similar glucose control to HD metformin twice daily in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients with T2DM and insufficient glycemic control. The overall safety profile of linagliptin&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;LD metformin combination therapy was comparable to HD metformin monotherapy, with a low incidence of hypoglycemia in both groups. Protocol-pre-specified moderate and severe GI events were similar for the two treatments, although the linagliptin&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;LD metformin group was associated with fewer mild GI events. Our findings suggest that linagliptin&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;LD metformin once daily may be an alternative treatment option in patients who cannot tolerate metformin doses &#x0003e;1000&#x000a0;mg/day.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec17"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="12325_2015_195_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><caption><p>Supplementary material 1 (PDF 143&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM2"><media xlink:href="12325_2015_195_MOESM2_ESM.pdf"><caption><p>Supplementary material 2 (PDF 204&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01438814.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>Sponsorship and article processing charges for this study were provided by Boehringer Ingelheim.
