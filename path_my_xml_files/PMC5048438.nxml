The YXBCM01 (Chinese herbal medicine) for PV trial evaluates the effects of YXBCM01 on relapse rate in patients suffering from PV. As an update to the published design and method for the trial, this paper presents the statistical plan for the main publication to avoid the risk of outcome reporting bias, selective reporting, and data-driven results.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This trial is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial. A total of 600 PV patients (300 in each group) will be randomized to one of two arms: participants in the experimental group will receive the YXBCM01 granule 5.5&#x000a0;g twice daily for 12&#x000a0;weeks. Placebo granules are given to patients in the control group at a dose of 5.5&#x000a0;g twice daily for 12&#x000a0;weeks. The sequential topical therapy is administrated simultaneously to all eligible patients by using calcipotriol betamethasone ointment once daily (a treatment area of up to 30&#x000a0;% body surface area (BSA), fingertip unit is recommended) in the first 4&#x000a0;weeks (maximum of 100&#x000a0;g weekly), followed by calcipotriol betamethasone ointment once daily for the remaining 8&#x000a0;weeks (maximum of 100&#x000a0;g weekly). The primary outcome measure is relapse rate in the treatment period and follow-up period. The secondary outcome measures include time to relapse, time to onset, rebound rate, cumulative consumption of topical medicine, visual analog scale (VAS), BSA, the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) 36-item short form health survey (SF-36).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Application of this statistical analysis plan to the YXBCM01 for PV trial will facilitate unbiased evaluation of these important clinical data.

The primary outcome measure in the trial is the relapse incidence rate in the treatment period and the follow-up period. The definition of relapse is a loss of 50&#x000a0;% of PASI improvement from baseline in patients who have achieved treatment success (at least 50&#x000a0;% improvement in PASI score from baseline) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The primary outcome relapse rate between the two groups will be compared by the chi-squared test.

Time to relapse is the duration between improvement (PASI score decreases more than 50&#x000a0;% from baseline, PASI-50) and recurrence appearance for the first time (loss of at least 50&#x000a0;% of the PASI improvement). Time to onset is a PASI score decrease of more than 50&#x000a0;% for the first time, which will be considered as ineffective when the PASI score cannot achieve 50&#x000a0;% improvement throughout the treatment period. Rebound (a binary variable) refers to a PASI score increase of more than 125&#x000a0;% above baseline, or the occurrence of new generalized pustular and erythrodermic lesions after its initial improvement (PASI-50) during the study period. VAS and BSA will be assessed every week during the first 4&#x000a0;weeks and every 2&#x000a0;weeks in the rest of the treatment period. DLQI and SF-36 will be assessed every 4&#x000a0;weeks throughout this trial.</p><p>The rebound rate between the two groups will be compared by the chi-squared test.

At one time point, comparisons between the experimental group and the control group will be conducted using a <italic>t</italic> test. In order to better distinguish the treatment effect and time effect, the changes from baseline to the endpoint of treatment in the above outcomes will be tested with a repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA).</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Subgroup analyses</title><p>We plan to conduct two subgroup analyses, both with strong pathological associations and possible interaction effects. The first will compare the primary and secondary outcomes (relapse rate, time to relapse, PASI, DLQL, VAS, SF-36, time to onset, cumulative consumption of topical medicine, SAS, SDS, BSA and direct medical cost) based upon the degree of disease severity. Patients will be classified into four subgroups by PASI scores of 10&#x02013;15, 16&#x02013;20, 21&#x02013;25, 26&#x02013;30 at baseline. The second will compare the primary and secondary outcomes among different Chinese medicine patterns. In Chinese medicine, PV is thought to be due to blood heat, dryness, blood deficiency, blood stasis and other causes. We will divide the patients into the subgroups of blood heat, dryness, blood deficiency, blood stasis and others according to the standard of Chinese medicine patterns. We will use ANOVA for continuous outcomes for three or more subgroups, and the chi-squared test for binary outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Sensitivity analyses</title><p>Per-protocol analysis is presented as the primary and secondary efficacy analyses of ITT analysis. At one time point, a <italic>t</italic> test is used for continuous outcomes and the chi-squared test for the binary outcomes. ANOVA is used for testing the changes at different time points between the experimental and control groups.</p><p>Adjusting for baseline covariates, for timed endpoints, such as time to relapse and time to onset, we will use the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis followed by the multivariable Cox proportional hazards model for adjusting for baseline variables. For continuous outcomes, such as PASI, DLQL, VAS, SF-36, cumulative consumption of topical medicine, SAS, SDS, BSA and direct medical cost, a linear regression model will be used to control the baseline covariates. For the binary outcome relapse rate, a logistic regression model will be performed for controlling baseline covariates.</p><p>To assess the impact of potential clustering for patients cared for by the same hospital, we will use a Cox proportional hazards model for the outcome of time to relapse or time to onset, and generalized estimating equations (GEE) for other outcomes with center as a random effect.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Safety analyses</title><p>Participants are to be questioned about adverse events (AEs) during the study at each visit point, and all AEs reports will be recorded and assessed by the investigators for a causal relationship with the treatment. Blood tests, urinalysis, a hemagglutination test and electrocardiographic examination will be checked before and after the treatment. Furthermore, calcium, kidney and liver function tests will be reexamined at week 4 and week 12, respectively. All abnormal changes from baseline laboratory tests will be evaluated by the investigators.</p><p>Safety will be evaluated by tabulations of AEs and will be presented with descriptive statistics at baseline and follow-up visits for each treatment group. The statistics will be organized by treatment phase and post-treatment phase as appropriate. Adverse event incidence rates will be summarized by organ system class, preferred term, and severity of the AE. Each subject will be counted only once within an organ system class or a preferred term by using the AEs with the highest severity within each category. Adverse events will also be summarized by organ system class, preferred term, and relationship to procedure. Each subject will be counted only once within an organ system class or a preferred term by using the AEs with the closest relationship to treatment within each category.</p><p>All information pertaining to AEs noted during the study will be listed by subject, detailing verbatim by the investigator: preferred term, organ system class, date of onset, date of resolution, severity, and relationship to procedure.</p><p>A tabulation of serious adverse events (SAEs) will be provided by subject within treatment groups. The chi-squared test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test will be used to compare the frequency difference of AEs between the experimental and control groups. As cases are divided into different degree of AEs, a rank-sum test will be performed for analyzing the independent ordered multiple category data between the two treatment groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Other analyses</title><p>Compliance rates are divided into three categories, such as below 80&#x000a0;%, 80&#x02013;120&#x000a0;% and above 120&#x000a0;%. We will use the chi-squared test to detect the difference in compliance rates between the two treatment groups. Comparison of concomitant drug usage (number of subjects using traditional Chinese medicine or modern medicine) and shed-off cases will be executed by descriptive statistics between the two treatment groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Handling of missing data</title><p>In the event of nonresponse after each follow-up, the subjects will be informed by our researchers and asked to provide the missing data. Even with the reminders, some loss to follow-up is expected over 12&#x000a0;weeks. The proportion of participants missing each outcome will be summarized in each arm and at each time point.</p><p>If there is less than 5&#x000a0;% of data missing for a specified primary or secondary outcome, we will perform a complete case analysis without imputing the missing values. If there is more than 5&#x000a0;% of data missing we will perform Little&#x02019;s test. We will continue analyzing the complete cases without imputing missing values if the complete case data set is indicated by Little&#x02019;s test to be a random sample. We will report the point estimates and their 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval (CI) applying a worst- and best-case scenario imputation for the missing values if the complete case data set is not indicated by Little&#x02019;s test to be a random sample. Multiple imputations will not be performed if the worst- and best-case analyses allow for the same conclusion. Otherwise, multiple imputations will create 10 imputed data sets under the assumption of data missing at random. The results of the trial will be the pooled intervention effect and 95&#x000a0;% CI of the analyses of each data set after multiple imputation.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Current status</title><p>The trial commenced in April 2014 at 11 hospitals in China.
