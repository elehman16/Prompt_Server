Unfortunately, none of these actual treatments used alone or in combination is curative, and so we proposed a dermocosmetic active ingredient to mitigate some aspects of the rosacea and particularly for erythematotelangiectatic rosacea.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Dermocosmetic active ingredient is composed of three glucosylated derivatives of natural plants hydroxybenzoic acid and hydroxycinnamic acids (rosmarinic acid, gallic acid, and caffeic acid). Anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenesis, and anti-degranulation studies were done on cellular models (keratinocytes, mast cells, and endothelial cells). Efficiency of the active ingredient in comparison to placebo was assessed clinically on human volunteers having erythematotelangiectatic rosacea. The active and placebo were applied topically twice a day for 28 days. Biometrical analyses were done using a siascope tool.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found that the active ingredient decreases inflammation (inhibition of interleukin-8 and tumor necrosis factor release), decreases degranulation of mast cells (inhibition of histamine release), and controls angiogenesis mechanism (inhibition of the production of vascular endothelial growth factor and neovessel formation) on cellular models. Study on human volunteers confirmed macroscopically the efficiency of this active ingredient, as we observed no neovessel formation and less visible vessels.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although rosacea is a skin condition disorder that is difficult to heal, the studies have shown that this active ingredient could be a dermocosmetic support, especially for erythematotelangiectatic rosacea armamentarium. The active ingredient was topically applied on the face for 28 days and improved erythematotelangiectatic rosacea symptoms either by decreasing them (vessels are less visible) or by limiting their development (any neovessels). The active ingredient decreases inflammation (inhibition of interleukin-8 and tumor necrosis factor release), decreases degranulation of mast cells (inhibition of histamine release), and limits the angiogenesis process (inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor production and neovessel formation).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>rosacea</kwd><kwd>erythema</kwd><kwd>gallic acid</kwd><kwd>rosmarinic acid</kwd><kwd>caffeic acid</kwd><kwd>glucosylation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rosacea is a common chronic skin disorder mainly affecting areas of skin having a high density of sebaceous glands, such as cheeks, nose, chin, and forehead.<xref rid="b1-ccid-8-501" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Pathogenesis of rosacea was described as an inflammatory vasculopathy,<xref rid="b2-ccid-8-501" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> involving mast cells and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

There is no clear continuum from one subtype to another, ie, one&#x02019;s condition could worsen from an erythematous rosacea to a rinofima without passing by the subtype 2 or even can start up with a papulopustular stage.</p><p>Based on these known physiopathological origins of rosa-cea, we developed an active ingredient acting on degranulation, inflammation, and angiogenesis processes. Its efficacy has been tested in vitro on specialized cells, such as normal keratinocytes, normal mast cells, and skin endothelial cells.

The recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki and the guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization of Good Clinical Practice were observed as applicable to a nondrug study. All volunteers provided written informed consent. The volunteers were not subjected to any concomitant treatment that could potentially modify their skin condition.

Based on this observation and on the current knowledge of rosacea physiopathology, we decided to develop a dermocosmetic ingredient that can relieve symptoms of erythematotelangiectatic rosacea in order to avoid the worsening of the situation.</p><p>The choice of molecules to form the active ingredient was based on the literature analysis, showing that caffeic acid, rosmarinic acid, and gallic acid get interesting biological properties that could be useful to slow down the pathological process of rosacea. Anti-angiogenesis function of caffeic acid was demonstrated on retinal tissues.<xref rid="b24-ccid-8-501" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Rosmarinic acid is a molecule having anti-inflammation<xref rid="b25-ccid-8-501" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and anti-degranulation<xref rid="b26-ccid-8-501" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> action, two interesting properties of rosacea. Tsai et al have shown that rosmarinic acid suppresses IL-8 release.<xref rid="b27-ccid-8-501" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Thus, gallic acid like rosmarinic acid also has an anti-inflammation and an anti-degranulation action.<xref rid="b28-ccid-8-501" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Kang et al also found the inhibitory effect of gallic acid on IL-8 release in oral epithelial cells.<xref rid="b29-ccid-8-501" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>Moreover, there are no published data showing that these components were already used in rosacea pathology, but due to their known instability and difficulty to formulate, we decided to add a glucosyl group to these three molecules by enzymatic reaction to create new stable, water soluble, and easy to formulate molecules. Previously published data from our laboratory<xref rid="b30-ccid-8-501" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> demonstrated that glucosylation of gallic acid does not modify its biological properties. We found using cellular studies that RGC has anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, and anti-degranulation properties. RGC decreases significantly IL-1, TNF alpha, and VEGF release from keratinocytes. In vivo, cytokines, such as IL-1 beta or TNF alpha, modulate the activity of VEGF, a major angiogenic factor. In our experiments, we confirmed like other authors<xref rid="b31-ccid-8-501" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b33-ccid-8-501" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> that normal human keratinocytes express a basal level of VEGF. We have also shown that VEGF is overexpressed under inflammatory condition. Interestingly, RGC was able to decrease VEGF expression level under this inflammatory condition due to its action on TNF alpha production. VEGF release is known to be mediated by TNF alpha.</p><p>Moreover, RGC through its mast cells anti-degranulation properties could also control the angiogenesis seen in rosacea. RGC inhibits the formation of neovessels, suggesting that this product could hinder the formation of new blood vessels in irritated skin and could improve vascular disorders linked to cutaneous redness or blotches such those seen in rosacea. It is known that under pathological conditions, VEGF released by keratinocytes stimulates the formation of neovessels by endothelial cells. The positive effects observed by topical application of RGC in vivo could be explain in part by this mechanism.</p><p>Internal unpublished data on caffeic acid glucoside have shown its capability to decrease PGE2 release. This property is interesting as PGE2 release is involved in vasodilation, edema, and erythema. We could assume, according to these in vitro findings, that our clinical observations showing that RGC helps to limit deteriorating skin condition is through the synergic action of glucosylated form and unglucosylated moieties of rosmarinic acid, gallic acid, and caffeic acid.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although rosacea is a skin condition disorder difficult to heal, these studies have shown that RGC active could be a dermocosmetic help, especially for erythematotelangiectatic rosacea armamentarium. Indeed, 2% of RGC topically applied on face for 28 days improved erythematotelangiectatic rosacea symptoms either by decreasing them (in half of the volunteers, vessels are less visible) or by limiting their development (any neovessels seen). RGC acts by decreasing inflammation (inhibition of IL-8 and TNF release), decreasing degranulation of mast cells (inhibition of histamine release), and limiting the angiogenesis process (inhibition of VEGF production and neovessel formation).</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank Professor Claudine Kieda and Dr Catherine Grillon from CBM-CNRS (Orleans, France) for the studies done on endothelial cells.
