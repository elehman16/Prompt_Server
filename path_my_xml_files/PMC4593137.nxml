With the incidence of premature delivery at 7.5% in developed countries and 9.6% worldwide,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> the cultivation of interventional methods to prevent premature delivery is much needed. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of these methods have already been performed whether preventive interventions such as therapy with magnesium and other supplements,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> drug therapy with medications such as terbutaline (a sympathetic &#x003b2;2-receptor agonist),<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> cervical cerclage,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> bed rest<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and relaxation are effective.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Thus far, no study has demonstrated the effectiveness of advice from healthcare professionals to pregnant women regarding the avoidance of wearing tight clothing that constricts the trunk area during pregnancy.</p><p>A woman's body undergoes many changes due to hormonal effects during pregnancy to support the uterus. Hormonal activity loosens up ligaments, and increases the capacity of the chest and abdominal cavity. The wearing of tight clothes can therefore interfere with these physical changes and cause discomfort. According to some midwives and obstetricians at our hospital, many pregnant Japanese women tend to choose tighter, more fashionable clothes over looser, more comfortable options. Women may be unaware that tight clothing can constrict their growing body. Even maternity wear, such as maternity pants, belly bands, brassieres and abdominal support, if tightly fitted, may constrict a pregnant woman's changing shape. Previous studies on the effect of clothing on health in ordinary adults have found that clothing-induced constriction may increase the time taken for faeces to pass through the intestines and decrease the amount of faeces,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> worsen autonomic nervous system function,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> worsen food digestive function,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> decrease trunk musculature activity and increase the risk of lumbar problems.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Constipation is one of the most common minor problems experienced by pregnant women,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and tight clothing may further aggravate this condition.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>It has also been suggested that <italic>hiesho</italic> (&#x02018;sensitivity to the cold&#x02019;)<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02014;a concept widely accepted in Japan and elsewhere in Asia&#x02014;is a risk factor for premature delivery. Previous studies have shown that pregnant women with <italic>hiesho</italic> have a 3.4&#x02013;3.5 times higher risk for premature delivery compared to pregnant women without <italic>hiesho</italic>.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Advice from healthcare professionals on wearing clothes to prevent feeling cold has been found to be effective.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Constriction from tight clothes may lead to <italic>hiesho</italic> due to restricted blood circulation. Thus, a physiological association of the pressure from clothing around the trunk with premature delivery and reduced QoL during pregnancy is certainly feasible.</p><p>The above studies suggest that a focus on clothing during pregnancy may be extremely important. However, previous studies on the types of clothing suitable for pregnant women and ways of wearing clothes comfortably during pregnancy have been limited, and have mostly focused on aspects such as the effectiveness of thigh-length support stockings to improve haemodynamic response.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In addition, previous research has shown that the effectiveness of abdominal decompression on normal pregnant women is unclear.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Overall, available evidence on the effect of clothing and abdominal compression during pregnancy is currently inadequate.</p><p>Between April 2011 and March 2013, we conducted a trial programme for pregnant women admitted to the National Center for Child Health and Development for threatened miscarriage or premature birth, where they were advised by healthcare professionals to reduce the pressure of their clothing around the trunk area. We then performed a retrospective study using data from the medical records of 208 women.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> We found that after adjustment for age, pre-pregnancy body mass index, delivery history, history of threatened miscarriage or premature birth, year of hospitalisation and prescription medications, the incidence of premature birth at &#x0003c;34&#x02005;weeks&#x02019; gestation was significantly lower in the intervention group (adjusted OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.60). There was no association, however, with premature birth at &#x0003c;37&#x02005;weeks&#x02019; gestation, for which the adjusted OR was 0.72 (95% CI 0.30 to 1.72).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The results of this preliminary study provided important evidence to support the implementation of a clinical trial of an advice programme by healthcare professionals; however, the preliminary study had some limitations.</p><p>In the present study, we aim to verify the effectiveness of advice from healthcare professionals to pregnant women to avoid wearing trunk-constricting clothing in order to reduce the risk of premature birth and improve QoL during pregnancy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This study will be a single-blinded RCT. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015008252F1">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref> shows the study design in detail.

Participants to whom none of the exclusion criteria apply will be informed of the purpose of the study and its overall outline from the study staff after their prenatal check-up at approximately 12&#x02013;14&#x02005;weeks&#x02019; gestation. At this check-up, staff will explain that non-participation in the study will not negatively affect the receipt of medical services or midwife care, and that even after they have given consent, they may still withdraw their consent. Participants who agree to participate in the study will sign a consent form, which they may either give directly to the study staff or subsequently send to the researchers by mail. Recruitment will continue until the required number of participants has been reached.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>The RAND function in Microsoft Excel will be used to perform the permuted block method that will allocate participants to the two groups. Doctors and clinical nursing staff in the hospital who evaluate the primary outcomes of this study will be blinded to the results of this allocation. Participants cannot be blinded because the intervention programmes vary depending on the group. Participants will also be asked to avoid talking to other pregnant women about the content of the intervention programme as much as possible to prevent contamination. The study staff will be responsible for distributing and collecting questionnaires from participants and for performing a number of measurements. We will determine fixed procedures in advance and request that the study staff implement these in order to control performance bias.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Intervention</title><sec id="s2d1"><title>Anaemia prevention and skin-care leaflets</title><p>Leaflets on anaemia prevention and skin care will be distributed to participants in the intervention and control groups. The participants will receive the anaemia prevention leaflet at 20&#x02005;weeks&#x02019; gestation and the skin-care leaflet at 30&#x02005;weeks&#x02019; gestation from study staff in a private room designated for study participants. After receiving the leaflets, participants will have the opportunity to ask members of the study staff questions regarding the contents of the leaflets. The time required for implementation of the intervention programme is approximately 5&#x02005;min. The main content of the anaemia prevention leaflet will consist of a basic knowledge of anaemia, the impact of anaemia on maternal and fetal health, and ways to prevent the condition. The skin-care leaflet will cover a basic knowledge of skin conditions during pregnancy, including faster growth of facial and body hair, an increase in freckles, and ways to prevent itching and stretch marks.</p></sec><sec id="s2d2"><title>Constriction elimination programme</title><p>Healthcare professionals will provide this programme only to participants in the intervention group after the anaemia prevention is distributed at 20&#x02005;weeks&#x02019; gestation. The study staff will explain the content of the programme orally aided by illustrations and demonstrations, and will answer questions from participants. The time required for implementation of the programme is approximately 10&#x02013;15&#x02005;min. The main content of the programme will consist of (1) physical changes during pregnancy; (2) potential risks that result from constricting the trunk; (3) types of clothing and how to wear them so as not to constrict the trunk; and (4) how to wear a seat belt when travelling by car. At 24 and 30&#x02005;weeks&#x02019; gestation, healthcare professionals will assess intervention-group participants in order to check their trunk for pressure marks on the skin and abdominal tension and to assess whether women have experienced any discomfort due to restrictive clothing. Healthcare professionals will also ask participants at 30&#x02005;weeks&#x02019; gestation to complete an open-ended questionnaire about their experience of this programme.</p><p>Women will be given the following information in detail. During pregnancy, hormonal effects cause the ligaments to loosen, and the shape of the pelvis and chest in particular change to support the uterus as it increases in size. Wearing clothing that constricts the trunk during pregnancy hinders these physical changes from progressing and can cause physical discomfort. Constriction above the uterus causes the uterus to be pressed against the backbone, while constriction in the chest region makes breathing more difficult and prevents the chest from expanding. It is therefore important to avoid clothing that constricts the trunk at any stage of pregnancy, so as not to inhibit natural changes in body shape.</p><p>In terms of practical clothing choices and how they should be worn, participants will be instructed to wear loose clothing overall, both as underwear and outer clothing. We will define constrictive clothing as clothing that feels tight and uncomfortable to wear, leaves pressure marks on the skin, and clothing that when removed makes the woman feel more comfortable. For example, clothing tied with ribbons around the trunk, as well as tops with built-in brassieres and tank tops, may become tight and cause constriction. Participants will be encouraged to practice caution with these garments. They will be told to avoid brassieres that feel tight and to take preventative measures, such as hooking the fastener of their bra one hook less than usual in order to give a looser fit. Even if briefs or outer clothing do not feel tight, if the elastic or other material leaves a pressure mark on the skin, they should be considered constrictive. Participants will also be told that even the design of underwear and outer clothing sold as maternity wear should be carefully regarded, and that they must be careful when purchasing clothing as some such items are structured to compress the trunk more than necessary. To keep their trunks warm, participants will be encouraged to use non-constricting belly bands, rather than adjusting their underwear or clothing.</p><p>Ligaments throughout the body become looser during pregnancy; however, loosening of the pelvis, in particular, causes a range of uncomfortable symptoms. To address these symptoms, participants will be advised to ensure that the elastic of their pants and briefs does not come up to the abdomen, but sits above the pubic bone at the hipline, thus supporting excessive loosening.</p><p>Advice on how to wear a seat belt when travelling by car during pregnancy will be provided based on the guidelines for obstetrical practice published by the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In practical terms, this means always wearing the shoulder and lap belts and ensuring that they do not cut across the bump of the pregnant uterus.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Outcome measurements</title><sec id="s2e1"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>The primary outcome of this study will be whether any of the following category variables has been met: (1) cervical length &#x0003c;30&#x02005;mm up to 28&#x02005;weeks&#x02019; gestation, (2) admission to hospital for threatened premature delivery or (3) premature delivery (gestational age &#x0003c;37&#x02005;weeks). Data from all three categories will be collected from medical records by a blinded gynaecologist. A cervical length of &#x0003c;30 or &#x0003c;26&#x02005;mm is associated with a 3.8-fold or 6.2-fold relative risk of premature birth, respectively.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The negative predictive values of a cervical length of &#x02265;30&#x02005;mm at 24 and 28&#x02005;weeks&#x02019; gestation are 97% and 98%, respectively.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Adjusted ORs and a 95% CI of 0.95 (0.92 to 0.98) and 0.94 (0.92 to 0.97) were used for cervical length at 24&#x02013;26 and 30&#x02013;31&#x02005;weeks for premature delivery.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Considering this gynaecological evidence, the criterion of whether or not cervical length is &#x0003c;30&#x02005;mm at up to 28&#x02005;weeks&#x02019; gestation is considered to be valid for investigating the efficacy of advice from healthcare professionals for pregnant women.</p></sec><sec id="s2e2"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>The secondary outcomes of this study comprise data collected for the following 10 items associated with the QoL and state of health of pregnant women: (1) tension and hardness of the abdominal wall; (2) temperature of the extremities and trunk region; (3) stress; (4) urinary incontinence; (5) QoL; (6) location of fetal activity; (7) bowel evacuation problems; (8) gynaecological complications; (9) velocity of the umbilical artery; and (10) birth weight.</p><p>Tension and hardness of the abdominal wall will be measured with a muscle hardness meter at two predetermined locations in the abdominal region, and the means of three separate measurements will be calculated in each case. Temperature of the extremities and the trunk will be measured by thermography. Stress will be measured using a salivary amylase. Urinary incontinence will be assessed using the Japanese version of the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire&#x02014;Short Form (ICIQ-SF).<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The QoL will be evaluated using the Japanese version of the SF-8.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The location of fetal activity and the frequency of bowel evacuation will be ascertained from the answers to questions on subjective frequency and status in a self-administered questionnaire. Data on these seven items will be collected by the study staff between 20 and 30&#x02005;weeks&#x02019; gestation. Data on the other three items (gynaecological complications, velocity of the umbilical artery and birth weight) will be transcribed by study staff from electronic medical records after delivery.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>When calculating the sample size, the level of significance (&#x003b1;) will be set at 0.05 and the power (1 &#x02013;&#x003b2;) at 0.8. Our previous retrospective study based on data from medical records included pregnant women who were admitted to hospital for threatened premature birth, unlike the pregnant women of this study.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Nevertheless, the study found an 8.5% difference in the incidence of premature birth at &#x02264;34&#x02005;weeks&#x02019; gestation, with rates of 8.7% in the intervention group and 17.2% in the non-intervention group. In practice, we anticipate the incidence of threatened premature birth at &#x02264;34&#x02005;weeks&#x02019; gestation to be lower than this value, given that the participants of this study will comprise a lower risk population; however, the incidence between groups will indicate the difference made by the intervention.</p><p>We used STATA12 to calculate the sample size based on this assumption, as well as the assumption that the 8.5% difference in incidence based on medical record observations from our previous retrospective study will be obtained. If the incidence in the intervention group is assumed to be 8.1% (6% difference in incidence), the sample size of a single group should be 462 pregnant women. For an incidence of 7.1% (7% difference in incidence), the sample size should be 331 women, and for an incidence of 6.1% (8% difference in incidence) it should be 246 women. In this study, we expect to achieve an effect close to the 8.5% found in our previous study, and estimate that 246 members in each group will be required to obtain a total sample of 492 women. This will correspond to the 6.1% incidence of the primary outcome in the control group. As we envisage a dropout rate of 20% of participants between the beginning and end of the study, we calculate that 616 participants (308 in each group) will be required for this study.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Handling of adverse events</title><p>In the event of the occurrence or suspected occurrence of any serious adverse events in association with this study, in accordance with the guidelines set out by the researchers&#x02019; institution, these events shall immediately be reported in writing to the Chair of the Ethics Committee and the director of the institution concerned. These members will issue advice on whether or not the study will be permitted to proceed. The level of physical invasiveness in this study is extremely low as the intervention consists of reducing clothing compression around the trunk, and data measurements will consist only of the transcription of data from self-administered questionnaires and electronic medical records, muscle hardness meter and salivary component measurements, and temperature measurement by thermography. Therefore, we believe that there is a low probability that this intervention will directly cause markedly severe adverse events among participants.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Data management</title><p>All the data collected in this study will be entered and saved on a computer that is isolated from the Internet.

Baseline data at 20&#x02005;weeks of pregnancy will be compared between the intervention and control groups to assess the validity of the randomisation process.

To perform multivariate analysis, we will use multiple logistic regressions for binary outcomes and multiple linear regressions for continuous outcomes. The regression analyses in this study will be adjusted for any baseline differences and other relevant covariates. The data will be analysed using STATA V.12.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas , USA) and SPSS statistics V.19.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, IBM Corp, Armonk, New York).</p><p>Since previous studies are not sufficient to calculate the sample size of this study accurately, we will conduct an interim analysis when 100 participants from each group finish this trial. This analysis will estimate the proportion of primary and secondary outcomes in each group and calculate the sample size of this study. However, if the results of the interim analysis show no difference in any outcomes in both groups, we will consider the discontinuation of this study.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Monitoring</title><p>A Data Monitoring Board is not needed because the intervention programme of this study produces minimal risk to participants.

<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This study is designed to verify the effect of a unique intervention programme, that is, advice from healthcare professionals to pregnant women about types of clothing and how to wear them to reduce the risk of premature birth and improve QoL during pregnancy. This programme's advantages over other premature birth prevention programmes include a low level of invasiveness and easy, cost-effective provision, without the need for special equipment. This programme could thus be adopted into clinical practice in developed countries, as well as in developing countries and rural areas with few medical resources. In addition to demonstrating the effectiveness of such advice from healthcare professionals, the implementation of this randomised comparative study may further highlight suitable types of clothing and wearing styles for pregnant women, thus potentially improving their state of health.</p><p>Previous studies on types of clothing for pregnant women and how clothing should be worn have been inadequate, and the possibility that the calculated sample size may not be appropriate cannot therefore be ruled out. However, on the basis of the results of a previous retrospective study of data from medical records as well as inferences about physiological causal relationships used in other previous studies, we consider that sufficient evidence is present to indicate that constriction of the trunk has an adverse effect on health.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors appreciate the help received from Dr Noriyoshi Watanabe, who contributed greatly to the preliminary retrospective study of medical records and the development and design of this study.
