the Humerus Evaluation by Randomisation (PROFHER) trial (trial registration
identifier: ISRCTN50850043).</p><p>PROFHER was a pragmatic, multi-centre randomised controlled trial
(RCT), funded by the United Kingdom National Institute for Health
Research (NIHR), which compared operative and non-operative treatment
of adults with a displaced fracture of the proximal humerus involving
the surgical neck.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p>Between September 2008 and April 2011, 250 adults were recruited
into the trial. At two-year follow-up, the primary outcome and the
Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS)<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> were available for
215 participants.<sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The
results showed no significant difference between operative and non-operative treatment
by OSS over two years (p = 0.479) or other patient-reported clinical
outcomes in the two years following fracture;<sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and the cost of surgery was considerably greater.<sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>The initial choice of a two-year follow-up for PROFHER was a
pragmatic one which balanced feasibility and the expectation that
any differences in the OSS between the two treatment groups at two
years would represent a true and enduring effect. However, there
is insufficient evidence from other RCTs to confirm this assumption.<sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Recovery from serious
injuries such as a fracture of the proximal humerus is a long and
often incomplete process that can be hindered by complications.
A substantial proportion (15/74, 20%) of participants in a trial
with less severe (&#x02018;minimally displaced two-part&#x02019;) fractures than
in PROFHER had continuing &#x02018;severe&#x02019; disability after two years, although
less than that at one year (30/84, 37%).<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>We reasoned that a five-year follow-up would allow for delays
in recovery, potential functional deterioration, and subsequent
operations resulting from complications, such as avascular necrosis
and complications of surgical fixation or humeral head replacement,
which could arise or become symptomatic later on. The extension
made practical sense as the infrastructure was already in place
and the potential availability of a large group of patients presented
an opportunity to gain reliable evidence about patient-reported longer term outcome, as well as insight into
the feasibility of future research.</p><p>We set up the extended follow-up study at the Yorks Trials Unit,
securing ethical approval in September 2010 from the institution,<sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> before the end of
recruitment to, and without knowing the results of, the first study.</p><p>Our primary aim was to obtain three, four and five-year data
on the key outcomes (OSS, EuroQol 5D-3L (EQ-5D-3L),<sup><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and subsequent surgery)
to determine whether the effect of treatment detected at two-year
follow-up had persisted or changed. A further aim, linked to the
collection of EQ-5D-3L data and information about any further surgery, was
to examine the potential effect on our economic analysis<sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> of any change in
health related quality of life (HRQoL) and the costs related to
this.</p><p>Our secondary aims were to generate longer term condition-specific
data on shoulder function that would provide reference data for
the interpretation of the findings of PROFHER and future studies
of proximal humeral fractures and to inform future research in this
area on the appropriate duration of follow-up.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The methodology of the main trial is reported elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The inclusion and exclusion criteria

after the start of the original trial to the 176 participants who
had completed and returned a consent form sent on receipt of their
24-month questionnaire. A pre-notification letter was sent before
this and, when necessary, reminders were sent after two and four
weeks, with the option to complete questionnaires by telephone after
six weeks. To maximise collection of data at the three time points,
patients were asked to complete a short questionnaire restricted
to the OSS, EQ-5D-3L, recent operations on their shoulder, and recent
fractures. Patients were also sent an unconditional &#x000a3;5.00 incentive
payment with each questionnaire. We also collected data from NHS
Digital, using the NHS Summary Care Records available electronically
for authorised staff, on patient mortality at regular intervals
before sending the questionnaires to avoid distressing bereaved
families or friends.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome measure was the OSS, which assesses pain,
function and activities of daily living.<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> It
contains 12 items, each with five categories of response, and a
range of total scores from 0 (worst outcome) to 48 (best outcome).<sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Secondary outcomes
were the EQ-5D-3L, used to estimate utilities (HRQoL weights),<sup><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> further shoulder
surgery and further fractures. While mortality was a secondary outcome
in the main follow-up, it was reported solely as a reason for loss
to follow-up in the extended follow-up: mortality and definitive
treatment of the fracture after two years could not reasonably be expected
to be linked and would not anyway be listed as a cause of death.
Overall, the OSS and EQ-5D-3L were collected at six, 12, 24, 36,
48 and 60 months; EQ-5D-3L data were also collected at baseline
and three months. Secondary shoulder surgery and further fractures
were collected from hospital forms at one and two years and from
patient questionnaires at three, four and five years&#x02019; follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Sample size</title><p>The main study was designed to detect a standard effect size
of 0.4 (approximating to five OSS points) with 80% power using 5%
significance level, and needed approximately 200 participants at
two years.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> We assumed
a 20% attrition rate at five years and based our proposal on a final
sample size of 160 which would provide 71% power to detect a standard
effect size of 0.4 using 5% significance level. Given the reduced
statistical power for the extended follow-up, significance testing
was limited to the primary outcome alone.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Statistical and economic analyses</title><p>All analyses were performed using Stata version 13.1 (StataCorp,
College Station, Texas) and were on an intention-to-treat basis, participants
being analysed in the groups to which they were randomised. Significance
tests were two-sided at the 5% significance level.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Primary analysis</title><p>OSS data from the extended follow-up time points were added to
the primary analysis model of the PROFHER trial.<sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The analysis compared
OSS data from the two treatment groups over all follow-up assessments using
a multilevel regression model. In order to account for the correlation
of outcomes over time from the same patients, time points were nested
within patients. The model adjusted for the fixed effects of treatment
group; time (six months, one, two, three, four and five years); interaction
between treatment group and time; tuberosity involvement at baseline
(yes or no); age (&#x0003c; 65 years, &#x02265; 65 years), and gender and health
status at baseline (EQ-5D-3L). The unstructured covariance pattern
was retained from the primary analysis model. Patients with valid
OSS data at one or more follow-up points for the standard or extended
follow-up as well as complete covariate data were included in the
analysis. Estimates of the difference in OSS between treatment groups,
95% confidence intervals (CI) and p-values were obtained for the
extended follow-up at three, four and five years.</p><p>In a sensitivity analysis, the multilevel model was repeated
substituting missing data with data derived by multiple imputation
by chained equations. Missing outcome and covariate data were imputed
from age, gender, tuberosity involvement, EQ-5D-3L index at baseline
and available OSS data at other follow-up points.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Subgroup analyses</title><p>As with the main trial, the possibility of differential long-term
treatment responses for older patients (subgroups: &#x0003c; 65 years <italic>versus</italic> &#x02265; 65
years) and more complex fractures (subgroups: involvement of no
tuberosities<italic>/</italic>one or both tuberosities) was explored. Expectations of the benefit of surgery
over conservative treatment, established before the main trial results
were known, were that this was greater in patients &#x0003c; 65 years
and in patients with fractures involving one or both tuberosities,<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and that these benefits
might only emerge in the longer term.<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Unadjusted mean OSSs by subgroups
and treatment arm were therefore explored. Due to the substantially
reduced statistical power for the subgroups, no statistical testing
was performed.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Secondary outcomes</title><p>We calculated the annual and overall frequencies of shoulder
surgery and fractures in each treatment group that had occurred
within the previous year. Extended follow-up data were combined
with those of the main trial to establish the number of participants
in each treatment group who had secondary shoulder surgery or a further
fracture over five years. Free text providing details of further
surgery and non-pre-specified fractures was categorised by two independent
observers (HH and AR), who were blinded to the treatment group.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Economic analysis</title><p>The economic analysis aimed to explore whether the results from
the PROFHER trial were sustained over a five-year time period by
determining the between-group differences in HRQoL (measured via
the EQ-5D-3L) at set times (three, four and five years) and examining
how this difference evolved over time. We also planned to estimate
costs of any further shoulder surgery and report these descriptively.</p><p>The methods used to process the EQ-5D-3L data and calculate quality-adjusted
life years (QALY) scores were the same as those described in our
previous cost-effectiveness report.<sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Briefly, the EQ-5D-3L data were transformed
into &#x02018;health-related quality of life weights&#x02019; (utilities) using
the United Kingdom general population tariff which assigns societal
values to each health state.<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> QALYs
were calculated by combining
the utility estimates by the duration of time in each health state
using the area under the curve method following the trapezium rule
which assumed linear interpolation between follow-up points.<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> A discount rate was
applied to QALYs after 12 months, at an annual rate of 3.5%.<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p>In the main trial, the base-case analysis was conducted for the
imputed dataset by means of multiple imputation with chained equations,
using seemingly unrelated regression analysis.<sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> This method accounts
for the correlation between costs and effects from the same individuals
and imputes the missing data. However, other regression-based methods
are available for handling missing data in longitudinal studies,
principally mixed models, and results may be sensitive to the methods
used.<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> A
multilevel model similar to the primary OSS analysis was therefore
conducted to investigate whether the results obtained in the main
trial were robust to this alternative method of analysis. Therefore,
the mean difference in utilities and QALYs (with 95% CIs) between
the two groups was estimated using a multilevel model that adjusted
for the fixed effects of treatment group, time (three and six months,
one, two, three, four and five years), interaction between treatment
group and time, tuberosity involvement at baseline, age, gender
and baseline utility.</p><p>Uncertainty around the results was explored by means of sensitivity
analysis that used multiple imputation by chained equations to replace
missing data on QALYs in the multilevel model where missing outcome
and covariate data were imputed from age, gender, tuberosity involvement,
and baseline utility.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 176 patients (81% of the 218 who returned questionnaires at
two years; 70% of 250 randomised trial participants) who consented
to long-term follow-up at two years after randomisation, valid OSSs
were received for 164 (93%) at three years, 155 (88%) at four years, and 149 (85%) at
five years&#x02019; follow-up (Fig. 1). Retention was therefore slightly
lower than anticipated in the extended follow-up. However, additional
power was gained by the multilevel analysis. A total of ten patients
died during the long-term follow-up, five in each trial arm.</p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Participant flow diagram.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="BJJ-2016-1028-galleyfig1"/></fig><p>As found at baseline (except for smoking status, which did not

differences between operative and non-operative treatment of displaced
fractures of the proximal humerus involving the surgical neck at
three, four or five years in the OSS, our primary outcome. Nor was there
any trend for group differences relating to age or fracture type.</p><p>These findings mirror those of the main trial.<sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> No trial participant
had secondary shoulder surgery for a new complication during the
extended follow-up period. The between-group differences in utilities,
based on EQ-5D-3L data, at three, four or five years were very small:
the 95% CIs overlapped at each assessment. The same lack of statistically significant
between-group differences applied to the HRQoL analysis that showed the trend
for a QALY gain for participants in the non-operative group was
maintained over time. Sensitivity analyses indicated minimal differences
between the two groups at each follow-up time.</p><p>By exceeding the original target of 200 participants at two-year
follow-up, PROFHER was sufficiently powered at final follow-up.
By contrast, we were 11 short of the 160 participants with OSS data
at five years, and therefore did not meet the revised statistical
power criteria for the extended follow-up. However, we believe this
is unlikely to affect the validity of the results. First, loss to
follow-up, including identical mortality (five in each group), was
balanced in the two groups. Secondly, baseline characteristics at
five years were comparable between groups as well as being representative
of the original population. Thirdly, much of the missing data were
accounted for in the multilevel analysis, which included 231 patients.
Fourthly, the between-group differences were small: the 95% CIs
at each follow-up time were less than the minimal clinically important
difference of five points. Fifthly, the between-group differences
in the EQ-5D-3L were also very small, again reflecting comparability
of the groups. Finally, there were no new complications warranting
surgery.</p><p>Although there were no cost data to replicate the incremental
cost-effectiveness analysis conducted for the PROFHER trial, the
analyses of the health utility data for the five-year period produced
results that are consistent with the main trial analysis:<sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> in general, patients
allocated to surgery reported lower HRQoL. The very small differences
in HRQoL between the two groups found for the mixed model and multiple
imputation analyses indicate negligible differences in quality of
life between the treatment groups. The costs of the only shoulder
operation reported for the extended follow-up would not have affected
the findings of the main trial.</p><p>We consider that it is unsafe to draw any conclusions from the observed differences
in participants incurring further fractures between the two groups
on the basis of treatment group. We suggest that this is primarily
a chance effect. In terms of known risk factors for fractures (such
as higher age, female gender, previous fracture and smoking), the
two groups were at similar risk of further fracture at baseline
except for smoking status, where there was a higher incidence of
smokers in the non-operative group. This may partly explain a higher
number of fractures in that group. Known inaccuracies, relating
to both under- and over-reporting, of self-reported fractures<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> are of some concern
and indeed, based on additional participant commentary, we have
confirmed one instance of duplicate reporting over time. We also
have no information about whether there was any difference in the
advice offered and medication provided for preventing further fractures
in the two groups.</p><p>Our findings of an absence of treatment differences on the OSS
in the extended follow-up underpin the main findings for the two-year
follow-up. The only case of further surgery over the extended follow-up
was further surgery for a patient who had already had surgery for
a complication that occurred within the two-year follow-up.<sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Given that most
(15 of 22) secondary surgery occurred in the first year, this finding
and the lack of difference in the OSS provide reassurance that late
symptomatic complications are rare. The HRQoL results show that
the PROFHER economic analysis was applicable over a five-year period.
The overall OSS results show that most patients had attained satisfactory
shoulder function by two years: this was subsequently sustained.
Therefore, the two-year follow-up would have been sufficient for
the PROFHER trial, and this finding could inform the length of follow-up
for future RCTs on these fractures.</p><p><bold>Take home message:</bold></p><p>- The results of the extended follow-up underpin the main findings
of the PROFHER trial.</p><p>- There was no significant difference in patient-reported outcome between
operative and non-operative treatment for the majority of adults with
proximal humeral fractures involving the surgical neck.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><string-name><surname>Handoll</surname>
