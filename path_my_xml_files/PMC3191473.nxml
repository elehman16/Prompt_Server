Treatment goals for this patient population include early mobilization with restoration of the anatomic alignment of the proximal part of the femur and maintenance of the fracture reduction. During the 1950's external fixation was introduced for the management of intertrochanteric fractures.1 Although the first reports were promising, a high prevalence of postoperative complications such as pin-loosening, infection, and mechanical failure of the fixator resulted in discontinuation of its use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The development of external fixators and the introduction of new materials such as the hydroxyapatite-coated pins prompted surgeons to reconsider external fixator as an alternative method for the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures in elderly high-risk patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>This prospective randomized study aimed to present our experience in treating intertrochanteric fractures in elderly patients using the pertrochanteric external fixator and compare two different techniques of proximal pin placement in terms of functional outcome, procedure simplicity and radiation exposure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The study design was approved by the ethics committee. Seventy patients, 25 men and 45 women, with an average age of 81 years (range; 69-96 years) were treated surgically for intertrochanteric fracture, resulting from a low energy trauma. The Orthofix Pertrochanteric Fixator (Pertrochanteric Fixator, Orthofix, Verona, Italy) was utilized in all cases (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This device offers additional theoretical advantages, such as simplicity and versatility in pin placement, improved stability due to the rigid frame, and minimal stiffness of the ipsilateral knee joint due to the small size of the device.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Proximal screws placement</bold>.

Osteoporosis was also present in all patients. Exclusion criteria included dementia, reverse obliquity fractures, previous hip fracture, and pathological fractures. Patients with diabetes mellitus were not treated with external fixation due to the increased risk of pin-track infection. This patient population was randomly placed in two groups regarding to the proximal pin placement technique. In the first group (Group A; n = 35) the proximal pins were inserted in a convergent way, as proposed by the manufacturer, while in the second group (Group B; n = 35) the proximal pins were inserted in parallel, which is our modification of the technique.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Concomitant diseases in patients with intertrochanteric fractures of the hip treated with external fixation</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Concomitant diseases</th><th align="center">n</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold>Heart failure</bold></td><td align="center">39</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Coronal disease</bold></td><td align="center">32</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Hypertension</bold></td><td align="center">48</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Renal disease</bold></td><td align="center">16</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Thyreoeidopathy</bold></td><td align="center">5</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Anemia</bold></td><td align="center">15</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Pulmonary disease</bold></td><td align="center">22</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Malignancy</bold></td><td align="center">1</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>According to the American Society of Anesthesiologists, 47 patients were scored as ASA 3 and 23 patients as ASA 4. In group A, 12 patients had an AO type A1 fracture and 23 patients had an AO type A2 fracture. In group B, 13 patients had an AO type A1 fracture and 22 patients had an AO type A2 fracture. Before surgery no significant difference was noted between the two Groups regarding the fracture type. All patients were operated within the first three days after admission (mean; 2 days).</p><sec><title>Surgical Technique</title><p>Fifty-three patients had spinal anesthesia whereas 17 patients had general anesthesia. With the patient in a supine position on a fracture table, holding the leg under controlled traction the fracture was reduced in both planes under image intensification. Fracture reduction was assessed by evaluating major fragment translation and the femoral neck-shaft angle. Less than 5 mm of translation or gap and a neck-shaft angle with minor valgus (&#x0003c; 15 degrees) compared with the other leg were considered as a sufficient reduction on the anteroposterior view. In the lateral view less than 20 degrees of angulation was considered acceptable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Under fluoroscopic control two proximal and two distal 6.5-mm self-drilling and self-tapping screws were percutaneously inserted along the femoral neck and into the proximal femoral shaft, respectively.</p><p>In Group A, the most proximal screw was inserted first along the femoral neck within 5 mm from the superior cortex. The second proximal screw was inserted in a slight convergent way according to the Orthofix operative technique passing near the medial cortex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Clinical case with proximal screws placed in a convergent way</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

The appropriate position of the K-wire was confirmed by fluoroscopy at this point. Attention was paid to ensure that the tip of the screw was at least 5 mm far from the articular surface to prevent penetration. Using a special screw guide the first screw was inserted parallel to the K-wire, taking care to place it as near as possible to the medial cortex and at the center of the femoral neck by rotating the screw guide around the K-wire axis. The second screw was inserted parallel to the first one, following the screw seat of the external fixator proximal clamp and in the same depth as the first screw, requiring no extra radiation exposure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Moreover, it was possible to place the second screw slightly anteriorly or posteriorly in the femoral neck, by minimally rotating the device, if there was anterior or posterior cortex comminution. This modification leads to accurate proximal pin placement with minimal radiation exposure.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Clinical case with proximal screws placed in a parallel way</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

Intraoperative blood loss was minimal and postoperative haemoglobin levels were similar to the preoperative levels. Four patients with preoperative low hemoglobin levels required blood transfusion within the first 2 postoperative days to facilitate mobilization.</p><p>Follow-up visits were scheduled at 45, 90, and 180 days after surgery and new x-rays were performed at that time. During a minimum of 12-month follow-up period 6 patients, 2 from group A and 4 from group B, died from causes unrelated to the fracture. In the remaining 64 patients no clinically significant limitation of hip or knee range of motion was observed in patients of either group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). External fixator was removed in the outpatient department with local anesthesia after radiological confirmation of fracture consolidation, in a mean time of 98 days (range; 90-120 days) after surgery. Radiographic union was defined by the presence of trabeculae bridging the fracture site or obvious periosteal callus within the fracture line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The more prolonged healing time was noticed in fractures with subtrochanteric extension and medial cortex comminution. All fractures healed uneventfully (100% consolidation rate) in both groups. There was no sign of osteolysis around the screws, neither cut-out of the pins. A re-fracture occurred after external fixator removal in one patient from group A. In this patient, the fracture had not healed at the time of fixator removal. Due to the patient's impaired health, re-fracture was treated non-surgically (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Postoperative range of motion</bold>.

Forty-eight fractures (68.57%) were anatomically reduced whereas 22 fractures (31.43%) were reduced with valgus angulation of less than 15 degrees or with a small gap or translation of less than 5 mm. Furthermore, the femoral neck-shaft angle and the distance between the femoral head and the tip of the screws on the radiographs obtained prior to device removal were compared with those measured on the immediate postoperative radiographs. In 1 patient of group A and in 2 patients of group B the reduction was lost and the neck-shaft angle was 11 degrees varus on average (range; 10-13 degrees) compared with the immediate postoperative radiographs (p &#x0003e; 0.05).

Among these fractures, 50 to 60% are classified as unstable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Unstable intertrochanteric fractures occur more often with increased age and low bone mineral density and are associated with a high rate of complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Several methods of fixation have been proposed for the management of intertrochanteric fractures, such as compression hip screw and side plate, dynamic compression sliding plate, fixed angle blade plate, intramedullary sliding hip screw, and lately external fixator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Scott1 first described a method of treating intertrochanteric fractures by skeletal pinning and external fixation. Since then several authors have proposed multiple type of external fixators, but results were not so encouraging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. On the contrary, recent evidence supports that pertrochanteric fractures treated with newly developed external fixators have better results than those reported in previous studies of external fixation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. According to the same authors, external fixation can provide results that are similar to, or even better than, the results obtained with conventional internal fixation techniques. All these studies reported the advantages of external fixation including quick and simple application, minimal blood loss, less radiation exposure, pain reduction, satisfactory stability, and early weight-bearing. Pertrochanteric external fixator has been mainly used in elderly high-risk patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], as well as in multiple injured patients with complex fractures of the subtrochanteric region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The authors had the experience with the application of pertrochanteric external fixator. This study was designed in order to establish an easier method of application by minimizing the radiation exposure and the overall surgical time. The average intraoperative time was higher in group A, although no statistically different from the intraoperative time in group B. On the other hand, statistically significant difference was found in radiation exposure between the 2 Groups, with Group B requiring less C-arm usage than Group A for pin insertion.</p><p>The present study also confirms the advantages of external fixation for treating intertrochanteric fractures in elderly, high-risk patients. In accordance with previous studies, the mean intraoperative time for application of the fixator was short (21.8 minutes) compared with the one reported in other surgical methods, such as sliding hip screw, dynamic hip screw, intramedullary sliding hip screw, and Enders nails [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. There was no need of blood transfusion since blood loss during surgery was insignificant in opposition to other surgical methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. These parameters were crucial given that our group consisted of high-risk patients with several co-morbidities. An additional advantage of external fixation was the possibility of application under local anesthesia for patients who have poor general health in whom other options were not applicable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Varisation and limp shortening due to varous collapse are mechanical complications commonly reported after either internal or external fixation of unstable or severely osteoporotic intertrohanteric fractures. Although most of the patients in our series had poor bone quality, low incidence of mechanical complications was recorded and was similar in both groups. Varisation of a mean of 11 degrees was noted in 3 cases (4.7%). Migration of the proximal screws into the femoral head was recorded in 4 patients (6.2%). In all cases, the migration was less than 5 mm compared with the initial radiographs, without penetration into the joint or cut out. Vossinakis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] reported statistically significant lower incidence of proximal screw migration with the external fixator when compared with the sliding hip screw. In cases of proximal screw protrusion into the joint space or cut-out, treatment includes retraction of the offending screw without anesthesia. In our series we did not had any proximal screw migration of more than 5 mm and, more important, no cut out of the superior cortex.</p><p>All fractures healed uneventfully in both groups and none of our patients required further operation. Immediate postoperative full loading or lack of control of loading, often seen in elderly people, is usually the cause of reduction loss immediate postoperatively. Comminuted and severely osteoporotic fractures are also prone to lose of initial reduction. Moroni et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], in a similar study by using hydroxyapatite-coated screws, reported bone ingrowth into the coating and lower rate of varus collapse. Therefore, someone may suggest that the use of hydroxyapatite-coated screws could increase the stability of fixation. Furthermore, in stable intertrochanteric fractures the external fixator may act as a tension band [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Lateral placement increase the lever arm of the power and augments the physiological stress-reducing effect of the iliotibial tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In unstable fractures, due to its elasticity, external fixator enhances rapid and exuberant callus formation. Load sharing between the fractured bone and the external fixation is usually achieved and damaging stresses on the fixator are reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Large contact surface between the pins and the bone and a degree of controlled sliding that allows slight impaction at the fracture site contribute to mechanical stability as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Both methods of proximal screw placement showed comparable results. Parallel positioning of the proximal screws however, seems to be simpler method with less radiation exposure of the surgeon. This is due to the simplicity of the second screw placement parallel to the first one using the screw guide that minimizes the use of the C-arm.</p><p>In a previous study, Vossinakis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] proposed parallel insertion of proximal screws, whereas in a most recent study the same authors described convergent positioning of the proximal screws [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In both studies adequate results were reported. In our series, positioning of the screws in either parallel or convergent way did not affect the final outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study shows that external fixation is an effective treatment for intertrochanteric fractures in elderly high-risk patients. Operative time is short, blood loss is negligible, and stable fixation permits early mobilization. Proximal screw placement in either parallel or convergent way shows similar results and does not affect the final outcome. However, screw placement in a parallel way is a simpler method with less radiation exposure providing adequate fixation stability and therefore is recommended by the authors.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>There are no competing interests; this is a basic academic research initiative.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All authors contributed equally to this work.
