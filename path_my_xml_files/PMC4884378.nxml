In South Africa patients wait years for a hip/knee arthroplasty. Affected patients require effective management to address their pain, especially while awaiting surgery. Existing literature is mostly available from high income countries exploring effects of interventions during short waiting periods. Research is warranted in low income countries where long waiting periods are common. This study explored the effects of a six-week physiotherapist-led exercise and education intervention on pain in this population.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A randomised controlled trial was performed at two public hospitals in South Africa. Ethical approval and informed consent was obtained. 74 participants from arthroplasty waiting lists were randomly allocated to an intervention (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;35) or control group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;39). The intervention included six physiotherapist-led group-based sessions (two hours/week of education, exercise and relaxation). The control group received usual care. Data collection was conducted by blinded physiotherapists at baseline, week six, 12 and month six. The primary outcome was pain, measured by the Brief Pain Inventory. Additionally, participants completed an open-ended questionnaire at month six, to gain insight regarding the intervention. Analysis was by intention to treat using two-way analysis of variance and post-hoc Tukey comparisons. Answers to subjective questions were analysed according to common themes that emerged.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The intervention group had significant improvements compared with the control group with moderate to large effect sizes (ES) on pain severity [week 6: <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01, ES&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.94, 95 % CI (0.45,1.41), month 6: <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02.

Additionally, participants&#x02019; individual feedback supported observed significant improvements in pain. Such an intervention appears to be effective in managing pain in this population and should be incorporated into practice for appropriate patients. Further research is being conducted to explore long term and postoperative outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical trial registration</title><p>Pan African Clinical Trial Registry, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pactr.org/ATMWeb/appmanager/atm/atmregistry?_nfpb=true&#x00026;_windowLabel=trialViewer_1_2&#x00026;trialViewer_1_2_actionOverride=%2Fpageflows%2Ftrial%2FtrialViewer%2FviewTrail&#x00026;trialViewer_1_2id=885">PACTR201409000885765</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pactr.org/ATMWeb/appmanager/atm/atmregistry?_nfpb=true&#x00026;_windowLabel=trialViewer_1_2&#x00026;trialViewer_1_2_actionOverride=%2Fpageflows%2Ftrial%2FtrialViewer%2FviewTrail&#x00026;trialViewer_1_2id=1186">PACTR201507001186115</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12891-016-1088-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Hip/knee osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>Arthroplasty/joint replacement</kwd><kwd>Waiting list</kwd><kwd>Physiotherapy</kwd><kwd>Exercise</kwd><kwd>Education</kwd><kwd>Chronic pain</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>South African Society of Physiotherapy</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>University of Cape Town Margaret Roper Scholarship</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is known as the most common joint disease worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The prevalence of OA continues to rise exponentially in both high and low income countries, including South Africa (SA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The statistics from the Global Burden of Disease studies of 2010 reported the age-standardised prevalence rates of knee OA in Southern Sub Saharan Africa to be 3.1&#x000a0;% [95&#x000a0;% confidence interval (CI) 2.1, 4.5] in males and 5.2&#x000a0;% (95&#x000a0;% CI 3.5, 7.4) in females, with lower prevalence for those with hip OA (males: 0.6&#x000a0;%, 95&#x000a0;% CI 0.5, 0.7. Females: 0.8&#x000a0;%, (95&#x000a0;% CI 0.6, 0.9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This increasing prevalence is partlydue to an increasingly aged population, decreased physical activity and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The burden of OA leads to a large portion of the older population suffering with severe pain on a daily basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Due to the chronicity and complexity of OA, effective management is necessary at all stages of the condition to manage this population&#x02019;s pain.</p><p>As insight into this field of research is constantlyimproving, many evidence-based guidelines have beenpublished for the management of hip and knee OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The evidence-based management for OA begins with non-pharmacological methods of education, exercise and weight control. Pharmacological agents are subsequently added as required, in combination with the above first-line management. Finally, surgery is indicated for those with late stage OA who do not respond to conservative treatment methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>A major concern internationally is the limited accessibility of the recommended management options, especially in the public health system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This is true for many individuals in SA where first line management options are not readily accessible and delays in surgery are experienced as a result of long waiting lists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Waiting lists in secondary and tertiary health facilities in SA have been reported to range from one to eight years depending on the severity of the condition and the resources available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Waiting for surgery for six month or longer is reported to have various negativeimpacts on the individual including worse pain, function and quality of life, adding to the burden of OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Evidence for an exercise and education intervention</title><p>It is proposed that combining first line management recommendations for OA of exercise and education could provide a patient centred approach to ongoing management while awaiting arthroplasty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. While exercise interventions alone have shown no effects on pain or function in persons awaiting total knee replacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and only low to moderate effects on those awaiting total hip replacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], education and exercise delivered by programmes such as the ESCAPE programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and/or arthritis self-management programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] have been reported to be an effective method of not only improving knowledge, but also prolonging the belief that exercise is beneficial and achieving desired changes in exercise habits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Asevidence suggests, instead of merely educating on the importance of exercise, interventions should include both educational and active participatory exercise components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. To further expand on this it is anticipated that by combining both aspects, the optimal benefits of these two management options could be achieved by allowing the person to incorporate new knowledge from the educational component into practice and implement the advised changes in beliefs and behaviours, such as exercise, in order to experience the benefits first hand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Previous studies have shown benefits from various exercise and education interventions in persons with hip and knee OA; ranging from improvements in pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and exercise participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Despite literature supporting the use of combined interventions in persons with OA, studies specific to those with severe OA and awaiting surgery for extended periods such as the population in SA, are scarce.</p><p>To the authors&#x02019; knowledge, no such studies have been performed in the SA population and the above mentioned studies performed in higher income countries with more accessible resources and shorter waiting times cannot be generalised to the SA population.</p><p>Therefore, in response to the increasing burden of OA and long waiting lists for hip and knee arthroplasty in the public health system in SA, research was warranted to establish the effects of a pre-operative exercise and education intervention on pain, for patients with OA awaiting arthroplasty.

The sampling frame included patients who had been placed on a waiting list to receive a hip/knee arthroplasty, specifically in the public health system inthe Western Cape and Gauteng provinces. Principle investigators were given access to waiting lists at Tygerberg and Helen Joseph Hospital. Participants were required to be on the waiting list for a minimumof three months to allow for necessary stabilisation to any new medications that may have been prescribed or adjustments to their treatment when the patient was first put onto the list. Inclusion criteria were as follows: a willingness to commit to the study, aged between 50 &#x02013; 70&#x000a0;years, diagnosed with OA of the hip/knee, literate in English,Afrikaans, isiXhosa or isiZulu. Exclusion criteria were any cognitive impairment, as reported in the medical records, previous trauma/surgery to the unaffected leg, deemednot eligible for exercise as per the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines for exercise prescription. Reasons for exclusion according to theACSM included previous cardiac conditions or surgery,uncontrolled diabetes or asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Additionally those who had previously taken part in a six-week programme aimed at improving self-efficacy and management were excluded.</p><p>Since pain was the primary outcome measure in this study; a change in pain severity was selected to determine the required sample size using Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) data from a previous study on pain in people with OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Calculations used a smallest meaningful difference in pain scores of 3 (on a scale of 0 to 10 on the BPI), and a standard deviation of 2.49 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Statistical significance was accepted as <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 with a medium to large effect size (ES&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.5) accepted as meaningful. It was calculated that samples of 26, 36, and 45 participants in total would provide 80&#x000a0;%, 90&#x000a0;% and 95&#x000a0;% statistical power for change in pain respectively.</p><p>To allow for attrition at recruitment or during the study, a higher target sample size was preferred and recruitment was aimed at a maximum of 48 participants at each site to make up 2 groups of 24 (a maximum of 96 participants across both sites).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Recruitment procedure</title><p>The waiting lists at both facilities combined wereapproximately 4300 patients requiring arthroplasty for various reasons, including OA. Due to limited research personnel in the public health setting in SA and notbeing able to contact all patients, a random sample of 20&#x000a0;% of the total waiting list (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;781) was drawn forlogistical reasons, using random number selection in Microsoft Excel. This was done to ensure patients had a fairer chance of being contacted, rather than contacting patients from the top of the list down. Diagnosis was made by the orthopaedic surgeon at the first clinic visit when the patient was placed on the waiting list from clinical history, physical examination and radiographic images according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) clinical and radiological criteria. Those in the sample that met inclusion criteria were contacted telephonically by the primary investigators, to inform them of the nature of the study and to invite them to participate, if eligible. A large number of participants (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;685) were unreachable and/or excluded from participating for various reason such as incorrect age/diagnosis other than OA according to the waiting list information, previous surgery, not interested, transport issues (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Thus 96 participants were invited to attend baseline testing, 21 did not arrive due to losing interest or transport issues and 1 was excluded due to incorrect diagnosis, therefore 74 arrived and were eligible to partake.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Recruitment and randomisation process</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12891_2016_1088_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>The first 10 participants&#x02019; baseline meeting was utilised to pilot the baseline procedures of providing all relevant information to the participants, obtaining informedconsent, completing demographic information and completing baseline outcome measures.</p><p>This took place at the setting intended for the study where outcome measures and the intervention took place, with the presence of the principle investigator for the information and informed consent signing and the blinded physiotherapist research assistant (RA) for completing the outcome measures, at each hospital. Piloting went smoothly as participants were able to complete outcome measures with the assistance of the RA without issues, it was noted that the time allocated to eachsession of data collection was sufficient and no changes were needed to the methods of collecting data for theprimary outcome measure. Thereafter, the remaining 64 participants gave written informed consent anddemographic information (including age, gender, educational level, employment status, joints affected, BMI, co-morbidities and waiting time for surgery) was recorded with the help of the research assistant.

IsiXhosa and isiZulu translators were present for intervention sessions. The same physiotherapists led the six sessions to ensure content and delivery of the intervention remained constant. It took place for a maximum of two hours, on a weekly basis for six successive weeks, in groups of no more than 12 participants.

To address shortcomings found with other pain scales that neglect pain&#x02019;s characteristic as a variable factor, the BPI evaluates pain severity on the person&#x02019;s &#x0201c;worst&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;least&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;average&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;now&#x0201d; pain over the last 24&#x000a0;h instead of one score forintensity of pain during different tasks. A pain severity score is calculated as an average of these four scores.Pain interference is scored by evaluating the effect of pain on an activity sub-dimension (walking, generalactivity and work) and four other aspects of life (relationships with others, enjoyment of life, mood, forming the affective sub dimension, and sleep) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for the BPI). These two dimensions (severity and functioning) are the first two dimensions, described by the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) panel, which should be included in all research dealing with chronic pain evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p>Psychometric testing has been performed on the BPI&#x02019;s use in OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and its&#x02019; use in the assessment of pain to distinctly depict pain intensity and its effects on function is supported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The BPI has high levels of testre-test reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] and internal consistency in various languages and does not display cultural bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Of particular interest to this study, the BPI has been used in studies of OA which reported good internal consistencies; particularly for the subscale of pain interference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p><p>The BPI has previously been translated into Afrikaans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] as well as isiXhosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The IMMPACT panel has specifically singled out the pain interference scale from the BPI as a recommended scale to use for assessment of pain-related functional impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p><p>Besides the BPI, secondary measures of disability [Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], function (The Physical Performance Task Battery) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], self-efficacy (The Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease 6-Item Scale) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] and health related quality of life (EQ-5D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] were taken at all follow up intervals (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p><p>In addition, the experimental group were asked to complete an open ended questionnaire at the six month follow up meeting. A simple questionnaire was constructed by the principle investigators to include seven open ended questions about the six-week intervention and workbook used. This questionnaire did not go through any process of validation. The questions are included in the Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. This was to gain some insight into the participants&#x02019; personal thoughts or feelings around the intervention and the individual effects thereof.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary outcome measure of pain severity according to the BPI at baseline showed that data werenormally distributed [Week 0 BPI severity: <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;74, K-S p value&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.20 (K-S p&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05)].

This is seen by clinically relevant findings in the experimental group with significant improvements in pain severity and interference with moderate to large effect sizes, when compared to the control group.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Discussion</title><p>As pain is the most common complaint of those suffering with OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], most studies performed in this field assess pain severity. In this study, the BPI shows an exercise and education intervention can result in amoderate effect on pain; as seen by the sustained significant reduction in pain severity scores over time. It is noted that the changes in pain severity between groups approach what is considered a meaningful difference in pain (3 on a scale of 0 &#x02013; 10). The intervention&#x02019;s reported mean effect size on pain (ES 0.94 and 0.74 at week 6 and month 6 respectively) is larger than previous studies reporting the effects of exercise <italic>alone</italic> on pain in persons with OA (ES 0.39 &#x02013; 0.58) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Fransen and colleagues similarly reported a large ES for pain after an exercise intervention in persons with knee OA (ES&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.94, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) yet combined data for hip and knee OA show small to moderate effect with a smaller effect at its lower CI (ES 0.46, 95&#x000a0;% Cl (0.35, 0.57) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. This is better matched to the lower confidence interval noted in the current study for reduction in pain severity. However, comparison to Fransen et al.s&#x02019; study on exercise should be made with caution as they only followed their participants for four months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>].</p><p>It is important to consider the precision of the reported effect size in this current study when interpreting results as the CI of 0.45 &#x02013; 1.41 and 0.26 &#x02013; 1.2 at week six and month six show a considerable difference inconfidence limits. The lower limit (0.45 and 0.26) of the effect size for changes seen in pain severity at week six and month six report a small to moderate effect at most whereas the upper limit (1.41 and 1.2) are seen as very large effects. Thus these results for pain severity should be interpreted with a degree of caution.</p><p>Elsewhere, effect sizes for pain severity in prior studies on similar integrated interventions in knee OA range from 0.2 to 0.27 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. A study of integrated exercise and education by Lamb et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] is more in line with the longer waiting periods (over a year) experienced in the SA population and is supported by the current study&#x02019;s findings. Lamb et al. showed moderate effect sizes for pain improvement are attainable in those with knee OA in patients with symptoms on average of 10&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, their study did not make use of a control group which highlights a strength of the current study&#x02019;s design.</p><p>For a chronic pain condition such as OA, it is not only how much pain one has but the debilitating effect that pain has on the person&#x02019;s daily life and interactions that requires attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. An intervention including self-management strategies, such as the present intervention, with a focus on the effect of pain rather than just the amount of pain is recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Previous research has shown the debilitating effects of pain from being on relatively short waiting lists (less than 12&#x000a0;months); with worse pain and effects on function being correlated to longer periods of waiting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. As a result of this sample&#x02019;s long waiting period (average of two years, six months), it was anticipated that this group would present at baseline with severe interference in physical and emotional functioning as a result of pain (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.23, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.25). Despite this, the findings show that the intervention can significantly reduce and sustain lower pain interference scores.</p><p>Again, the large mean effects in pain interference,particularly at week six (ES&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.2, 95&#x000a0;% CI, 0.7, 1.69) and month six (ES&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.98, 95&#x000a0;% CI, 0.49, 1.45), are notably better than the ES of pharmacological agents such as NSAIDS (ES&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.32, 95&#x000a0;% CI 0.24, 0.39) and acetaminophen (ES =0.21, 95&#x000a0;% CI, 0.02, 0.41) for pain in people with OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Both NSAIDs and analgesics are prescribed to most, if not all, patients on a waiting list as part of the first-line management of OA despite small ES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, the ES of the combined treatment of exercise and education used in this study on pain interference was again larger than the ES on pain in hip and knee OA for aerobic exercise <italic>alone</italic> (ES&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.52, 95&#x000a0;% CI, 0.34, 0.70), strength exercise <italic>alone</italic> (ES&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.32, 95&#x000a0;% CI, 0.23, 0.42), water-based exercise <italic>alone</italic> (ES&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.25, 95&#x000a0;% CI, 0.02, 0.47) or education or self-managementinterventions <italic>alone</italic> (ES&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.06, 95&#x000a0;% CI, 0.02, 0.10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Therefore, it can be said that the effects of change for pain interference are of a higher precision than thosereported for pain severity with the differences in CI limits being smaller, particularly for pain interference atweek 6. The large and more precise effect of the combined intervention seen in this study for pain interference appear more accurate and may be considered a more effective treatment strategy for these patients than pharmacological agents or individual treatment approaches.</p><p>The individual answers grouped together formed themes which was helpful to link the benefits observed in pain scores over time with responses given relating to pain relief. Many (53&#x000a0;%) of the participants&#x02019; responses to the questionnaire supported the significant improvement in pain scores seen across the sample.</p><p>The participants&#x02019; improved self efficacy after six weeks shows that the intervention may have resulted in improved self-belief in their ability to achieve goals orperform an activity. However, the ES is moderate and the significant difference between groups is quite small (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.72, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.51) with a wide CI limit (0.28, 1.22) and the effect is not sustained beyond six weeks. This finding should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>The significant improvement in HRQoL at week 12 may be interpreted as a consequence of improvements in pain levels and interference since commencement of the study. However this finding should also be interpreted with caution as correlation calculations were not performed to confirm this. Similarly as mentioned above, even though the ES is moderate, the CI limits are again very wide (0.24, 1.18) and this significant difference is not consistent at week six or sustained at month six.</p><p>The findings of no improvements in disability or function are not necessarily surprising in this sample awaiting surgery with moderate to high levels of disability at baseline. It is anticipated that a more meaningful improvement in pain severity and interference could possibly translate into improvements in these areas and further research could confirm this hypothesis.</p><p>Since the wait for surgery is so lengthy in the public health sector in SA, the benefits recorded after this short intervention are encouraging and support the previously identified need to improve pain and related function in those whose waiting period is longer than a year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The current study appears to have begun to meet this need by reducing pain severity and interference while awaiting surgery after just six weeks of an exercise and education intervention. This is in contrast to otherstudies which report benefits to be evident only after a longer period of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Despite the current study following participants for shorter than the recommended duration of 12&#x000a0;months, the results are considered as a positive contribution towards further research in this field as improvements in pain severity and particularly pain interference were observed after only six weeks and sustained at month six.</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Strengths/limitations</title><p>A moderate sample was recruited from two different regions of the country, servicing two populations with osteoarthritis. This allows for a limited degree of generalizability to the broader population of OA sufferersawaiting a joint replacement, in the SA public health system. However, it is important to note that over 90&#x000a0;% of those on the waiting lists were not included in the study for different reasons (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This is a potential source of recruitment bias. Those not included in the study for unspecified reasons may have been either (a) too ill to participate or (b) not experiencing sufficient pain to be motivated to participate. If the majority of unspecified non-participants fell into either of these categories, the results may be biased. Another aspect is that this sample had slightly low educational levels compared to those in upperincome countries; which is representative of the large portion of the previously disadvantaged population, who consequently also have low income levels and therefore attend public health facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Caution should be applied as these findings might not be transferable to those in the private health sector who may have higher educational levels or wait shorterperiods for surgery.</p><p>Although the use of medication and percentage painrelief obtained from medication was recorded on the BPI, specific use of medication in terms of type, dose or how often medication was used was not recorded. This could be valuable data to determine whether the interventionaffected the use of medication or whether medication use influenced how participants responded to the intervention. It is recommended that future research into this field should consider medication use and effects thereof.</p><p>As Hurley and colleagues state, loss to follow up is a common problem during research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This was not too concerning at the first follow up session as seen by only 10&#x000a0;% loss to follow up, however higher attrition rates at week 12 (23&#x000a0;%) and month 6 (25&#x000a0;%) should be considered during interpretation of the findings. To manage missing data, data was carried forward from the lastobserved measure. This may have led to blunting ofresults and therefore it is recommended that for future studies researchers explore a different approach such as &#x0201c;multilevel modeling and multiple imputation to generate robust predictions of the effect of missing data&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. Despite the risk of further loss to follow up, it is recommended that future trials extend the follow up period to at least 12&#x000a0;months as long lasting benefits are especially needed in persons on a long surgical waiting list [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Another study is currently underway to extend follow up duration which will provide valuable comparative data whereby the current findings can be compared with prior long term research concerning persons with OA awaiting arthroplasty as well as post-operatively. In addition to this, it is suggested that future researchevaluates whether such an intervention has differenteffects on those with OA of the knee or hip,&#x000a0;and/or any effect on the need to still be on a waiting list for surgery.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The rationale behind undertaking the present study was primarily due to the rising burden of osteoarthritis affecting thousands of individuals awaiting surgery in SouthAfrica. This study provides evidence for an acceptable and effective evidence-based short term non-pharmacological and non-surgical intervention that can be easily delivered by a physiotherapist. The intervention appears to beeffective in reducing this population&#x02019;s suffering by reducing pain severity and interference and is well received by patients. Further research into this population of interest will be of value in determining longer lasting effects while awaiting surgery, whether the need for surgery can berevised, whether medication use has any influence as well as whether such a pre-operative intervention can have any significant effects post-operatively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ACR, American College of Rheumatology; ACSM, American College of Sports Medicine; ANOVA, analysis of variance; BMI, body mass index; BPI, brief pain inventory; CI, confidence interval; CONSORT, Consolidation of Standards of Reporting Trials; DI, disability index; ES, effect size; ESCAPE, enabling self-management and coping with arthritic knee pain through exercise; HAQ, health assessment questionnaire; ICF, International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health; IMMPACT, initiative on methods, measurement, and pain assessment in clinical trials; OA, osteoarthritis; SA, South Africa; VAS, visual analogue scale</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec22"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12891_2016_1088_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>&#x0201c;Appendix&#x0201d; includes examples of the exercise component of the intervention, the Brief Pain Inventory, open-ended questionnaire, secondary measures and the CONSORT guidelines table.
