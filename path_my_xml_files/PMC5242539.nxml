This is probably due to antimicrobial factors in human milk, such as immunoglobulins, antibacterial proteins/peptides, leukocytes and probiotic bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], but also ligand epitopes for attachment/clearance of opportunistic and commensal bacteria, such as oligosaccharides (free or on glycoproteins or lipids), lactose, and proteins/peptides [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, protection against infections from milk could be mediated by direct effects on pathogens, or by factors influencing the ecology of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The latter is supported by the fact that the complex microbiomes of the GI tract (mouth and gut) differ distinctly between breast-fed and formula-fed infants [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169831.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>In the development of infant formulas with the aim to narrow the gap between breast-fed and formula-fed infants, the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM), a small but in terms of biological activities significant milk fraction, has gained interest since it seems to have several health promoting effects including defense against infections [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This membrane fraction includes several components with antimicrobial effects including gangliosides [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], oligosaccharides [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and the glycoproteins butyrophilin, lactadherin and mucins [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169831.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The MFGM fraction thus has potential to affect bacteria attachment, colonization, clearance and metabolism in the oral cavity and the gut [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Historically, the MFGM has been discarded with the milk fat in the manufacturing of infant formula as blends of vegetable oils have been used as the fat source.</p><p>We have, in a recently performed randomized controlled trial, evaluated health effects in infants fed an experimental formula (EF) supplemented with a bovine MFGM fraction, compared to infants fed standard formula (SF) [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Infants fed the EF had a significantly lower incidence of infections leading to hospital stay or prescription of antibiotics during the first 6 months, and the most common diagnosis was acute otitis media (AOM). The EF group also had lower use of antipyretics and differed in antibody titers against pneumococcal vaccine [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We concluded that MFGM supplementation provided a protective effect against infections, especially AOM. Bacterial colonization of the upper airways has been suggested to be important for the pathogenesis in AOM [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and not only nasopharynx cultures [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] but also cultures from saliva [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169831.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] at onset of AOM correlate to otopathogens</p><p>The aim of this study, which was part of the above described clinical trial [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], was to characterize and compare the oral microbiome in infants fed MFGM supplemented formula with that of infants fed standard formula or a breast-fed reference group. Our hypothesis was that MFGM exposure would influence the composition of the oral microbiota and that the altered microbiota would contribute to a reduced risk of AOM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Ethics Statements</title><p>The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Ume&#x000e5;, Sweden (Dnr 07-083M), and conducted according to the principles in the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all caregivers. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00624689.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Study Subjects</title><p>Exclusively formula-fed infants (n = 160) were recruited consecutively from March 2008 to February 2012 and randomized to receive standard (SF, BabySemp 1<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Semper AB, Sundbyberg, Sweden) or experimental (EF) formula until 6 months of age as described previously [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The EF had a reduced protein concentration (1.20 vs. 1.27 g/100mL), a reduced energy density (60 vs. 66 kcal/100 mL) and was supplemented with a bovine MFGM concentrate (Lacprodan MFGM-10<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Arla Foods Ingredients, Viby, Denmark). A breast-fed reference group (BFR) consisting of 80 infants was also recruited. The inclusion criteria were &#x0003c;2 months of age, gestational age at birth 37&#x02013;42 weeks, birth weight 2 500&#x02013;4 500 g, absence of chronic illness, and exclusively formula-fed at baseline, and for the breast-fed reference group that the infant was exclusively breast-fed at inclusion and that the mother had the intention to breast-feed until 6 months. All caregivers were recommended to not give any taste portions of complementary foods until the infant was 4 months of age, and then only small amounts up to 6 months of age. Weight and length were assessed at visits at baseline, 4, 6 and 12-months of age. Compliance to the diet regimen and information on intake of taste portions, probiotic drops and antibiotics, as well as disease symptoms, medical contacts and given medications were assessed by a prospective parental diary and from medical records. As described in detail previously [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], the number of included infants was based on a pre-study power analysis for the original study to detect a difference of 0.5 SD in the main outcomes weight-for-age and cognitive score at a significance level of 0.05.

Sequences with a minimum length of 300 base pairs after primer sequence removal, with correct barcode sequences and primer sequences, and not meeting default quality filtering criteria for homopolymers and quality scores in QIIME were retained. Chimeric sequences, as identified by UCLUST, were removed. Retained sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% similarity to the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.homd.org/">http://www.homd.org/</ext-link>) and taxonomically named by BLAST to the same database for one representative sequence per OTU. The HOMD is a curated database holding 700 named species and taxa identified from 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of oral isolates and cloning studies. In HOMD, approximately 54% are named species, 14% unnamed (but cultivated) and 32% are known only as uncultivated phylotypes.

Normally (confirmed by Shapiro-Wilk&#x000b4;s tests) distributed variables were presented as means with 95% confidence intervals and differences between means tested with ANOVA. For non-normally distributed variables medians with range were calculated, and the Kruskal-Wallis test used to test differences between groups. HOT taxa prevalence were highly skewed with &#x0003e;50% of the subjects lacking detection. Therefore, detection frequency (% children) and mean prevalence (% of total number of reads) in the three feeding groups are presented, together with median prevalence among those with detected taxa. Differences in distributions between groups were tested using Chi-square test. For comparisons between HOT taxa a p-value &#x02264;0.008 (accounting for multiple testing by the False discovery rate), and for other variables a p-value &#x0003c;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p><p>Rarefaction curves were calculated to compare microbial richness among the three feeding group samples, and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) to compare the phylogenetic diversity (&#x003b2; diversity) and search for clustering of samples based on the OTU assignment by QIIME. In addition, multivariate principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least square (PLS, SIMCA P+, version 12.0, Umetrics AB, Ume&#x000e5;, Sweden) regression with assigned taxa and potential confounders (mode of delivery, sex, anthropometric measures and lactobacilli by culture) in the independent block were done. These analyses searched for clustering of samples based on taxonomic assignment with addition of potential confounders (PCA) and to identify taxa associated with the EF, SF or BFR groups (PLS regression) as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For PCA and PLS regression, variables were auto-scaled to unit variance, and cross-validated predictions of Y (here feeding groups) were calculated. Clustering of subjects is displayed in a score-loading plot, and the importance of each x-variable is displayed in a loading plot. Variables with a 95% confidence interval for the PLS correlation coefficient that did not include zero, were considered statistically significant. Besides the explanatory R<sup>2</sup>-value, PLS regression provides a cross validated predictive value (Q<sup>2</sup>) of the model.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec014"><title>Results</title><p>Of the infants included in the basic trial, sequencing of the oral microbiota was performed in 64%, 56% and 49% of the 4 months old, and 81%, 81% and 72% of the 12 months old infants in the EF, SF and BFR groups, respectively.

When comparing the EF and SF groups, the main findings at 4 months of age were that 8 HOT-taxa (3 highly and 5 moderately significant) were characteristic for the EF, while 10 other HOT-taxa were characteristic for the SF group. The species richness did not differ between the two formula-fed groups. Moreover, it was found that the species richness at 4 months was significantly lower in breast-fed than in formula-fed infants.</p><p>The most striking finding in the present study was the distinctly different composition of the oral microbiota in the breast-fed compared with the formula-fed infants. This, which is previously well documented for the gut [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169831.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and described for the oral [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] microbiota, may reflect transmission of bacteria from the milk <italic>per se</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and/or effects of various milk components on the metabolism or attachment of single bacterial species [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169831.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Hence, the characteristic presence of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in the mouth of breast-fed infants that we report is well in line with their presence in milk [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and the gut of breast-fed infants [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It may also be noted that the present metagenomic analysis confirms our previous finding from culturing and colony sequencing of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>gasseri</italic> being one species that characterizes breast-fed versus formula-fed infants [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Furthermore, our finding of a lower species richness in breast-fed compared with formula-fed infants is in accordance with results reported for the fecal microbiome [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Notably, this difference in species richness was gone when the infants were 12 months old while some differences in the oral microbiota remained even though breast-feeding in most cases was discontinued since several months. This indication of a long-term effect of breast-feeding on the gastrointestinal microbiota deserves to be followed-up.</p><p>The MFGM envelops the fat globules in milk and facilitates their secretion from the mammary gland, but it also has important biological functions, including antimicrobial effects <italic>in vitro</italic> and in animal studies [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169831.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169831.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We recently reported that infants fed the MFGM supplemented formula had a lower incidence of AOM and less use of antipyretics [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and Bruggencate et al [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] found that MFGM intake reduced <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> induced diarrhea in adults. Taken together, these results support a modifying effect of MFGM on the proliferation of certain bacterial species and/or symptoms of infection. The mechanism by which this may occur was not evaluated in the present study, but as the MFGM concentrate is rich in both non-glycosylated and glycosylated bioactive proteins and lipids it may be anticipated that these contribute by modulating the first steps in colonization, i.e. attachment of the bacterial cells and/or their metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169831.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169831.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In general, there are few studies where the effects of MFGM on infection-related conditions have been studied, and the present study is the first study to show <italic>in vivo</italic> effects on the complex microbiota in the mouth. The results suggest that the findings should be followed-up for potential effects also in the gut.</p><p>It may be speculated whether the differences we found in the oral microbiota between the EF and SF groups may relate to the lower incidence of AOM among EF-fed infants up to 6 months of age [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The most common bacteria found in the middle ear in otitis are <underline><italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic></underline>, <underline><italic>H</italic>. <italic>influenzae</italic></underline> and <underline><italic>M</italic>. <italic>catarrhalis</italic></underline> [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In this perspective, it is interesting that <italic>M</italic>. <italic>catarrhalis</italic> was less prevalent in oral swabs from the 4 months old EF infants compared to those in the SF group.</p><p>One more notable observation in the present study, was that at 12 months of age, the presence of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic>, an opportunistic bacterial species associated with early childhood caries [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], was more prevalent in formula-fed than in breast-fed infants. The association between breast-feeding and risk of caries is debated, but as it is known that earlier colonization by <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> is associated with higher risk for caries development at older age, these results would speak in favor for breast-feeding also in this respect [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown that both human and bovine milk may inhibit the metabolism and adhesion of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> but results are inconclusive [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169831.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, comparisons between formula-fed and breast-fed infants in the present study should be made with caution since these groups were not randomized. There might be unknown group differences correlated to oral microbiota acquisition, i.e. we do not have detailed information on dentation status at 12 months of age.</p><p>The strengths of the present study were the double-blind randomized design among formula-fed infants, that sampling was done by trained research nurses and that information on both mode of delivery and use of antibiotics was available. An additional strength was that the obtained sequences could be taxonomically defined against a curated 16S rDNA database specifically built for oral bacteria. The potential sources for bias include selection bias and unbalanced exposure to antibiotics and mode of delivery. Notably, antibiotics had not been given to any of the 4 months-old infants included in the study, and sensitivity analyses in infants that were vaginally delivered confirmed that the overall findings were solid. We cannot exclude that there is a certain degree of selection bias in the study group compared to the general population, but do not think this is significant since allocation to the two formula groups was random and differences in infant growth and microbiota between breast-fed and formula-fed infants are well in line with previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0169831.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169831.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The microbiota in the oral cavity of infants fed a formula supplemented with MFGM differed from that of infants fed standard formula for a set of taxa.
