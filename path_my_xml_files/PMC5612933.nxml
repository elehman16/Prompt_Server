The present study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) photolysis-based antimicrobial chemotherapy adjunctively performed with root debridement (RD) for moderate to severe periodontitis. A randomized controlled trial was conducted that included 53 patients with 142 test teeth. The test teeth were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: Group 1, RD&#x02009;+&#x02009;H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis; Group 2, RD followed by administration of a local drug delivery system (minocycline chloride gel); or Group 3, RD alone. Clinical and microbiological examination were performed for up to 12 weeks following treatment. Probing pocket depth (PPD) and bleeding on probing (BoP) were improved after each treatment session. At 12 weeks, Group 1 had achieved significantly lower PPDs than the other groups, though there were no significant differences in BoP between Group 1 and the other groups. Counts of <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic>, a known periodontal pathogen, in Group 1 were significantly lower than those in Group 3, and were comparable to those in Group 2. Therefore, it is suggested that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis treatment can be used as a novel adjunctive antimicrobial chemotherapy for non-surgical periodontal treatment.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease caused by pathogenic microorganisms in dental plaque (microbial biofilm), resulting in periodontal pocket formation, and loss of periodontal attachment and alveolar bone around the tooth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Thus, periodontal therapy by mainly mechanical instrumentation, such as debridement, scaling and root planing (SRP), is performed to reduce the microbial load and/or disrupt microbial biofilm. Kieser proposed that debridement (defined as instrumentation for disruption and removal of microbial biofilms) should be assessed before proceeding to more aggressive instrumentations, such as scaling (instrumentation for removal of mineralized deposits) and root planing (instrumentation for removal of contaminated cementum and dentin)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In this context, mechanical debridement using an ultrasonic scaler is widely performed, which removes less tooth structure than hand instruments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. A number of clinical studies have demonstrated that non-surgical periodontal therapy, including less-invasive debridement, is an effective treatment modality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> when accompanied by proper oral hygiene control. However, deep periodontal pockets tend to respond poorly to non-surgical therapy in comparison with shallow pockets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Mechanical debridement can be supplemented with antimicrobial chemotherapy, such as systemic antibiotics and topical application of antimicrobials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. However, improper use of systemic antibiotics could be accompanied by side effects, such as gastrointestinal problems, and the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria. As such, prescription of systemic antibiotics should be cautiously considered. To reduce the risk of systemic side effects, antibiotics incorporated into sustained-release vehicles (e.g., gels) at lower doses than in systemic administration have been developed and clinically applied; this method is known as a local drug delivery system (LDDS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Although multiple meta-analyses have shown that the use of LDDSs in conjunction with mechanical debridement improves periodontal conditions more than debridement alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, the possibility of inducing bacterial resistance to the antibiotics cannot be ruled out. In addition, an LDDS usually requires multiple applications at specific intervals to ensure adequate exposure time of the subgingival bacteria to the drug<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, which may be inconvenient or result in poor patient compliance.</p><p id="Par4">To overcome the shortcomings of LDDSs, a novel antimicrobial technique, in which hydroxyl radicals generated by hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) photolysis act as the active ingredient, has been developed in our laboratory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Since hydroxyl radicals are powerful oxidizing agents, they cause lethal oxidative damage to microorganisms. Hydroxyl radicals cannot be formulated into a ready-made disinfectant due to their very short life in a liquid medium (approximately 10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup>&#x02009;s)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Instead, they can be generated by irradiating 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> inside the periodontal pocket with light at a wavelength of 405&#x02009;nm (i.e., photolysis)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Since the light and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can penetrate the microbial biofilm, this antimicrobial technique is effective against biofilm-forming bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The bactericidal effect is strong, killing biofilm-forming bacteria with a&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;4-log reduction of viable counts within one minute, and as such, a single treatment session may be sufficient for periodontal therapy. Furthermore, an <italic>in vitro</italic> study has suggested that repeated treatment using H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis does not induce bacterial resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. This is likely due to non-selective damage to bacterial cells caused by the hydroxyl radicals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Hence, this technique is expected to be an effective alternative to LDDS for periodontal therapy.</p><p id="Par5">Concerning the safety of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis treatment, the Food and Drug Administration of the United States considers the application of 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to oral mucosa &#x0201c;acceptable&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, and light at 405&#x02009;nm is within the range of visible light. In addition, it has been demonstrated that exposure of the oral mucosa to hydroxyl radicals generated by 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis for a short time does not cause abnormal histological changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Based on these pre-clinical studies, we have developed a therapeutic device, named RP-14, that can perform ultrasonic root debridement (RD) concomitantly with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis-based antimicrobial treatment. In this context, we hypothesized that 1) RD&#x02009;+&#x02009;H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis treatment would not result in inferior improvement of the periodontal condition in comparison to RD&#x02009;+&#x02009;LDDS treatment for moderate to severe periodontitis, and 2) RD&#x02009;+&#x02009;H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis treatment would improve the periodontal condition more than RD alone. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of RD&#x02009;+&#x02009;H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis treatment by testing the formulated hypotheses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par6">This randomized controlled trial was conducted from July 2015 to April 2016.

The mean age of the patients was 55.5 years (standard deviation: 8.2). Forty-three patients were treated at the university hospital, while 10 were treated at the private clinic.

The initial PPDs for Groups 1 (RD&#x02009;+&#x02009;H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis treatment), 2 (RD&#x02009;+&#x02009;LDDS treatment), and 3 (RD alone) were 6.76, 6.88, and 6.93&#x02009;mm, respectively, while BoP was 100% for all groups. Fifty-two of 53 patients completed the 12-week study period. One patient, having three test sites, was withdrawn from follow-up because antibiotic administration became necessary due to development of acute periodontitis at a non-test site. At site level, treatment of a maxillary second molar site in Group 1 was discontinued because a perforation of the sinus membrane was observed during treatment; this test site was thus excluded from analysis owing to lack of data after treatment. Therefore, the intention-to-treat analysis was performed using data obtained from 141 test sites (Group 1, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;48 sites; Group 2, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;46 sites; and Group 3, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;47 sites).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Patient demographic data and clinical characteristics of the test sites.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>All groups</th><th>Group 1</th><th>Group 2</th><th>Group 3</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

The results demonstrated that RD&#x02009;+&#x02009;H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis treatment (Group 1) was not significantly inferior to RD&#x02009;+&#x02009;LDDS treatment (Group 2) regarding the primary outcome (PPD at the 12-week examination). Moreover, PPDs at 12 weeks after RD&#x02009;+&#x02009;H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis treatment were significantly smaller than those after treatment with RD&#x02009;+&#x02009;LDDS and RD alone (Group 3). Thus, the hypotheses were accepted, suggesting that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis treatment can be beneficial when used as an adjunctive antimicrobial chemotherapy during non-surgical periodontal treatment.</p><p id="Par12">Group 1 showed the highest reduction in PPD during the initial 4-week healing period. Subsequently, the PPDs in all groups were slightly reduced or maintained, and as such, the differences between the three groups remained almost unchanged up to 12 weeks. These findings suggest that RD&#x02009;+&#x02009;H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis treatment brings about PPD reduction during the early phase of healing. PPD reduction after periodontal treatment generally occurs as a result of 1) gingival recession, 2) clinical attachment gain, and 3) a combination of the two. In all groups, gingival recession might equally occur as a result of traumatic injury by mechanical instrumentation (RD) and resolution of swelling of gingiva. It was reported that SRP with subgingival irrigation using 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> resulted in comparable gingival recession to SRP without irrigation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. This suggests that 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> itself may not contribute to additional gingival recession. Thus, the establishment of a shallower PPD in Group 1 than that in Groups 2 and 3 might be the consequence of additional clinical attachment gain. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis treatment most probably exerted maximum bactericidal effect at the base of periodontal pockets because laser light and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> are released from the end of the scaler tip placed around the base during treatment. The base of the pocket is the site where re-attachment of periodontal soft tissue will start after treatment. Thus, we speculate that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis treatment might create a more suitable environment for acquiring clinical attachment gain, leaving less bacteria at the base of periodontal pockets, than RD&#x02009;+&#x02009;LDDS and RD alone. Regarding BoP, there was no significant difference between Group 1 and the other groups, except for the difference between Groups 1 and 2 at the 4-week examination (P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.037). At the 12-week examination, BoP in Group 1 (37%) was comparable to that of Groups 2 (38%) and 3 (44%). An approximate 60% reduction in BoP 12 weeks after treatment is in accordance with results reported in the literature wherein non-surgical treatment for moderate to severe periodontitis was evaluated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par13">Microbiological analysis revealed that all treatment modalities decreased the total bacterial and <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> counts in the periodontal pockets. Since RD is a mechanical means of removing bacteria from the root surface, it stands to reason that RD alone should lead to a substantial reduction in bacteria. Accordingly, there were no significant differences in total bacterial counts between Groups 1 and 3. In contrast, <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> counts in Group 1 were significantly lower than those in Group 3, and were comparable to those in Group 2. These findings demonstrate that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis treatment is effective at reducing periodontal pathogens, as was LDDS, though the reduction of total bacterial counts by the RP-14 device was minimal. Since hydroxyl radicals generated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis do not diffuse over long distances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, the bactericidal effect via lethal oxidative damage, such as DNA oxidation and lipid peroxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, is exerted only when and where H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is irradiated by laser light. As mentioned above, in the RP-14 system, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and laser light are released from the end of the scaler tip, which was placed at the base of the periodontal pocket during treatment. Hence, <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> inhabiting the base of the pocket would be effectively reduced in Group 1. Comparing Groups 1 and 2, the former exhibited a larger reduction in PPD than the latter, even though the reduction of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> was comparable. During LDDS, antibiotics incorporated into the gel were repeatedly delivered to the periodontal pocket, which may affect the healing of periodontal tissue, thereby interfering with pocket reduction. Unlike H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis treatment, the bactericidal effects of 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> alone and laser irradiation at 405&#x02009;nm alone are limited, as demonstrated by pre-clinical studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Thus, bacteria inhabiting the upper portion of the periodontal pocket would not be effectively reduced. This might result in slightly higher total bacterial counts as well as significantly higher BoP at the 4-week examination in Group 1 than Group 2. The bacteria left at the upper portion of the periodontal pockets in Group 1 might prolong the inflammation of the upper portion of the gingiva, maintaining a relatively high BoP during the initial healing process. However, since patients were enrolled in a meticulous oral hygiene program, the influence of the bacteria at the upper portion of the periodontal pockets might be diminished by the supragingival plaque control in a time dependent manner. As a consequence, BoP in Group 1 became comparable to that in Groups 2 and 3 at the 12-week examination. Concerning the microbiological analysis, it should be noted that the present study dealt with only <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> and total bacteria. Recent advances in sequencing technologies make it possible to comprehensively analyse microbiota. Thus, to better understand how H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis treatment affects periodontal bacterial flora, a further study on microbiota using next-generation sequencing technology should be conducted.</p><p id="Par14">RD was performed with the same amplitude and frequency of the ultrasonic scaler tips in all groups. However, since hollow- and solid-type scaler tips were used in Group 1 and the other groups, respectively, there was a difference in kinetic energy between the groups. Kinetic energy is expressed by the equation <italic>E</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;<italic>mv</italic>
<sup>2</sup>
<italic>/</italic>2, where <italic>E</italic> is kinetic energy (J), <italic>m</italic> is the mass of the object (kg), and <italic>v</italic> is speed (m/s). Since the scaler tips vibrated at the same speed regardless of the type (since they had the same amplitude and frequency), the energy was proportional to the weight of the end portion of the scaler tip. The weights of the end portions of the scaler tips, calculated based on the blueprints and the gravity of the material, were 39.6&#x02009;mg for the hollow-type and 77.8&#x02009;mg for the solid-type. Thus, the kinetic energy of the hollow-type scaler tip was nearly half that of the solid-type. Indeed, when the acrylic resin plate was subjected to ultrasonic scaling using the hollow- and solid-type scaler tips, the weight loss caused by the former was almost half that caused by the latter. Therefore, the RD performed in Group 1 may have been less aggressive than that performed in the other groups. Nonetheless, Group 1 exhibited the lowest PPDs. This finding suggests that less-aggressive mechanical debridement would be sufficient when performed in conjunction with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis treatment.</p><p id="Par15">We confirmed that the safety of periodontal treatment using the RP-14 system was generally acceptable. Although two adverse events were observed (sinus membrane perforation and stomatitis of the tongue) that may have been possibly correlated to treatment using the RP-14, they were not likely related to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis treatment. Perforation of the sinus membrane was more likely caused by RD than H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis. Since it has been demonstrated that the hydroxyl radicals generated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis do not damage the oral mucosa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, it is reasonable to assume that the perforation was caused by the mechanical intervention. However, since an influx of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into the sinus may be harmful, it is important to diagnose possible sinus membrane perforations during preoperative radiographic examination when maxillary molars require treatment. Even though the patient who experienced perforation during this study recovered without demonstrating symptoms of sinusitis, if a perforation is suspected preoperatively, treatment using the RP-14 system should be avoided. Regarding the development of stomatitis at the edge of the tongue, while it occurred close to the test tooth, it was not adjacent to the site that was directly treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis. Although the possibility of it being correlated to the treatment using the RP-14 system cannot be denied completely, the likelihood of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis treatment inducing stomatitis seems limited.</p><p id="Par16">In conclusion, the clinical efficacy and safety of non-surgical periodontal therapy with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis-based antimicrobial chemotherapy adjunctively performed with RD were demonstrated. Of the treatments tested, RD&#x02009;+&#x02009;H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis treatment achieved the shallowest periodontal pockets. Since shallow pockets facilitate maintenance of the periodontal condition after active treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, the effect of PPD reduction after RD&#x02009;+&#x02009;H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis treatment could be beneficial. However, as the follow-up period was only 12 weeks, a longer follow-up study should be conducted to verify the results obtained in this study. In addition, since approximately 40% of the test sites subjected to RD&#x02009;+&#x02009;H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis treatment exhibited inflammation (i.e., BoP positive sites), re-treatment and/or subsequent surgical treatment is still required for these cases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par17">This study was designed as a randomized controlled, single-blind, multi-centre (one university hospital and one private dental clinic) trial with a split-mouth design to compare the effects of non-surgical periodontal therapy with RD&#x02009;+&#x02009;H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis to those of RD&#x02009;+&#x02009;LDDS treatment (where RD was followed by antimicrobial treatment with LDDS) and RD alone.

Group 1 received ultrasonic RD using the device with a hollow-type, steel scaler tip and 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> instead of water coolant.
