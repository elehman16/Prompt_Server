RAL currently requires twice-daily administration and is not coformulated with NRTIs. EVG is available in 2 once-daily single-tablet coformulations, but it requires pharmacologic boosting by cobicistat, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, resulting in the potential for drug&#x02013;drug interactions with medications primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. RAL and EVG have overlapping resistance profiles. DTG is a once-daily unboosted INSTI with a higher barrier to resistance than RAL or EVG and is available as a single agent or coformulated with abacavir/lamivudine. Abacavir is associated with risk of hypersensitivity reaction, requires pretreatment HLA-B*5701 testing, and has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events in some epidemiologic studies.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> DTG can be administered once daily but requires twice-daily administration in the setting of previous INSTI failure with resistance and with some coadministered medications.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>Bictegravir (BIC, GS-9883) is a novel, potent, once-daily, unboosted INSTI with a high in vitro barrier to resistance and in vitro activity against most INSTI-resistant variants, including several variants that demonstrate reduced susceptibility to DTG.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies showed that BIC has a half-life of &#x0223c;18 hours, may be given without regard to food, is mainly cleared by metabolism with similar contributions of CYP3A4 and UGT1A1, and drug&#x02013;drug interactions are limited to potent dual inhibitors of CYP3A4/UGT1A1 (eg, atazanavir) and strong inducers of CYP3A4 (eg, rifampin).<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> We conducted a placebo-controlled study evaluating the short-term antiviral potency of BIC at doses ranging from 5 to 100 mg daily in HIV-infected adults.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>HIV-infected adults between the ages of 18 and 65 years of age were eligible for this study.

In the first part of the study, we randomized 10 participants 1:1 to cohort 1 (BIC 25 mg) or cohort 2 (BIC 100 mg). Within each cohort, participants were assigned in a 4:1 ratio to receive active BIC or matching placebo. After review of data from the first 2 cohorts, we randomized 10 additional participants 1:1 to cohort 3 (BIC 5 mg) or cohort 4 (BIC 50 mg). Within each cohort, participants were again assigned 4:1 to receive active BIC or placebo. All participants received BIC or placebo every 24 hours by mouth in the fasted state for 10 days and were followed for 7 days after the end of dosing. Study personnel observed all study drug dosing.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Antiviral Activity Assessments</title><p>We collected blood samples at screening, day 1 (baseline), and days 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, and 17 for plasma HIV-1 RNA quantification using the Roche TaqMan 2.0 assay, with a lower limit of detection of 20 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL (Roche Diagnostics, Branchburg, NJ). Whole blood was collected at screening and on days 1, 11, and 17 for genotypic and phenotypic analysis of HIV-1 integrase using the GeneSeqIN and PhenoSenseIN assays (Monogram Biosciences Inc., South San Francisco, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Safety and PK Assessments</title><p>Safety evaluations included recording of adverse events (AEs), concomitant medications, physical examinations, laboratory evaluations, and 12-lead electrocardiograms. We collected intensive PK plasma samples on days 1 and 10, predose PK samples on days 7, 8, and 9, and single-point PK plasma samples on days 14 and 17 after the last dose on day 10. We analyzed plasma samples using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography&#x02013;tandem mass spectrometry method to determine BIC concentrations at QPS laboratories (Newark, DE). Single-dose PK parameters included C<sub>max</sub>, T<sub>max</sub>, C<sub>last</sub>, T<sub>last</sub>, AUC<sub>0-24</sub>; multiple-dose PK parameters included C<sub>max</sub>, T<sub>max</sub>, C<sub>last</sub>, T<sub>last</sub>, area under the concentration versus time curve AUC<sub>0-last</sub>, AUC<sub>0-24</sub>, C<sub>tau</sub>, t<sub>1/2</sub>, AUC<sub>tau</sub>, Vz/F, CL<sub>ss</sub>/F, AR_AUC (AUC accumulation ratio on day 10), AR_C<sub>max</sub> (C<sub>max</sub> accumulation ratio on day 10). PK parameters were estimated based on the observed concentration&#x02013;time data by the noncompartmental PK approach using WinNonlin version 6.3 (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA).

Participants were grouped according to actual treatment received, with all who received placebo combined as one treatment group for analysis purposes. The per-protocol analysis set was defined as all participants who took at least 1 dose of study drug and who had baseline HIV-1 RNA &#x02265;1900 copies/mL, which allowed up to 2 log<sub>10</sub> decreases in HIV-1 RNA. We determined that a planned sample size of approximately 4 participants per group in each active BIC group and 3 in the placebo-to-match group could provide 86% power to detect a treatment difference of 0.95 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL of DAVG<sub>11</sub> in HIV-1 RNA between at least 1 of the BIC treatment groups and the placebo group. In this power analysis, we assumed that a common SD for DAVG<sub>11</sub> in HIV-1 RNA was 0.32 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL (data on file) and that a 2-sided <italic>t</italic> test would be conducted at an alpha level of 0.05. For subjects in the per-protocol analysis set, we calculated DAVG<sub>11</sub> using the trapezoidal rule and the area under the curve concept. We summarized the DAVG<sub>11</sub> for plasma HIV-1 RNA by treatment and compared each active BIC treatment group with placebo group using the <italic>t</italic> test based on an analysis of variance model. In addition, we conducted a pairwise comparison among all active BIC treatment groups.</p><p>The maximum reduction from baseline in plasma HIV-1 RNA (log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL) was calculated for the per-protocol analysis set using all available HIV-1 RNA data and was analyzed in the same fashion as for the primary efficacy endpoint. We fitted the viral decay slope using a log-linear regression model, where HIV-1 RNA collected at baseline (ie, the last available value before the first dose) and the last available on-treatment (ie, the last dose date +1) HIV-1 RNA value up to day 7 was used as the dependent variable. The collection days of these 2 HIV-1 RNA values was used as the independent variable. The viral decay slope was analyzed in the same fashion as for the primary efficacy endpoint. The percentage of participants ever achieving HIV-1 RNA &#x0003c;50 copies/mL after one dose of study drug and by the end of study was summarized by treatment group using the per-protocol analysis set. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).</p><p>We used descriptive statistics for the safety analysis set, which included all who received at least one dose of study drug. AEs were coded with the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (version 17.1).</p><p>For the PK analyses, we used descriptive statistics to summarize plasma concentrations and PK parameters. In addition, we calculated geometric mean (95% CI) and mean (SD) of select natural-log transformed PK parameters. Dose proportionality of PK parameters of BIC was assessed by comparing PK parameters of BIC across all dose levels for single-dose (day 1) and multiple-dose (day 10), separately. In addition, dose proportionality was evaluated based on the power model and the analysis of variance method. The time to achieve steady-state plasma concentration of BIC within each cohort was evaluated using Helmert transformation testing procedure of C<sub>trough</sub> on day 2, and days 7&#x02013;11.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Participants</title><p>We randomized 23 participants, of whom 3 were never treated.

Bictegravir was safe and well tolerated at all dose levels. BIC demonstrated rapid absorption in the dose range tested, and the steady-state plasma exposure was approximately dose-proportional up to a 100 mg dose in HIV-infected participants. The accumulation ratios were consistent with its terminal half-life, indicating time-independent pharmacokinetics, and its half-life is supportive of once-daily therapy without the need for a PK booster.
