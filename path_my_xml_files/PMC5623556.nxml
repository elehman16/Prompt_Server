Gaps exist in the implementation and uptake of evidence-based guidelines for managing COPD in primary care. We describe the methodology of a cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) evaluating the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of an interdisciplinary model of care aimed at reducing the burden of smoking and COPD in Australian primary care settings.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A cRCT is being undertaken to evaluate an interdisciplinary model of care (RADICALS &#x02014; Review of Airway Dysfunction and Interdisciplinary Community-based care of Adult Long-term Smokers). General practice clinics across Melbourne, Australia, are identified and randomised to the intervention group (RADICALS) or usual care. Patients who are current or ex-smokers, of at least 10 pack years, including those with an existing diagnosis of COPD, are being recruited to identify 280 participants with a spirometry-confirmed diagnosis of COPD. Handheld lung function devices are being used to facilitate case-finding. RADICALS includes individualised smoking cessation support, home-based pulmonary rehabilitation and home medicines review. Patients at control group sites receive usual care and Quitline referral, as appropriate. Follow-ups occur at 6 and 12&#x02009;months from baseline to assess changes in quality of life, abstinence rates, health resource utilisation, symptom severity and lung function. The primary outcome is change in St George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire score of patients with COPD at 6&#x02009;months from baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This project has been approved by the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee and La Trobe University Human Ethics Committee (CF14/1018 &#x02013; 2014000433). Results of the study will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and research conferences. If the intervention is successful, the RADICALS programme could potentially be integrated into general practices across Australia and sustained over time.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ACTRN12614001155684; Pre-results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>smoking</kwd><kwd>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</kwd><kwd>COPD</kwd><kwd>primary care</kwd><kwd>pulmonary rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>education</kwd><kwd>home medicines review</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008349</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Eastern Melbourne Primary Health Network</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006630</institution-id><institution>Lung Foundation Australia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A large implementation trial in primary care involving current smokers, ex-smokers and patients with an existing diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Cluster randomisation of general practices to minimise the risk of contamination, and blinded outcome assessment.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Open-labelled trial; participants and health professionals are not blinded, with a potential for Hawthorne effect.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#x000a0;(COPD) (COPD) is a major public health problem. Symptoms and complications of the condition can greatly affect patients&#x02019; ability to undertake daily activities, impair quality of life and result in extensive use of health services. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), COPD is the fourth leading cause of death and is projected to be the third leading cause of death by 2030 (potentially contributing to 8.6% of deaths worldwide).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In Australia, the overall prevalence of moderate to severe COPD in adults aged 40 years and over is 7.5% (95%&#x000a0;CI 5.7% to 9.4%).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> The prevalence increases to 29.2% (95%&#x000a0;CI 18.1% to 40.2%) among those aged 75 years and over.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In 2012, 4% of all deaths among Australians aged 55 years and over was attributed to COPD.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The rate of hospitalisation for COPD among those aged 55 and over was 1052 per 100&#x02009;000 population.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> It was estimated that the rate of COPD management in Australian general practices during 2013&#x02013;2014 was 1.0 (95%&#x000a0;CI 0.9 to 1.1) per 100 encounters, an increase from 0.8 (95%&#x000a0;CI 0.7 to 0.9) in 2004&#x02013;2005.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</p><p>The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) defines COPD as &#x02018;<italic>a common preventable and treatable disease, [which] is characterised by persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive and associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the airways and the lung to noxious particles or gases&#x02019;.</italic>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The greatest and most preventable risk factor for the development of COPD is tobacco smoking, with up to 50% smokers eventually developing clinically significant COPD.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</p><p>Numerous guidelines for the diagnosis, management and prevention of COPD have been published. The Lung Foundation Australia (LFA) and the Thoracic Society of Australia and&#x000a0;New Zealand have summarised current evidence and developed a set of guidelines for the optimal management of people with COPD, known as the COPD-X Plan.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The COPD-X guidelines recommend key components of COPD management, including lung function testing to confirm diagnosis, optimising both pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies including pulmonary rehabilitation, smoking cessation support, vaccinations, appropriate oxygen therapy, development of support networks and self-management plans, and appropriate management of exacerbations.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> More recently, a concise guide of the COPD-X Plan has been published and distributed for use in primary care.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
</p><p>Despite numerous guidelines for COPD management, studies conducted in other countries have revealed gaps in health practitioner knowledge of and adherence to these guidelines.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Audits of primary care professionals&#x02019; adherence to COPD guidelines in Australia and overseas have consistently shown deviations from optimal pharmacological treatment, lack of referrals to pulmonary rehabilitation and underutilisation of spirometry in COPD diagnosis.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;21</xref>
</p><p>Underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis of COPD in the Australian population are common.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 22&#x02013;24</xref> This may be due to the general underutilisation of spirometry in both hospital and primary care settings.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 24&#x02013;27</xref> It is estimated that at least 600&#x000a0;000 Australians have moderate to severe COPD of which they are unaware and therefore not receiving appropriate treatment.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 28 29</xref> There is a need for greater awareness of COPD among primary care health providers to promote earlier diagnosis and more timely initiation of appropriate treatments.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
</p><p>Optimal pharmacological treatment is important in controlling the symptoms of COPD and preventing exacerbations. Deviations from recommended pharmacological treatments have been identified, especially in relation to use of corticosteroids (inhaled and oral) and antibiotics.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 30</xref> In recent years, multiple new therapeutic agents for managing COPD have been introduced onto the Australian market. These agents include new long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta agonist (LABA) combinations and LAMA/LABA combinations. New inhaler devices have also been developed for the delivery of these novel agents, creating additional challenges for health professionals and patients alike.</p><p>Pulmonary rehabilitation is a key non-pharmacological component in the management of COPD. Improvements in the&#x000a0;quality of life of patients with COPD following pulmonary rehabilitation can be seen in the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire scores in areas of dyspnoea, fatigue, mastery and emotional function, along with an enhancement in patients&#x02019; sense of control over their condition.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Despite the compelling evidence of its benefits, access to pulmonary rehabilitation programmes remains limited in Australia. It is estimated that only 5%&#x02013;10% of patients with moderate to severe COPD use pulmonary rehabilitation services in Australia.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Similarly low rates of pulmonary rehabilitation uptake are reported across the developed world.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33 34</xref> A combination of programme-related factors and barriers at both the patient and referrer level contributes to low access rates. Poor knowledge of the benefits of pulmonary rehabilitation in the management of COPD, limited knowledge of the referral process,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32 35</xref> inconvenience of travel to hospital-based programmes, concerns from culturally and linguistically diverse patients, and the lack of perceived benefit of pulmonary rehabilitation have been reported to affect the uptake and completion of these programmes by eligible patients.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36&#x02013;38</xref>
</p><p>Interdisciplinary practice-based interventions have shown to lead to positive changes in healthcare, including improvements in patient care.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> An interdisciplinary approach could potentially benefit the management of patients with COPD. Many different healthcare professionals are involved in the crucial components of COPD management, including smoking cessation support, pharmacotherapy, self-management education and exercise training. Effects of an interdisciplinary approach on COPD patient outcomes have been analysed. Studies have demonstrated the potential benefits of an interdisciplinary approach on patient quality of life, symptom control, exercise tolerance and hospital episodes.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40 41</xref> Other studies have shown improvements in the&#x000a0;level of follow-up, self-reported daily activities, pulmonary rehabilitation attendance and disease knowledge among patients with COPD.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 42</xref>
</p><p>Primary care services in Australia are predominantly delivered by the nation&#x02019;s 22&#x02009;000 general practitioners&#x000a0;(GPs), nearly all of whom working in privately owned general practice settings. Primary healthcare providers also include nurses (general practice nurses, community nurses and nurse practitioners), allied health professionals, midwives, pharmacists, dentists and Aboriginal health workers. The primary healthcare services include health promotion, prevention and screening, early intervention, treatment and management.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Clinical care provided within general practice is predominantly reimbursed by fee-for-service payments (through the Australian Federal Government&#x02019;s Medical Benefits Scheme (MBS)), although GPs are also able to attract copayments for their services. The MBS in Australia allows GPs to claim for services surrounding chronic disease management. These include GP preparation of chronic disease management plans, plans for ongoing treatment by a multidisciplinary team (GP along with at least two other health professionals) and for pharmacist-conducted home medication review (HMR) services.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>
</p><p>Currently, delivery of pulmonary rehabilitation programmes and HMRs is on a GP referral basis. Remuneration is available to pharmacists for HMR services (home visit and generation of a report of findings and recommendations to the referring practitioner) through the MBS. However, there is no remuneration pathway for private physiotherapists providing pulmonary rehabilitation programmes in the community. A formal model of care bringing together services provided by various health professionals for the management of patients with COPD is lacking. An interdisciplinary model of care involving GPs and other practice staff, pharmacists and physiotherapists has not been evaluated in the Australian primary care setting.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>The primary aim of this study is to determine the efficacy, for patients with COPD, of an interdisciplinary model of care (RADICALS&#x000a0;&#x02014; Review of Airway Dysfunction and Interdisciplinary Community-based care of Adult Long-term Smokers) compared with usual care on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), measured at 6&#x02009;months using the St George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).</p><p>The secondary objectives are to determine the proportion of smokers with spirometry-confirmed COPD and evaluate the efficacy of RADICALS&#x000a0;compared with usual care on smoking abstinence, nicotine dependence, lung function, symptom severity, health resource utilisation (unplanned GP&#x000a0;visits, hospitalisations and emergency department presentations), anxiety and depression scores, and medication adherence at 6 and 12 months. If the interdisciplinary model is shown to be effective, an economic evaluation will be conducted to compare the costs and benefits of the model with usual care.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>This is a cluster&#x000a0;randomised controlled trial in primary care clinics across Melbourne, Australia. Eligible primary care clinics that consent are randomised to either intervention (interdisciplinary care group=ICG) or control (usual care group=UCG). Participants are recruited from each clinic and receive the intervention or usual care depending on the allocation of the clinic. Each participant is screened for eligibility at baseline and completes follow-up interviews at 6 and 12 months from baseline.

Cluster randomisation of clinics minimises the risk of contamination across intervention and control groups when participants from the same clinic are managed by the same GPs and/or clinic staff. However, observed outcomes among participants sampled within the same clinic may still be more similar than outcomes observed in participants sampled from different clinics. The sample size has been increased depending on the size of clinics randomised and the degree of similarity of outcomes among members of the same clinic, measured in terms of the intracluster or intraclass correlation coefficient.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>

Effective interventions are required for case-finding and diagnosis of COPD, maintaining and improving HRQoL, promoting self-management and improving participation in exercise programmes. Studies involving multidisciplinary, integrated care models have signposted various issues that should be addressed in future studies for better COPD management. These include better patient involvement, more individualised and intensive smoking cessation interventions, new ways of delivering pulmonary rehabilitation, and prompt intervention following COPD diagnosis.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 40 42</xref> The RADICALS model of care aims to address these aspects. The model emphasises an interdisciplinary approach to COPD management by providing patient-centred care through collaborative working relationships between GPs, nursing staff, other practice staff, pharmacists, physiotherapists and respiratory physicians/scientists. Individualised smoking cessation support, HMRs, home-based pulmonary rehabilitation and interdisciplinary care are the key components of RADICALS.</p><p>HMRs can identify existing medication-related problems and make recommendations regarding COPD and smoking cessation therapy. Medication reviews have the potential to improve adherence to evidence-based pharmacological treatments for COPD. A home-based pulmonary rehabilitation programme is known to be as effective as centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> Home-based pulmonary rehabilitation may overcome some of the barriers associated with centre-based rehabilitation, such as inconvenience of travel and long waiting periods.</p><p>The proposed RADICALS model has the potential to reduce the burden and morbidity associated with smoking and COPD, and improve HRQoL for affected patients. If the intervention is successful, the RADICALS&#x000a0;programme could potentially be integrated into general practices across Australia and sustained over time. Resources and services already exist in the Australian community that would aid its implementation. It should be noted that&#x000a0;the HMR service and the home-based pulmonary rehabilitation programme offered as part of RADICALS are funded solely through the trial, and not through the MBS. Outcomes of this study may inform integration of this service model into primary care, including service payments through the MBS. Our case-finding methods are informed by a previous COPD case-finding study conducted in Australian primary care,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> and the LFA&#x000a0;recommendations for case-finding based on FEV<sub>1</sub>/FEV<sub>6</sub> readings,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> potentially adding to the evidence&#x000a0;base in this area.</p><p>Our study is a large implementation trial in primary care involving current smokers, ex-smokers and patients with an existing diagnosis of COPD. Some strengths include the cluster randomisation of general practices, which minimises the risk of contamination, and outcome assessment by staff blinded to treatment allocation. Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding of participants and health professionals is not possible, introducing the potential for Hawthorne effect. The RADICALS intervention is primarily designed for Australian primary care based on the COPD-X guidelines, which do not use the GOLD ABCD grading system for symptoms, potentially limiting extrapolation of our findings to studies using the ABCD grading. Nevertheless, we use the mMRC Dyspnoea Scale and the CAT for symptom assessment in participants, allowing us to carry out subgroup analyses, if required.
