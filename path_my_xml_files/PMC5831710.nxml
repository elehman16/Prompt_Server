Tranexamic acid (TA), an antifibrinolytic drug, reduces bleeding and transfusion need in major surgery and trauma. In ongoing PPH following vaginal delivery, a high dose of TA decreases PPH volume and duration, as well as maternal morbidity, while early fibrinolysis is inhibited. In a large international trial, a TA single dose reduced mortality due to bleeding but not the hysterectomy rate. TA therapeutic dosages vary from 2.5 to 100&#x000a0;mg/kg and seizures, visual disturbances and nausea are observed with the highest dosages. TA efficiency and optimal dosage in haemorrhagic caesarean section (CS) has not been yet determined. We hypothesise large variations in fibrinolytic activity during haemorrhagic caesarean section needing targeted TA doses for clinical and biological efficacy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par3">The current study proposal is a blinded, randomised controlled trial with the primary objective of determining superiority of either 1&#x000a0;g of TXA or 0.5&#x000a0;g of TXA, in comparison to placebo, in terms of 30% blood-loss reduction at 6&#x000a0;h after non-emergency haemorrhagic caesarean delivery (active PPH&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;800&#x000a0;mL) and to correlate this clinical effect in a pharmacokinetics model with fibrinolysis inhibition measured by an innovative direct plasmin measurement regarding plasmatic TA concentration.</p><p id="Par4">A sample size of 342 subjects (114 per group) was calculated, based on the expected difference of 30% reduction of blood loss between the placebo group and the low-dose group, out of which 144 patients will be included blindly in the pharmaco-biological substudy.

PPH mostly occurs during caesarean section (CS) due to atony and abnormal placental insertion. Haemorrhagic CS represents more than half of severe PPH. PPH-induced coagulopathy can be potentially major and contributes to the severity of PPH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Coagulopathy has been observed as a major component of maternal morbidity after vaginal delivery due to uterine atony [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], but also in patients experiencing intensive care admission after massive PPH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Early hyper-fibrinolysis can be observed at the onset of PPH and becomes maximal 2&#x000a0;h after the beginning of bleeding when no prohaemostatic treatment has been given [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Fibrinogen decrease is a central component of PPH-induced coagulopathy concomitant to D-dimer increase and factor II decrease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].

A high dose of 4&#x000a0;g was administered, followed by a continuous infusion of 1&#x000a0;g/h. The EXADELI trial demonstrated a mild, but significant, reduction of the bleeding volume (173&#x000a0;mL vs 221&#x000a0;mL in the control group) and a significant reduction of the delay for PPH cessation measured as a blood flow of less than 50&#x000a0;mL per 10&#x000a0;min (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Although limited, the bleeding volume reduction was associated with a reduction of the percentage of patients developing severe morbidity, such as anaemia or haemorrhagic shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Mild side effects were observed, including nausea and visual disturbances, but no acute kidney injury nor seizure or thromboembolism were observed. Renal function was similar or even better in the TA group. Deep vein thrombosis complicated catheter insertion in two patients in the control group and three in the TA group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The major point of the EXADELI trial was the strict measurement of PPH bleeding on special graduated bags and the strict respect to the French timed PPH management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Concomitant administration of prohaemostatic treatments was avoided, except for untraceable PPH, enabling the observation of the natural course of PPH-induced coagulopathy. TA clinical efficiency to reduce bleeding in the haemorrhagic caesarean context has not been previously published. In the only (unpublished) Tunisian randomised, placebo-controlled trial in haemorrhagic CS, TA administration induced a reduction of blood loss and transfusion need (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03). Because the absence of academic literature on CS and the low level of evidence after vaginal delivery, current 2014 French guidelines for PPH management restricted the use of TA to late administration in massive haemorrhage: &#x02018;Tranexamic acid may be of interest in PPH treatment, even if its clinical interest has not been demonstrated in an obstetrics setting. Every clinician is free to use TA. If used, the expert group suggests the administration of a 1-g dose only if PPH resists prostaglandins&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The WOMAN trial aimed to assess the impact of the early administration of TA on death and hysterectomy in women experiencing PPH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Between 2010 and 2016, 20,060 women with a clinical diagnosis of PPH in 21 low- and middle-income countries were included in this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to intravenously receive either 1&#x000a0;g TA (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10,051) or placebo (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10,009) in addition to standard care. The WOMAN trial found that TA decreased death due to bleeding (155 (1.5%) vs 191 (1.9%), RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.65&#x02013;1.00; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.045), especially in women given treatment within 3&#x000a0;h of giving birth (89 (1.2%) vs 127 (1.7%), RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.52&#x02013;0.91; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.008). Laparotomy for bleeding was also reduced (82 (0.8%) vs 127 (1.3%), RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.49&#x02013;0.85; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002) after CS and vaginal delivery. The original composite primary endpoint was not reduced (534 (5.3%) vs 546 (5.5%), RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.87&#x02013;1.09; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.65). Adverse events were not increased in the TA group vs placebo: thromboembolic events (30 (0.3%) vs 34 (0.3%)), seizures (33 (0.3%) vs 43 (0.4%)), and renal failure (129 (1.3%) vs 120 (1.2%)). One could suggest that the TA benefit on mortality may be higher in women with severe PPH, then aim to reserve TA for the more severe situations. However, the data showed that the delayed administration of TA was associated with potential harm. Thus TA, if used, should be given early and empirically as soon as a PPH is diagnosed, and before severe haemorrhage. As the study was based on robust clinical endpoints, neither blood loss estimation nor haemoglobin drop were available. There was no subgroup analysis of TA efficacy according to the volume of bleeding. Laboratory results were not included in the primary analysis but were assessed in a few centres as a part of a secondary analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The biological effect of the high TA dose administered in the EXADELI trial was observed and compared to a non-treated haemorrhagic group and a non-haemorrhagic postpartum group. Significant excessive fibrinolysis was noted in the untreated haemorrhagic group vs the non-haemorrhagic group at PPH onset. This excessive fibrinolysis was inhibited in the TA-treated group 30&#x000a0;min and 2&#x000a0;h after TA administration, as demonstrated by the inhibition of the D-dimers and PAP increases (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Reduction of postpartum haemorrhage duration in the high-dose-tranexamic-acid-treated group vs the untreated control group</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2420_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig><fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Inhibition of the natural hyperfibrinolysis by a high dose of tranexamic acid administered at the early stage of postpartum haemorrhage. &#x02020;&#x02020;<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05.

In major cardiac surgery, the 4-g dose followed by a continuous infusion of 1&#x000a0;g/h is the known efficient therapeutic dosage. However, in trauma, as in major surgery, fibrinolysis is an expected part of coagulopathy. In PPH associated with CS, although fibrinolysis appears early and is constant, its intensity is variable and most of the PPH stops after the first step of management. We hypothesis that a 0.5-g dose is sufficient to inhibit the most common fibrinolytic activity in haemorrhagic CS, while some of the CS-associated fibrinolysis is so intense that neither 0.5&#x000a0;g nor 1&#x000a0;g will be enough the inhibit the coagulopathic process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>The choice of the different dose regimens relevant for study in the haemorrhagic caesarean section context</title><p id="Par27">The higher dose of 4&#x000a0;g and continuous infusion was not selected because of the minor side effects observed in the EXADELI trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

The dose of 1&#x000a0;g or 10&#x000a0;mg/kg is commonly used prophylactically before CS, but has not yet been tested as a treatment in an actively bleeding haemorrhagic CS. Because of the lack of data on lower doses and TA pharmacokinetics, a low 0.5-g dose should also be tested.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study aim and originality</title><p id="Par28">The aim of the study is to determine, out of two doses (a standard and a low dose) compared to placebo, the optimal and minimal dose of an intravenously administered single bolus of TA to reduce blood loss when administered during haemorrhagic CS.</p><p id="Par29">The originality of the trial can be described as follows: no previous study has been published evaluating the clinical impact of TA on blood loss and transfusion need reduction during haemorrhagic CS. The determination of the optimal dose to obtain this clinical impact is of interest for clinicians in the current obstetric practice. TA concentration and innovative direct plasmin peak assessment by a simultaneous generation thrombin plasmin assay (SGTPA) are expected to provide scientific and objective data to determine the optimal dose. The dose-ranging study with a low dose is expected to describe the minimal dose able to inhibit fibrinolysis and to contribute to bleeding reduction while minimising side effects. The first pharmaco-biological observational results allows the choice of this dose ranging. No previous study has tested the low dose in the obstetric literature in either trauma-induced massive haemorrhage or major surgery.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Experimental plan</title><p id="Par30">The TRACES study is a multicentre, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled therapeutic and pharmaco-biological dose-ranging study to evaluate the clinical efficiency of TA on blood-loss reduction in patients experiencing PPH during elective or non-emergency CS (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Study design</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2420_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Expert authorities and ethics committee approval</title><p id="Par31">The TRACES trial obtained approval from the competent national authorities (ANSM 201500249926) and the Ethics Committee (CPP 15/50 020216) before beginning the study, in accordance with article L1121-4 of the Public Healthcare Code.

Plans are written in advance for investigators and sponsor to communicate trial results to participants, healthcare professionals, the public, and other relevant groups (e.g. via publication, reporting in results databases, or other data-sharing arrangements).</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par85">TRACES inclusions have already begun. In the first opened centre (promoter centre), 64 patients have been included (57 haemorrhagic and seven non-haemorrhagic). The four other centres are opened and included 13 patients.
