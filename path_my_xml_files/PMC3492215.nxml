In acute exacerbations of asthma, corticosteroids reduce relapses, subsequent hospital admission and the need for &#x000df;<sub>2</sub>-agonist therapy. Prednisolone is relatively short-acting with a half-life of 12 to 36&#x02009;hours, thereby requiring daily dosing. Prolonged treatment course, vomiting and a bitter taste may reduce patient compliance with prednisolone. Dexamethasone is a long-acting corticosteroid with a half-life of 36 to 72&#x02009;hours. It is used frequently in children with croup and bacterial meningitis, and is well absorbed orally. The purpose of this trial is to examine whether a single dose of oral dexamethasone (0.3&#x02009;mg/kg) is clinically non-inferior to prednisolone (1&#x02009;mg/kg/day for three days) in the treatment of exacerbations of asthma in children who attend the Emergency Department.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a randomized, non-inferiority, open-label clinical trial. After informed consent with or without assent, patients will be randomized to either oral dexamethasone 0.3&#x02009;mg/kg stat or prednisolone 1&#x02009;mg/kg/day for three days. The primary outcome measure is the comparison between the Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM) across both groups on Day 4. The PRAM score, a validated, responsive and reliable tool to determine asthma severity in children aged 2 to 16&#x02009;years, will be performed by a clinician blinded to treatment allocation. Secondary outcomes include relapse, hospital admission and requirement for further steroid therapy. Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat and a per protocol basis. With a sample size of 232 subjects (105 in each group with an estimated 10% loss to follow-up), we will be able to reject the null hypothesis - that the population means of the experimental and control groups are equal with a probability (power) of 0.9. The Type I error probability associated with this test (of the null hypothesis) is 0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This clinical trial may provide evidence that a shorter steroid course using dexamethasone can be used in the treatment of acute pediatric asthma, thus eliminating the issue of compliance to treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Registration</title><p>ISRCTN26944158 and EudraCT Number 2010-022001-18</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Asthma</kwd><kwd>Pediatric</kwd><kwd>Corticosteroid</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Emergency department</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Asthma is a major cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality. In acute exacerbations of asthma, corticosteroids reduce relapses, subsequent hospital admission and the need for &#x000df;<sub>2</sub>-agonist therapy
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The earlier corticosteroids are administered in an acute episode, the better the clinical outcome
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The British Thoracic Society (BTS) Guidelines on the Management of Asthma (May 2008, revised January 2012) recommend commencing oral prednisolone early for children presenting with exacerbations of asthma and if discharged, continuing treatment for up to three days
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Prednisolone is relatively short acting with a half-life of 12 to 36&#x02009;hours, thereby requiring daily dosing
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Outpatient steroid therapy is effective once compliance is assured. However, many factors impact on patient compliance with medication. One study found that at least 7% of children seen in a pediatric emergency department (ED) never have their prescriptions filled
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In another study, caregivers of pediatric asthma patients reported adherence to the prescribed length of oral corticosteroid therapy only 64% of the time
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Prolonged treatment course, vomiting and a bitter taste may reduce patient compliance with prednisolone
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. If effective, a single dose of corticosteroid would remove the problem of poor compliance and, therefore, reduce morbidity and the risk of relapse.</p><p>Dexamethasone is a long-acting glucocorticoid with a half-life of 36 to 72&#x02009;hours
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It has been used safely in children with croup and bacterial meningitis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], but is not specifically mentioned in the BTS Guidelines
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. It is well absorbed both orally and parenterally
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In a comparative study with a two-day course of hydrocortisone, a single dose of 0.6&#x02009;mg/kg dexamethasone resulted in a shorter length of hospital stay in children with exacerbations of asthma
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Dexamethasone has also been shown to be significantly more palatable than prednisolone to children presenting to the ED with exacerbations of asthma
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Whereas intramuscular (IM) dexamethasone is invasive but ensures compliance, a single dose of oral dexamethasone would negate the need for an injection and retain the advantage of ensuring compliance.</p><p>Seven randomized controlled trials comparing dexamethasone with prednisolone in the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations in children have been published
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. All of the studies were carried out in the USA, where both the dosing and duration of treatment varies from what is the usual practice in Ireland, the UK and Australasia
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The first of these studies compared nebulized dexamethasone with oral prednisolone
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Even though no difference was found between the study groups, it is accepted standard practice to give systemic corticosteroids in this clinical setting. Of the other six studies, three compared IM dexamethasone with oral prednisolone
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Again, while the studies found no demonstrable difference between study arms, the utility of an IM injection in a pediatric population with this condition is questionable.</p><p>Three studies comparing oral dexamethasone with prednisolone have been published
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Qureshi <italic>et al.</italic> compared ED treatment with an initial dose of oral prednisolone 2&#x02009;mg/kg (max. 60&#x02009;mg) followed by 1&#x02009;mg/kg daily for four days with oral dexamethasone 0.6&#x02009;mg/kg (max. 16&#x02009;mg) daily for two days
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Altamimi <italic>et al.</italic> compared ED treatment with an initial dose of oral prednisolone 1&#x02009;mg/kg (max. 30&#x02009;mg) followed by 1&#x02009;mg/kg twice daily for five days with a single dose of oral dexamethasone 0.6&#x02009;mg/kg (max. 18&#x02009;mg)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Greenberg <italic>et al.</italic> compared ED treatment with a single dose of prednisolone 2&#x02009;mg/kg (max. 80&#x02009;mg) followed by 1&#x02009;mg/kg (max. 30&#x02009;mg) twice daily for five days with a single dose of 0.6&#x02009;mg/kg oral dexamethasone (max. 16&#x02009;mg) followed by one dose of 0.6&#x02009;mg/kg oral dexamethasone to take the next day and placebo to take twice daily to complete a five-day course
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Each of these seven studies outlined found dexamethasone and prednisolone equally effective in treating acute exacerbations of asthma
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, there are limitations to each of the trials in terms of study design, sample size and dosing regime, while the age of patients enrolled varied among studies. Asthma is not usually diagnosed before the age of two years because of the prevalence of bronchiolitis in this age group. Ideally all trials included would have studied a homogeneous age group, and included patients up to the age of 16&#x02009;years. All but one of these studies used a five-day course of prednisolone, whereas the BTS Guidelines recommend a three-day course
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Also Chang <italic>et al.</italic> found no difference between a three- and five-day course of prednisolone in children with acute exacerbations of asthma who are not hospitalized
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In addition, the lack of a consistent and reliable outcome measure in all of the studies makes the results difficult to interpret. A summary table of these studies can be found in Table

Training sessions on the PRAM score have also taken place, and this score has been used in the assessment of all asthma exacerbations (over the age of 2) presenting to the ED from April 2011 onwards.</p><p>Eligible participants will be identified at triage or during clinical consultation by the ED clinician. They and their parents/guardians will be provided with written and verbal information about the study. All patients in the study will be recruited by a member of the research team or an ED clinician.</p><p>After eligibility for inclusion in the study is confirmed, the research trial and procedures involved will also be explained to the patient in age-appropriate language. In all cases, where appropriate, informed assent will be obtained from the patient. This may not be possible in younger patients and in patients who are too unwell (for example, short of breath) to actively participate in the consent process. If the patient recovers sufficiently, we will go through the assent process with them at a later stage. In all cases without exception, informed consent will be obtained from the parent/legal guardian. If a patient refuses assent they will not be included in the study, even if a parent/legal guardian gives consent.</p><p>The informed consent process will be documented in the medical notes (including the date/time of consent and the provision of information to the patient/parent(s)/guardian). Once the patient is consented, randomization will occur.</p><p>The patient will be randomized by the recruiting clinician to receive either a stat dose of oral dexamethasone 0.3&#x02009;mg/kg (max. dose 12&#x02009;mg) in the ED, <italic>or</italic> prednisolone 1&#x02009;mg/kg/day (max. dose 40&#x02009;mg) for three days. The clinician will pick the next available card from a pre-randomized pack of study cards contained in a locked storage cupboard in the ED. This card will contain the study number (that is, Subject ID) of that particular patient and will state to which treatment arm they are assigned (&#x0201c;DEXAMETHASONE&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;PREDNISOLONE&#x0201d;). Subject IDs will be allocated on a consecutive basis of recruitment to the study. The patient&#x02019;s weight will be checked (all patients presenting to OLCHC ED are routinely weighed after arrival unless in extremis) and the appropriate dose of study medication will then be read from the Dosing Schedule (see Table
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). The next pack of study medication with that dose will be taken. The first dose will be given in the ED by the member of the recruiting clinician. If the patient is assigned to the dexamethasone group, then this is the only dose that will be given. If the patient is assigned to the prednisolone group, the second and third doses (each dose in original foil blistered strip contained in separate labeled clear plastic zip-lock bags as described) will be given to the patient and their parent/guardian prior to discharge.</p><p>If the patient vomits the medication dose given in ED within 30&#x02009;minutes of administration, a second dose will be supplied. If the patient vomits again within 30&#x02009;minutes of the second dose, then no further dose will be given but the patient will remain in the study and be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis.</p><p>Subjects and parents/legal guardians will be trained on the correct administration of prednisolone on Days 2 and 3. This training will be documented in the subject&#x02019;s medical notes. Patients will be requested to bring the study packs with them for the Day 4 assessment.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Patient randomization</title><p>The randomization process has been designed by CSTAR (Health Research Board Centre for Support and Training in Analysis and Research). Randomization will occur in blocks of 12 subjects. An equal number of subjects will be randomized to each treatment group for every 12 subjects enrolled.</p><p>The clinician will pick the next available envelope from a pre-randomized pack of study envelopes contained in a locked storage cupboard in the ED.

It is assumed that the distribution of PRAM scores will take an approximate normal distribution. A change in PRAM score from 6.57&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.5 (mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;standard deviation) at triage to 2.93&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.23 at discharge from ED was the basis of the validation study on PRAM (personal communication from Francine Ducharme)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The sample size calculation below compares dexamethasone and prednisolone at Day 4. It assumes that dexamethasone is not inferior to prednisolone if the average PRAM score for dexamethasone at Day 4 is not more than one point higher than the prednisolone average PRAM score. On this basis, with a sample size of 232 subjects (105 in each group with a 10% loss to follow-up) we will be able to reject the null hypothesis - that the population means of the experimental and control groups are equal with a probability (power) of 0.9. The Type I error probability associated with this test (of the null hypothesis) is 0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat and a per protocol basis.

Significance will be set at the 5% level. No interim evaluation of the data is planned.</p></sec><sec><title>Bias and confounding variables</title><p>In terms of selection bias, we feel that this study targets a representative patient population to whom this research ultimately may be clinically applicable. Every effort will be made to ensure that recruitment of participants occurs over all 24-hour periods and at weekends by having patients recruited by the ED physician treating the patient.</p><p>We anticipate that the randomized controlled design of this study will minimize the effect of confounding variables on our analysis. However, all potential confounders (that is, age, asthma severity, concomitant medications) will be measured during data collection and they will be adjusted for during the analysis should there be any imbalance. Also, every effort will be made to ensure that the physician who is assessing the primary outcome is blinded to the treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety reporting</title><p>All adverse events (AEs) that occur during the study period observed by one of the clinical staff, or reported by the patient or parent/guardian spontaneously, or in response to a direct question, will be noted on the appropriate form.

The research team will ensure that follow-up information and a detailed written report are provided when available.</p></sec><sec><title>Suspected unexpected serious adverse drug reaction (SUSAR)</title><p>Each SUSAR will also require expedited reporting to the Sponsor. This will occur as soon as possible, but no later than 24&#x02009;hours after a member of the research team has first knowledge of the minimum criteria for expedited reporting. In each case, relevant follow-up information should be sought and a detailed, written report completed as soon as possible. It is the Sponsor&#x02019;s responsibility to ensure that all relevant and available information is forwarded to the Competent Authority (Irish Medicines Board) and the appropriate health ethics committee (HREC, OLCHC). For fatal or life-threatening events this will be done as soon as possible and not later than seven days after the Sponsor becomes aware of the event. Additional relevant information will be sent within eight days of the first report. This will be sent no later than an additional 15 calendar days.
