Several techniques have been developed to obtain these results with variable outcomes. The aim of this study was to compare and evaluate the effectiveness of acellular dermal matrix allograft (ADMA) and subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) in combination with coronally positioned flap in the treatment of multiple gingival recessions in aesthetic areas.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Total 10 patients were selected for this study, aged between 18 to 40 years and were randomly assigned to one of the groups ADMA and SCTG. The clinical parameters including probing pocket depth, clinical attachment level, gingival recession, width of keratinized tissue were recorded at baseline and at 6 months after surgery and data was statistically analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>No significant differences in gingival recession reduction were noted between ADMA and gold - standard SCTG. Within limits of this clinical study, the use of ADMA may represent an acceptable alternative to the SCTG for treating gingival recession. The use of ADMA eliminates the need for the palatal donor site thus represents a less invasive surgery for treating multiple gingival recessions.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results suggest that ADMA may be a useful substitute instead of subepithelial connective tissue graft for root coverage.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Acellular dermal matrix allograft</kwd><kwd>gingival recession</kwd><kwd>subepithelial connective tissue graft</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Recession of gingival margin remains a highly prevalent problem for its impact on esthetics[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] and dentine hypersensitivity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] The patients today are increasingly conscious of personal appearance and much attention has been focused on denuded roots that are exposed during smiling and are unaesthetic.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] The main indications for root coverage procedures are aesthetic and/or cosmetic demands,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] followed by the management of root hypersensitivity,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] or whenever it hampers proper plaque removal.</p><p>Obtaining predictable root coverage has been an important part of periodontal therapy. Over the years, several surgical techniques have been described to address the isolated gingival recession, showing a high predictability in terms of root coverage.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] When multiple gingival recessions involving adjacent teeth are present, an approach to address all recession defects at one single surgical time is the first choice. The coronally positioned flap is one of the most effective techniques for the treatment of Miller class I and II gingival recession.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>Apart from excellent esthetic results, it is technically simple to perform but the root coverage obtained by this procedure is associated with thin marginal soft tissue recession, at treated sites and thus questions the long-term predictability of coronally positioned flap (CPF) in the treatment of multiple gingival recessions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>Langer and Langer[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] introduced subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) in treating gingival recession, in which connective tissue graft combined with an overlying pedicle graft was used. The SCTG covered by a CPF is a frequently used procedure due to its high predictability.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] However, this procedure requires a second surgical site that may cause certain degree of discomfort and increase the risk of post operative complications such as pain and hemorrhage. Therefore, the root coverage technique that allows treatment of multiple sites with minimum post-operative morbidity is desirable. In an effort to avoid second surgical site for harvesting the connective tissue graft from the palate, to reduce potential morbidity, and to treat wider array of defects, different biomaterials such as GTR, Emdogain, and acellular dermal matrix allograft (ADMA) with CPF have been tried.</p><p>Recently, the use of an ADMA has become an increasingly popular technique, as a substitute for SCTG in treating marginal tissue recession.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] <italic>In vitro</italic> as well as clinical studies suggested that ADMA is an acellular, non-immunogenic scaffold that heals by repopulation and revascularization, rather than through a granulation process maturing to scar.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] The use of an ADMA has been reported to have a favorable clinical outcome in root coverage procedures with a range of mean root coverage from 86% to 99%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of ADMA and SCTG in combination with CPF in the treatment of multiple gingival recessions in aesthetic areas with the following objectives:</p><p>

Horizontal incisions were made at right angles to the adjacent interdental papillae, at the level of the cementoenamel junction without interfering with the gingival margin of the neighboring teeth. Two oblique vertical incisions were extended beyond the mucogingival junction and a trapezoidal mucoperiosteal flap was raised up to the mucogingival junction. After this point, a split thickness flap was extended apically, releasing the tension and favoring the coronal positioning of the flap. The epithelium on the adjacent papillae was de-epithelialzed. The root surface was instrumented with curettes and washed with saline solution. The root surfaces were not subjected to any chemical conditioning.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Harvesting of SCTG</title><p>A surgical template i.e., sterile tin foil was utilized to obtain the approximate dimensions and shape of the graft. The length of the surgical template was determined by the combined width of the teeth to be covered. Then the surgical template was placed on the palate where it was outlined by a shallow incision. A horizontal incision is made approximately 3 to 4 mm from the gingival margins of the maxillary teeth to the desired width. Vertical incisions were made on either side of the horizontal incision which will further facilitate the removal of the connective tissue graft and aid in wound closure. Primary flap was reflected to expose the underline connective tissue. The graft was excised and trimmed as necessary. The primary flap at the donor site was then placed back to its original position and sutured with 5-0 resorbable sutures<sup>&#x02020;</sup>.

The basement side was placed adjacent to bone and tooth and connective tissue side was placed facing the flap. The coronal-lateral border of ADMA was sutured to lingual gingival tissue with 5-0 resorbable sutures.

During this period, the plaque control was achieved with a 0.12% Chlorhexidine gluconate<sup>&#x02020;&#x02020;</sup> solution rinse twice daily. After 14 days, the periodontal dressing and sutures were removed. All the patients were examined weekly for first month and once a month for next 3 months for supragingival scaling and oral hygiene instructions until the end of the study.

Comparisons between treatment groups at baseline and 6 months were accomplished with student's unpaired t-test. Comparisons of the PI and PBI at baseline, 3 months and 6 months were made by students paired t-test.

There was no sign of allergy, infection or any other complication in any patient after the use of ADMA graft, which indicates that the product ADMA was well tolerated.</p><p>The clinical outcomes of various forms of surgical interventions are influenced by general level of oral hygiene. In this case series, both mean plaque index (PI) and papillary bleeding index (PBI) were significantly reduced at 6 months as compared to baseline. The results presented here indicate that treatment modalities, SCTG, and ADMA group showed good improvement in the studied clinical parameters with respect to baseline and at 6 months [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Successful root coverage was found in both the treated groups with mean percent root coverage in the SCTG group being 97% and in the ADMA group was 94% [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. These findings are in agreement with previously reported studies. Hirsch <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] observed 99% root coverage for SCTG group and 95% for ADMA group. Rahmani <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] also observed mean root coverage of 70% for SCTG and 70% for the ADMA group.</p><p>In the present study, the mean gain in clinical attachment level in both the groups was 2.7 mm. The type of healing obtained between the ADMA and previously denuded root surface can only be speculated on, since no histological evaluations were available. Based on the reports of ADMA, matrix would revascularize via preserved vascular channel and that it would integrate into the host tissue.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] At the same time, ADMA may also act as a barrier equivalent to selective cell repopulation membrane, thus encouraging periodontal-guided tissue regeneration. The observed clinical changes probably represent a combination of new connective tissue attachment in the apical half of the defect and the presence of long junctional epithelial attachment in the coronal half.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] In the case of connective tissue graft, based on histological evidence, healing has been shown to be mediated through a long junctional epithelium along the major portion of the root with an extremely limited area of new attachment and bone formation at the base of the recessions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] Although a new connective tissue attachment mostly fails to form in the entire depth of the defect in previous histological studies on ADMA and SCTG, the treatment procedures used in the present case series did not result in formation of a deep periodontal pocket.</p><p>In the present study, we observed an increase in the width of keratinized gingiva in both the groups. The mean increase in the width of keratinized gingiva in the SCTG group was 1.2 mm and 1 mm in the ADMA group. Similar observations have been made by Hirsch <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] and Haim <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] in a clinical trial comparing SCTG and ADMA with a coronally positioned flap. In a comparative study on the effectiveness of ADMA to increase width of attached gingiva, Wei <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] reported that ADMA produced a lesser extent of attached gingiva in comparison to SCTG. They believed that the difference could be attributed due to considerable shrinkage of ADMA during the healing phase.</p><p>Our study presented two-main limitations: one was the 6 month short-term evaluation (since creeping attachment occurs highest during 9-12 months, which may further improve the root coverage[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>]) and the second was the lack of histological evaluation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The root coverage obtained by both procedures although satisfactory, clinical relevance in terms of patient's satisfaction was especially with the use of ADMA as most of the patients were treated with aesthetic request. One of the advantage of ADMA is that the need for palatal donor material is eliminated, which reduces post-operative morbidity. In addition, it provides an unlimited supply of graft material thus permitting multiple site root coverage that can be extended for a sextant, quadrant, or even a full mouth arch at one time.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><label>*</label><p>WI C.
