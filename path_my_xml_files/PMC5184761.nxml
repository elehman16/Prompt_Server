Patient on anticoagulantion therapy, with coagulopathy, local or intra-abdominal infection, sepsis and huge ascites, patients with bowel obstruction, with physical opioid dependence and drug seeking behavior, and patient not willing to participate in the study were excluded from the study. An informed consent was taken from all the patients. The CPB was performed in patient and subjective evaluation of degree of pain relief was done.

We are targeting a mean difference in visual analog scale (VAS) score to the tune of 2 with a pooled variability of 1 to be detrimental in the selection of the regimen.

Patients were kept nil orally as per American Society of Anesthesiologists preoperatively fasting guidelines. An IV access was obtained by 18 gauge intravenous (IV) cannula and sensitivity to lignocaine were done, using 0.1 ml intradermal injection. After that IV ondansetron (0.1 mg/kg), IV midazolam (0.02 mg/kg), and IV ceftriaxone antibiotic (25&#x02013;50 mg/kg) was given 30 min before performing procedure. After shifting the patient to operation theater, the patient was preloaded with intravenous fluid (Ringer's lactate) 10 ml/kg body weight prior to the procedure. Meanwhile, monitors such as pulseoximeter, noninvasive blood pressure (BP), and electrocardiogram were attached. Baseline HR, BP, and SPO<sub>2</sub> were recorded. C- arm guided transdiscal technique was chosen to block the celiac plexus. The insertion site was the lateral margin of the superior articular process of T12 and it was marked 5 cm from the midline line. The skin and subcutaneous tissues were anesthetized using local anesthetic 2% lidocaine preservative free. The 15 cm long 25 gauge spinal needle was inserted on the left side through a skin wheal. After feeling of contact of the disc, the fluoroscope was rotated to a lateral position. The needle was inserted through the disc while checking the tip position with AP and lateral fluoroscopic images. After penetrating the disc, frequent fluoroscopic images for both AP and lateral views were used to guide the needle when advancing it in the correct plane. While advancing the needle, there was a feeling of &#x02018;loss of resistance&#x02019;. It can then be concluded that the needle is outside the T12/L1 disc. When needle was in position, observation for leakage of blood, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid was made before careful aspiration. 2ml contrast (urograffin) was injected in order to check the position of needle in the disc. The needle position was confirmed in lateral images by seeing the hugging of dye anterior to the intervertebral disc and in antero-posterior images dye was midline in a position anterior to the intervertebral disc. After this depth is ascertained, the right sided needle was inserted in a similar fashion to a depth of 1.0&#x02013;1.5 cm farther. After checking the position of the needle, a 3 ml of local anesthetic was given before injection of study solution to prevent the irritation of alcohol. 10, 15, and 20 ml of study solution were used in each needle, in 10 patients of each group, respectively. Before removal of the needle, 2 ml normal saline was injected into each needle to prevent alcohol from tracking back along the needle path.</p><p>The effect on pain relief, requirement of oral analgesics and QOL were compared.

In addition, excessive sedation or other side effects may limit the acceptability and usefulness of oral opioids therapy. Neurolysis of celiac plexus (NCPB) appeared boon to cancer pain. It appears to be a safe, cost-effective approach to treating visceral pain associated with cancer. The benefits include improved analgesia, reduced opioid consumption, favorable economic implications, and superior clinical effects due to the avoidance of deleterious properties of high-dose chronic opioid therapy.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Degree of pain relief</title><p>There was significant pain relieved in patients of all the three groups after CPB. This was demonstrated by decrease in VAS score. In the present study, VAS score &#x02264;3 with or without opioid medication was taken as a successful CPB. Mercadante[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] found that CPB made pain control possible with a reduction in opioid consumption for a mean survival period of about 51 days. Furthermore, Eisenberg <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] suggested that NCPB has long-lasting benefit for 70&#x02013;90% of patients with pancreatic and other intra-abdominal cancers, regardless of the technique used. Bridenbaugh <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] concluded that this simple procedure proved effective in controlling the pain without any serious complications. Kawamata <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] found that VAS scores significantly improved for 4 weeks after CPB and concluded that the VAS scores were lower in CPB group than MOR group. Amr and Makharita[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] found that the analgesia induced by the celiac block after medically controlling pain was better and more sustained when compared with the outcome on performing a celiac block at a high VAS score &#x0003e;7.</p><p>In the present study, a fall in VAS scores was observed 15 min after intervention in all the three groups, which was due to the effect of local anesthetic agent lidocaine. The lowest VAS score in all the three groups was observed at the end of 2<sup>nd</sup> week. This finding of our study is supported by Eisenberg <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In their study, good to excellent pain relief was reported in 89% of patients during the first 2 weeks after NCPB. Furthermore, Soweid and Azar[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] found that 78% of patients reported a drop in pain score 2 weeks after the procedure. In 2013, Seicean[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] also found that average pain and worst pain had decreased significantly by 2 weeks after the procedure, but complete relief using pain killers was not significantly different, although some patients gave up their morphine-based medication.</p><p>In the present study, VAS scores in Group I were lower as compared to baseline at all follow-up intervals except from 12 weeks onward to the end of study where the difference from baseline was not significant statistically. In Group I, the VAS score remained to &#x02264;3 up to 8<sup>th</sup> week i.e., duration of blockade was 8 weeks. In Groups II and III, at all the follow up intervals, VAS scores were significantly lower as compared to baseline. However in Group II after 12<sup>th</sup> week the VAS score became more than 3 i.e. duration of blockade was 12 weeks. In Group III until the end of study i.e. up to 16 week the VAS score remained &#x02264;3 i.e., duration of blockade was 16 weeks. This finding of the study is supported by Rykowski and Hilgier,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] they found that recurrence of significant and severe pain (VAS score 4 or more) occurred gradually, mostly from the 4<sup>th</sup> month from the primary neurolysis (mean, 3.4 months or 119 days of effective pain relief without strong opioids) and concluded that after NCPB, 74% had effective pain relief during the first 3 months. Similarly, Eisenberg <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] concluded that partial to complete pain relief continued in approximately 90% of patients alive at 3 months post-NCPB and in 70&#x02013;90% until death even if beyond 3 months post-NCPB. Hence, we can conclude that patients of Group III had a longer duration of pain relief after CPB as compared to other groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Dosing of morphine</title><p>At baseline, all the patients had the same requirement of morphine. In the present study as compared to baseline, after CPB from week 1 itself the morphine requirement was reduced at all the follow-up intervals in the Group II and Group III. In Group I the morphine requirement was reduced to up to 11 weeks, from 12<sup>th</sup> week onward morphine dosing returned to baseline. In the present study, morphine was not completely stopped in any patients of three groups. This result of the present study is supported by other studies.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Opioids were withdrawn totally in 47% of NCPB and reduced in 53% in these studies.</p><p>In the present study, Group I had significantly higher morphine requirement as compared to Group II from week 9 onward to the end of the study. Group II had significantly higher morphine requirement as compared to Group III from week 12 to the end of the study. Therefore, we can state that patients of Group III required less doses of morphine after CPB as compared to other groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Assessment of quality of life</title><p>At baseline, QOL scores did not show a significant intergroup difference (<italic>P</italic> = 0.165). In all the three groups, differences in QOL scores at different follow-up intervals as compared to base line was significant statistically (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) except in Group I from week 12 onward and Group II at week 16 intervals. At all these intervals, the values were significantly higher (improved QOL) than that at baseline. An intergroup difference in QOL scores was observed at week 3 onward until the end of study (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). A significant difference in QOL scores between Groups I and Group II was observed from week 6 until week 14, QOL scores of Group II were higher (improved QOL) as compared to Group I. Between Group I and Group III, significant differences were observed from week 2 onwarduntil the end of study, QOL score of Group III were higher (improved QOL) as compared to Group I. Between Group II and Group III, significant difference was observed at week 16 only when Group III had higher score (improved QOL) as compared to Group II.</p><p>This result of our study is supported by Amr and Makharita.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] They found that QLQ-C30 assessment revealed a significant improvement in daily life activity and QOL after injection in both groups but with more significant improvement in the group in which the celiac block was performed after medical therapy. Similarly, Rykowski and Hilgier[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] concluded that patients who had good pain relief after neurolysis had improved alertness and QOL. Matamala <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] concluded that decreased opioid consumption may improve the QOL by decreasing sedative effect of opioids and enhance the immune system as it was shown that opioids had a negative effect on immunity at cellular level. However, Kawamata <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] found that sufficient pain management with the least side effects does not remarkably improve QOL in patients with pancreatic cancer pain, but it can prevent deterioration in QOL. To improve the QOL significantly, socio-environmental supports including home care are necessary, as well as pain management and palliative care, and concluded that CPB does not directly improve QOL in patients with pancreatic cancer pain, but it may prevent deterioration in QOL by the long-lasting analgesic effect, limitation of side effects, and the reduction of morphine consumption, compared to treatment only with NSAID-morphine. Similarly, Wong <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] concluded that NCPB improves pain relief as compared to systemic analgesic intervention alone but it does not influences QOL or survival.</p><p>From the observations of our study, we cannot comment on the improvement survival of the patients received CPB because first; we had excluded those patients, who did not complete the 16 weeks follow-up period for any reason, second, due to the short follow-up period, and finally, it was not included in the objective of our study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Complications</title><p>In the present study except for pain at injection site, mild back pain, and diarrhea were noticed in few patients, and they were transient in nature, no other side effects were observed in any of the groups. Eisenberg <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] concluded that common adverse effects were transient, including local pain (96%), diarrhea (44%), and hypotension (38%). In the present study, none of the patient experienced bradycardia or hypotension. The may be due to preloading with Ringer's lactate by increasing amount of 70% alcohol up to 40 ml the incidence of side effects were not increased in the present study.</p></sec><sec
