Physical activity is critical to retaining health and independence, but the majority of older people are insufficiently physically active to achieve these benefits and have high levels of sedentary (sitting) time. Activity programmes are often offered in retirement villages; however, their uptake is limited. Furthermore, although the physical environment in and around these villages can play an important role in decisions to be physically active, its role is often overlooked by research in these settings. We aim to develop, implement and evaluate a proof-of-concept motivationally embellished intervention designed to increase walking, reduce sitting and improve mental health in residents in retirement villages.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This will be a 16-week pilot intervention using a cluster randomised design with retirement villages as the unit of randomisation and residents as the unit of assessment.

Objective audits of neighbourhood environments around each village will be completed using the Pathway Environmental Audit Tool. Seven villages will be randomised to the experimental arm and seven to the control arm. Only participants in the experimental arm will receive <italic>motivational</italic> training. All outcomes will be assessed at baseline, end of intervention and 6-month follow-up. Changes in physical activity levels, sitting time and mental health will be examined.

It is estimated that, by 2050, adults aged 65 years&#x000a0;and above will constitute 16% of the global population.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The risks of a range of chronic diseases and dependency increase with age, with potentially far-reaching individual and societal costs. However, these risks can be modified through engagement in regular and sustained physical activity. For example, physical activity participation reduces the risks of losing independence, acquiring chronic diseases, including dementia, can increase life expectancy and improve quality of life.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;5</xref> However, as people age, physical activity tends to decline, with the majority of older adults not engaging in sufficient amounts of physical activity to maintain or improve health.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;9</xref> Current guidelines of physical activity for older adults suggest they should engage in at least 150&#x02009;min of moderate intensity physical activity per week in bouts of at least 10&#x02009;min each, or 75&#x02009;min of vigorous intensity activity, or an equivalent combination of the two, per week, in addition to balance (three times per week) and muscle strengthening (twice weekly) activities.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Retirement villages as an opportune setting for the promotion of physical activity</title><p>Retirement villages are highly relevant settings to promote physical activity, as they aim to foster relative independence of residents by encouraging the preservation of functional capacity. It is expected that the number of retirement villages will continue to increase, given the rapidly growing ageing population. Given that retirement villages cater for a relatively broad group of older adults, they represent an important setting in which to examine the efficacy and effectiveness of health behaviour change interventions. Retirement villages differ substantially with regard to the socioeconomic status of their residents. For example, in some retirement villages accommodation is funded by residents themselves, but in other villages residents lease their accommodation or their housing is subsidised. Residents in subsidised tenancy tend to be the most disadvantaged in terms of socioeconomic status, mental health, substance abuse and general health. Indeed, it is well established that socioeconomically disadvantaged populations tend to suffer from more health problems and engage in lower levels of physical activity.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> Thus, it is critical to examine whether a health behaviour change intervention is equally effective in retirement villages with different socioeconomic groups of residents.</p><p>Similar to community-dwelling older adults, residents in retirement villages have opportunities to be physically active. For example, structured exercise programmes and facilities such as swimming pools and gyms are often available in these villages. However, existing programmes and facilities do not appeal to a large proportion of residents.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This observation is consistent with findings showing that only 27% of older adults in retirement villages in Perth, Western Australia, were sufficiently physically active to accrue health benefits.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Walking as a suitable aerobic activity for older adults</title><p>Walking is a safe and free mode of physical activity that can be self-sustained and that does not require any specialist equipment or skills.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> It is also the physical activity of choice for older adults, particularly those who are physically inactive.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> A systematic review of interventions focused on the promotion of walking showed that walking can be increased by up to 60&#x02009;min per week in the general population, at least in the short term.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Furthermore, other evidence suggests that for older adults living with some chronic illness or disability (which does not prevent them from walking), accumulating 5000 steps per day is a realistic goal and leads to clear health benefits.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> Group-based formats, in particular, appear to be very effective in increasing walking in physically inactive individuals, and they are instrumental during the adoption stages of physical activity change.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Indeed, retirement village residents who were interviewed on their perceptions of peer-led group-based walks, walking was labelled as extremely important for socialising with other residents while engaging in physical activities.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> These findings are consistent with research conducted with other populations of older adults.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> The proposed group-based intervention format was also seen by the interviewees in the study by Th&#x000f8;gersen-Ntoumani <italic>et al</italic> as a potentially effective means of establishing a healthy lifestyle &#x02018;routine&#x02019;, which many new residents found difficult in the transition from home-based living to retirement village living.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Targeting both physical activity and sedentary time</title><p>There is now wide recognition that in addition to increasing physical activity, it is also important to reduce sedentary behaviours (&#x02018;sitting time&#x02019;). A meta-analysis has shown that those older people in the highest sitting category, when compared with those in the lowest, have significantly elevated risk for all-cause mortality and chronic diseases such as diabetes, independent of levels of physical activity.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> In another meta-analysis, with more than 1&#x02009;million people, it was shown that watching three or more hours of television per day increased the risk of mortality, after adjusting for levels of physical activity. However, while this was true for most people, those with high levels of physical activity showed no such association between television viewing and risk for mortality.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> These findings imply that physical activity and sedentary time need to be directly and independently addressed and that the deleterious effects of high levels of sitting are most pronounced for those who are relatively inactive. Moreover, as moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and sedentary behaviour are largely independent, it is also clear that changes in one behaviour do not necessarily result in changes in the other. Identifying effective strategies to reduce sitting is particularly important in older adults who tend to spend more than 8&#x02009;hours per day sitting, which is higher than any other age group.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
</p><p>Intervention research directly targeting sedentary behaviour with older adults in particular is, however, sparse.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 29</xref> In one habit-based sedentary behaviour reduction intervention, the researchers designed a booklet consisting of 16 tips on how to reduce sitting behaviours.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The selection of techniques was guided by Lally and Gardner&#x02019;s habit formation framework and encompassed techniques designed to increase motivation to reduce sedentary behaviour (and increase physical activity), facilitate the translation of intentions into actions and disrupt sitting. Overall, the techniques were received favourably by older sedentary adults.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> A recent review of studies with adults conducted by Gardner and colleagues suggested that self-monitoring, problem solving, modifying the social and physical environments and providing information on the health consequences of sitting were promising behaviour change techniques in interventions designed to reduce sedentary behaviour.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>The physical environment</title><p>In line with ecological models of behaviour change, interventions should consider the physical environment alongside individual and social factors.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> However, little is known about how the environmental characteristics of one&#x02019;s place of residence impact on the effectiveness of behavioural interventions aimed at increasing walking and reducing sedentary behaviour.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> It is plausible to assume that the short and, especially, long-term effects of interventions focused on walking would be partly determined by neighbourhood &#x02018;walkability&#x02019;.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> This is especially the case for older adults who are likely to be highly influenced by the physical environment, since mobility and independence can be greatly limited by a poorly designed community space.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Specifically, positive associations have been reported between perceived and/or objectively&#x000a0;measured street connectivity, number of walking paths, traffic and crime safety, aesthetics, access to services, residential density and walking for different purposes in older people.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34 35</xref> A recent review of the literature found poor agreement between the perceived and objectively measured neighbourhood environments; each predicted unique variance in physical activity.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Additionally, perceived environmental attributes have been shown to moderate the effectiveness of a motivational intervention focused on walking in middle-aged adults, whereby motivational aids were able to overcome the negative effects of low neighbourhood aesthetic appeal.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Thus, in order to better understand the effectiveness of interventions, it is important to evaluate the moderating effects of <italic>both</italic> the objectively&#x000a0;measured and perceived neighbourhood physical environments. A study with older adults from retirement communities showed that a 3-month intervention focused on addressing individual, social and built environment factors was successful in helping older adults change their <italic>perceptions</italic> of the environment so participants began to perceive fewer environmental barriers to walking and became more satisfied with their walking environment.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Therefore, it is likely to be important to raise awareness of opportunities to walk in the local environment when implementing walking interventions with retirement village residents.</p></sec><sec id="s1e"><title>Self-determination theory (SDT)</title><p>Grounding interventions on sound theory is informative because theory helps facilitate an understanding of <italic>why</italic> and <italic>how</italic> intervention strategies work.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> One theoretical framework that has shown good potential to promote health behaviour change is SDT.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Although many interventions have shown promise in increasing physical activity levels, a review of 57 interventions with older adults showed short-term but no long-term positive effects.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> SDT identifies enabling factors for long-term adherence to physical activity.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> The theory proposes that only autonomous motivation, that is motivation emanating from within the individual, is likely to contribute to sustained behaviour change, especially for behaviours that are important for health but that are not necessarily inherently enjoyable. In contrast, motivation resulting from feelings of guilt or pressure (ie, controlled motivation) is unlikely to result in sustained behaviour change.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> The social environment plays an important role in helping individuals internalise motivation for engaging in behaviours. Specifically, the provision of autonomy support (eg, by a walk leader), which is characterised by offering choice, meaningful information in a non-judgemental manner, being empathetic and minimising the use of pressure and control, can facilitate internalised motivation. These propositions have been extensively tested and supported in the healthcare (including physical activity) domain.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41&#x02013;46</xref> For example, Th&#x000f8;gersen-Ntoumani and colleagues have shown that incorporating SDT-based motivational principles into the design of a 16-week walking intervention was effective in terms of promoting positive changes in physically inactive middle-aged and older University employees.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Specifically, there were increases in walking, other types of physical activity and mental well-being by the end of the intervention, which were sustained at a 4-month follow-up. It was also shown that it was possible to train walk leaders in the provision of autonomy support to participants.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> This intervention format can readily be adapted for use with other population groups, after any necessary customisations.</p></sec><sec id="s1f"><title>The present intervention</title><p>The intervention described in this paper will differ from previous physical activity and sedentary behaviour interventions with older adults, thereby adding significant (conceptual and applied) value to the existing literature. A &#x02018;train-the-trainer&#x02019; approach will be adopted as an important part of the intervention, which will entail the training of older residents (subsequently referred to as &#x02018;resident ambassadors&#x02019;) in using a motivationally supportive communication style. These resident ambassadors will subsequently guide, motivate and support their peers to adopt and sustain lifestyle changes. It is expected that this support will empower their peers to change the quality of their own motivation to walk more and sit less, thus increasing the likelihood of intervention sustainability in the long term. In contrast to previous walk-based interventions, the reduction of sedentary (sitting) behaviours will be targeted in addition to walking.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 47</xref> Furthermore, a phased approach will be used in the intervention design whereby organised group&#x000a0;support will be phased out and will be gradually replaced by support in developing self-regulated and self-organised walks. This transition will allow participants to take increasing ownership of their behaviours. Finally, in line with recommendations to examine moderators and mediators of health behaviour change, a range of personal, physical environment and village characteristics will be assessed.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>

</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analyses</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This will be a 16-week pilot intervention using a cluster randomised design. Data collection will start in March 2017, and it is expected that all assessments will be completed a year later. Retirement villages will be the unit of randomisation, and residents will be the unit of assessment. Participants will be randomly assigned to either control or experimental arm with a 1:1 allocation, stratified by village. A researcher not associated with recruitment or data collection, and who will be blind to village identity, will carry out randomisation via computer software, after recruitment. Allocation concealment will be ensured, as randomisation will not be disclosed until the intervention starts. Fourteen retirement villages in Western Australia will be recruited. Seven villages will be randomised to the experimental arm and seven to the control arm. This number of villages has been selected because 30 villages would be considered the minimal sample size to estimate environmental moderating effects in a definitive randomised controlled trial&#x000a0;(RCT).<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> Targeting approximately half of the minimal sample size of villages will provide for a sufficiently robust estimate to inform power analyses for a future definitive trial. We aim to recruit villages (and match them as much as possible across both arms) that will be characterised by varying levels of social disadvantage (lease-for-life, resident funded or subsidised tenancy), physical environment characteristics (eg, perceived safety, safety from traffic and proximity to amenities) and levels of deprivation (as defined through Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas scores). We will recruit an <italic>average</italic> of 15 resident participants (total n=210) and five resident ambassadors (total n=70) from each village. However, given the pragmatic nature of the intervention and the fact that the sizes of villages differ greatly, the numbers of ambassadors and walkers are likely to vary per village. All participants, village coordinators and the data analyst will be blinded to allocation, given that in both arms participants and resident ambassadors will receive training without knowing that the content of the training will differ across villages. There will be no circumstances under which unblinding for those individuals will be necessary. Research assistants&#x000a0;(RAs) who will collect data will be unblinded due to practical constraints.</p><p>The protocol has been prepared in accordance with guidelines by the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials and Template for Intervention Description and Replication.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50 51</xref> Completed checklists are provided as additional files.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Recruitment, participants, eligibility and screening</title><p>All recruitment will be done by the research team that will liaise with providers of retirement villages in Perth, Western Australia, and nearby areas. When support in principle is obtained from the providers, the research team will make contact with the village coordinators and, following approval for recruitment, they will arrange suitable methods and opportunities for the research team to promote the intervention among the residents of the villages. Forms of recruitment will be face-to-face contact (eg, talks introducing the project as part of coffee mornings), and via posters, flyers and letters posted in residents&#x02019; letter boxes. Resident ambassadors, who will volunteer for the role, will be permanent residents in the retirement villages, aged 60 years or above, who are able to communicate well in English, can provide consent, are already physically active (ie, meet the current Australian Government recommendations of physical activity for health) and have a willingness and commitment to take on the ambassador role.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> Walk group participants will be permanent village residents, aged 60 years or above, who are able to communicate well in English, provide consent, participate in baseline assessments, have no terminal illness or health problems that prevent them from walking (we will include those who use walking sticks and walking frames), do not have a known dementia diagnosis, can walk continuously on a flat surface at a light/moderate pace for 15&#x000a0;min, have had fewer than two falls in the past 3 months and do <italic>not</italic> currently meet the specific Australian Government guideline for older adults to accumulate at least 30&#x02009;min of moderate intensity physical activity on most days of the week (ie, recommendation 3 of &#x02018;Choose Health, Be Active&#x02019;).<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> Screening of ambassadors and group walk participants&#x02019; physical activity levels will be done using the two-stage approach outlined by Vandelanotte <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> Participants will also be asked to complete the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire to ensure that there are no contraindications for walking.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>

In the control arm, the workshop will consist of information on the benefits of increased walking and reduced sitting, training in how to lead group walks in a safe manner, what to do in case of emergencies and the tasks needed to coordinate and lead the group walks. In the experimental arm, the resident ambassadors will receive similar information (some of it will be in handout format due to time constraints), but they will also receive training on the major types of motivation proposed by SDT, and they will be asked to reflect on their own motivation for their role. Resident ambassadors in both arms will receive printed material to support learning.</p><p>In the experimental arm, resident ambassadors will also receive an additional 2-hour workshop later in the same day, delivered by members of the research team. In this workshop, the ambassadors will be introduced to the basic principles of the motivational framework underpinning the intervention (ie, SDT) and will engage in practical exercises that will aim to show <italic>how</italic> to support other residents&#x02019; autonomous motivation for walking and for reducing sitting behaviours. Specifically, the different motivations underpinning engagement in these behaviours will be described and illustrated. The resident ambassadors will then be introduced to ways in which autonomous motivation can be supported. For example, the resident ambassadors will be trained to encourage participants&#x02019; involvement and opinions in making choices (eg, walking routes&#x000a0;and ways to break up sitting time), use open-ended questions, be empathetic, acknowledge difficulties or negative emotions, develop feelings of belongingness, provide competence-building feedback, avoid judgemental or controlling language, provide rationales for activities and encourage personal responsibility and initiative. The resident ambassadors will be encouraged to identify concrete examples of how they can put these principles into practice. They will also be provided with relevant examples. Two weeks into the intervention, a third 2-hour workshop will be offered to the ambassadors in the experimental arm to share successes and challenges in implementing the motivational strategies taught. Brainstorming will be encouraged, and solutions will be identified. In between the second and the third workshops, as well as after the third workshop, resident ambassadors in the experimental arm will use training material to achieve weekly goals (eg, helping participants feel successful) via the implementation of SDT-based motivational strategies. The resident ambassadors in the control group will not receive the motivational training, but the motivational training will be made available to them at the end of the project. Due to geographical distance between the villages in the same conditions, all workshops will be delivered in the ambassadors&#x02019; own retirement villages.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Group sessions for residents</title><p>In both arms, the residents will receive at the beginning of the intervention one group-taught 2-hour session, delivered by the research team, on the benefits of walking and reducing sitting time for health. In this session, they will also be provided with outdoor walk route maps and information on step counts for specific walks to destinations inside and outside their villages. The participants in the experimental arm will receive the same information but in a more condensed form during the workshop (but with more detailed handouts to read afterwards). They will also be offered training on motivation using SDT principles. Given that SDT argues that facilitating the understanding of the importance of the activity will help individuals to self-endorse it, the participants in the experimental arm will undertake exercises in which they will reflect on how and in what ways the programme will be beneficial to them and how it aligns with their personal values. Furthermore, the participants will receive training in behaviour change techniques (eg, implementation intentions, self-monitoring and goal setting) in an effort to optimise and support motivation. For example, participants will be asked to reflect on personal barriers to walking and reducing sitting time and how to overcome them by planning a response for anticipated obstacles (ie, &#x02018;implementation intentions&#x02019;). They will be given self-monitoring exercises (in addition to logging step counts) so that they can become more aware of how their walking and sitting behaviour patterns change and how to cope with tempting situations (eg, sedentary alternatives) that might prevent them from undertaking their walks or breaking up their sitting time. Goal&#x000a0;setting principles will be illustrated, and relapse prevention will be discussed with suggestions of how to get back on track following temporary setbacks. Furthermore, they will also be taught behaviour change techniques regarding ways of breaking up long periods of sitting. A tips sheet outlining specific strategies will be produced based on the results of a review by Gardner and colleagues and preliminary qualitative work which is currently being conducted by our team with 20 residents.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> As for the resident ambassadors, the workshops will be delivered in the residents&#x02019; own retirement villages.</p><p>Participants in both arms will be provided with log-books for the documentation of step counts. They will also be encouraged to use a tick sheet to indicate how many times per day they took a break from sitting (when sitting more than 30&#x02009;min at a time).<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>
</p><p>The participants in the experimental arm will be given motivational booklets that will include week-by-week guidance on implementing the behaviour change techniques covered in the workshop. They will also be supported in successfully using these techniques by the researchers by biweekly visits (either visiting participants individually or in groups) or phone calls (which will also aim to facilitate participant retention to the study and to collect information on any adverse events). These visits and phone calls will be weaned off gradually during the 16-week intervention to prevent participants becoming reliant on this support. Participants in the control group will not be given motivational booklets but will receive a general fact sheet with practical examples of increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviour. The full intervention package will be offered to the villages in the control arm at the end of the project. The intervention material will be made available to participants in the current trial in hard&#x000a0;copy and online on completion of the testing of the intervention (eg, via the project website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.riat.com.au">www.riat.com.au</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Group-led walks</title><p>Group-led walks constitute an important component of the intervention. Twenty-to-thirty minute group-led walks, which will be led by resident ambassadors, will be offered during the mornings and afternoons for the first 10 weeks to participants in both arms. Participants of similar walking capability will be put in the same group based on results of a 6&#x02009;min walk test. Participants will be encouraged to partake in three group walks per week. Duration and intensity of the walks will be adapted to the needs of the groups. The routes will be risk assessed by the researchers prior to the intervention commencing. Criteria for assessment will include assessing the level of pavements, street lighting, congested traffic areas, traffic lights, marked foot crossings for pedestrians or pedestrian island included in the midpoint of the road. The routes will be planned around the retirement villages to enable those participants who feel unable to walk for the full duration of the walk to walk only part of the route. In addition to the group-led walks, the residents in both conditions will also be encouraged during the first 10 weeks to engage in at least two self-organised walks per week (indoor walk routes will also be planned and promoted). In the final 6&#x02009;weeks, the participants in both arms will be encouraged to self-organise all their walks in smaller groups or individually.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Residents in action trial (RiAT) intervention procedures</title><p>An outline of the procedures for the trial is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Outline of trial procedures.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-015543f01"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Feasibility-related outcomes</title><p>Descriptive data on uptake will be recorded by the research team during the recruitment process.

The intervention will use strategies to specifically target older adults in retirement villages who do not currently achieve the guidelines to improve or maintain health and well-being. These groups are in greater need with regard to improving health and well-being and have greater scope for improvement than their more active counterparts. Any potentially positive impacts of the intervention on individuals&#x02019; health, well-being, independence and functioning could reduce the risk of these residents going into residential care settings (such as nursing homes) or delay such moves. This in turn could have substantial public health implications in terms of improved quality of life and reduced healthcare expenses. As part of the current pilot trial, we will record trial expenses relating to workshop delivery and production of training material that could inform a health economic analysis in a future definitive trial.</p><p>In contrast to previous trials, the present intervention uses a peer-led approach whereby resident ambassadors are motivationally trained to support their less physically active peer residents. Indeed, studies employing the theoretical framework underpinning the intervention (ie, SDT) have shown consistently that the provision of need supportive strategies from key agents within the social environment helps individuals facilitate improvements in quality of motivation and leads to sustained behavioural engagement and positive health and well-being outcomes.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46 75</xref> An important contribution of the study to the extant SDT literature is examining whether the physical environment and types of tenancy moderate intervention effectiveness.</p><p>Beyond intervening at the level of the social environment (ie, training ambassadors), the trial also incorporates training to equip residents with skills to self-sustain both physical activity and sedentary behaviour changes over the longer&#x000a0;term, using evidence-based behaviour change techniques. This is critical because previous research has shown that when older adults begin activity programmes, participation is often short&#x000a0;lived.<xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref> A thorough process evaluation will enable the identification of techniques that are more versus less effective, which will inform future intervention efforts in this, and similar, settings.</p><p>The results of the present pilot RCT will inform the testing of a definitive trial. If that trial is successful, the intervention programme can be packaged and rolled out for use by providers of physical activity programmes for older adults across Australia and other countries if appropriate. Furthermore, the intervention, or adapted versions of it, can be used across different types of accommodation, or complement existing physical activity programmes for older adults. To facilitate its adoption, the intervention material will become freely available in both printed and online formats following the definitive trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e292" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-015543.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e293" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-015543.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> CT-N, EB, KDH, EC, SJHB and NN conceived the project and obtained the project funding.
