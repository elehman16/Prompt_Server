<bold>Objective</bold>&#x000a0;To assess the three year clinical outcomes and cost effectiveness of a strategy of endovascular repair (if aortic morphology is suitable, open repair if not) versus open repair for patients with suspected ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.</p><p>
<bold>Design</bold>&#x000a0;Randomised controlled trial.</p><p>
<bold>Setting</bold>&#x000a0;30 vascular centres (29 in UK, one in Canada), 2009-16.</p><p>
<bold>Participants</bold>&#x000a0;613 eligible patients (480 men) with a clinical diagnosis of ruptured aneurysm, of whom 502 underwent emergency repair for rupture.</p><p>
<bold>Interventions</bold>&#x000a0;316 patients were randomised to an endovascular strategy (275 with confirmed rupture) and 297 to open repair (261 with confirmed rupture).</p><p>
<bold>Main outcome measures</bold>&#x000a0;Mortality, with reinterventions after aneurysm repair, quality of life, and hospital costs to three years as secondary measures.</p><p>
<bold>Results</bold>&#x000a0;The maximum follow-up for mortality was 7.1 years, with two patients in each group lost to follow-up by three years. After similar mortality by 90 days, in the mid-term (three months to three years) there were fewer deaths in the endovascular than the open repair group (hazard ratio 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.90), leading to lower mortality at three years (48% <italic>v</italic> 56%), but by seven years mortality was about 60% in each group (hazard ratio 0.92, 0.75 to 1.13). Results for the 502 patients with repaired ruptures were more pronounced: three year mortality was lower in the endovascular strategy group (42% <italic>v</italic> 54%; odds ratio 0.62, 0.43 to 0.88), but after seven years there was no clear difference between the groups (hazard ratio 0.86, 0.68 to 1.08). Reintervention rates up to three years were not significantly different between the randomised groups (hazard ratio 1.02, 0.79 to 1.32); the initial rapid rate of reinterventions was followed by a much slower mid-term reintervention rate in both groups. The early higher average quality of life in the endovascular strategy versus open repair group, coupled with the lower mortality at three years, led to a gain in average quality adjusted life years (QALYs) at three years of 0.17 (95% confidence interval 0.00 to 0.33). The endovascular strategy group spent fewer days in hospital and had lower average costs of &#x02212;&#x000a3;2605 (95% confidence interval &#x02212;&#x000a3;5966 to &#x000a3;702) (about &#x020ac;2813; $3439). The probability that the endovascular strategy is cost effective was &#x0003e;90% at all levels of willingness to pay for a QALY gain.</p><p>
<bold>Conclusions</bold>&#x000a0;At three years, compared with open repair, an endovascular strategy for suspected ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm was associated with a survival advantage, a gain in QALYs, similar levels of reintervention, and reduced costs, and this strategy was cost effective. These findings support the increasing use of an endovascular strategy, with wider availability of emergency endovascular repair.</p><p>

There have been three recent European randomised trials of endovascular versus open repair for ruptured aneurysm, including the IMPROVE trial. None of the individual trials or their combined data showed a significant survival benefit during the acute period (0-90 days) with endovascular repair.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> This challenges the data from systematic reviews of observational studies, which show a much lower operative mortality after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Few recent comparative studies have followed patients undergoing either EVAR or open repair for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in the mid or longer term (beyond a year after rupture). Studies, including one from the Vascular Study Group of New England,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> one from the Amsterdam cohort with ruptured aneurysm,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and a comparison of an endovascular first strategy with an open repair first strategy in Sweden,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> were mainly non-randomised and retrospective and could be confounded by aortic morphology<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and other unmeasured factors. Such data have suggested that, after three to five years, survival was similar for those having endovascular and open repair and that patients&#x02019; comorbidities and shock on admission were the main determinants of longer term survival.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The Amsterdam cohort study, which was dominated by open repair patients, showed that any early survival benefit of EVAR had been eroded by two years, and thereafter survival was similar in patients treated by open or endovascular repair, with about 50% of patients remaining alive at three years.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The Amsterdam study also showed that, for those discharged alive, later reinterventions were more common after endovascular than open repair. Therefore, the mid-term clinical and cost effectiveness of EVAR or an endovascular strategy for the management of ruptured aneurysm remains uncertain.</p><p>There has been considerable reorganisation of vascular services to provide higher volume centres for elective surgery in the UK and elsewhere.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Further changes might be necessary to optimise the use of scarce resources, including intensive care, and to ensure equitable access to complex emergency surgery.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The logistics of providing an endovascular service for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm are considerable with regard to the availability of appropriate staff, facilities, and consumables, and many centres in the IMPROVE trial could not offer this service every day of the week. Better evidence is required to stimulate organisational change, particularly further evidence of the effect of an endovascular strategy on mortality, reintervention rates, health related quality of life (QoL), and cost beyond one year follow-up. We investigated the hypothesis that in the mid-term (by three years) an endovascular strategy remains both clinically effective and cost effective.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>IMPROVE (ISRCTN 48334791) was a multicentre trial of unselected patients aged over 50 in whom a senior hospital clinician had made a clinical diagnosis of ruptured aortic aneurysm. Patients were randomised to either an endovascular strategy (immediate computed tomography and emergency EVAR if morphologically feasible) or emergency open repair. Patients were usually randomised in the emergency room, before computed tomography and anaesthesiology opinion. Therefore, open repair was the specified treatment for patients who were morphologically unsuitable for EVAR in the endovascular strategy group. In the open repair group, computed tomography was not compulsory but was used in 90% of patients. The trial methods, 30 day, and one year outcomes have been published elsewhere.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Soon after the completion of recruitment in 2013, with the observation that about 50% patients remained alive at three years, the trial was extended to provide three year outcomes for all patients. The same outcomes collected at one year were collected at three years, on a post hoc basis, as three year outcomes were not originally registered at the start of the trial because further funding for longer term follow-up could be sought only once all patients had been recruited. The study protocol was updated in August 2013 to include the three year outcomes: this, and the statistical analysis plans, are available from the trial websites (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.improvetrial.org">www.improvetrial.org</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/improvetrial">www.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/improvetrial</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Centres, randomisation, and patients</title><p>This trial was conducted in 29 British and one Canadian centres with proved competence in emergency EVAR. An independent contractor provided central telephone computer generated randomisation (1:1), stratified by centre with variable block size, which automatically provided date and time of randomisation. There was no blinding. The study randomised 613 patients from September 2009 to July 2013 and followed them up to July 2016. The trial guidelines for suitability for EVAR were aneurysm neck diameter &#x02264;32 mm, aneurysm neck length &#x02265;10 mm, and neck angulation &#x0003c;60&#x000b0;.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> As the radiological diagnosis of rupture can be difficult,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> experts in a core laboratory based at St George&#x02019;s Hospital, London, later reviewed computed tomograms.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome was total mortality, with secondary outcomes at three years including reinterventions related to the aneurysm, QoL, resource use, costs, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost effectiveness. Total mortality in the UK was from data linkage with the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and locally in Canada. Trained local coordinators were responsible for the collection of prospective data on resource use including readmissions and reinterventions related to the aneurysm and its repair and QoL data using EuroQol questionnaire (five dimension, three level version; EQ-5D) for all patients undergoing aneurysm repair. Related reinterventions were categorised as arterial, related to laparotomy, or other and classified according to whether they were for a life threatening condition or not (table A in appendix 1). The completeness of reintervention and readmission data was verified by detailed audit in Scotland and Canada and additionally cross checked against an administrative dataset (hospital episode statistics) for reinterventions in England, including those at non-trial hospitals (the source of data used for analyses is shown in table B in appendix 1). The main metric of cost effectiveness was the incremental net monetary benefits, which is calculated by valuing incremental QALYs at a recommended threshold of &#x000a3;30&#x02009;000 (&#x020ac;33&#x02009;650, $39&#x02009;540) per QALY, and then subtracting the incremental costs.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The endovascular strategy would be judged relatively cost effective if the estimated incremental net monetary benefit was positive at this threshold, but we also considered a range of alternative thresholds.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient involvement</title><p>Patients who had survived an earlier repair of ruptured aneurysm and their families were involved in the design of the trial and choice of outcomes (particularly the two stage ethical approval, reporting of place of discharge from hospital, and adverse reinterventions). The wife of a previous patient was included in the trial steering committee to oversee the conduct of the trial. Patients were not involved in the recruitment process. Patients&#x02019; quality of life was assessed at three time points. A short animated video about the trial and its results is available for patients and the public at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.improvetrial.org">www.improvetrial.org</ext-link> and will be made available to the Circulation Foundation.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Analyses of the full trial cohort were performed on an intention to treat basis. Mortality was assessed with standard survival analysis techniques, including Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard models, with all available follow-up and additionally for the time periods 0-three months (acute) and three months to three years (mid-term). Primary analyses were unadjusted for baseline variables with secondary analyses adjusted for sex, age (continuous measure), Hardman index<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> (morbidity score), lowest systolic blood pressure, and aneurysm neck length (when appropriate). We used multiple imputation with chained equations to account for missing data for baseline covariates, resource use, costs, and the EQ-5D utility score (further details are in table C in appendix 1.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> All adjustment variables except age were also used for subgroup analysis but, given the multiple tests performed, an interaction test P value of &#x0003c;0.01 was required to claim strong evidence of differences between subgroups. The prespecified analysis plan also identified a principal sensitivity analysis restricted to the 502 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of rupture in whom repair was started. In this analysis data were analysed according to the group assigned at randomisation. We compared the proportion surviving at three years after randomisation between the randomised groups using a Pearson&#x02019;s &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test without continuity correction and reported odds ratios using logistic regression. Hazard ratios corresponding to time to first reintervention related to the aneurysm and time to any reinterventions related to the aneurysm and its repair were obtained from Cox regression models, the latter with a multiple failure time model.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</p><p>We calculated the EQ-5D utility index score by combining the EQ-5D health profile of each patient with health state preference values from the UK general population<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and compared the resultant mean QoL utility scores with unpaired <italic>t</italic> tests. For patients discharged without aneurysm repair, quality of life was estimated as previously<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> (further details in appendix 2). QALYs up to three years were calculated by valuing each patient&#x02019;s survival time by their QoL at three, 12, and 36 months according to the &#x0201c;area under the curve&#x0201d; method.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Detailed resource use and costs within three years of randomisation were measured in accordance with international guidelines<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and reported from a hospital and personal social services perspective as recommended by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The costs and QALYs after one year were discounted at 3.5% per year.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
</p><p>Costs were initially calculated in &#x000a3; and converted into &#x020ac;. The incremental QALYs and costs were estimated with a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) model,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and, like the primary analysis of the clinical outcomes, this was without adjustment for baseline covariates. The estimate of incremental costs and QALYs were then used to report incremental net monetary benefits of the endovascular strategy according to the overall intention to treat population.</p><p>Given the moderate rates of non-compliance with trial protocol, and that the non-compliance was not at random, we also applied a complier average causal effects (CACE) model. The CACE estimate reports the potential effect of adhering to trial protocol&#x02014;endovascular strategy (EVAR if morphologically feasible) or open repair&#x02014;to provide a less biased estimate of the true causal effect of an endovascular strategy than a per protocol analysis.<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The CACE approach estimates the causal effects of an endovascular first strategy versus an open repair strategy among those patients who would have complied with the trial protocol for either strategy. Analyses were conducted in the 502 patients with treated ruptures and the CACE estimates for all endpoints, including the incremental net monetary benefits, were reported alongside the intention to treat odds ratio or mean difference in this population at three years (further details in appendix 2).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Study population and interventions</title><p>The study population has been described previously.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>Figure 1<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1"/> shows the 613 randomised patients followed-up to three years after randomisation. Briefly, among the 316 patients in the endovascular strategy group, 275 had aorto-iliac aneurysm rupture, eight had acute symptomatic intact aneurysm, 27 had asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm with other acute diagnoses, and six had other diagnoses. Of the 300/316 who underwent computed tomography, 186 (62%) were considered morphologically suitable for EVAR. Among the 297 patients in the open repair group, 261 had aorto-iliac aneurysm rupture, 14 had acute symptomatic intact aneurysm, 19 had asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm with other acute diagnoses, and three had other diagnoses. In total 536 patients had blood breaching the aneurysm sac (rupture): 34 died before repair and repair was started in 502 (group for principal sensitivity analysis), 259 and 243 in the endovascular strategy and open repair groups, respectively. In 149/259 EVAR was started, and 110/259 patients underwent open repair (26 against protocol, mainly because a staffed endovascular suite was not immediately available). In the open repair group, 33 patients underwent EVAR (mainly because they were poor candidates for general anaesthesia). Between 30 days and three years, two patients in each randomised group emigrated and were lost to follow-up. At randomisation, the mean age was 77, 22% of the patients were women, and the mean aneurysm diameter was 8.4 cm. The baseline characteristics of the 502 treated ruptures, according to randomisation status, were similar to those of the full trial cohort (table 1<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"/>).</p><fig id="f1" fig-type="figure" position="float"><caption><p>

Figure 3<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3"/> shows the cumulative incidences for patients with at least one intervention to three years and at least one intervention for a life threatening condition (see also table A in appendix 1). New reinterventions for life threatening conditions continued to occur at a much slower but steady rate between three months and three years in both groups. The hazard ratios for risk of reintervention, both overall and by time, remained similar after adjustment (table F in appendix 1). The indications for mid-term reintervention (both related to the aneurysm and other, by both randomised group and treatment received) between three months and three years are shown in table G in appendix 1: 21% of surviving patients treated with EVAR had a mid-term intervention.

We found that after aneurysm rupture an endovascular strategy offers no significant reduction in operative mortality at 30 or 90 days, but there is an interim mid-term survival advantage (three months to three years), which, together with the early gains in quality of life, leads to a mid-term gain in QALYs after three years.

The shock associated with rupture probably kills many patients irrespective of the type of repair, but EVAR is less invasive and can be conducted under local anaesthesia so that patients recover more rapidly than after open repair.</p><p>Acute kidney injury is common after repair of a ruptured aneurysm, particularly open repair, and has prolonged consequence for mortality.<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Acute kidney injury was not formally documented, but 46 patients in the open repair group with confirmed rupture required renal replacement therapy postoperatively versus 32 in the endovascular strategy group, suggesting that this might have contributed to the better three year outcomes in the endovascular strategy group. Patients in the open repair group had longer stays in critical care than the endovascular strategy group (average 6.3 versus 4.2 days), and there is some evidence that prolonged stay in critical care is associated with higher long term mortality.<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>
</p><p>The proportion of women in the IMPROVE trial (22%) was much higher than in the trials of elective aneurysm repair, and the advantages of the endovascular strategy were possibly greater in women than in men. The continuing burden of major reinterventions related to laparotomy after open repair for ruptures (not seen, or not reported, after elective open repair) might contribute to mid-term costs in the open repair group, while endovascular devices and the technical skills to deploy them might have improved since the trials of elective repair. The convergence of the survival curves beyond three years is unexplained too, but this phenomenon also has been observed in the analysis of recent registry data and an earlier analysis from Medicare.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>

</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study has several limitations. Firstly, this was a pragmatic trial in the emergency setting and not all randomised patients (with a clinical diagnosis of rupture) had a ruptured aneurysm, although 99% did have an aneurysm. Secondly, some of the patients with ruptured aneurysm died before repair (similar numbers in each randomised group), and in this emergency setting the non-compliance rate was higher than anticipated (about 10% in each group). Thirdly, though this is by far the largest of the three recent European trials, with hindsight the sample size might have been larger to allow for non-compliance. Fourthly, after 30 days follow-up focused mainly on the group of 502 patients in whom repair of a ruptured aneurysm was started. Such patients, however, are the clinically most relevant group and were analysed both by intention to treat and complier average causal estimates for all outcomes. Fifthly, after the acute period, data on reinterventions were limited only to those related to the aneurysm and its repair; however, these data were complete, including procedures related to the aneurysm at hospitals outside the trial. Finally, as there was no blinding it also is possible that patients who received EVAR might have reported better quality at early time points.</p><p>There also are several strengths to this study. Firstly, recruitment was non-selective, and over half the potentially eligible patients at the trial centres were randomised,<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> increasing the generalisability of the findings. Secondly, it is the first prospective randomised study with complete clinical and health economic mid-term follow-up. Thirdly, few patients were lost to follow-up, and data completion rates were excellent.</p></sec><sec><title>Summary</title><p>This mid-term follow-up provides convincing support for the benefits of an endovascular strategy (EVAR if morphologically feasible) versus open repair to treat patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.
