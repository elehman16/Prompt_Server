Ergo_bike training using the Probe Reaction Time (P-RT) and 10-m maximum walking speed as
the outcome measures, on incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI) patients. [Subjects] Thirty
male T8&#x02013;L3 level spinal cord injury patients were the subjects. [Methods] The subjects
were randomly divided into 2 groups: a Lokomat group and an Ergo_bike group. Each group
consisted of 15 subjects. The P-RT and 10&#x02005;m maximum walking speed were measured before and
after the intervention for each group. [Results] The P-RT and the time taken to cover 10&#x02005;m
at maximum walking speed decreased significantly in the Lokomat group. [Conclusion] The
Lokomat training not only decreased P-RT, but also improved the walking ability of
subjects with iSCI.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Lokomat</kwd><kwd>Ergo_bike</kwd><kwd>Probe reaction time</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>After spinal cord injury, the recovery of walking ability is one of the most important
milestones in the rehabilitation process and one of the factors with the greatest impact on
social and professional reintegration for the patient<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients with iSCI have the potential to regain some ambulatory
function. However, ambulation seldom becomes normal and iSCI patients tend to walk slower,
depend on walking aids, and are prone to falling<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Underlying causes for this can be spasticity or impairment of
balance, strength, or proprioception<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
addition, prolongation of response times might affect walking performance, but has received
little attention in the treatment of patients with iSCI.</p><p>It is thought that there is a limitation in the capacity of individuals to process
information received from the environment. When a movement task is in progress, and another
task is concurrently applied, the work required to perform the two tasks at the same time is
called a dual task. If the main task is comparatively simple, a comparatively large amount
of attention can be allocated to the second task. This makes it possible to perform the
second task comparatively quickly. Thus, it is interpreted that a lot of attention resources
are allocation to the second task. Accordingly, when a second task is demanded during
movement task enforcement and the reaction time (RT) for the dual task is relatively short,
it is implied that the main task is performed automatically. This study measure is called
the probe reaction time<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. When the main
task is walking and the second task is a reaction time test, a shorter P-RT implies better
walking performance of subject. A shorter P-RT during walking means less attention is paid
to walking. When walking performance is better, less attention is paid to walking. This is
explained by the allocatable resources theory. The increase in attention results in extra
resources being available and, as long as cognitive effort allocates the resources to the
task, there will be better performance of the task<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. A subject could also pay more attention to prevention of falls.
Thus, a shorter P-RT implies better walking performance.</p><p>The bicycle ergometer, such as Ergo_bike (Daum Electronics, Germany), has been widely
accepted and used in clinical practice. It has been used to improve muscle strength of the
lower extremity and cardiorespiratory capacity, but the movement trajectory on a bicycle
ergometer differs from walking and the training process is boring. The demand on SCI
patients of a bicycle ergometer (muscle strength of the lower extremity; stability of trunk)
is high, and it is still unclear whether or not exercise on a bicycle ergometer improves the
walking ability of iSCI patients. Thus alternate treatment approaches are desirable.</p><p>In response to the therapeutic challenges presented by bicycle ergometers, robotic devices,
such as Lokomat (Hocoma, Inc., Zurich, Switzerland), have recently emerged as a means of
automating locomotor training in SCI rehabilitation. Lokomat provides electromechanically
assisted locomotion with a constant gait pattern, which is externally paced and controlled
by the therapist. It offers some advantages over conventional therapy such as less manpower,
longer training sessions, repetitive stepping pattern, kinematic consistency and higher
intensity training. It has also been shown to promote the plasticity of locomotor pattern
generators at the spinal cord level as well as supraspinal structures<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nevertheless,
despite recent interest in automated locomotor training, there remains very little evidence
to support the superiority of this technique over traditional training.</p><p>To best determine the key parameters of a large-scale study, preliminary data must first be
collected in the form of a pilot study. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate
the immediate effect of Lokomat versus Ergo_bike training, using the P-RT test and 10-m
maximum walking as outcome measures, on the functional recovery of incomplete spinal cord
injury patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SubjectS and Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The subjects were 30 male patients with iSCI (neurological level T8~L3; median time since

Association Impairment Scale (ASIA) as grade D<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subjects were screened before participating in the study
using a medical condition questionnaire. The questionnaire addressed whether or not the
subjects could walk independently or with walking aids, or had bone instability
(non-consolidated bone fracture, unstable spinal column, or severe osteoporosis). It also
addressed whether they had contraindications for Lokomat training: open skin lesion in the
lower extremity and torso, severe fixed contractures, circulatory disease, or arthrodesis
of the hip, knee or ankle joints. If so, they were excluded from the study.</p><p>A physical therapist conducted the clinical examination, which included measurements of
P-RT, the time taken to cover 10&#x02005;m at maximum walking speed and number of steps; walking
velocity, step length and cadence were calculated.</p><p>The P-RT of walking was evaluated using MP3 (SN-F110, Signeo), an IC recorder (ICD-UX70,
Sony) and headphones. The subjects were asked to respond by saying &#x0201c;Pa&#x0201d; as quickly as
possible after hearing an auditory stimulus &#x0201c;Di&#x0201d; stored in the MP3. Both sounds were
recorded by the IC recorder. DigionSound5 sound-processing software was used to calculate
the intervals between the &#x0201c;Di&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Pa&#x0201d; sounds. The mean values of the intervals were used
as the P-RT. Prior to the experiment, the subjects were given an explanation of the
experimental procedure, and they performed trial exercises to familiarize themselves with
the procedure. In the actual experiment, the subject was asked to perform the P-RT test
while walking at a self-determined speed<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The P-RT was measured 10 times consecutively during walking.</p><p>To measure the 10 m walking time, lines were drawn at the 2&#x02005;m and 12&#x02005;m points on a
straight walking track of 14 m, and the time taken walk between the 2&#x02005;m and 12&#x02005;m was
recorded as the walking time. The 10-m walking time of maximum walking speed was measured
2 times and the mean value was used in the analysis.</p><p>The total set-up and treatment time for the Lokomat never exceeded 1 hour. The initial
training speed was 1.5&#x02005;km/h and it was progressively raised to 1.8&#x02005;km/h as quickly as
possible while maintaining gait quality, i.e. symmetrical gait and foot clearance without
knee buckling. The body weight system was initiated at 35%, and 70% guidance force was
provided for the participants. The subjects were given verbal encouragement to actively
step in conjunction with the movement presented by Lokomat.</p><p>The Ergo_bike group subjects were instructed to pedal at a pedaling rate of 45&#x02005;rpm with a
work load of 60 W. The height of the saddle was adjusted to the same level as the greater
trochanter of subjects. The handlebar was adjusted to keep the shoulder joint flexed at
60&#x000b0; to avoid the influence of trunk movements.</p><p>The training time of two groups was 40 minutes. In order to maintain aerobic training,
the heart rate was monitored by a therapist and never exceeded 140 beats per minute. The
work load could be decreased according to heart rate.</p><p>The P-RT and 10-m walking time were measured before and after the intervention for each
group.</p><p>In order to determine the main effect of the 2 intervention methods, one-way analysis of
variance with the Bonferroni correction was used with factors of the P-RT or 10&#x02005;m walking
time. The data were analyzed using SPSS Ver. 17.0 for Windows.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The results for each measurement item are shown in <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of each measurement item before and after the intervention</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">P-RT (ms)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10&#x02005;m Walking Time (s)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">a: Lokomat group-before</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">309.3 &#x000b1; 58.7</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18.6 &#x000b1; 2.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">a&#x0003c;b.d*</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">b: Lokomat group-after</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">207.9 &#x000b1; 44.2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18.1 &#x000b1; 2.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">b&#x0003c;d*</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">c: Ergo_bike group-before</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">299.3 &#x000b1; 51.4</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18.6 &#x000b1; 2.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">c&#x0003c;d**</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">c&#x0003e;d**</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">d: Ergo_bike group-after</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">246.2 &#x000b1; 47.2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18.1 &#x000b1; 2.3</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*p&#x0003c;0.05, **p&#x0003c;0.01</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>. The P-RT and the 10&#x02005;m walking time decreased significantly in the Lokomat
group. Post-intervention, the Lokomat group had a significantly shorter P-RT than the
Ergo_bike group, but there was no difference in the 10&#x02005;m walking time between the Lokomat
group and the Ergo_bike group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This study investigated the immediate effect of exercise using a Lokomat versus Ergo_bike
on the P-RT and walking ability of iSCI patients. The Lokomat group showed not only a
shortened P-RT, but also improved walking ability.</p><p>The P-RT after training was shorter in the Lokomat group. Fast reaction times are essential
for maintaining balance when stepping and walking, and Lokomat training might be especially
beneficial for ambulating iSCI patients, because they already have locomotor constraints.
The study provides new evidence that Lokomat training is more effective than the Ergo_bike
training at shortening the P-RT.</p><p>Future studies are needed to investigate the change in the ambulatory function after a long
period of Lokomat training.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Z&#x000f6;rner</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Blanckenhorn</surname><given-names>WU</given-names></name><name><surname>Dietz</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>EM-SCI Study Group: <article-title>Clinical algorithm for improved
