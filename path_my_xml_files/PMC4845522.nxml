of reactive oxygen species (ROS). N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), an antioxidant that scavenges free radicals, is considered a supplement to alleviate glutathione (GSH) depletion
during oxidative stress. Despite beneficial effects of NAC in other pathological events,
there is no report on the effect of NAC in individuals with varicocele. Therefore, the aim
of this study is to evaluate the outcome of NAC on semen quality, protamine content,
DNA damage, oxidative stress and fertility following varicocelectomy.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This prospective clinical trial included 35 infertile men with
varicocele randomly divided into control (n=20) and NAC (n=15) groups. We assessed
semen parameters, protamine content [chromomycin A3 (CMA3)], DNA integrity [terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)] and oxidative stress [2', 7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein-diacetate (DCFH-DA)] before and three
months after varicocelectomy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Percentage of abnormal semen parameters, protamine deficiency, DNA fragmentation and oxidative stress were significantly decreased in both groups compared to
before surgery. We calculated the percentage of improvement in these parameters compared to before surgery for each group, then compared the results between the groups.
Only percentage of protamine deficiency and DNA fragmentation significantly differed
between the NAC and control groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study, for the first time, revealed that NAC improved

occur in the male reproductive tract (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Molecular
and structural anomalies in this system may
result in male infertility (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The most common
structural anomaly associated with the reproductive
tract is abnormal enlargement of the pampiniform
plexus of veins within the scrotum,
commonly referred to as varicocele (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Although
the association between male infertility
and varicocele has been known since the past
century, a limited number of studies exist that report the molecular and genetic bases of varicocele.
Therefore, further research in this field may
open new strategies for treatment of male infertility
due to varicocele (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>One of the key events in the pathology of varicocele
is excessive production of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Oxidative stress results
from an imbalance between ROS production and
antioxidant capacity (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). However, it is important
to bear in mind that ROS acts as a doubleedged
sword. Although it serves as a key signal
molecule in physiological processes, ROS
also has a role in pathological processes (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In
pathological conditions, two roles have been
envisaged for overproduction of ROS: i. ROS
induced damage to sperm membrane reduces
sperm motility and ability of the sperm to fuse
with the oocyte, and ii. ROS directly damages
sperm DNA and subsequently effects genomic
integrity of the embryo (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Therefore, antioxidant
therapy may overcome the deleterious
effects of ROS in individuals with varicocele
(<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Varicocelectomy, especially through microsurgery,
has been shown to restore testicular
volumes and semen parameters, as well as reduce
the degree of DNA fragmentation (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).
Despite these beneficial effects of varicocelectomy,
fewer studies have focused on the role of
antioxidants as adjunct therapy along with varicocelectomy
(<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) is a derivative of the
naturally occurring amino acid L-cysteine that has
free radical scavenging activity. Therefore, it is
supplemented to alleviate glutathione (GSH) depletion
during oxidative stress (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have shown both <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and
<italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) addition of NAC may improve semen
parameters and thereby improve male fertility.
Despite these beneficial effects of NAC, there
has been no report on the effect of NAC in individuals
with varicocele. Therefore, the aim of this
study is to evaluate the effects of NAC on semen
quality, protamine content, DNA damage, oxidative
stress and fertility following microsurgical
varicocelectomy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This prospective clinical trial carried out between
2011 and 2013, was approved by the Ethics
Committee for Research Involving Human
Subjects at Royan Institute and the Isfahan Fertility
and Infertility Center. All individuals gave
informed consent prior to participation in the
study.</p><sec><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>
Inclusion criteria included male gender, age
younger than 45 years, primary infertility, and
left-sided varicocele (grades II and III) diagnosed
by palpation and Doppler duplex ultrasound. Exclusion
criteria included grade I varicocele, azoospermia,
recurrent varicocele, leukocytospermia,
urogenital infections, testicular size discrepancy,
abnormal hormonal profile, anatomical disorders,
Klinefelter&#x02019;s syndrome, cancer, fever in the 90
days prior to surgery, seminal sperm antibodies,
excessive alcohol and drug consumption, previous
history of scrotal trauma or surgery, and occupational
exposure.</p><p>We included female partners who were less than
35 years of age that had normal ovulatory cycles
and patent tubes (hysterosalpingography or laparoscopy)
in this study. Individuals with endometriosis,
cycle irregularity, or gross anatomical abnormalities
were excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient selection</title><p>This study was designed similar to a blinded
clinical trial. A total of 40 individuals with grades
II and III varicocele enrolled in this study. Following
microsurgery, the patients were randomly
allocated to the control or treatment groups. In the
control group, individuals received no drug after
varicocelectomy (n=20). In the treatment or NAC
group (n=15), the individuals received three tablets
of NAC (200 mg daily) post-varicocelectomy
for three months based on a previous study (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In
this study, five individuals were excluded from
the treatment group due to lack of compliance
with NAC use, according to the study protocol.
All parameters assessed in this study were carried
out by a single trained individual unaware of
treatment assignment. Duration of infertility was
2.1 &#x000b1; 0.2 years and duration of marriage was 3.8
&#x000b1; 0.3 years in individuals with varicocele.</p><p>We initially aimed to include a group in which
the individuals did not want to undergo surgery,
as either a control (without surgery) or treatment (without surgery+NAC) group. However, there
were few individuals that refused to undergo surgery
since the majority of these individuals had
referred for infertility treatment.</p><p>Prior to surgery and at three months post-surgery,
all participants provided semen samples by
masturbation after 3-4 days of abstinence. Semen
samples were analyzed according to World
Health Organization (WHO) criteria (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). After
immobilizing the sperm with a fixing solution,
we evaluated the sperm concentration by
a Makler counting chamber. Sperm were expressed
as million/ml. Sperm motility and morphology
were assessed by the Computer Aided
Sperm Analysis (CASA) system (LABOMED,
SDC313B). Sperm morphology was evaluated
by Diff-Quik staining. DNA fragmentation
and protamine deficiency were assessed with
the TUNEL assay (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and chromomycin A3
(CMA3) staining (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of sperm morphology (Diff-Quik

the slide, allowed to air dry and stained with the
prepared kit (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Briefly, slides were immersed for
30 seconds into methanol (fixative), eosin (stain basic
proteins) and a thiazin-like stain (stain DNA),
respectively. Subsequently, slides were dipped into
water to remove excess dye and allowed to air dry.
We evaluated 200 sperm per slide.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of DNA fragmentation and protamine
deficiency sperm by TUNEL and CMA3
staining</title><p>DNA fragmentation was evaluated with the
aid of a terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferasemediated
dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)
kit (Apoptosis Detection System Fluorescein,
G3250, Promega, Mannheim, Germany) according
to Kheirollahi-Kouhestani et al. (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).
On each slide, 500 sperm were assessed under
an epifluorescent microscope (BX51, Olympus,
Japan) at &#x000d7;100 magnification. Sperm with
red heads were considered to have intact DNA.
Those with green heads were considered to have
fragmented DNA.</p><p>The percentage of sperm with protamine deficiency
was assessed with CMA3 staining, according
to Nasr-Esfahani et al. (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). On each
slide, we assessed 500 sperm under an epifluorescent
microscope (BX51, Olympus, Japan) at
&#x000d7;100 magnifications. Those sperm that stained
light yellow were considered as CMA3 positive
or protamine deficient; however, sperm that
stained dark yellow were considered to have normal
protamine content.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of reactive oxidative species by
DCFH-DA</title><p>ROS status was assessed using a 2', 7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein-
diacetate (DCFH-DA, D6883,
Sigma Co., USA) probe according to Kiani-Esfahani
et al. (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Briefly, a 2.5 mM stock solution
of H2DCF-DA was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide
and stored at -70&#x000b0;C. A total of one million sperm
were treated with 5 &#x003bc;M H2DCFDA for 30 minutes,
while percentages of ROS positive sperm
were defined by flow cytometery.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The Kolmogorov-Smirnov Z test was used to assess
normal data distribution. The student&#x02019;s t test
was carried out using the Statistical Package for the
Social Studies (SPSS11.5, Chicago, IL, USA). For
comparison between control and NAC groups, we
used the independent t test. For comparison between
the preand post-surgery in control and NAC groups,
the paired t test was used. The differences with values
of P&#x0003c;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The study population consisted of 35 individuals
with grades II and III varicocele. The
mean ages of male participants was 30.1 &#x000b1; 4.4

4.9 (range: 17-35) years. During this study, individuals
with varicocele were randomly assigned
to control (non-NAC) and NAC groups.
In order to show that there were no significant
differences between the two groups before treatments,
the sperm parameters between control and
NAC groups were compared. The results showed
no significant difference between the two groups
(<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Age range of females (27.4 &#x000b1; 5.7 vs.

heavy metal poisoning, overdose with acetaminophen
and epilepsy (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>The results of this study showed that sperm
parameters (concentration, motility and normal
morphology) significantly improved after surgery
compared to before surgery in both the NAC
and control groups, with the exception of the
percentage sperm motility which insignificantly
improved in the control group. Despite controversies
on the degree of improvement of each semen
parameters post-varicocelectomy (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), this
insignificant improvement of motility in the control
group was consistent with previous reports
(<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). However, the results of this study suggested
that NAC might have an additional value by improving
sperm motility post-varicocelectomy. In
contrast to these results, Comhaire et al. (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) reported
that although NAC improved sperm concentration
and acrosome reaction, it had no effect
on motility and morphology.</p><p>Despite the importance of semen parameters in
fertility, many researchers have suggested that other
sperm function characteristics should be considered
along with these parameters when assessing
fertility (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Therefore, in this study, we have
assessed genomic integrity and ROS production.</p><p>Sperm DNA becomes susceptible to damage by
three postulated routes: i. Improper packaging of
DNA during spermiogenesis, ii. Oxidative stress
and iii. Apoptosis (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). We have assessed DNA
damage, ROS production and sperm nuclear maturity
before and after surgery in the NAC and control
groups. Of note, all parameters improved after
surgery in both groups, except for the percentage
of ROS negative sperm in the control group. The percentage of sperm motility did not significantly
improve before and after surgery in the control
group. Therefore, this lack of significant improvement
in motility post-surgery in the control group
might be related to the lack of significant improvement
in percentage of ROS negative sperm. In addition,
the improved sperm motility in the NAC
group was associated with a reduced percentage
of sperm producing ROS or increased percentage
of ROS negative sperm, which might be related to
NAC treatment. The existence of this correlation
might be explained by the cascade of events that
begin with ROS associated with lipid peroxidation
(<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), which in turn, reduces membrane fluidity.
This prevents axonemal protein phosphorylation
and leads to sperm immobilization (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). NAC
may break these chains of events.</p><p>In this study, there was higher mean ROS intensity
in semen samples after surgery compared to
before surgery. This contrasted expectations since
ROS production should decrease post-surgery.
This was likely due to leakage of ROS or reduced
production of ROS after loss of enzymes in the
sperm of these individuals, which were in their final
stage of apoptosis. This supposition has been
previously presented by Aitken et al. (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) who reported
that initially ROS positive sperm progressively
become TUNEL positive. This indicated
that in individuals with varicocele, despite higher
production of ROS, the ROS might leak from
these cells or sperm in the final stage of apoptosis,
hence the enzymes that produced ROS were not as
efficient. This might account for the reduced intensity
of ROS.</p><p>In order to further differentiate between the role
of surgery and antioxidant therapy, we calculated
the percentage of improvement relative to before
surgery for sperm parameters, sperm protamine
content, DNA integrity, and ROS in each group
and compared them between the NAC and control
groups. The percentage of improvement was calculated
by the difference between the mean values
of a parameter before and after surgery divided
by its initial value before surgery. The results revealed
no significant difference for percentage of
improvement for the semen parameters between
the NAC and control groups. However, among the
sperm functional parameters assessed, the percentage
of improvement for the normal protamine content
and DNA fragmentation significantly differed
between the NAC and control groups, despite no
initial difference between the two groups before
surgery. These results suggested that despite the
similar process of surgery in the two groups, the
difference between percentages of improvement
in the two groups was due to antioxidant activity
of NAC. Possibly other etiological factors might
account for this difference, which were improved
by NAC, or NAC might overcome the secondary
side effects of surgery. However, the role of NAC
on its own in treatment of varicocele has yet to be
elucidated.</p><p>Despite the higher rate of pregnancy in the NAC
group compared to the control group, we did not
compare clinical pregnancy rates between the
groups. Due to the limited number of cases, further
study would be warranted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>NAC can scavenge free radicals, increase GSH
production and reduce disulfide bonds, as well as
viscosity and elasticity of semen, which are important
for fertility. This, in conjunction with the results
of the current study (improved sperm parameters,
DNA integrity and chromatin packaging),
may account for the higher pregnancy rate in NAC
group. In order to reach this conclusion, additional
studies are recommended.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors express their gratitude to Royan Institute
