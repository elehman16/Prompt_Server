The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of rupatadine (RUP) versus desloratadine (DES) in subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR).</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>To assess the efficacy and safety of RUP in SAR in comparison with placebo (PL) and DES. A randomized, double-blind, multicenter, international, and PL-controlled study was carried out. The main selection criteria included SAR patients over 12 years old with a positive prick test to a relevant seasonal allergen for the geographic area. Symptomatic patients at screening with a nasal symptom sum score of &#x02265;6 points (nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, sneezing, and nasal pruritus), a non-nasal score of &#x02265;3 points (ocular pruritus, ocular redness, and tearing eyes), and a rhinorrhea score of &#x02265;2 points with laboratory test results and electrocardiography within acceptable limits were included in the study. Change from baseline in the total symptom-score (T7SS) over the 4-week treatment period (reflective evaluation) was considered the primary efficacy variable. Secondary efficacy measures included total nasal symptom score (T4NSS) and conjunctival symptom score (T3NNSS), both of which are reflective and instantaneous evaluations. Furthermore questions related to quality of life (eg, sleep disturbances or impairment of daily activities) have also been evaluated. Safety was assessed according to adverse events reported, as well as laboratory and electrocardiography controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 379 patients were randomized, of which 356 were included and allocated to PL (n = 122), RUP (n = 117), or DES (n = 117). Mean change of T7SS over the 4-week treatment period was significantly reduced in the RUP (&#x02013;46.1%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.03) and DES (&#x02013;48.9%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.01) groups, compared with PL. Similarly, RUP and DES were comparable and significantly superior to PL for all secondary endpoints, including nasal and conjunctival symptoms and patients&#x02019; and investigator&#x02019;s overall clinical opinions. Symptom score evaluation (both reflective and instantaneous evaluations) throughout the treatment period showed a progressive and maintained significant improvement with both treatments at day 7 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01), day 14 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.007), and day 21 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01) in comparison with PL. Adverse events were scarce and were similar in both treatment groups. Electrocardiography (QTc) and lab test results did not show any relevant findings</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>RUP is a very good choice for SAR due to its contribution to the improvement of nasal (including obstruction) and non-nasal symptoms to a similar degree as DES.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>allergic rhinitis</kwd><kwd>seasonal</kwd><kwd>H1-antihistamines</kwd><kwd>rupatadine</kwd><kwd>desloratadine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an increasingly prevalent disease in the majority of developed countries, affecting 23%&#x02013;30% of the general population in Europe.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-jaa-6-031">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-jaa-6-031">3</xref> In some countries it is now approaching epidemic proportions and is becoming a significant public health concern.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-jaa-6-031">4</xref> AR affects patients of all ages and ethnic groups, causes major illness like predisposal to asthma and disability worldwide, and affects an individual&#x02019;s social life, sleep, school, and work.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-jaa-6-031">5</xref> AR still remains undermanaged and an analysis of both control and clearly defined severity phenotypes may help contribute to better therapy approaches.</p><p>Second generation oral H1-antihistamines have been the traditional first-line therapy in the treatment of ARs against symptoms mediated by histamine (rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal itching, and eye symptoms), but they have been less effective with nasal congestion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-jaa-6-031">6</xref> The primary goal of treating patients with AR is to provide symptomatic relief. At the present time, the market is flooded with a lot of similar H1 compounds, and physicians are overwhelmed with such a great amount of promotional literature that has scarce comparative data among the different therapeutic agents.</p><p>Rupatadine is a powerful once-daily nonsedating H1 antihistamine.

Furthermore, the QTc interval values (milliseconds) after Bazzet&#x02019;s correction had to be normal (not prolonged). The values considered to be normal were ,430 milliseconds for males and ,450 milliseconds for females.</p><p>Patients were selected for randomization based on reflective self-assessments on a screening diary card completed within the last 3 consecutive days, where they were required to present a nasal discharge sum score &#x02265; 12, a total nasal sum score &#x02265; 36, and a total non-nasal sum score &#x02265; 18. Additionally if a patient was on a regularly scheduled immunotherapy or who had mild asthma symptoms that were being treated with inhaled bronchodilators, he or she was allowed to be included in the study. Finally, women of childbearing age had to have a negative pregnancy test and use contraceptive measures.</p><p>Patients suffering from non-AR (eg, vasomotor, infectious, or drug-induced rhinitis) or with a negative prick test were not included. Patients being treated with nasal decongestants in the previous 24 hours, oral antihistamines, or disodium cromoglicate (in the previous week), ketotifen (in the previous month), topical antihistamines (in the previous 48 hours), systemic or topical treatment with corticosteroids (except for topical hydrocortisone &#x0003c; 1%), immunosuppressants, or any investigational drug within 2 weeks prior to inclusion, were also excluded. Other relevant exclusion criteria included abnormal laboratory values of clinical significance, certain conditions that may interfere with response to treatment such as: mild asthma treated with inhaled bronchodilators or inhaled corticosteroids &#x0003e; 800 mcg/day of budesonide or beclomethasone; with &#x0003e;.500 mcg/day of fluticasone; obstructive nasal polyps; or hypersensitivity to compounds structurally related to the study drug.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of efficacy on symptoms score</title><p>At the screening visit, patients were instructed by the investigator to self-evaluate their scores via the daily diary twice each day, first in the morning just before taking medication and approximately 12 hours later, in the evening. Both evaluations should be reflective, based on the patient&#x02019;s evaluation of symptom severity in the previous 12 hours, and based on the score at the time of recording, which took place at the same time as the patient&#x02019;s evaluation.</p><p>Each patient received a diary card for the daily recording of symptoms at the start of the treatment. Severity scores for seven (T7SS) individual AR signs/symptoms; nasal (nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, sneezing, and nasal pruritus) and non-nasal symptoms (ocular pruritus, ocular redness, and tearing eyes) were recorded on the diary card and scored numerically on a scale from 0&#x02013;3, where 0 indicates no symptoms present, 1 indicates mild symptoms (occasionally present, but not troublesome), 2 indicates moderate symptoms (frequently present and annoying), and 3 indicates severe symptoms (continuously present and interfering with work or sleep).</p><p>The investigators examined the patients&#x02019; diary cards at each follow-up visit (days 14 &#x000b1; 3 and 28 &#x000b1; 3) to check treatment compliance and to give any advice as necessary.</p><p>Change from baseline in the total patient symptom score (T7SS) over the 4-week treatment period (reflective evaluation) was considered the primary efficacy variable. Furthermore, secondary variables were also calculated: the change from baseline in the T7SS over the 4-week treatment period (instantaneous evaluation), change from baseline in the total nasal symptom score (T4NSS) and non-nasal symptom score (T3NNSS), which are both reflective and instantaneous evaluations.</p></sec><sec><title>Subject&#x02019;s and investigator&#x02019;s evaluation of therapeutic response</title><p>The subject&#x02019;s and investigator&#x02019;s evaluation of therapeutic response to treatment at 2 and 4 weeks was also assessed.

These percentages of symptom reductions associated with placebo and desloratadine are very close to those obtained in a recent clinical study using a similar methodology and conducted in similar participating countries among SAR patients in a shorter period of evaluation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-jaa-6-031">15</xref> It is also remarkable that the improvement in symptoms from baseline were observed among the placebo group of &#x0003e;35% across all symptoms, including ocular symptoms, considering that the baseline values of this group were similar to those of the active treatments. This observation is not unusual since it has been previously described with other anti-H1 compounds in clinical trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-jaa-6-031">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-jaa-6-031">17</xref> However, in spite of the remarkable placebo effect, the difference between the placebo and active groups was significant, as soon as in the first 5 days and, more importantly, it remained significant both at 2 and 4 weeks for the primary and in many of the relevant secondary endpoints.</p><p>Both rupatadine and desloratadine improved both investigator and patients&#x02019; therapeutic response assessments compared to placebo at 4 weeks. Furthermore, there were no differences among the treatment groups in the assessment of sleep disturbances. The use of rupatadine 10 mg presented with a lower impairment of daily activities than placebo at the final visit, with no differences noted when compared to desloratadine 5 mg.</p><p>The close similarity between rupatadine and desloratadine had been expected in relation to the findings in the previous studies reported with SAR patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-jaa-6-031">18</xref> The findings of this study are in accordance with previous meta-analysis with desloratadine in comparison with placebo, involving several controlled clinical trials with higher degrees of variability.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-jaa-6-031">19</xref> Nevertheless, direct comparisons involving large samples are relatively infrequent in the literature,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-jaa-6-031">20</xref> and overall, there were no results significantly favoring levocetirizine or fexofenadine over desloratadine in terms of their effects on AR symptoms.</p><p>Despite the actual preference of Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma classification, no previous studies with desloratadine or rupatadine were released before 2006 in patients with intermittent or persistent AR that could determine the efficacy based on the duration of the severity of symptoms and their impact on quality of life.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-jaa-6-031">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-jaa-6-031">23</xref> When this study was designed, the AR patients were involved accordingly with the traditional classification of SAR given that the sample size being estimated was only being based on previous studies with SAR patients reported with desloratadine and rupatadine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-jaa-6-031">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-jaa-6-031">27</xref> Nevertheless, desloratadine, rupatadine, and levocetirizine are the only anti-H1 compounds that have been shown to be effective and safe under this Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma classification.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-jaa-6-031">28</xref></p><p>From the point of view of safety, it can be concluded that the overall incidence of related adverse events with rupatadine was similar to the incidence of adverse events in patients treated with placebo and desloratadine. The electrocardiography analysis of the QTc parameters conducted in the study yielding findings that were similar between both anti-H1 compounds, and these were consistent with those findings observed in studies examining rupatadine in the evaluation of cardiac safety in humans following the most recent recommendations on this matter.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-jaa-6-031">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-jaa-6-031">30</xref></p><p>In the present study, which was conducted in adolescents and adults, we have demonstrated that the daily administration of rupatadine is significantly more effective than placebo in relieving the symptoms of SAR throughout the 4 weeks of treatment. Given that rupatadine significantly improves the nasal and ocular symptoms of AR suggests that this agent may have significant advantages in addressing a wide range of rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Study participants</title><p>France: Francois Wessel, Montserrat Angell-Perello, Laurent Fouquert, Sylvie Huet Francoise Sanquer.
