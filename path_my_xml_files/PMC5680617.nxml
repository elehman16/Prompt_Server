This study aimed to determine the effects of tetracaine 0.5% on changes in heartbeat and heart rhythm, hemodynamic changes during surgery, intraoperative bleeding, and pain after septoplasty surgery. The irregular double-blind clinical trial registry of clinical trials Iran with the code number (IRCT: 20150526625N8) in the first half of 2013 on 86 patients in Kashani hospital of Shahrekord. Having selected and matched the patients were divided into two groups. Case group was dropped tetracaine 0.5% in each of the nasal cavity 15 min before the beginning of the operation. The control group was dropped distilled water 15 min preoperation in each of the nasal cavity. The surgery lasted about 30&#x02013;60 min. Clinical symptoms were evaluated after anesthetic induction as well as pain using the visual analog scale after the operation, in the recovery room. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS version software 17 through independent <italic>t</italic>-test, Chi-square, and repeated measures variance analysis. Postoperative pain intensity in the experimental group compared to the control group was significantly lower than the control group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05); however, blood pressure and heart rate during anesthesia, there was no difference between groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). Based on the findings, intake of tetracaine drop 0.5% has no impact on some hemodynamic changes during septoplasty operation. However, compared with the control group, pain was significantly reduced.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Blood pressure</kwd><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>pulse rate</kwd><kwd>septoplasty</kwd><kwd>tetracaine 0.5%</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The nasal septum repair surgery is so-called septoplasty. Septoplasty can be performed with general anesthesia or intravenous sedation or by means of local anesthesia. Operative problems, including heart rate and blood pressure changes are due to the manipulation of area of surgery, since area of surgery has lots of nerve through the autonomic system and submucosal adrenaline and phenylephrine drop are commonly used to reduce bleeding during surgery that it causes changes in heart rate and predisposing patient to cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The use of appropriate topical anesthesia is high significance in patient satisfaction, reduced bleeding, and safety of surgery.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] One of the methods used in septoplasty surgery is local anesthesia without general anesthesia. The advantage of this method is not to require general anesthesia and to reduce bleeding.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Tetracaine is a local anesthetic, which is highly effective and has been commonly used for eye surgery for many years.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Tetracaine cause to control the passage of sodium through the cell membrane in competition with the calcium perfused on the nerve membrane receptors and to reduce action potential depolarization phase. This impacts started by reversible stabilizing of the nerve cell membranes, and consequently reducing the permeability of this membrane to sodium ions, and stop the conductivity of nerve impulses. Besides, its injections are used for spinal, epidural, peripheral nerve blockage, epineurium, and the lower extremities.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Tetracaine dose is 0.1&#x02013;0.2 mg/kg and the duration time is 90&#x02013;200 min.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Few side effects have been reported for tetracaine with therapeutic doses. However, if the patient has symptoms of poisoning such as seizures, vertigo, tinnitus, tremor or trembling, nervousness or unusual restlessness, vomiting will be occurred.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Of the benefits of anesthetic tetracaine can point out to its fast-acting, long-term, having low-risk of methemoglobinemia as well as strong anesthetic properties comparing other local anesthetics.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] A study suggested the use of this drug in the nasal endoscopic surgery in their study.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Surgical repair of the nasal septum (septoplasty) is one of the high-risk surgerys because it is the place where nerve manipulation of the automated system is occurred. Any stimulation of this area causes significant changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Since to have peripheral vision, bleeding is needed to be few during surgery, so vasoconstrictor compounds such as adrenaline and phenylephrine is used. These compounds trigger to increase heart rate and blood pressure due to their high absorption. These factors are the main causes of irregular heartbeat and potential incidence of tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. One proper solution is the use of anesthetic drops having good mucosal absorption. Which reduces painful nerve stimulation, to prevent high blood pressure and heart rate and reduces post-surgery restlessness of patient in the recovery room? Regarding the cases mentioned in this study, we aimed to assess the effects of tetracaine 0.5% on hemodynamic changes during surgery and postoperative septoplasty pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>The irregular double-blind clinical trial registry of clinical trials Iran with the code number (IRCT20150526625N8) in the first half of 2013 on 86 patients in Kashani hospital of Shahrekord University of medical sciences was performed.

For maintenance of anesthesia of propofol 5 mg/kg/h was used. Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded every 5 min until the end of anesthesia.</p><p>At the end of surgery and anesthesia, patients were transferred to the recovery room and 30 min after the transition to recovery pain scores were determined using visual analog scale (VAS).
