We conducted a prospective, randomized double-blind study in 40 Parkinson disease patients at Hoehn &#x00026; Yahr stages 1.5 to 3 who were either assigned to monthly bee venom injections or equivalent volumes of saline (treatment/placebo group: n = 20/20). The primary objective of this study was to assess a potential symptomatic effect of s.c. bee venom injections (100 &#x003bc;g) compared to placebo 11 months after initiation of therapy on United Parkinson&#x02019;s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III scores in the &#x000ab; off &#x000bb; condition pre-and post-injection at a 60 minute interval. Secondary objectives included the evolution of UPDRS III scores over the study period and [123I]-FP-CIT scans to evaluate disease progression. Finally, safety was assessed by monitoring specific IgE against bee venom and skin tests when necessary. After an 11 month period of monthly administration, bee venom did not significantly decrease UPDRS III scores in the &#x000ab; off &#x000bb; condition. Also, UPDRS III scores over the study course, and nuclear imaging, did not differ significantly between treatment groups. Four patients were excluded during the trial due to positive skin tests but no systemic allergic reaction was recorded. After an initial increase, specific IgE against bee venom decreased in all patients completing the trial. This study did not evidence any clear symptomatic or disease-modifying effects of monthly bee venom injections over an 11 month period compared to placebo using a standard bee venom allergy desensitization protocol in Parkinson disease patients. However, bee venom administration appeared safe in non-allergic subjects. Thus, we suggest that higher administration frequency and possibly higher individual doses of bee venom may reveal its potency in treating Parkinson disease.</p><sec id="sec001"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01341431">NCT01341431</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>France Parkinson GAO 2011</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hartmann</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>DRCD Programme Booster by APHP patent office</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hartmann</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the DRCD (Programme &#x02018;Booster&#x02019;, APHP patent office), by France Parkinson (Grand Appel d&#x02019;Offre 2011) and by funding from the program &#x0201c;Investissements d&#x02019;Avenir&#x0201d; ANR-10-IAIHU-06.

This, in turn, modifies the activity of basal ganglia output structures [<xref rid="pone.0158235.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Therefore, symptomatic therapies in PD aim at either repleting dopamine or normalising basal ganglia activity, for instance by high frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) or the subthalamic nucleus (STN). The holy grail, however, remains the development of neuroprotective strategies to slow degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons and thus disease progression, at least with regard to the motor triad. We propose that bee venom may exert both symptomatic and neuroprotective effects in PD.</p><p>Regarding potential neuroprotective effects of bee venom, hyperpolarization of midbrain dopaminergic neurons resulting from blockade of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated small conductance K<sup>+</sup> (SK) channels by the bee venom toxin apamin partially rescues dopaminergic neurons from their spontaneous demise in dissociated mesencephalic cultures [<xref rid="pone.0158235.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Apamin is the only polypeptide neurotoxin contained in bee venom to pass the blood-brain-barrier when injected peripherally (18 aa peptide) and irreversibly blocks SK channels [<xref rid="pone.0158235.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These channels (subtypes 1&#x02013;3) are present in various neuronal populations throughout the central nervous system and play a major role in the control of the switch between tonic and burst firing in physiological conditions [<xref rid="pone.0158235.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. SK3 channels can be detected on nigral dopaminergic neurons. Taken together, this suggests that SK channel blockade of dopaminergic neurons not only controls their firing pattern but ultimately, their survival [<xref rid="pone.0158235.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Regarding the hypothesis that bee venom might exert acute, symptomatic effects on PD motor symptoms, we suggest that these are not be due to striatal dopamine release only. In 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated (MPTP) mice [<xref rid="pone.0158235.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats [<xref rid="pone.0158235.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], bee venom and/or apamin raise striatal dopamine levels but the kinetics of this increase are likely long-term as well as short-term. Therefore, a complementary option is that blockade of SK channels downstream of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system, i.e. on basal ganglia relay or output nuclei may mediate motor effects. Indeed, SK2 receptors are present on GABAergic substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr) and glutamatergic subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons [<xref rid="pone.0158235.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and bee venom restores the balance between inhibitory and excitatory influence exerted by the striatum and the STN on SNpr cells following dopaminergic transmission interruption by neuroleptics injection, thereby normalising basal ganglia output activity [<xref rid="pone.0158235.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This effect is almost identical with that observed following DBS of the STN in rats [<xref rid="pone.0158235.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Several recent studies have adressed the potential use of bee venom therapy in PD models and PD patients [<xref rid="pone.0158235.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158235.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158235.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158235.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158235.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158235.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158235.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

Thyroid uptake was blocked before the scan by administration of potassium perchlorate (400 mg orally). One hundred and twenty projections were acquired for 30 minutes in a 128 x 128 matrix.

Also, UPDRS III scores over the course of 11 months, and nuclear imaging, did not evolve significantly differently between both treatment groups. LED increased less in the bee venom group compared to placebo but again, differences between both groups failed to reach significance. Finally, motor fluctuations and dyskinesia remained unaffected by bee venom treatment over the study period.</p><p>One other clinical study has investigated the potential symptomatic effect of bee venom on PD symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0158235.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Using bee venom acupuncture twice a week for eight weeks at 10 acupuncture points (compared to an acupuncture group without bee venom and a control group), a significant decrease of UPDRS III scores from 15.0 to 10.0 points was observed (17.0 to 13.0 in the acupuncture group, n = 13, p&#x0003c;0.05; 13.0 to 13.0 in the control group, n = 9). However, this study is hardly comparable to ours as it remains unclear to what extent acupuncture and bee venom contributed respectively to this effect. Also, the quantities of bee venom used were not quantified in micrograms (0.01 mL bee venom diluted to 0.005% at each injection point) and it thus remains unclear how much product was actually injected.</p><p>Cognition as assessed by the MMS appeared to be slightly enhanced under bee venom but not significantly compared to placebo. Although the MMS is a rough tool to investigate cognitive function, it is interesting to note that hippocampal SK channel blockade has been suggested to enhance cognitive performance [<xref rid="pone.0158235.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0158235.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Recently, in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, apamin i.p. has been shown to display pro-cognitive effects, in addition to reversing motor deficits and attenuating anxiety-related behavior [<xref rid="pone.0158235.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Surprisingly, the ADL subscores on the PDQ-39 scale improved significantly over the study period in the placebo group compared to the bee venom group. We can only speculate about the reasons for these changes given that they do not correlate with motor scores. Most likely, the local inflammatory reactions frequently observed after bee venom injections may contribute to this effect. As such, they were generally not debilitating but nonetheless anxiogenic since patients usually wished to know whether these reactions were due to bee venom or not, a question we were of course unable to answer during the study period due to blinding.</p><p>The decrease of amplitude of rest, positional and action tremor using the segmental rating scale in the placebo group was equally unexpected. At baseline, patients in the placebo group had more severe postural and kinetic tremor than those who were to be treated with bee venom. We suppose that the difference at the end of the study between the groups is partly due to a floor effect among patients who received bee venom and had milder tremor. In addition to more severe positional and kinetic tremor, at baseline control patients had higher Hoehn and Yahr stages, higher UPDRS III ratings, higher LED, lower scores on the Schwab and England scale, and a longer duration of manifest PD. We therefore think that patients in the control group were slightly more affected. Possibly as a consequence, LED showed a trend towards higher increase over the study period among control patients.</p><p>Regarding safety, despite the production of specific IgE antibodies in response to bee venom injection, no clinical symptoms of allergy were detected. The protocol we used seems safe and was consistent with the highest dose recommended by the manufacturer for immunotherapy, 100 &#x003bc;g in a single injection. About 45% of patients produced IgE before the third injection and the remainders after. The peak of IgE synthesis was observed after the fifth injection in half of patients and IgG4 production began subsequently to be detected in half of patients after the sixth injection. Thus, early in the immune response a critical phase may exist which may cause allergy with clinical symptoms. However, over time, a balance in the level of specific IgE and IgG4 antibodies is induced. This phenomenon explains the desensitization of allergic patients treated by immunotherapy and may also put to rest fears of using bee venom in non-allergic subjects, which is a important finding as such and paves the way for future studies.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, because of safety concerns, we stuck to a typical desensitization protocol for allergies against bee venom. To achieve more potent effects of bee venom, it is likely necessary to increase the dosage and/or to decrease the injection interval, for instance to at least fortnightly or even weekly injections. In traditional apitherapy with live bees (personal communications), patients are treated weekly or bi-weekly with up to four stings per session which makes for a comparative dose 16 times higher than the one used in our study. Also, in a randomized cross-over trial of bee stings in multiple sclerosis, patients were stung by up to 20 bees three times per week, pushing the comparative dose to 90 times that used in our study [<xref rid="pone.0158235.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]; note that in this study, no allergic reactions occurred in the 25 patients who completed the trial over a 6 month period. However, no routine IgE monitoring or STs were performed. Finally, in our own MPTP mouse study, bee venom was administered twice weekly with dosages of 120 &#x003bc;g/kg body weight, thereby ranging up to 100 times higher than in humans [<xref rid="pone.0158235.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Second, based on the observed results, the study was underpowered. When we planned the study, we overestimated the difference between groups. The observed size effect was 0.14 while we planned the study with a size effect equal to one. Regarding drop outs, it must be underlined that these patients were excluded based on very and possibly overly strict safety concerns (see above) as no allergic reactions actually occurred. However, to avoid any preventable risk, we decided to be extremely conservative in our exclusion policy. Third and lastly, patients in the bee venom group were less severely affected than the patients in the placebo group, which might have distorted/diminished possible treatment effects.</p><p>As bee venom is a potentially lethal substance in case of an anaphylactic reaction, two options appear feasible to design a safer substance: first, to use apamin as a monotherapy. However, apamin is currently not licensed for any medical condition and would therefore have to undergo phase I toxicology testing before a phase II trial could be considered. Of note, animal data suggest that the therapeutic range of apamin may be narrower as a single substance than when embedded in whole bee venom. In MPTP-treated mice, high dose apamin treatment induced motor symptoms akin to tremor or dyskinesia [<xref rid="pone.0158235.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In SK3-deficient mice, symptoms reminiscent of psychosis could be observed [<xref rid="pone.0158235.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Also, apamin seemed to induce less neuroprotective effects than whole bee venom in our mouse study, suggesting that other components of bee venom might contribute to this effect [<xref rid="pone.0158235.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. One candidate, for instance, is mellitin which has been shown to slow motor neuron degeneration in a murine amyotrophic lateral sclerosis model [<xref rid="pone.0158235.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, an alternative strategy might be to remove the allergens from bee venom. The most potent allergens in bee venom is phospolipase A<sub>2</sub>, followed by hyaluronidase and icarapin [<xref rid="pone.0158235.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Also, weaker allergens such as mellitin or ingredients whose allergenicity remain unknown (vitellogenin) are present in bee venom [<xref rid="pone.0158235.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Thus, allergen removal is probably a challenging process. Moreover, it cannot be excluded that these also contribute to potential symptomatic and/or neuroprotective effects of bee venom [<xref rid="pone.0158235.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>In summary, our study did not evidence any clear symptomatic or disease-modifying effects of monthly bee venom injections over an 11 month period compared to placebo using a standard bee venom allergy desensitization protocol in PD patients. Of note, bee venom administration appeared safe in non-allergic patients. Given the increasingly strong preclinical rationale that SK channel blockade may be beneficial in treating PD short and long term, we believe that a larger study with less stringent exclusion criteria regarding IgE levels and ST is warranted.
