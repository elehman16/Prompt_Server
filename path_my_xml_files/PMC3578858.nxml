Previous studies are consistent in describing pronounced anatomical and functional connectivity between the PMC and the primary motor cortex (M1). Lesion studies consistently show compensatory adaptive changes in PMC neural activity following an M1 lesion. Non-invasive brain modification of PMC neural activity has shown compensatory neurophysiological aftereffects in M1. These studies have contributed to our understanding of how M1 responds to changes in PMC neural activity.

In macaque monkeys it has been shown that transient pharmacological PMC inhibition following functional recovery after ibotenic acid M1 lesions severely inhibited motor performance <xref rid="pone.0057425-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. A similar effect can be observed in humans: inhibition of the ipsi- or contralesional dorsal PMC after M1 ischemic lesions inhibits motor performance <xref rid="pone.0057425-JohansenBerg1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057425-Fridman1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Furthermore, functional imaging studies confirm that behavorial compensation after M1 lesions depends strongly on the PMC activity <xref rid="pone.0057425-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057425-Ward1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057425-Lang1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Thus, several non-invasive brain stimulation studies have specifically investigated the relationship between PMC and M1 regions after single-pulse, inhibitory or facilitatory stimulation of the PMC to disclose the electrophysiological properties of interregional pathways mediating aforementioned effects <xref rid="pone.0057425-Boros1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0057425-Teitti1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The studies have consistently found strong connectivity between the PMC and M1 regions. The results strongly suggest the existence of a pathway targeting an interneuron network within M1 facilitating its corticospinal output. Other studies have established the behavioral consequences of M1 inhibitory stimulation for motor performance <xref rid="pone.0057425-Nitsche1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057425-Vines1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057425-Lang1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and interhemispheric interactions between bilateral primary motor areas <xref rid="pone.0057425-Lang2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057425-Nitsche2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Finally, lesion studies in animals and humans have consistently shown the significant role that the PMC plays in compensating for lost M1 functionality. In contrast, the compensatory changes in the PMC following the artificial inhibition of M1 neural activity and the behavioral consequences remain to be investigated. The structural basis for compensatory interactions can be found in (1) the vast array of interconnections between M1 and the PMC as well as in (2) corticospinal output neurons within the PMC <xref rid="pone.0057425-Teitti1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>Many aspects of the significance of the association between the PMC and M1 regions remain unresolved <xref rid="pone.0057425-Kantak1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057425-Swayne2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057425-Rehme2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. For example, Johansen-Berg et al. find that post-stroke motor performance depends on PMC activity in the contralesional hemisphere <xref rid="pone.0057425-JohansenBerg2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> while Fridman et al. provide evidence that ipsilesional PMC activation is beneficial and that contralesional regions make no substantial contribution <xref rid="pone.0057425-Fridman2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Yet, Nelles et al. report that ipsilesional PMC activity can be either beneficial or disadvantageous <xref rid="pone.0057425-Nelles1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. A possible reason for these divergent findings could be that the amount of deficit plays a critical role in a time-dependent manner <xref rid="pone.0057425-Swayne1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057425-Dancause1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057425-Fridman1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Swayne et al., based on lesion data obtained from stroke patients, proposed a multistage model of motor network compensation <xref rid="pone.0057425-Swayne2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The model suggests that ipsilateral premotor function can only sufficiently compensate for lost M1 functionality in cases of mild impairment. Stepwise processes can recruit contralateral motor areas depending on the amount of deficit <xref rid="pone.0057425-Swayne1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Similarly, a recent study also performed on stroke patients by Rehme et al. has shown how non-affected primary and secondary motor regions change their interaction patterns, i.e. facilitatory or inhibitory, over time <xref rid="pone.0057425-Rehme1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. This being said, evidence for time-dependency following non-invasive brain stimulation has also been found in a study on healthy test subjects by Lang et al. <xref rid="pone.0057425-Lang3" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. They investigated the temporal dynamics of tDCS induced net aftereffects in and between the bilateral primary motor cortices. They show that the aftereffects on interhemispheric inhibition and the intracortical excitability are time-dependent since local intracortical measures outlast changes in interhemispheric transmission <xref rid="pone.0057425-Lang2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Despite general similarities, clearly the underlying mechanisms must be assumed to be at least partially different to those seen in lesion studies since the timescale and intervention strength of tDCS does not allow for structural changes <xref rid="pone.0057425-Dum1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>In summary, studies on patients clearly suggest there is an adaptation of the ipsilesional PMC to an M1 lesion that has significant behavioral consequences. However, it remains unclear whether the adaptation is beneficial or disadvantageous. Pathways with different impacts on M1 excitability have been identified in brain stimulation studies. Knowledge of these pathways is relevant to understanding the aforementioned M1-PMC interactions after an M1 lesion. However, the response of M1 and PMC pathways to systematically modified M1 excitability has not been studied. Moreover, none of these studies have related their electrophysiological findings to measures of motor function. Thus, our primary objective was to inhibit M1 neural activity and to study the effect this intervention has on PMC excitability, M1-PMC interaction, and motor performance in healthy test subjects. To address changes in intracortical circuitry and cortical excitability we focused on paired-pulse and input-output TMS protocols. To address the temporal dynamics, in line with a multistage hypothesis, we compared split-half results from a well-established 0 to 40 with a 40 to 80 minute &#x02018;late-phase&#x02019; time window. Motor performance was measured by finger-tapping speed. We found that cathodal tDCS inhibition of M1 leads to enhanced PMC excitability associated with changes in motor performance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics approval</title><p>This study was approved by the Ethics Commission of the Charit&#x000e9; Universitit&#x000e4;tsmedizin - Berlin and conformed to the <italic>Declaration of Helsinki</italic>.

All of the sessions took place at approximately the same time of day and the participants were asked to have had a sufficient night's rest before the experiments were conducted since the time spent awake has recently been shown to possibly affect susceptibility to non-invasive brain stimulation <xref rid="pone.0057425-Huber1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. First, we performed navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) to determine the optimal stimulation site for M1 and PMC corticospinal projections in the dominant hemisphere. This was performed in an isolated session prior to the two tDCS stimulation sessions to avoid fatigue effects. The coordinates of the two stimulation targets were stored for use in following sessions. In the two subsequent stimulation sessions, sham and cathodal tDCS were applied over M1 individually in each subject. The order was randomized to avoid sequence effects. Both the participants and the investigator were unaware of the stimulation condition (double-blind design). The investigator was blinded by providing a numerical code which had to be entered to the stimulation software and was decoded into the stimulation type (Spike2, CED, Cambridge, UK). Additionally, the display of the stimulation device was covered. Immediately before and after tDCS, 20 TMS stimuli were applied at equal intensities (%MSO, i.e. percentage of maximum stimulator output) at 500 &#x000b5;V-MT (please refer to the section &#x02018;<italic>Corticospinal, intracortical and interhemispheric excitability</italic>&#x02019; for a detailed definition of &#x02018;500 &#x000b5;V-MT&#x02019;) before tDCS to examine changes in cortical excitability induced by the stimulation.</p><p>Additionally, five measures of cortical excitability and motor function were each randomly assigned to one of four twenty-minute time slots distributed over an early (up to 40 minutes post-tDCS) and late (40&#x02013;80 minutes post-tDCS) recording period. Two of these measures, interhemispheric inhibition and intracortical excitability (i.e. intracortical facilitation and inhibition), were assigned a common slot. The remaining three measures were input-output curves, motor thresholds, and finger-tapping speed (FT) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057425-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The random order was kept constant in both tDCS conditions (sham versus verum) for each subject (i.e. stratified randomization). Overall, each electrophysiological and functional parameter was investigated on 8 occasions per time interval (i.e. early or late) and condition. We expected to capture all tDCS-induced aftereffects within 80 minutes <xref rid="pone.0057425-Liebetanz1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.

After PMC hotspot identification, 20 minimal suprathreshold stimuli were applied at an intensity eliciting MEPs at an average amplitude of 200 &#x000b5;V. This confirmed the reliable elicitation of corticospinal volleys. The concomitant EF<sub>remote</sub> in M1 was estimated. Subsequently, 20 stimuli were applied with this EF<sub>remote</sub> intensity and orientation directly over the M1 hotspot. If no MEPs were elicited then the MEPs that had been elicited by PMC stimulation were assumed to originate in the PMC and not to be due to distant co-stimulation of M1. This approach is a modified version of that successfully used by Teitti et al. <xref rid="pone.0057425-Teitti1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. They argued that if the EF<sub>remote</sub> over M1 during frontal or premotor stimulation was below a level sufficient to elicit an MEP from M1 (i.e. below RMT), then the MEP must have originated from corticospinal projections other than those located in M1. Spangenberg et al. have reproduced this finding in brain tumor patients <xref rid="pone.0057425-Spangenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. We built upon these findings by including control stimulation over M1 to prove that the assumption of a non-M1 origin is correct.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Corticospinal, intracortical and interhemispheric excitability</title><p>The MEP amplitude was defined by peak-to-peak measurements of belly-tendon surface recordings from the muscles contralateral to the dominant hemisphere with a background activity below a maximum of 20 &#x000b5;V.

Care was taken to measure a reliable RMT, which was estimated per subject, measure and time slot individually. Interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) was measured bi-directionally using two TMS coils placed over the APB hotspots of the primary motor cortices of each hemisphere (Coil 1: Nexstim, Helsinki, Finland; Coil 2: Magstim 200, Magstim, UK).

The electrode's surface area was adapted to avoid effective stimulation of the adjacent PMC, to prevent high scalp current densities and to elicit an aftereffect in the stimulated M1 of about one hour <xref rid="pone.0057425-Nitsche1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057425-Poreisz1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. A 16 cm<sup>2</sup> (6.4&#x000d7;2.5 cm) cathodal strip electrode of less than half the size of the 35 cm<sup>2</sup> electrodes used in early tDCS studies <xref rid="pone.0057425-Nitsche2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> was used and placed with its long axis parallel to the central gyrus to further diminish spread to the rostrally located PMC. The reference electrode, with a size of 35 cm<sup>2</sup>, was placed over the supraorbital region of the opposite hemisphere to disperse the current to a non-effective level <xref rid="pone.0057425-Nitsche1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The electrodes were soaked in 0.9% sodium chloride solution and attached to the participant's head with adhesive tape.</p><p>A current of &#x02212;0.7 mA with a current density of &#x02212;0.04 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> was used <xref rid="pone.0057425-Nitsche1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Estimating the current density on the surface has been shown to be complex. Results vary depending on spherical or cylindrical models. For optimal predictive power, a geometric head model derived from actual MRI data should be used <xref rid="pone.0057425-Miranda1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. The cathodal tDCS consisted of ramping the current to &#x02212;0.7 mA over 5 seconds, keeping it at this level for 9 minutes 50 seconds, and ramping it to 0 mA in another 5 seconds to avoid the unpleasant sensations that occur when rapidly switching the current on or off. Sham tDCS was also started with a 5-second ramping phase to &#x02212;0.7 mA. This level of current was kept constant for 30 seconds (compared to 10 minutes verum stimulation) to give the participant a tingling sensation. The current was subsequently reduced to 0 mA over another 5 seconds and then kept at this level until a total of 10 minutes sham-stimulation was completed.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Data evaluation and statistics</title><p>MATLAB (Matlab&#x000ae;, Mathworks, Gatwick, USA) was used for signal processing and statistical testing.

This was done both by visual inspection of EMG traces during stimulation as well as post-hoc thresholding and regression analysis prior to data preprocessing.

A repeated measures ANOVA was calculated to test the null hypothesis that additionally recorded parameters between stimulation conditions (i.e. cathodal and sham) or MEP latencies between regions (i.e. M1 and PMC) did not differ (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0057425-t001">Table 1</xref>). Time was introduced as a two-level main factor for all tests because early and late aftereffects were expected to be different. TMS intensity was added as a four-level main factor for input-output curve testing as high and low-threshold neurons have been found to be affected differently by tDCS <xref rid="pone.0057425-Nitsche1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. To determine if inhibitory or facilitatory circuits were affected, the interstimulus interval was included as a two-level main factor in paired-pulse trials <xref rid="pone.0057425-Kujirai1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. If the null hypothesis was rejected at a 5% significance level, we performed a Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) post-hoc test as an alpha-error cumulative-corrected multiple comparison procedure.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0057425-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0057425.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Summary of experimental results.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0057425-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0057425.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">Interregional</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

These results show that the PMC is affected by M1 cathodal inhibition with neurophysiological as well as behavioral consequences.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>The site of cortical inhibition</title><p>To target M1 but not PMC with tDCS we adopted the methods suggested by Nitsche et al. <xref rid="pone.0057425-Nitsche1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and Miranda et al. <xref rid="pone.0057425-Miranda1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> and used a stimulation electrode with a smaller surface area (16 cm<sup>2</sup> vs. conventional 35 cm<sup>2</sup>), a rectangular instead of a quadratic shape, and reduced total current (&#x02212;0.7 mA vs. conventional &#x02212;1.0 mA). Although previous brain stimulation studies with tDCS have successfully used larger electrodes to differentiate PMC from M1 effects (e.g. 35 cm<sup>2</sup> leads to opposite metabolic effects in ipsilateral M1 and dorsal PMC <xref rid="pone.0057425-Lang1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>), we believe that a more focal stimulation will prove to be preferable. Conversely, whereas 35 cm<sup>2</sup> electrodes have successfully differentiated effects in M1 and PMC, 9 cm<sup>2</sup> electrodes were recently shown to be inefficient <xref rid="pone.0057425-Kirimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Thus, the success of stimulation with a 16 cm<sup>2</sup> surface area must be measured by the strength of inhibition induced in M1. The findings of this study show that a 16 cm<sup>2</sup> tDCS electrode can induce increased SICI, lateralized IHI, increased RMT and reduced corticospinal excitability in accordance with well-established cathodal tDCS effects <xref rid="pone.0057425-Nitsche1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057425-Lang2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. This confirms that the use of a smaller electrode was successful. Unlike Nitsche et al. we did not find a reduced ICF. However, this is not a novel finding and can be explained by more focal stimulation <xref rid="pone.0057425-Boros1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Similar to Lang et al. we found IHI to only be changed in the interventional hemisphere and not in the contralateral hemisphere <xref rid="pone.0057425-Lang2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. However, Lang et al. found IHI to be decreased after cathodal tDCS, unlike the results in our study <xref rid="pone.0057425-Lang2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. This might also be attributed to the use of smaller stimulation electrodes (16 cm<sup>2</sup> vs. 35 cm<sup>2</sup>).

Boros and colleagues found that artificially heightened PMC activity (anodal tDCS in their study) leads to suppression of SICI (i.e. gaba'ergic inhibition) in M1 <xref rid="pone.0057425-Boros1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Activity in the PMC was not assessed, so that a more direct comparison is not possible. The effect on SICI in the present study is not apparent in the early post-stimulation period, most likely because gaba'ergic interneuronal activity (intrinsic activity) is masked by the direct inhibitory tDCS aftereffects (extrinsic input) on gaba'ergic interneurons <xref rid="pone.0057425-Nitsche1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In summary, the gaba'ergic results are similar, suggesting, at least in part, the utilization of some similar pathways. Concerning effects on corticospinal excitability, Gerschlager et al. show that PMC inhibition leads to reduced and Rizzo et al. show that heightened PMC neural activity leads to heightened M1 excitability <xref rid="pone.0057425-Gerschlager1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057425-Rizzo1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. In line with these findings, we find enhanced (normalization of reduced) M1 excitability during enhancement of PMC excitability. Conversely, it is understood that M1 and PMC can share both facilitatory and inhibitory pathways relevant to the shaping and selection of movements <xref rid="pone.0057425-Munchau1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Thus, the results of the present study could suggest that the facilitatory pathways are predominantly responsible for the compensation of attenuated movements. Yet the alternative explanation, enhanced inhibition of inhibitory pathways, is also plausible and the differentiation of these two pathway types remains unresolved by the present study.</p><p>Attenuated electrophysiological and behavioral findings in M1 are all well-established for cathodal tDCS <xref rid="pone.0057425-Nitsche2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>; e.g. with significant effects at 130% and 140% but not 110% RMT in input-output curves as well as similar effects on intracortical and interhemispheric circuits. Furthermore, we find clearly enhanced PMC excitability that is present both directly after cathodal tDCS and in a later period after M1 excitability has returned to normal. Interestingly, significant cortical excitability changes at 130% RMT are only present in this late period. Moreover, it is also the only predictor of motor performance. This selective effect is likely related to modification of the recruitment characteristics of corticospinal neurons <xref rid="pone.0057425-Devanne1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, due to the &#x02018;time-dependent&#x02019; and possibly NMDA-receptor-dependent modulation of different cortical systems <xref rid="pone.0057425-Nitsche2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. A limitation to this study is that navigation software still cannot provide conclusive evidence against unspecific distant activation of low-threshold M1 neurons located e.g. at the depth of the precentral gyrus. This could have masked a possible association of motor performance with stronger stimulation strengths.</p><p>The finding of a secondary effect on the PMC after M1 inhibition is novel but not surprising as strong M1 PMC connectivity and compensatory mechanisms after M1 lesions are well established in both animals (for review see <xref rid="pone.0057425-Dancause1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>) and patients <xref rid="pone.0057425-Swayne1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057425-JohansenBerg1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057425-Fridman1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057425-Ward1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057425-Takeuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057425-Bestmann1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>.

The specific finding of a predictive association between cortical excitability at 130% RMT and motor performance deserves further investigation.

Thus, our results deserve a brief comparison.
