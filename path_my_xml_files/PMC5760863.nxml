The discovery of EGFR mutation with the development of TKIs and their subsequent generations has led to a substantial improvement in PFS and OS in these cancers. Different type of EGFR mutations have differential impact on response to TKIs.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] TKIs are currently prescribed in activating EGFR mutations. Exon 19 deletion and exon 21 mutation are considered as the classic activating mutations. The incidence of EGFR-mutated lung cancer is not similar across the globe, varying from 10% to 20% in Western countries to 30%&#x02013;40% in Chinese regions.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] However, the response rate, PFS, and OS differ substantially between the Indian patients and patients from other parts of the world.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Hence, this analysis was performed to study whether exon 19 deletion had superior outcomes in the Indian patients. As these mutations are mutually exclusive, it is worthwhile to know their clinical significance in the Indian context.</p><p>Over the last few years, evidence has suggested that the clinical outcomes of exon 19-mutated patients were better than exon 21-mutated patients.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In the joint analysis of LUX-Lung 3 and 6 study reported by Yang <italic>et al</italic>., a comparison was made between EGFR-mutated patients treated with afatinib (irreversible TKI) with either pemetrexed and cisplatin or gemcitabine-cisplatin doublet chemotherapy. Overall, afatinib did not improve OS in this analysis. However, patients who had exon 19 deletion had a significant improvement in OS when compared against either pemetrexed and cisplatin (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.36&#x02013;0.79, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0015) or gemcitabine-cisplatin doublet chemotherapy (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.44&#x02013;0.94, <italic>P</italic> = 0.023). This analysis does suggested that probably in the eastern Asians and Caucasians, these mutations were different.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] These higher outcomes are probably due to the strong affinity and binding of the drug to exon 19-deleted EGFR receptor or due to the biological differential behavior of these 2 mutations.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Similar conclusion was drawn by a meta-analysis reported by Kuan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In this study, it appeared that patients with exon 19 deletion when they receive irreversible TKI like afatinib, it is associated with a statistically significant OS benefit in these patients (irreversible TKIs, HR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.47&#x02013;0.73). However, these findings were not seen in patients receiving reversible TKI like gefitinib or erlotinib (HR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.69&#x02013;1.02).</p><p>In our study, we found similar PFS and OS in exon 19- and exon 21-mutated patients. Although exon 19 patients had a superior response rate, the other efficacy outcomes were similar. This may be due to the fact that disease stabilization rate was higher in exon 21 patients compared to exon 19-deleted patients. A suggestion to this hypothesis is seen in the differential stable rate (33.8% versus 18.4%) between the two exon cohorts. The data suggest that in addition to the treatment, probably in exon 19 patients, we do have an ethnic difference which dictates response. We failed to find any study reported from India or Indian subcontinent on differential response of gefitinib in EGFR exon 19- versus exon 21-mutated patients. The survival outcomes reported in the study are similar to those reported from other centers in India by Doval <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>The study has its own limitations and strengths. It is one of the largest series studying the outcomes of exon 19 versus exon 21 mutations. The data were collected prospectively, and hence, missing data were minimal. This is the first study from India reporting on differential outcomes seen with exon 19 and exon 21 mutations. The limitations of the study were that it was a single-center study and that the analysis done was <italic>post hoc</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"
