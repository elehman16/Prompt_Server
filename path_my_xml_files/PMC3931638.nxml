Patients performed six simulated injections. Assessments of patient device acceptance and device usability were made by patient reports and independent observations of compliance with the device instruction for use (IFU) following single injections and repeated injections.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 390 simulated injections were performed. Patient device acceptance was high; more than 90% of patients found each of the tested criteria to be acceptable (&#x0003e;80% was required for statistical significance; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.016). Perceived ease of use and simplicity of the three-step process resulted in high acceptance scores: mean scores (&#x000b1; standard deviation) were 8.71 (&#x000b1;1.18) and 8.05 (&#x000b1;0.37), respectively, on a 0&#x02013;10-point scale. Patients also expressed their acceptance with the ease and usefulness of the detection of the remaining drug in the autoinjector. In addition, 80% of patients declared that they would recommend the device to someone else. Globally, the human factors tested (age, sex, hand disability [Cochin score], extent of previous experience with self-injection [ie, expert or na&#x000ef;ve]) had no impact on IFU device compliance. In particular, the lack of a Cochin score interaction indicated that the degree of hand disability is not a predictive factor of poor self-injection capability with this autoinjector.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrated a high level of patient acceptance for self-injection with this autoinjector among patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Limited prospective data on factors that influence adherence to disease-modifying drugs in MS identified the following factors: problems with injecting; reduced manual dexterity, which can make the correct self-injection procedure physically problematic; dependence on others; perceived lack of efficacy; and adverse events (injection site reactions and injection pain).<xref rid="b8-ppa-8-199" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-ppa-8-199" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Factors that influence compliance to injectable treatment in RA remain under-investigated, even though more newer injectable biologics are becoming available for use.<xref rid="b10-ppa-8-199" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> As in MS, patients with RA have reduced manual dexterity, which can make the correct self-injection procedure physically problematic.</p><p>In response to these potential problems with injections, various injection technologies (for example, autoinjection devices) have been introduced, which are designed to improve the ease of use, safety, and reliability of injections, and to reduce pain.<xref rid="b2-ppa-8-199" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Autoinjectors automatically insert the needle and deliver a controlled dose of drug, such as the disease-modifying drugs used by patients with MS and RA. Autoinjectors have been shown to provide a number of benefits, including a reduced risk of injection site reactions, reduced discomfort, and greater ease of use compared with manual (syringe plus needle) injections.<xref rid="b11-ppa-8-199" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-ppa-8-199" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The BD Physioject (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) has been specifically designed to help improve adherence to a subcutaneous (SC) injection schedule.

The primary study objectives were to evaluate patient device acceptance among na&#x000ef;ve and experienced users of autoinjectors among patients with RA. Patients were asked to rate the perceived required force to press the button, the perceived required force to press the autoinjector onto the foam pad during injection, and the perceived visibility of the end of the injection process. These are the three steps required for successful injection: 1) correctly activate the system (force to press the button); 2) button can be activated only if the system is correctly pressed to injection site (force to press the autoinjector); 3) do not remove the system before the end of the injection (end of injection visibility). The secondary objectives were to evaluate usability (ie, compliance with the device instructions for use [IFU]) in this population under chronic treatment conditions (repeated simulated injections).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a randomized, single-center, study conducted in France in compliance with Good Clinical Practice according to European directives and French laws. Patients were recruited by the Rheumatology Department of the University Hospital of Grenoble between April 2010 and June 2010, and were observed by a clinical research associate employed by this hospital. Two observers were trained by BD. Instructions were written to help observers standardize their observations and communicate the same level of information to the patients. The testing environment simulated the environment of a physician&#x02019;s office/clinic (for example, there was sufficient lighting, and only an observer was present with the patient in the testing room). Each patient performed a total of six simulated SC injections using a foam pad developed by BD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ppa-8-199">Figure 1</xref>), which was applied to the usual injection sites (ie, the abdomen and thigh).</p><p>In phase 1 of the study, all patients were told that they were being given an autoinjection device meant to be used at home. Patients were randomized to receive full information (ie, device IFU), some information about the injector and injection process, or no information before first use of the device (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ppa-8-199">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ppa-8-199">Table 1</xref>). The external observer was unmasked regarding the information level. Patients in the &#x0201c;no information&#x0201d; subgroup were asked to do the best job they could to figure out how to use the autoinjector without any instructions. Patients who received some information were asked to carefully study the instructions, which were comprised of pictures and minimally written explanations of the process. Patients&#x02019; questions were answered by repeating the provided instructions. Patients in the full information subgroup were asked to carefully read the complete instructions and their questions were fully answered by the observer. Injections were also randomized, as patients were instructed to inject a particular site on a particular side of the body. In phase 1, patients made two individual injections; they were monitored by an independent observer trained to be able to detect noncompliance with device IFU.</p><p>In phase 2, all patients were provided with full information about the device, and they were asked to make four repeated injections. Patients were again monitored by a trained independent observer.</p><p>As an exploratory objective at the end of study session to validate the foam pad, each patient performed two injections directly on his/her body using a needleless autoinjector. Compliance with device IFU and the patient&#x02019;s level of acceptance of creating a skin fold during an injection were assessed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients were recruited by the investigator (a rheumatologist) while they attended the clinic for treatment or for a medical consultation. If the investigator deemed that a patient was eligible for self-injection, he or she was invited to participate in the study. In order to be representative of the RA population, a 1:3 ratio of males and females, respectively, was expected. No other eligibility criteria (or ratios) were applied. Patient age, degree of hand disability, and previous self-injection experience were recorded after inclusion, but there were no limits on these parameters. Hand disability was assessed using the Cochin score, a validated instrument commonly used in clinical trials and epidemiological studies in the RA population. This scores responses to 18 questions on daily from 0 (activity performed without difficulty) to 5 (impossible to do).<xref rid="b14-ppa-8-199" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-ppa-8-199" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> A minimum of 60 evaluable patients (ie, without missing data on the primary objective analysis) were required to be able to detect patient acceptance greater than 80% (with a power of 88% and a risk 1 error of 5%). Recruitment was halted after the 65th patient because 60 patients were evaluable. A total of 390 simulated injections were performed and analyzed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study assessments</title><p>The survey questionnaire is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ppa-8-199">Table 2</xref>. Three questions (Q1&#x02013;Q3) were used to assess the perceived ease and comfort of use, as reported by the patient after each phase. Patients completed an 11-point Likert scale (scores ranging from 0&#x02013;10). To complete the patient device acceptance assessment concerning the system&#x02019;s ease of use, each patient answered four complementary questions (questions Q4&#x02013;Q7). For their willingness to adopt the device, there were five specific questions in the survey addressing this parameter (Q8&#x02013;Q12).</p><p>Usability (ie, patients&#x02019; compliance with device IFU) was evaluated by the independent observer who observed the handling of the autoinjector system during injections, while recording each error. Compliance with device IFU was assessed by analyzing the percentage of injections where all steps were correctly performed.</p><p>The effect of patients&#x02019; characteristics and human factors on patient device acceptance and device usability was assessed according to age, sex, Cochin score, previous practical experience in self-injection (na&#x000ef;ve or expert patients), information subgroup (in phase 1), and side and site of the body used for simulated injections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA). For the primary objective (ie, the detection of patient device acceptance &#x0003e;80% with a power of 88%), the type 1 error was set to 0.05 and a <italic>P</italic>-value of &#x02264;0.05 was considered as statistically significant.</p><p>Eleven-point Likert scales were used to assess patient device acceptance across the three test criteria. Responses in the range of 0&#x02013;5 on the Likert scale were classified as &#x0201c;not acceptable&#x0201d;, and responses in the range of 6&#x02013;10 were classified as &#x0201c;acceptable.&#x0201d; A score of 8 points or above was considered as high acceptance. For each phase, an overall binary acceptability criterion, defined as an acceptable score (&#x02265;6) for the three Likert scales (Q1&#x02013;Q3) was also computed.</p><p>For each criterion, the proportion of patients acceptant was compared to 80% using a one-sided exact binomial test. Binary criteria were also compared between the two phases using McNemar&#x02019;s test. Compliance with device IFU (usability) was analyzed by the following descriptive statistics: the number of missing data, mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum and maximum, quartiles (quartile 1, quartile 2, and quartile 3), and two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous variables; and the number of missing data, frequencies, percentages, and two-sided 95% CIs (using the Cloper&#x02013;Pearson exact method) for categorical variables.</p><p>To assess the effect of human factors on patient device acceptance and device usability, mean acceptance scores were analyzed and compared between subgroups (age, sex, Cochin score, previous practical experience in self-injection, information subgroup [in phase 1], and side and site of the body used for simulated injections) using mixed models analysis of variance using an autoregressive correlation structure.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient population</title><p>All 65 patients with RA included in this study had Cochin scores &#x02264;79 at baseline, which correspond with severe hand disability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ppa-8-199">Figure 3</xref>). Thirty-one patients were experienced (ie, had experiences with self-injection using a syringe and/or an autoinjector prior to inclusion in the study) and 34 were na&#x000ef;ve. In phase 1, there were no major differences in patient profiles (ie, age, sex, Cochin score, and previous practical experience in self-injection) between the three study arms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-ppa-8-199">Table 3</xref>). A total of 390 simulated injections were performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient device acceptance</title><p>In phase 2, patient device acceptance was high (ie, &#x0003e;8). A statistically significant number of patients (&#x0003e;90%; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.016) found each of the three test criteria (Q1, Q2, and Q3) to be acceptable.

A total of 80% of patients declared that they would recommend the autoinjector to someone else (Q8) (ie, 80% of patients gave a score &#x02265;6 for this question; the mean score &#x000b1;SD was 8.05&#x000b1;1.96). The willingness to adopt the autoinjector for further SC treatment was also very high; 90.8% of patients gave a score &#x02265;6 for further self-treatment (Q12), and 73.8% would accept further treatment from a nurse (Q10) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t5-ppa-8-199">Table 5</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>The effect of human factors on patient device acceptance</title><p>The effects of different human factors are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t6-ppa-8-199">Table 6</xref>.

On the contrary, the study population characteristics demonstrate that the proportion of patients with high hand disability, and yet who were also judged to be eligible for and successful at self-injection, was higher than expected by the investigator, and it was similar to that observed in the general RA population.

This present study demonstrated high acceptance scores for ease of use and process simplicity.</p><p>The results of the present study agree with those of the more recent MOSAIC study,<xref rid="b13-ppa-8-199" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> which used a variant (RebiDose&#x02122;; Merck Serono, Geneva, Switzerland) of the autoinjector used here. That 12-week, Phase IIIB clinical trial conducted with 121 patients with MS evaluated the ease of use of the autoinjector, as well as its functional reliability. After the first injection, 93.6% of patients answered that the injection was easy (36.7%) or very easy (56.9%), as measured on a five-point scale (with responses ranging from very difficult to very easy). The lack of accidental activations in this study also concurs with the findings from a previous study involving 480 real injections.<xref rid="b11-ppa-8-199" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Results comparing patients&#x02019; willingness to recommend an autoinjector to someone else are difficult to find. The only results available in the literature concern a study conducted with real SC injections in a 1-year contraception study in which patients self-injected once every 12&#x02013;14 weeks.<xref rid="b25-ppa-8-199" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Fifty women were included after having undergone training in a simulated arm, and they made a first successful self-injection, which was observed by an investigator. A total of 94% of these women answered that they were (somewhat) likely to recommend self-injection.</p><p>The willingness to accept further SC treatment by self-injection with the BD Physioject&#x02122; was very high (90.8% of patients gave a score &#x02265;6); this result is higher than that of the MOSAIC study, where 73% of patients said they would continue to use the experimental autoinjector if it became available, but it was similar to the findings of another study in which patients were using an autoinjector to take hormones (87% would like to pursue use of the device for a future treatment).<xref rid="b13-ppa-8-199" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b20-ppa-8-199" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>Compliance with device IFU was excellent in both na&#x000ef;ve and experienced patients, with 85% of patients able correctly to perform 100% of the injection steps. In phase 1, compliance with device IFU in patients in the &#x0201c;full information&#x0201d; group (mean: 97%; range: 64%&#x02013;100%; 95% CI: 92.4%, 99.2%) was higher than in an earlier study in 40 healthy volunteers, where the mean compliance rate was 93% (range: 40%&#x02013;100%; 95% CI; 79.6%, 98.4%).<xref rid="b11-ppa-8-199" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Two reasons might explain this: first, the study in healthy volunteers was conducted with an earlier version of the IFU &#x02013; the version used in the present study incorporated key learnings from this previous study; second, patients with RA felt more concerned by the RA treatment and they were more experienced in this type of treatment than healthy volunteers. The results pertaining to compliance with device IFU from the present study are similar to those for an autoinjector used in a Phase IIIB open clinical trial conducted among patients with MS where the overall success rate was 89%.<xref rid="b23-ppa-8-199" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>Globally, the effect of the human factors tested (age, sex, hand disability, previous practical experience with self-injection) did not significantly impact scores for autoinjector usability in this cohort of patients with RA. This absence of effect on the usability of the same device confirms the findings of the MOSAIC study, which found that neurological and cognitive deficits, as well as fatigue, generally had no influence on ratings of satisfaction, functional reliability, or ease of use among patients with MS.<xref rid="b13-ppa-8-199" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>A threshold of 80% was chosen for comparisons of patient acceptance because it was the threshold considered as satisfactory in several acceptance studies.<xref rid="b21-ppa-8-199" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b28-ppa-8-199" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b29-ppa-8-199" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>The robustness of the method used to assess the effect of human factors &#x02013; and, hence, the confidence in the observed results &#x02013; is high. Indeed, although this study was conducted prior to the publication of the US Food and Drug Administration&#x02019;s draft guidance about human factor studies, the method used was compliant with this new guidance concerning sample size and user environement.<xref rid="b30-ppa-8-199" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> If users with distinctly different characteristics (for example, age, skill sets, or experience levels) are going to use a new device, this guidance indicates that validation testing activities should include 15 patients from each major user group. In the present study, the number of patients in each subgroup was close to or greater than 15, irrespective of the factor being tested (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ppa-8-199">Table 2</xref>).</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Limitations of the current study</title><p>The methods and tools used in this study were based on those used in other published studies; the most common tool used to assess patient satisfaction and acceptance is the Likert scale, either with a 1&#x02013;5-point or 0&#x02013;10-point format.<xref rid="b6-ppa-8-199" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b22-ppa-8-199" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b23-ppa-8-199" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b25-ppa-8-199" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b27-ppa-8-199" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The 0&#x02013;10-point scale is a tool commonly used in studies assessing acceptance of autoinjectors,<xref rid="b22-ppa-8-199" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b23-ppa-8-199" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and it was the scale used in a previous BD marketing study, which is the main reason why it was used in this study; however, for performance criteria such as ease of use, a 1&#x02013;5-point scale could have been more powerful.</p><p>The questionnaires used to capture information relevant to the evaluation of patient device acceptance were not formally validated prior to this study. A self-injection assessment questionnaire using a 1&#x02013;5-point Likert scale was published after the conduction of the present study, and it was demonstrated to be a valid and reliable tool for RA patients to use to assess their success in giving self-injections, while also determining the likelihood with which they would adhere to a self-injection regimen.<xref rid="b6-ppa-8-199" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> This tool could be used in a further study with this autoinjector to assess the perceived advantages and the potential barriers to self-injection (including the psychological, social, and physical barriers, as well as the level of acceptance of self-injection and willingness to continue the treatment by self-injection).</p><p>This study was a monocentric study conducted in France alone. Even if the sample size and RA population representativity were considered, a larger scale study may reinforce our results.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study found high patient acceptance of the autoinjector in each of the tested criteria. In the full information group, compliance with device IFU was excellent in na&#x000ef;ve and experienced patients, regardless of the patient&#x02019;s age and degree of hand disability. This means that even patients with severe hand disability can comply with device IFU, while managing self-injection successfully. Therefore, the findings of this study add to the evidence supporting the use of autoinjectors to help improve treatment compliance among patients with chronic diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Fr&#x000e9;d&#x000e9;ric Mistretta and Jean-Fran&#x000e7;ois Ferlet (RCTs, Lyon, France) for their help in conducting data management and analysis; Sandrine Massicot, Fatah Tidadini (clinical research associates), and M&#x000e9;lanie Gilson (rheumatologist) of the University Hospital of Grenoble for their help in conducting the clinical study.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for their valuable comments, which helped to considerably improve the quality of the manuscript.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The study was funded and sponsored by Becton Dickinson &#x02013; BD Medical Pharmaceutical Systems.
