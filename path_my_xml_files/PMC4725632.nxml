Nemonoxacin is quickly and completely absorbed after its oral administration and has a half-life of 10&#x02013;13 hours, which supports its once-daily administration.<xref rid="b6-dddt-10-357" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8-dddt-10-357" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Like other FQs, the absorption of nemonoxacin is reduced in the presence of polyvalent metal ions, such as Al<sup>3+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and Fe<sup>2+</sup>, because of its ability to chelate with metals.<xref rid="b9-dddt-10-357" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Because no major or minor metabolites of nemonoxacin have been found in in vitro or in vivo studies,<xref rid="b6-dddt-10-357" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8-dddt-10-357" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> the risk of metabolism-related DDIs is very low. Mass balance studies in healthy volunteers have shown that nemonoxacin is predominantly eliminated by the kidney, and 50%&#x02013;70% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine more than 72 hours after its administration.<xref rid="b6-dddt-10-357" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b9-dddt-10-357" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> After its binding by plasma proteins is considered (16%), the renal clearance (CL<sub>r</sub>) of the free (unbound) fraction of nemonoxacin is 132&#x02013;164 mL/min, which is greater than the normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (ie, 125 mL/min), suggesting active renal secretion of the unchanged drug. Because nemonoxacin primarily exists as a zwitterion at physiological pH, it is likely to interact with organic anion transporters (OATs) and organic cation transporters (OCTs) in renal tubule cells. It is well documented that probenecid, which is actively secreted via the renal tubules and has a high affinity for OATs and OCTs, decreases the CL<sub>r</sub> of many FQs, including ciprofloxacin, gemifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and levofloxacin.<xref rid="b10-dddt-10-357" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13-dddt-10-357" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> It was also reported that coadministration of cimetidine, a competitive OCT2 inhibitor, significantly reduces the CL<sub>r</sub> of enoxacin, fleroxacin, gemifloxacin, or levofloxacin (by 13%&#x02013;28%).<xref rid="b13-dddt-10-357" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b15-dddt-10-357" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Here, we performed two studies to determine the effects of probenecid and cimetidine on the pharmacokinetics of nemonoxacin in healthy volunteers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study drugs</title><p>Nemonoxacin malate capsules (250 mg of nemonoxacin per capsule, Batch number: 12031007, Expiry date: March, 2014) were provided by TaiGen Biotechnology Co., Ltd.

In Study 1, all 12 volunteers completed the study and were included in the pharmacokinetic analyses. Their mean age was 23.3&#x000b1;2.7 years (range 19&#x02013;27 years), mean body weight was 62.0&#x000b1;9.6 kg (range 58&#x02013;80 kg), and mean body mass index (BMI) was 21.8&#x000b1;2.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (range 19.6&#x02013;23.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). In Study 2, one male volunteer withdrew for personal reasons after the administration of cimetidine on day 4 in Period 1. The other eleven volunteers completed the study and were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis. Their mean age was 21.8&#x000b1;1.6 years (range 18&#x02013;24 years), mean body weight was 58.4&#x000b1;3.9 kg (range 51&#x02013;65 kg), and mean BMI was 21.0&#x000b1;1.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (range 19.7&#x02013;23.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The volunteers were in good health in terms of their medical history, physical examination, electrocardiography (ECG), and routine laboratory tests. None of the subjects had used any drugs for &#x02265;2 weeks before the study and alcohol was forbidden from 72 hours before the administration of the study drugs. All volunteers provided written informed consent before enrollment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>Two independent, open-label, randomized, two-treatment, two-sequence, two-period crossover studies were designed to assess the effects of probenecid and cimetidine on the pharmacokinetics of nemonoxacin in healthy volunteers. Both studies included a washout period of 7 days between each study period. In Study 1, each volunteer received a single oral dose of 500 mg of nemonoxacin alone (Treatment A) or with 500-mg oral doses of probenecid 1 hour prior to and 12 and 24 hours after the administration of nemonoxacin (Treatment B). In Study 2, each volunteer received a single oral dose of 500 mg of nemonoxacin alone (Treatment C) or with multiple doses of cimetidine (Treatment D). In Treatment D, 400 mg of cimetidine was orally administered thrice daily for 7 days, and nemonoxacin was administered on day 5. In both studies, nemonoxacin was orally administered to the subjects after an overnight fast of &#x02265;10 hours. No food was allowed for &#x02265;4 hours after administration of the drug. Water was allowed as desired, except 2 hours before and 2 hours after drug administration. Study 1 was conducted at the General Hospital of Shenyang Military Region and Study 2 was conducted at the First Hospital Affiliated to Lanzhou University. The protocols of Study 1 and Study 2 were approved by the Independent Ethics Committee of the General Hospital of Shenyang Military Region and the Independent Ethics Committee of the First Hospital Affiliated to Lanzhou University, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety evaluation</title><p>All the volunteers who participated in the studies were included in the safety analysis. Safety was evaluated in terms of physical examinations, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and body temperature), 12-lead ECG, laboratory tests (clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and serology), and adverse events (AEs). Vital signs and 12-lead ECG were assessed before the administration and at 2, 4, 24, 48, and 72 hours after the administration of nemonoxacin. Clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis were conducted 1 day before and 24 hours after nemonoxacin administration. Additional laboratory tests were performed 72 hours after nemonoxacin administration if abnormal, and clinically significant values were observed at 24 hours. AEs were recorded throughout the study period and at the follow-up.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Sample collection for pharmacokinetic analysis</title><p>In both studies, blood samples (4 mL) were collected from a forearm vein and were placed in heparinized tubes. Samples were obtained before and at 0.33, 0.67, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hours after the administration of nemonoxacin. The blood samples were centrifuged at 1,500&#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 10 minutes. The plasma was separated and frozen at approximately &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C until further analysis. Urine samples were collected before nemonoxacin was administered and during the following periods after its administration: 0&#x02013;4, 4&#x02013;8, 8&#x02013;12, 12&#x02013;24, 24&#x02013;48, and 48&#x02013;72 hours. The volume of urine was recorded in each collection interval, and 10 mL of well-mixed urine was retained and frozen at approximately &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C until further analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Bioanalytical methods</title><p>The plasma and urine nemonoxacin concentrations were determined with a validated liquid chromatography&#x02013;tandem mass spectrometry assay (Supplementary data), after protein precipitation with acetonitrile. Chromatography was performed on an Eclipse Plus C18 column (particle size 3.5 &#x003bc;m, 100&#x000d7;4.6 mm; Agilent, Wilmington, DE, USA) with isocratic elution (mobile phase of 1% formic acid in 5 mM ammonium acetate&#x02013;acetonitrile [70:30, v/v]) at a flow rate of 0.70 mL/min. The column temperature was 40&#x000b0;C. An API 4000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a TurboIonSpray source (Applied Biosystems, Concord, ON, Canada) was used to determine the concentrations of nemonoxacin. The concentrations were quantified with multiple reaction monitoring of transitions <italic>m/z</italic> 372&#x02192;<italic>m/z</italic> 311 for nemonoxacin and <italic>m/z</italic> 402&#x02192;<italic>m/z</italic> 364 for moxifloxacin (internal standard). The nemonoxacin response was linear (<italic>r</italic>&#x0003e;0.998) over concentration ranges of 0.005&#x02013;5.0 and 0.2&#x02013;200 &#x003bc;g/mL for plasma and urine, respectively. The intra- and inter-assay precision in the plasma matrix was &#x0003c;4.3% and 6.1%, respectively. For the urine concentrations, the intra- and inter-assay precision was &#x0003c;5.5% and 7.1%, respectively. The accuracy was 96.4%&#x02013;102.1% for plasma and 96.1%&#x02013;98.9% of the nominal value for urine. In method validation, dilution test was performed to assess the reliability of the method at concentration levels outside the calibration range. The results indicated that a tenfold dilution of human plasma samples containing nenomoxacin above the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) was acceptable. In unknown sample analysis, for concentrations higher than ULOQ, the samples were then reassayed after appropriate dilution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Pharmacokinetic analysis</title><p>The pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using the standard noncompartmental method with the Phoenix WinNonlin software version 6.3 (Pharsight, Mountain View, CA, USA). The maximum concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) and the time to reach <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> (<italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>) were obtained from the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curves. The elimination rate constant (<italic>&#x003bb;<sub>z</sub></italic>) was calculated by linear regression of the terminal linear portion of the ln-concentration&#x02013;time curve, and the terminal elimination half-life (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>) was calculated as 0.693/<italic>&#x003bb;<sub>z</sub></italic>. The area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve (AUC) from time 0 to the last time point (AUC<sub>0&#x02212;</sub><italic><sub>t</sub></italic>) was calculated using the linear trapezoidal method.

Many in vivo studies have shown DDIs between FQs and probenecid, a substrate for OATs and OCTs.<xref rid="b10-dddt-10-357" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13-dddt-10-357" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Nemonoxacin differs from FQs in that it lacks the fluorine at the R6 position but, like FQs, nemonoxacin has two ionizable groups and displays a high CL<sub>r</sub>.

For example, in DDI studies of ciprofloxacin or gemifloxacin, the interacting drug, probenecid, was administered at doses of 3.5&#x02013;4.5 g, which were divided into multiple daily doses. Under this treatment regimen, the effects of probenecid were likely to be exaggerated because the CL<sub>r</sub> of ciprofloxacin and gemifloxacin decreased by 65% and 51%, respectively, and the AUC<sub>0&#x02212;&#x0221e;</sub> of ciprofloxacin increased by 72%.<xref rid="b10-dddt-10-357" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-dddt-10-357" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, in DDI studies of gatifloxacin or moxifloxacin, probenecid was used at a clinically relevant dose (500 mg twice daily).

The extent of this interaction is similar to its interaction with gemifloxacin, but is weaker than its interaction with gatifloxacin.

Nemonoxacin and the internal standard (IS) moxifloxacin were separated on an Eclipse Plus C18 column (100&#x000d7;4.6 mm, 3.5 &#x003bc;m particle size; Agilent, Wilmington, DE, USA) protected by a Security Guard C18 column (4&#x000d7;3.0 mm, 5 &#x003bc;m; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA). The mobile phase was a mixture of 1% formic acid in 5 mM ammonium acetate&#x02013;acetonitrile (70:30, v/v) and the flow rate was 0.7 mL/min. The column temperature was maintained at 40&#x000b0;C.</p><p>Mass spectrometric detection was performed on an API4000 triple quadrupole instrument (Applied Biosystems, Concord, ON, Canada) in multiple-reaction monitoring mode. A Electrospray Eionization (ESI) interface was used in positive ionization mode. Data processing was performed with Analyst 1.4.1 software (Applied Biosystems). The instrument was operated with an ion spray voltage of +4.2 kV, heater gas temperature of 400&#x000b0;C, nebulizer gas (gas 1) of 50 psi, heater gas (gas 2) of 50 psi, curtain gas of 30 psi, and collision gas of 4 psi. Nitrogen was used as the nebulizer, heater, curtain, and collision-activated dissociation gas. The declustering potential was set at 80V for nemonoxacin and the IS. In the ESI-positive scan mode, the protonated molecules [M + H]<sup>+</sup> of nemonoxacin and moxifloxacin mainly produce fragment ions at <italic>m/z</italic> 354 and 384, respectively, by the neutral loss of one molecule of water (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-dddt-10-357">Figure S1</xref>).
