the mid-substance of the Achilles tendon occurs as a result of failure
to mediate the repair and degeneration processes, causing pain and
disability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref></sup> The
general population has an incidence of 2.35 per 1000 people, equivalent
to more than 150 000 people in the United Kingdom every year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref></sup></p><p>The management options for patients with mid-substance Achilles
tendinopathy range from initial advice and modification of activities
through to electrotherapy modalities, exercise programmes and surgical
procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref></sup> Recent
guidelines on the management of Achilles tendinopathy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref></sup> and a recent meta-analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref></sup> have both advocated
that eccentric exercises should be the &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; of management.
This is in keeping with previous reviews on the topic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref></sup></p><p>Patients who do not improve after initial non-operative management
are referred to an orthopaedic consultant for a surgical opinion.
Operative treatment is the final treatment option offered, as it
is associated with a failure rate of up to 30%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref></sup> There is also a
small but serious risk of worsening the patient outcome through
development of associated complications, such as deep-vein thrombosis, infection
and nerve injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref></sup></p><p>Before undertaking a surgical procedure an orthopaedic consultant
will advocate a final period of non-operative management to prevent
a patient undertaking any unnecessary risks. Subsequently, a further
programme of eccentric exercises is advocated at this point. However, problems
related to motivation and compliance in this chronic subgroup of
patients has led to the investigation of alternative modalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref></sup></p><p>Injections of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) are one such alternative
that have been reviewed recently by the National Institute for Health
and Clinical Excellence (NICE).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref></sup> Their
report concluded that the evidence for such injections lacked in
both quantity and quality. Consequently, the safety and efficacy
of the intervention was unclear. Therefore their key recommendation
was for further high-quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
to be completed in this new and emerging area.</p><p>Since the publication of the NICE review there has been a subsequent
high-profile RCT published on this topic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref></sup> The authors of this paper compared
PRP injection with placebo injection, with both groups also undergoing
an eccentric loading programme. The setting was a sports medicine
outpatient clinic and patients were recruited through web-based
advertisements and posters. The authors did not demonstrate any
differences between the two groups using the Victorian Institute
of Sports Assessment-Achilles (VISA-A) score.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref></sup> However, the study
was underpowered, with only 27 patients in each group, and it did
not address the chronic subgroup of Achilles tendinopathy patients
that present for a surgical opinion described above.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref></sup></p><p>In order to address the need to study this specific subgroup
of patients, the aim of this current research was to perform a pilot
RCT comparing PRP injections with the gold-standard eccentric loading
programme in the chronic subgroup of patients who have failed previous non-operative
management. This pilot trial is key to determining the feasibility
of evaluating alternative non-operative interventions, such as PRP,
in this chronic subgroup who have already undergone conservative
procedures and are seeking a surgical opinion. Data will be collected regarding
the feasibility of recruitment procedures, the conversion of the
number of approaches to those randomised and provide important information
required for later determining of sample size calculations for a
full trial in this group of patients.</p><p>This information will subsequently enable conclusions to be drawn
regarding the feasibility of completing a full study which would
aim to answer: &#x02018;In patients who have failed previous non-operative
management, is there a difference in VISA-A scores at six months
between those managed with a PRP injection and those managed with an
eccentric loading programme&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec><title content-type="h3">Design and research governance</title><p>This was a pilot RCT to evaluate the feasibility of completing
a subsequent full trial. It was approved by NRES Committee (Coventry Research
Ethics Committee and University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire
Research and Development Department). It was also registered on
the current controlled trials database ISRCTN95369715.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Setting and participants</title><p>This study was conducted between May 2009 and March 2012 in an
outpatient department of a large United Kingdom teaching hospital. All
patients were referred to this clinic for a surgical opinion regarding
their mid-substance Achilles tendinopathy, having already failed
previous non-operative management. On first presentation all patients
were first seen by the orthopaedic lead for the clinic who screened
all patients for eligibility.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were all patients with a clinical diagnosis
of mid-substance Achilles tendinopathy. This comprised a subjective
history of increasing pain on loading activities for a minimum duration
of three months, objective findings of pain on palpation at a level
2 cm to 6 cm above the tendon insertion, and confirmation on ultrasonography
of local tendon thickening with hypoechoic areas and irregular fibre
orientation.</p><p>Patients were excluded if the tendinopathy was secondary to a
systemic condition such as rheumatoid arthritis or diabetes. Achilles
tendinopathies presenting at the insertion were also excluded. It
is recognised that both of these subgroups of patients represent
a separate population with separate underlying causes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref></sup> Additionally, patients
who had sustained a previous rupture or had undergone previous surgery
on the Achilles tendon were excluded, as were patients who had had
previous lower limb injuries in the previous twelve months.</p><p>All eligible patients that were screened by the lead orthopaedic
consultant (MLC) were then referred to the research physiotherapist,
also present within the clinic. The research physiotherapist (RSK)
was responsible for providing all eligible patients with an information
pack, approved by the ethics committee and the opportunity to ask
questions about study participation.</p><p>Patients who agreed to participate in the study signed a consent
form before being randomly allocated to one of the two treatment
groups in a 1:1 ratio. Treatment allocation was determined using
a computer-generated random number sequence and administered by
an independent trial co-ordinator. All patients then received one
of two standardised interventions.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Sample size</title><p>Given the pilot nature of this study, no formal sample size calculation
was performed, but a sample of 20 in total was considered to be
sufficient to assess variability between patients and crudely estimate
the nature of any treatment effect. This was a small study, so the
size of the treatment effect was unlikely to be estimated with great
precision.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Control intervention</title><p>All patients allocated to receive the eccentric loading programme
were provided with a written instructional manual and shown how
to perform the exercises by the research physiotherapist (RSK).
This protocol had two exercises; the first involved the patient being
in a standing position with the heel over the edge of a step with
the legs straight. The patient then lowered their heels beyond the
level of the step. The second exercise followed the same sequence
but with the knee slightly bent, to maximise activation of the soleus
muscle. These exercises were performed twice a day, seven days a week
for 12 weeks and then progressed as pain allowed by advancing from
double-leg exercises to single-leg exercises and finally single-leg
exercises with added weight via a backpack. At each session the
patient completed three sets of 15 repetitions of the two exercises (i.e.,
180 repetitions/day). This programme followed the original programme
published by Alfredson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Study intervention</title><p>All patients allocated to receive an injection of PRP had 52
ml of whole blood withdrawn from the antecubital fossa, which was
combined with 5&#x000a0;ml of citrate anticoagulant. This was immediately
centrifuged for 12 minutes at 2400 rpm (GenesisCS Component Concentrating
System, Fort Myers, Florida). After centrifugation the platelet
layer (approximately 3 ml to 5&#x000a0;ml) was extracted using a syringe
and then injected into the Achilles tendon using a peppering technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref></sup> This technique
involved a single-skin portal followed by five penetrations of the
tendon. All patients then received standardised post-treatment advice.
This included advising the patient to gradually return to activities
of daily living and sports as pain allowed, in addition to being advised
of possible adverse events. </p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Data collection and outcome measures</title><p>All patients were assessed at standard clinical follow-up at
six weeks, three months and six months. At these timepoints the
VISA-A questionnaire was administered, which was the primary outcome
measure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref></sup> This
questionnaire comprises eight questions covering the three domains
of pain, function and activity, and the final score ranges from
100 (asymptomatic) to 0 (greatest disability). A change in the VISA-A of
12 points reflects a change in performing activities such as walking,
jumping and sports with mild pain <italic>versus</italic> no pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref></sup> Such an improvement
is important to patients on individual and population levels, and
will lead to a change in clinical practice both locally and nationally.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref></sup> The EuroQol 5-Dimension
questionnaire (EQ-5D)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref></sup> was
also administered as a secondary outcome measure. This is a validated
quality-of-life questionnaire comprising five domains related to
daily activities, with a three-level answer possibility and a VAS
&#x02018;thermometer&#x02019;, which is the participants self-rating of their health
status. It has end points of 100 (best imaginable state) and 0 (worst
imaginable health state).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref></sup> Any
complications were recorded.</p><p>It was not possible to blind the clinician administering the
intervention or the patient receiving the intervention. However,
the primary data was patient-reported and the trial statistician
was blinded to the intervention groups throughout.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Statistical analysis</title><p>The main analysis investigated differences in the primary outcome
measure (VISA-A) between the two treatment groups on an intention
to treat basis at six months after treatment. Six months was chosen
from previous studies in the area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref></sup> as the point at which a patient
would have improved clinically and subsequently discharged, or alternatively
deemed to have failed treatment and offered further alternative
management.</p><p>As this was a pilot study the analysis was exploratory in nature,
with the primary aim to assess the size and direction of observed
differences between the treatment groups. Formal significance testing
was undertaken, assuming an approximate normal distribution for
the VISA-A scores at six months and using a Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test and
linear regression analysis to adjust for any imbalance in the baseline
characteristics between treatment groups. Diagnostic quantile&#x02013;quantile
plots of the residuals were used to assess the normality assumptions.
Mann&#x02013;Whitney tests were used to compare EQ-5D and EQ VAS scores at
six months. Statistical significance was set at the 5% level for
all tests. Analyses and graphical summaries were produced using
the statistical package R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A CONSORT diagram of participant flow through the trial is shown
in Figure 1. Following exclusions, a total of 20&#x000a0;patients were randomised
to one of the two treatment interventions. All randomised patients
received and completed their allocated intervention. The baseline
demographics for the two groups can be found in Table I. One patient
in the PRP group was lost to follow-up before the three-month assessment
because they failed to respond to follow-up procedures.</p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow diagram.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="2000200-galleyfig1"/></fig><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table I</label><caption><p>Baseline demographics (PRP, platelet-rich

and EQ-VAS, provided no evidence for significant treatment effects
(p = 0.202 and p = 0.999, respectively). These scores represent
an unadjusted analysis and the data are represented in Figure 2
and Table II. Quantile&#x02013;quantile plots, and the symmetry of the six-month
boxplots shown in Figure 2a, indicate that the assumption of approximate
normality for VISA-A at six&#x000a0;months was acceptable.</p><p>There were no complications recorded for either group during
the six-month follow-up. At
this time point, 15&#x000a0;patients were discharged, one was lost to follow-up and
two patients from each group opted to receive a further six-month
period of the non-operative treatment that they were not initially
randomised to. Of these four patients, two were discharged after
the further six months of non-operative management and two opted
for a surgical procedure. In both cases this consisted of an initial
percutaneous tenotomy followed by a later tendon debridement. No
results were collected beyond the six-month trial period.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The aim of this current research was to perform a pilot RCT in
patients with failed previous non-operative management for mid-substance
Achilles tendinopathy, assessing the clinical effectiveness of PRP
injections in comparison with a gold-standard eccentric loading
programme. The results of this pilot trial would enable conclusions
to be drawn regarding the feasibility of completing a full study
to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of PRP injections.</p><p>The study demonstrated that patients are prepared to forego surgery
in favour of a final programme of non-operative management, with
only two patients refusing to take part from a total of 22 approached. It has also provided
valuable information on the possible size and direction of treatment
effects for a larger study. The estimate of the standard deviation
of the VISA-A score at six months was approximately 20 points. Assuming
a conservative treatment effect of 12 points, an overall minimum
sample size for a full trial of the PRP intervention would be 90&#x000a0;patients
(45 in each group), for assumed normality of the outcome measure,
using a two-armed parallel group trial based on 80% power and 5%
significance. A study of this sample size would be feasible across
a small number of additional centres.</p><p>At the time of starting this study (2009), NICE had recently
performed a systematic review of the literature relating to tendinopathy
and autologous blood injections. They found no RCTs in this area.
Further systematic reviews on this topic were published throughout
2010<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref></sup>; these highlighted
one RCT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref></sup> published
since the NICE review. This study investigated the superiority of
an eccentric loading programme plus PRP injection <italic>versus</italic> an
eccentric loading programme plus a saline injection for mid-substance Achilles
tendinopathy. No statistically significant difference between the
two treatments was found. However, this may be secondary to a type
II error, secondary to the small sample of 27 in each group for
this study. Despite there being no statistically significant findings,
the direction of the treatment effect was in favour of the PRP injection
group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref></sup></p><p>Although it could be argued that what is needed now is an appropriately
powered RCT to assess the clinical effectiveness of PRP, this further
pilot stage was essential. The trial described above studied a subgroup
of patients with Achilles tendinopathy who had not previously undergone an
eccentric loading programme,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref></sup> whereas
our population comprised only those who had undergone previous non-operative
management. Furthermore the recruitment strategy for the previous
study was through advertisement, meaning that their patients were
inherently motivated and subsequently compliant, as opposed to the
challenges faced by the patient presenting in a NHS tertiary referral
clinic. These differences therefore warranted further piloting of
trial process prior to undertaking a larger study.</p><p>No further RCTs in relation to mid-substance Achilles tendinopathy
have been published comparing PRP injections with traditional eccentric
loading exercises, but additional case series have. These have demonstrated clinically
relevant improvements in patient-reported outcome measures and,
in keeping with this study, no reported complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref></sup></p><p>It is clear that there is no definitive answer regarding the
superiority of PRP injections for patients with mid-substance Achilles
tendinopathy. This pilot study has demonstrated the feasibility
of conducting such a study in a United Kingdom NHS setting. Before
a full trial could be attempted, the limitations of this pilot study
would need to be addressed. The main considerations include the
blinding of assessors and recording of exercise adherence through
possible inclusion of patient diaries.</p><p>Additionally, given the relatively small number of patients required
for a full trial, further consideration will be required regarding
the randomisation procedures, such as stratifying for known confounding
factors. Finally there are also relative advantages and disadvantages
to the inclusion or exclusion of a placebo arm that should be carefully
considered. A placebo arm was included in the previous RCT,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref></sup> but not in our
pilot study. Our main reason for this omission was because a true
placebo injection for Achilles tendinopathy does not exist: both
saline injections and dry needling have both been advocated by NICE
as having a possible treatment effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref></sup> However, if a placebo arm could
be implemented not eliciting a treatment effect, then this could
provide an advantageous alternative to an active treatment arm to
determine treatment efficacy. Additionally if an active treatment
(such as the eccentric loading programme) is added to both treatment
arms, as it was in the previous RCT,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref></sup> there is an unknown interaction
effect of adding an eccentric loading treatment to demonstrate any
differences. Therefore these considerations must be weighed appropriately against
the potential importance of a placebo controlled trial for any future
studies.</p><p>The authors would like to acknowledge H. Richmond for her initial
