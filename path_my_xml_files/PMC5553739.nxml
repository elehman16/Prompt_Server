A common caveat of trials that establish efficacy of a given health service is the resource-intensive manner in which selected research therapists are trained and supervised to ensure the health service is delivered with fidelity so its hypothesized effects are adequately demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Replication of these training and technical assistance procedures to support community-based implementation is unrealistic in most settings. Consequent need for effective, affordable strategies to support community implementation of empirically supported health services casts a shadow over the prospect of their transport to community settings, including those wherein substance misuse is encountered. Notably, legislative policies in the United States of America (i.e., Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, 2008; Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 2010) have diversified such settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>&#x02018;Science-to-practice gaps&#x02019; in the addiction field extend to adolescent treatments and settings</title><p id="Par17">Dating back two decades to a widely cited Institute of Medicine report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], a persisting focus in the addiction field is bridging &#x02018;science-to-practice gaps.&#x02019; As estimated by the 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, a majority of the 1.3 million American adolescents with a substance use disorder struggle with marijuana specifically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Further, marijuana is a leading impetus for treatment admissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and linked to lesser neuropsychological functioning and academic performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and greater likelihood of school dropout, emergent psychopathology, and suicidality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Nevertheless, risk perceptions about marijuana use have declined among high school students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], perhaps a function of increasingly progressive legislation widening its public availability and permissibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Consequent demand for cost-effective, clinically useful marijuana-focused treatments for adolescents is high.</p><p id="Par18">Historically, addiction research has focused on adults, as evident in prominent trials comparing empirically supported therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] or evaluating their combination with medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Also of primary focus has been the addiction specialty care context, as evidenced in three dozen multisite protocols conducted by the National Institute on Drug Abuse via its Clinical Trials Network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Expanded inclusion of substance use disorders among essential conditions for which Americans may access health services has prompted treatment-seeking in other settings that serve as a point-of-contact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Schools are an example as 70&#x02013;80% of adolescents who access services doing so in schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Most school-based services lack empirical support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and introduction of empirically supported services (if effectively implemented by school personnel) may substantively improve public health efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Conceptual and empirical basis for the teen marijuana check-up</title><p id="Par19">Among prominent evidence-based therapies is Motivational Interviewing (MI), a &#x0201c;collaborative conversation style for strengthening a person&#x02019;s own motivation and commitment to change&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. An oft-studied brief adaptation of MI is Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET), typically structured as 1&#x02013;2 individual sessions wherein personal assessment data is gathered and explored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This brief structure and hallmark client-centered care philosophy were core features of a popular alcohol-focused approach, the Drinker&#x02019;s Check-Up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], which spurred similar self-referral interventions for specific populations and behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>A key challenge for implementing TMCU in schools</title><p id="Par20">As in other health fields, experimental controls inherent in adolescent treatment trials limit generalizability of resulting findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This is prominent among reasons for &#x02018;voltage drop,&#x02019; where effect size diminishes upon a therapy&#x02019;s community implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Though public demand for school-based services like TMCU is strong, the prospect of real-world TMCU implementation raises concerns about identification, training, and oversight of school-based personnel. Extant research on MI training conducted with a diverse workforce documents: (1) insufficiency of workshop training to cull durable skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], and (2) utility of post-workshop technical assistance via coaching and performance-based feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. While such technical assistance is broadly recommended to disseminate health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], key questions for schools at which TMCU is implemented are how much technical assistance personnel require.</p><p id="Par21">Given prominent concern about costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], much may be gained from identifying affordable strategies to avail technical assistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In efficacy trials, gold-standard technical assistance includes fidelity monitoring, provision of feedback on work-samples, and recurrent behavioral rehearsal opportunities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]&#x02014;all to assure research therapists maintain sufficient fidelity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Such gold-standard technical assistance was included for research therapists in TMCU efficacy trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Given scant resources at many schools, the prospect of replicating such procedures in support of TMCU implementation is understandably daunting. A consequent challenge is to identify alternative strategies whereby technical assistance is offered to resource-challenged schools without compromise to TMCU fidelity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Process control benchmarking: a promising TMCU implementation support strategy</title><p id="Par22">One potential option for affordable, effective technical assistance in implementing the TMCU is governance by process control benchmarking. This involves continual tracking of interventionist fidelity and comparison to a priori benchmarks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], whether conceptually derived performance standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], norms derived from a clinical database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], or aggregated efficacy trial data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. For the TMCU, this comparative process will be facilitated by existence of conceptually derived performance standards for MI/MET interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and fidelity data from efficacy trials encompassing a dozen research therapists and nearly 700 students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">A testable implementation support strategy utilizing process control benchmarking, aforementioned MI/MET performance standards, and prior TMCU efficacy trial data is a <italic>fidelity drift alarm</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. As school-based interventionists are subject to natural performance variance due to setting demands, student case-mix, and situational factors, a TMCU fidelity drift alarm would signal points of deviation from acceptable fidelity parameters, with an alarm bell prompting individually focused technical assistance. If occurring situationally, or &#x02018;as-needed,&#x02019; this is likely to diminish required resources. A fidelity drift alarm may be maintained (and re-calibrated, if appropriate) over time, thus allowing malleable and continual fidelity-monitoring. Relative to gold-standard technical assistance, this may be viable as a clinical and cost-effective method of technical assistance for schools to transition to lesser purveyor reliance. Moreover, it represents a sustainment strategy that may be applied to other empirically supported therapies implemented in schools.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Fidelity drift alarm</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13012_2017_633_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

Cost-effectiveness analysis compares differences in the incremental cost of TMCU to differences in its incremental effectiveness in reducing marijuana use to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. This ratio describes the additional cost to achieve a unit of desired outcome (i.e., cost per one fewer day of student marijuana use) in TMCU relative to waitlist/control. Cost-benefit analysis broadens the economic impact assessment by comparing intervention costs to the monetary value of reducing negative consequences (i.e., school absences, criminal activity, medical costs, and lost productivity among parents/caregivers. Monetary conversion factors for units of outcome (e.g., cost per criminal offense or cost per day missed from work) translate such outcomes into dollars, which can then be directly compared to intervention costs.

First, most adolescents who misuse substances evidence marijuana use disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], a leading impetus for youth treatment admissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Second, progressive legislation of medical/recreational marijuana use widens its public availability and cultural permissibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], while risk perceptions among high school students continually decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Third, over 95% of teens with a substance use disorder continue to attend school&#x02014;so school-based services should offer significant reach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Taken together, these issues underscore need for effective, affordable strategies to support transport of efficacious, marijuana-focused health services for use by school-based personnel. The described trial&#x02014;and its testing of a fidelity alarm bell as a method of purveyor technical assistance&#x02014;is designed to offer one such effort. Resulting trial findings are likely to hold implications for similar service transportability challenges across a range of health services and the community-based settings for which they are appropriate.</p><sec id="Sec39"><title>Innovation and potential impact</title><p id="Par64">The described trial offers innovation at multiple levels. Most broadly, its findings will address a salient gap in implementation science literature through examination of processes for purveyor introduction and support of an empirically supported health service. Though this trial will specifically examine implementation of a brief marijuana-focused intervention in schools, replication of many design features described herein may be appropriate for other trials. At the level of implementation strategies, this trial will test a novel approach whereby technical assistance is provided to school-based staff after initial training. As technical assistance processes remains an understudied topic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>], a clinically useful, affordable means to provide such support may hold considerable impact for therapy purveyors and community settings. Notably, the &#x02018;fidelity alarm bell&#x02019; to be tested retains core elements (i.e., purveyor fidelity monitoring, feedback, coaching) recommended for implementing MI/MET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and other therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. A final point concerns potential future interplay with ongoing validation work on automated MI/MET fidelity assessment methods that code session recordings via computer and transform fidelity indices as visual feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>].

Potential for selection bias exists for participating schools, interventionists, and students. Recruitment of schools that collaborated on prior TMCU trials may undermine generalizability of results, though both the multisite design and broad inclusion criteria for settings and interventionists mitigate this concern. With respect to TMCU effectiveness, student inclusion/exclusion criteria are consistent with those of prior efficacy trials and the intent of this targeted intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The trial responds to local demands in Washington state, where legalization of recreational marijuana use among adults has amplified public concern and demand for preventative services. Persisting variation in legislative marijuana policy, both domestically and abroad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>], suggests this local context be considered in eventual interpretation of trial findings. Measurement choices present additional caveats. Trial aims necessitate audio-recording of TMCU sessions, which for some may introduce social anxiety and impression management. These concerns appear not to extend to planned SP interactions, given strong evidence for valid, reliable MI fidelity estimates via this methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Reliance on student-report instruments to examine TMCU effectiveness is another caveat, particularly for marijuana use&#x02014;though use of invasive biological testing with minors would introduce greater scientific and pragmatic concerns. As in any trial, potential influence of unassessed third variables is a possible limitation. Further, alternative trial designs (i.e., cluster-randomization, stepped-wedge) may offer some potential benefits in efficiency, albeit not without introducing other unwanted caveats.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par66">This trial offers potential advancement for the implementation science field, specifically in its thorough examination of a data-driven technical assistance method to support long-term implementation of a marijuana-focused MET intervention in schools.

The described trial adds to other recent efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>] in furthering momentum for the adoption and effective implementation of efficacious therapies for youth populations through a focus on methods of purveyor technical assistance to assure quality in therapy delivery.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>%CR</term><def><p id="Par5">Percentage of reflections deemed to be &#x02018;complex&#x02019;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>%OQ</term><def><p id="Par6">Percentage of questions deemed to be &#x02018;open&#x02019;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSMB</term><def><p id="Par7">Data Safety Monitoring Board</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EPIS</term><def><p id="Par8">Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MET</term><def><p id="Par9">Motivational enhancement therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MI</term><def><p id="Par10">Motivational interviewing</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MINT</term><def><p id="Par11">Motivational Interviewing Network of Trainers</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>R:Q</term><def><p id="Par12">Ratio of reflections to questions</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par13">Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SP</term><def><p id="Par14">Standardized patient</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TMCU</term><def><p id="Par15">Teen Marijuana Check-Up</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Meg Brunner, MLIS for her assistance in creating manuscript figures.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par67">The described trial is funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, R01DA040650 A Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation Trial of a School-Based Teen Marijuana Check-Up), awarded to Walker, D. and Hartzler, B.
