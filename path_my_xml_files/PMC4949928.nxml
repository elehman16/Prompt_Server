The prevalence of CHF in French general practice is estimated to be about 10&#x000a0;% for patients aged over 59&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend medical and electrical management to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve quality of life. They also recommend non-pharmacological management including self-care management, patient education, and self-care behaviour to improve patients&#x02019; adherence to treatment and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>In France, patient education programmes delivered by multidisciplinary teams in outpatient clinics attached to hospitals have been assessed for their impact on rehospitalisation, mortality and participation rates in patients with heart failure (HF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, this does not reflect the situation of the majority of patients, most of whom are ambulatory and cared for by general practitioners (GPs). Only a few studies have assessed the effect of HF management programmes delivered in the primary care setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Others recruited patients in primary care but the intervention was delivered by practice nurses or doctors&#x02019; assistants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, these studies do not reflect the &#x02018;real-life&#x02019; situation of primary care in France, where practice nurses are rare at GP clinics. Therefore, more evidence is needed on the effect of patient education programmes delivered by GPs. As GPs are the doctors closest to patients, we hypothesised that a patient education delivered by them could improve the quality of life of patients with HF.</p><p>The <italic>Education Th&#x000e9;rapeutique des patients Insuffisants Cardiaques</italic> (ETIC; Therapeutic Education for Patients with Cardiac Failure) trial was designed to assess whether a pragmatic educational programme for patients with CHF delivered by trained GPs could improve the quality of life of patients with CHF compared with routine care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and randomisation</title><p>The study design has been published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The ETIC was a cluster randomised controlled clinical trial with general practices as the unit of randomisation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The trial was carried out in the four areas of the Auvergne region of France, with stratification on each. The trial is reported according to the extended CONSORT statement for cluster randomised trials. The ETIC was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (Registration Number: NCT01065142) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>General practitioner and patient flow chart.

Patients with NYHA Stage I HF were included because, even if asymptomatic, they had to manage the everyday manifestations of disease and might benefit from patient education; also, it was interesting to know whether the intervention had an impact on the evolution of NYHA HF stages. In contrast, the condition of patients with NYHA Stage IV HF seemed too advanced for educational sessions to have an impact on their quality of life, because patients were not included after a hospital discharge but were included in general practice with stable CHF. HFrEF was defined as an ejection fraction of &#x02264;40&#x000a0;%, whereas HFpEF was defined as an ejection fraction of &#x0003e;40&#x02013;50&#x000a0;% in combination with signs and/or symptoms of CHF and evidence of diastolic dysfunction (abnormal left-ventricular relaxation or diastolic stiffness) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Patients with severe cognitive disorders according to the GP&#x02019;s judgement, those institutionalised at the time of inclusion, those with NYHA Stage IV HF, those participating in another clinical trial and those lacking French language skills were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Instruments and outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome was patients&#x02019; quality of life, as measured by the MOS 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), a widely used generic instrument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ), an HF-specific instrument, both of which are considered good psychometric properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The SF-36 questionnaire consists of eight dimensions: physical function, role physical, body pain, general health, vitality, role emotional, mental health and social function. The SF-36 physical health score incorporates physical function, role physical, body pain and general health. The SF-36 mental health score incorporates vitality, role emotional, mental health and social function. SF-36 scores range from 0 to 100: 0 indicates the worst quality of life and 100 the best. MLHFQ score ranges from 0 to 105: 0 indicates best quality of life. Quality of life was assessed at baseline and at 7, 13 and 19&#x000a0;months using self-administered questionnaires completed by patients or their main caregiver within 7&#x000a0;days of their appointment with the GP. If the patient had literacy difficulties, the main caregiver interviewed the patient and filled out the questionnaire.</p><p>The secondary outcomes were: all-cause and HF-associated mortality; all-cause and HF-associated hospitalisations and the number of days spent in hospital; cumulative number of deaths of all causes or HF-associated hospitalisations and cumulative number of days of hospitalisation; cumulative number of cases of acute HF (an acute episode reported by the GP with or without hospitalisation); cumulative number of visits to a cardiologist and cumulative number of additional GP visits (in addition to those dedicated to the trial); adherence to therapy (using a self-administrated questionnaire at baseline and at the end of follow-up) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]; evolution of NYHA HF stage; and changes in weight and body mass index at 19&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Intervention</title><p>No medication was tested in this trial and GPs were allowed to adapt patients&#x02019; treatments if necessary. The GPs in the Intervention Group received a 2-day interactive workshop that trained them to deliver a patient education programme (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The intervention consisted of patient education on standardised topics: clinical alarm signs, physical activity, diet and cardiovascular risk factors. The GPs were trained to manage their own education objectives (e.g. diet, treatment adherence) and patients&#x02019; objectives (e.g. to be able to walk their grandchildren to school).

The education sessions were standardised in their timing (every 3&#x000a0;months) and the topics covered. The GPs received an education booklet with the topics covered and education tools (i.e.; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Dietary leaflets and information on clinical alarm signs). The first educational session (educational diagnosis) for patients occurred during Month 1 and covered several topics: lifestyle and dietary habits, physical activity, hobbies, leisure activities, projects and details of resources available to patients (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: The educational diagnosis summary). This first step was necessary to establish patients&#x02019; knowledge, attitude and motivation. Patients had a further four education sessions, at 4, 7, 10 and 13&#x000a0;months, followed by an overview session at 19&#x000a0;months. The patient education sessions were adapted to each patient, on the basis of the first education session at Month 1 and at each of the following visits, to match the needs and motivation of each patient. At the end of each visit, the patients fixed and agreed their own personal objectives with the GP (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: The education sessions summary).

Consequently, education sessions were simultaneously standardised in their topics and their timing (every 3&#x000a0;months) and personalised to individual patients. To assess the quality of the intervention, at the end of each education session the GPs reported what they did and the topics discussed (e.g. clinical alarm signs, physical activity, diet, cardiovascular risk factors and adherence; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: The education sessions summary).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Education intervention topics</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Knowledge</td><td>Do you suffer from heart failure?</td></tr><tr><td>Attitudes</td><td>What is &#x02018;heart failure&#x02019; for you?</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="5">Motivation</td><td>What do you know about heart failure?</td></tr><tr><td>How do you live with this disease?</td></tr><tr><td>What impact has heart failure had on your life (personal, professional, social)?</td></tr><tr><td>What are your fears?</td></tr><tr><td>What are your expectations?</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">Clinical alarm signs</td><td>For you, what could be a clinical alarm sign of your heart failure?</td></tr><tr><td>What should you do to detect clinical alarm signs?</td></tr><tr><td>Do you know what to do if you detect clinical alarm signs?</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">Physical activity</td><td>What does physical activity mean for you?</td></tr><tr><td>What physical activities do you undertake?

On the basis of several simulations, it was estimated that 40 GPs in general practices recruiting five patients each were required per group, resulting in the recruitment of 200 patients in each group. The statistician was blinded with regard to treatment allocation.</p><p>Statistical analyses were realised in intention to treat using Stata (version 13; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). The main analysis was performed with hierarchical linear regression models to estimate the effects of the intervention on SF-36 and MLHFQ scores for the post-baseline time points adjusted for the baseline score, as proposed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Random effects were used for practice, individuals within practices and repeated measurements per individual (slope and intercept). The results were expressed as the regression coefficient (b) and 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval (CI). Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) were presented by group. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was used to investigate the nature of the missing data and a per-protocol analysis was also performed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Recruitment of general practitioners and patients</title><p>An overview of the recruitment of GPs and patients is presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

The sample size was estimated by taking into account an anticipated ICC of between 0.1 and 0.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. According to the ICC results, the data were more dispersed for MLHFQ score (ICC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.11) than SF-36 scores (mental SF-36 and physical SF-36 ICC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01), which indicates that, in this context, the MLHFQ is probably more discriminative. These results could be useful for future studies in similar settings.</p><p>The quality of life scores at the end of follow-up at 19&#x000a0;months appeared surprisingly stable in the elderly patients enrolled in the ETIC study, especially the SF-36 physical health score, reflecting the natural progression of health-related quality of life in general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. We cannot attribute this to an effect of our education sessions, because this stability in quality of life was found in both groups. We propose that the act of participating in a study stabilised patients&#x02019; quality of life (an example of the Hawthorne effect). The same stability was found in another study involving patients with stable CHF conducted in primary care in Germany [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>We compared the number of additional GP consultations for all patients and observed no difference between the Intervention and Control Groups. However, among patients who consulted their GP, the mean number of consultations was significantly higher in the Intervention Group. This was not the case for visits to the cardiologist. These results are consistent with another study in the primary care setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Strengths and limitations of the trial</title><p>The ETIC was one of the largest trials in the primary care setting to study the effects of an educational intervention on patients with CHF. A cluster design was chosen for pragmatic reasons and to avoid contamination bias.</p><p>Reviews of studies on management programmes for patients with HF have shown mixed effects on hospital admissions, mortality and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. There was large variability in the complexity of case management, patient education, training of care managers and care settings. Overall positive effects on predominantly disease-specific quality of life were found in a short-term follow-up but the results observed during longer follow-ups were largely non significant. Short-term positive effects on quality of life were observed in hospitalised patients and those with acute HF, who exhibited low baseline scores, enabling short-term effects to be detected in comparison with controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The potential for improving the quality of life of patients recovering from hospitalisation may be higher than that of patients with stable disease treated in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The ETIC trial included patients with stable HF with relatively high baseline quality of life scores; perhaps it was unrealistic to attempt to improve the quality of life of this population, even if the follow-up period (19&#x000a0;months) was longer than in other studies.</p><p>The aim of this trial was a change of 12 points in the quality of life scores, to show not only a statistically significant but also a clinically relevant difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Although some studies tried to find a difference of five points in quality of life scores, others chose a difference of 12 points for the same reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, this difference cannot explain the absence of an effect. It is also the case for the power, because even if a difference of five points had been chosen, this study would not show a significant difference (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the intensity of the intervention delivered by the GPs may have been too low and other factors outside the disease-related intervention may have had a greater impact on quality of life. Quality of life is a multifactorial measure that may be too complex to be changed solely by GPs trained in patient education. Consequently, even if quality of life is a good clinical indicator of health status, it is probably difficult to show a significant improvement as the result of an intervention in an elderly population with stable HF. Rather, utilisation of healthcare and treatment optimisation or self-care behaviour may be more effective, measurable outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>The number of participants per site may seem inadequate but we sought the best balance between the number of GPs and the number of patients enrolled by each GP based on the capacity for inclusion and feasibility in terms of the workload (including the follow-up). Another team in Germany estimated the same capacity for inclusion per GP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Finally, it is important to note that each active GP contributed 4.3 (&#x000b1; 2) patients to the Control Group and 4.8 (&#x000b1; 1.8) patients to the Intervention Group whereas, according to the study design, the number of patients to be included in each group should have been five.</p><p>The limitations of this trial include a dropout rate of 36&#x000a0;% after randomisation among GPs, either because they withdrew consent to participate (31&#x000a0;%) or failed to recruit patients (5&#x000a0;%). Although the recruitment goal was not reached, the lack of significant difference between the randomised groups cannot be attributed to a lack of power: the effect size for the primary outcome was minimal (less than 0.27 [&#x02212;0.07&#x02013;0.61]) and the ICC was lower than expected, meaning that the sample size could have been smaller. In France, clinical research by GPs in primary care is still relatively new and this is one possible explanation for the high dropout rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Another explanation could be that GPs who agreed to participate but ultimately did not found the trial workload to be too heavy. The generalisability of the data from the remaining GPs who participated in the ETIC trial can be considered good, because they are very similar to the national characteristics of GPs as assessed in 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Furthermore, the characteristics of the patients included were similar to those of patients with CHF in France in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>At baseline, the patients&#x02019; characteristics were similar, except that those in the Intervention Group were more likely to be overweight or obese compared with those in the Control Group. The same difference was found at the end of follow-up. The patients had a similar quality of life according to the SF-36 but, although without statistical significance, MLHFQ scores were worse in the Intervention Group (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.07). One possible explanation is that selection bias was present: the training received by the GPs in the Intervention Group may have made them feel more competent and, therefore, they may have included more severely ill patients in the trial. To avoid this bias, we could have randomised the GPs after they had recruited their patients, using Zelen&#x02019;s method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, this option was not feasible because of the short life expectancy of the patients: we considered the mean age of patients at the time of inclusion to be high, at 74&#x000a0;years. It was inadvisable to recruit patients over a period longer than 1&#x000a0;year and then randomise the GPs to receive training.</p><p>As the ETIC population was a population with a good quality of life and with a significant proportion of patients with HFpEF, our results could not be extrapolated to patients with HFrEF and a poor quality of life. Most of the patients in our study had HFpEF and, as treatment is not conclusively known to be of benefit in such patients, we hypothesise that it is the same with patient education. However, when outcomes were stratified according to HFrEF and HFpEF, the type of HF had no influence. We failed to demonstrate an impact of our intervention regardless of the type of HF.</p><p>To assess the quality of the intervention, at the end of each education session the GPs reported what they did and the topics discussed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, we cannot make any inferences on the intensity of the intervention delivered by the GPs in the Intervention Group. It is possible that a 2-day workshop is insufficient to teach GPs how to conduct successful counselling of HF patients regarding lifestyle. However, a longer workshop may be unrealistic for GPs and would not equate to a pragmatic design suitable for everyday practice. Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility that we were unable to observe an effect of the intervention because of the inclusion of motivated GPs with a special interest in the topic in both trial arms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Patient education delivered by GPs to elderly patients with stable CHF in the ETIC programme did not achieve an improvement in their quality of life compared with routine care.
