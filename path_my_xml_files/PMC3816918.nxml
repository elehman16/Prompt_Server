However, metformin alone frequently fails to maintain glycemic control in the long term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), and most patients with type 2 diabetes will require additional therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Although initially effective, sulfonylureas are associated with low durability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), and common side effects are hypoglycemia and weight gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Furthermore, as type 2 diabetes progresses, with deterioration of &#x003b2;-cell function and increased insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), the use of agents utilizing pathways dependent on insulin becomes increasingly difficult. In addition, steady increases in weight are observed in patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), which may be associated with worsening markers of insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Thus, there is still a great unmet need for effective and well-tolerated antidiabetes agents that can be used in combination with existing treatments to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes, in particular without the risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain.</p><p>The sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), located in the proximal tubule of the kidney, represents a promising target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. SGLT2 is responsible for tubular reabsorption of &#x0223c;90% of the glomerular filtrated glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). In patients with type 2 diabetes, inhibition of SGLT2 leads to reduced renal glucose reabsorption and increased urinary glucose excretion, resulting in a reduction in hyperglycemia, irrespective of &#x003b2;-cell function or insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>Empagliflozin is a potent and selective inhibitor of SGLT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In phase II trials in patients with type 2 diabetes, a 12-week treatment with empagliflozin as monotherapy or as add-on to metformin resulted in reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, weight, and blood pressure and was well tolerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). These effects were shown to be sustained for up to 90 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>The aim of this study (EMPA-REG METSU) was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of empagliflozin (10 and 25 mg once daily) versus placebo over 24 weeks as add-on therapy to metformin plus sulfonylurea in patients with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycemic control. In addition, the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin 25 mg was investigated in poorly controlled patients with HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003e;10% in an open-label treatment arm.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase III study conducted from July 2010 to February 2012 in 148 centers in 12 countries (Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Korea, Mexico, Slovakia, Slovenia, Taiwan, Turkey, and the U.S.). The clinical trial protocol was approved by the institutional review boards and independent ethics committees and competent authorities of the participating centers, and the trial complied with the Declaration of Helsinki, in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice.

Randomization was performed using a third-party interactive voice and web response system and was stratified by HbA<sub>1c</sub> (&#x0003c;8.5 and &#x02265;8.5%), eGFR (&#x02265;90, 60&#x02013;89, and 30&#x02013;59 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>; Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation), and region (Europe, Asia, North America, and Latin America). Patients allocated to the open-label arm received empagliflozin 25 mg for 24 weeks without run-in. Study visits were scheduled at screening; at the start of the placebo run-in period (randomized patients only); and at weeks 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24.

Change from baseline in 2-h postprandial glucose (PPG) was assessed in a subset of patients based on a meal tolerance test (MTT) performed at baseline and week 24.</p><p>Safety end points included vital signs, clinical laboratory parameters, 12-lead electrocardiogram, and adverse events (AEs; preferred terms coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities version 14.1). AEs included all events with an onset after the first dose of trial medication up to a period of 7 days after the last dose. AEs of special interest included confirmed hypoglycemic AEs (plasma glucose &#x02264;3.9 mmol/L and/or requiring assistance) and events consistent with urinary tract infection (UTI) and genital infection.

Safety and lipid parameters were analyzed in the treated set (patients treated with one or more doses of study drug).</p><p>Values observed after a patient started rescue medication were set to missing. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach was used to impute missing continuous efficacy data. MDG was also analyzed based on observed cases (OCs). Categorical efficacy variables were analyzed using noncompleters considered failure imputation. LOCF-IR imputation (i.e., LOCF without setting values after rescue therapy to missing) was used for analysis of lipid parameters. Analyses of efficacy end points in the open-label set were based on OC.</p><p>The primary end point was assessed using an ANCOVA model, with treatment, region, and eGFR at baseline as fixed effects and baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> as a linear covariate. Key secondary and continuous exploratory end points were analyzed using the statistical model described for the primary end point, with the baseline value for the end point in question as an additional linear covariate. Changes over time in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, FPG, and blood pressure were analyzed using restricted maximum likelihood&#x02013;based mixed model repeated measures. Categorical change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> and the proportion of patients with &#x0003e;5% weight loss were analyzed using logistic regression.</p><p>Treatment differences versus placebo in primary and key secondary end points were tested using a hierarchical testing approach for each dose at a significance level of 2.5% (two sided) to maintain the overall type I error at 5%. All other exploratory tests were two sided at a 5% level (no multiplicity adjustment).

Both doses led to clinically meaningful improvements in glycemic control, body weight, and SBP (but not DBP) with a good tolerability and safety profile.</p><p>Guidelines recommend that patients who fail to achieve adequate glycemic control with metformin monotherapy receive an additional agent such as sulfonylurea, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor, a thiazolidinedione, or basal insulin. When combination therapy fails to achieve adequate glycemic control, insulin therapy is usually the most appropriate third-line treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Although efficacious, insulin is associated with side effects such weight gain and hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). In this trial, the addition of empagliflozin to metformin and sulfonylurea led to significant reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, with 26&#x02013;32% of patients reaching HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7.0% at week 24 compared with only 9% in the placebo group. Improved glucose control was further demonstrated by significant reductions in MDG, FPG, and 2-h PPG with empagliflozin compared with placebo. Changes in MDG, assessed based on OC analysis, corresponded well with changes in HbA<sub>1c</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). A beneficial effect of empagliflozin on glucose control was also observed in patients with very poor glycemic control at baseline, in whom HbA<sub>1c</sub> was reduced from a mean of 11.2&#x02013;8.2% at week 24. These results suggest that empagliflozin is efficacious over a broad HbA<sub>1c</sub> range. Further, empagliflozin was shown to be efficacious in a patient population that included a substantial number of patients with a long duration of type 2 diabetes (77% of randomized patients had been diagnosed &#x0003e;5 years before the trial). Significant reductions in body weight and waist circumference were observed with empagliflozin compared with placebo, and 24&#x02013;28% of patients on empagliflozin had a &#x0003e;5% reduction in weight at week 24, compared with only 6% on placebo. Weight control is important for patients with type 2 diabetes to help improve glycemic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and improve cardiovascular risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), and is particularly pertinent for patients taking a sulfonylurea. Treatment with sulfonylurea is associated with weight gain, a side effect that has been shown to reduce patient satisfaction and adherence to medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>Hypertension is an important cardiovascular risk factor associated with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In this study, a significant reduction in SBP was observed with empagliflozin compared with placebo, without an increase in pulse rate. This may reflect osmotic diuresis associated with urinary glucose excretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), which may also explain the small increase in hematocrit. Unexpectedly, no reduction in DBP was observed at week 24. As a limitation of the study, changes in antihypertensive medication were allowed, possibly diluting the effect of empagliflozin versus placebo on blood pressure. A reduction in uric acid levels was observed in patients treated with empagliflozin, compared with an increase in patients on placebo. In many epidemiological studies, lower uric acid levels have been associated with lower cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p><p>Empagliflozin was well tolerated when used as add-on therapy to metformin plus sulfonylurea for 24 weeks. More patients reported serious AEs with placebo than empagliflozin, and the number of patients who discontinued due to AEs was similar between the randomized empagliflozin groups and the placebo group. More randomized patients reported confirmed hypoglycemic events with empagliflozin than with placebo. This suggests that empagliflozin in combination with sulfonylurea may increase the risk of hypoglycemia, whereas empagliflozin alone has a low risk of hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Importantly, empagliflozin as add-on to on metformin plus sulfonylurea did not cause any hypoglycemic events that required assistance.</p><p>Patients with type 2 diabetes, particularly female patients, are at increased risk of UTIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>); however, the reported incidence varies between trials due to different reporting methods. In this trial, the proportion of patients with events consistent with UTI was slightly higher with empagliflozin 10 mg than with empagliflozin 25 mg or placebo, and the proportion of patients reporting genital infections was higher with empagliflozin than with placebo. This is consistent with data on other SGLT2 inhibitors, which show that a higher proportion of patients report genital infections with the SGLT2 inhibitor versus placebo, but the proportion of patients who report UTIs is similar or only slightly higher with SGLT2 inhibitor versus placebo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p><p>Empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg showed no difference in efficacy or tolerability in this trial, even though a dose-dependent increase in urinary glucose excretion and a dose-dependent decrease in HbA<sub>1c</sub> have been reported in phase I/II studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Dose dependency of empagliflozin will be evaluated based on the totality of data from phase III trials comprising more than 10,000 patients.</p><p>To conclude, in this trial, empagliflozin at doses of 10 and 25 mg led to clinically meaningful improvements in glycemic control in patients with inadequate control on metformin plus sulfonylurea, led to significant reductions in body weight and SBP, and was well tolerated over 24 weeks. These results demonstrate the potential of empagliflozin as a third-line therapy in patients inadequately controlled with metformin plus a sulfonylurea.</p></sec>
