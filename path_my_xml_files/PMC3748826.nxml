hyperthyroidism is an autoimmune disease causing hyperfunction of the thyroid gland. The concentration of selenium is high in the thyroid gland and two important groups of enzymes within the thyroid are selenoproteins, that is, they depend on selenium. Selenium may have beneficial effects on autoimmune hypothyroidism and on Graves' orbitopathy, but the effects of selenium on Graves' hyperthyroidism is unknown.</p><p>We hypothesize that adjuvant selenium may be beneficial in the treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism. The objective is to investigate if selenium supplementation plus standard treatment with anti-thyroid drugs versus standard treatment with anti-thyroid drugs will lead to a decrease in anti-thyroid drug treatment failure (that is, failure to remain euthyroid, without further treatment, one year after cessation of anti-thyroid drug treatment), faster and longer lasting remission (that is, anti-thyroid drug treatment success), and improved quality of life in patients with Graves&#x02019; hyperthyroidism.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><p>The trial is an investigator-initiated, randomised, blinded, multicentre clinical trial. Inclusion criteria are: age 18 years or older; diagnosis of active Graves' hyperthyroidism within the last two months; and informed consent. Exclusion criteria are major co-morbidity; previous radioactive iodine treatment; ongoing anti-thyroid drug treatment for more than two months; treatment with immunomodulatory drugs; known allergy towards the components in the selenium and placebo pills; pregnancy or breast-feeding; and intake of selenium supplementation above 70 &#x003bc;g per day. We plan to include 492 participants, randomised (1:1) to two tablets of 100 &#x003bc;g selenium once daily for the 24 to 30 months intervention period versus two identical placebo tablets once daily.</p><p>The primary outcome is the proportion of participants with anti-thyroid drug treatment failure (see above) at the end of the intervention period (24 to 30 months). Secondary outcomes are: thyroid-specific quality of life during the first year after randomisation; level of thyroid stimulating hormone-receptor antibodies at 18 months after randomisation and at the end of the intervention period (24 to 30 months); hyperthyroid symptoms during the first year after randomisation; eye symptoms during the first year after randomisation, and at the end of the intervention period (24 to 30 months); adverse reactions during the intervention period; and serious adverse events during the intervention period.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>It was of great importance to the initiators of this trial, that the results would be directly applicable to daily clinical practice. Therefore, it was designed as a pragmatic trial: the patients follow their usual treatment at their usual hospitals. In order to still collect high quality data on the clinical course and quality of life, an elaborate trial management system was designed to keep track of patient input, need for trial personnel input and action, and to collect data from medical chart systems. Meticulous follow-up on missing responses to the QoL measurements has been incorporated into the system, to minimise missing quality of life data. Monitoring of adverse reactions and events is achieved by thorough instruction of the participants, surveillance of patient-reported outcomes, and integration with national databases regarding hospitalizations. A very long intervention period was necessary, since patients are not considered in remission until one year after stopping anti-thyroid drugs. Usually, patients are treated for 12 to 18 months with anti-thyroid drugs, yielding a total intervention period of 24 to 30 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01611896">NCT01611896</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Graves' disease</kwd><kwd>Selenium supplementation</kwd><kwd>Pragmatic trial</kwd><kwd>Quality of life</kwd><kwd>ThyPRO</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Graves&#x02019; hyperthyroidism is an autoimmune disease causing hyperfunction of the thyroid gland by a mechanism, where auto-antibodies bind to and stimulate the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor. It affects individuals of all ages and is five to ten times more common in women than in men, with an overall annual incidence in Denmark of about 1,700 patients in 5.5 million people
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Treatment of Graves&#x02019; hyperthyroidism comprise: 1) anti-thyroid drugs (ATD) (for example, methimazole or propylthiouracil); 2) thyroidectomy, that is, surgical removal of the thyroid gland, and 3) radioactive iodine treatment (I<sup>131</sup>), which permanently reduces thyroid function. In Europe, the primary treatment is usually ATD, which leads to resolution of hyperthyroidism (that is, euthyroidism) in 85% to 90% of patients within 6 weeks
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This treatment is usually continued for a period of 12 to 18 months and then tapered off (ATD treatment withdrawal). However, 30% to 60% of patients will experience relapse of hyperthyroidism during the following years
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism suffer from a wide range of symptoms and have major impairments in most areas of quality of life (QoL)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Selenium is an essential trace element important for human health. The main dietary sources of selenium in Denmark are meat, poultry, dairy products, bread, cereals and fish
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The recommended daily intake of selenium is 40 &#x003bc;g for women and 50 &#x003bc;g for men. The estimated actual daily intake in Denmark is considered sufficient, but it cannot be ruled out that about 10% of the Danish population could benefit from selenium supplementation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The upper tolerable level of selenium intake is set to 400 &#x003bc;g per day in the USA
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and 300 &#x003bc;g per day in the EU
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The thyroid gland has the highest selenium concentration per unit weight among all tissues. Selenium is incorporated into key enzymes involved in several metabolic pathways. The main selenoprotein families are the glutathione peroxidases, the thioredoxin reductases and the iodothyronine deiodinases
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It is hypothesized that the glutathione peroxidases and the thioredoxin reductases participate in a complex defence system maintaining normal thyroid function by protecting the gland from both hydrogen peroxide, which is produced by the thyrocytes, and reactive oxygen intermediates
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. It has thus been hypothesized, that selenium may have a beneficial role in autoimmune thyroid diseases, by blunting the autoimmune process.</p><p>We have not identified any published randomised trials of selenium supplementation in patients with Graves&#x02019; hyperthyroidism. On ClinicalTrials.gov, one ongoing randomised trial is registered on selenium supplementation in Graves&#x02019; thyrotoxicosis (NCT01247077). This trial assesses neuropsychological well-being (not otherwise specified), after nine months intake of 200 &#x003bc;g selenium, and includes 44 participants. In a multicentre trial among 159 patients with mild Graves' orbitopathy, without hyperthyroidism, 200 &#x003bc;g selenium selenite improved disease-specific QoL (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.001) and reduced eye disease severity (<italic>P =</italic> 0.01)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Another trial evaluated the effect of adding a mixture of antioxidants, including 60 &#x003bc;g of selenium (not otherwise specified) to standard ATD treatment in 29 patients with Graves' disease. During the 60-day follow up period euthyroidism was reached more rapidly in patients receiving antioxidants
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In contrast, several randomised trials have evaluated the effect of selenium on the other major autoimmune thyroid disease: autoimmune hypothyroidism. In six
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] of seven
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] placebo-controlled clinical trials, selenium treatment reduced thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) levels, indicating a beneficial effect on the autoimmune activity.</p><p>We hypothesize that the addition of selenium supplementation to the standard treatment with ATD in patients with active Graves&#x02019; hyperthyroidism will lead to a decrease in ATD treatment failure (that is, fewer patients with relapse), faster remission, and improved quality of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective is to investigate the effect of selenium supplementation on the proportion of participants with ATD treatment failure, that is, failure to remain euthyroid without further treatment one year after cessation of ATD treatment.</p><p>The secondary objectives are to investigate the effect on thyroid-specific QoL, level of TSH-receptor antibody (TRAb), hyperthyroid symptoms, eye symptoms, adverse reactions, and serious adverse events. Further, we wish to explore the effect of selenium on ATD treatment duration, incidence of Graves' orbitopathy, and hypothyroid symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>The GRASS (GRAves&#x02019; disease Selenium Supplementation trial) trial is an investigator-initiated, randomised, blinded, multicentre clinical trial of selenium supplementation versus placebo in patients with Graves&#x02019; hyperthyroidism. The trial has a parallel-arm design with 1:1 allocation to the experimental intervention group and the control intervention group, and involving seven clinical trial sites in Denmark (see Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The trial also includes a questionnaire and register-based follow up period up to ten years after completion of the intervention period.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Trial flow chart.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-14-119-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Trial participants</title><p>All patients with current hyperthyroidism, who are referred to or being followed at the participating clinical trial sites, are considered for participation. Patients are eligible for the GRASS trial, if they comply with the following inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>The inclusion criteria are: Graves&#x02019; hyperthyroidism (first-time diagnosis, defined as patients not yet receiving ATD treatment, or having received ATD treatment continuously for less than two months, or relapse of Graves&#x02019; hyperthyroidism defined as patients previously having received and discontinued treatment with ATD); active Graves' hyperthyroidism (TSH &#x0003c;0.1 mU/L and positive TRAb according to local laboratory results) measured within the last two months prior to the inclusion date; age 18 years or older; provision of written informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>The exclusion criteria are: major co-morbidity, rendering the participants unlikely to continuously receive the trial intervention; previous treatment with radioactive iodine; ongoing ATD treatment for more than two months; treatment with immunomodulatory drugs, such as cyclosporine A, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide; allergy to the components in the selenium and placebo pills; pregnancy or breast-feeding; intake of selenium supplementation above 70 &#x003bc;g per day; inability to read and understand Danish; lack of provision of informed consent.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Trial intervention</title><sec><title>Selenium</title><p>The compound used in this trial is organic selenium, in the form of selenium yeast, which mainly consists of selenomethionine. The specific product is Organisk selen, 100 &#x003bc;g tablets and is produced by Jemo-Pharm A/S, Stege, Denmark (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jemo-pharm.dk/frame.cfm/cms/id=977/sprog=2/grp=6/menu=1/">http://www.jemo-pharm.dk/frame.cfm/cms/id=977/sprog=2/grp=6/menu=1/</ext-link>). The daily dose is set at 200 &#x003bc;g (two tablets taken in the morning). The trial dosage is based on the available clinical data, is not considered to cause adverse reactions, and is lower than the upper tolerable intake level of 300 &#x003bc;g per day
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Placebo</title><p>Placebo tablets, identical in size, appearance, taste, smell, and solubility to the experimental intervention tablet are produced by Jemo-Pharm A/S. They have the same content as Organisk selen but are without selenium, as the selenium yeast has been exchanged with yeast grown in selenium-deplete media. The placebo regimen is identical to the selenium regimen.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation</title><p>Randomisation will be performed centrally. The allocation sequence is computer-generated with a varying block size kept unknown to the investigators. Randomisation is stratified by clinical trial site and disease status (incident or relapse), and the allocation ratio is 1:1.</p></sec><sec><title>Informed consent procedure</title><p>Potential participants are identified at referral or visits to the outpatient clinics and include all patients with current hyperthyroidism (that is, elevated thyroid hormone levels). Where Graves&#x02019; hyperthyroidism is confirmed (that is, TRAb is positive), the potential participant is invited to an information visit by letter. The visit consists of obtaining history, blood sampling, information about trial contact, and randomisation.</p></sec><sec><title>Duration</title><p>The intervention period for each participant will be 24 to 30 months, as selenium will be given until 12 months after cessation of ATD treatment, which usually lasts 12 to 18 months (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The total trial duration is expected to be about 4 years (inclusion period about 17 months and up to 30 months intervention period).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Duration of the intervention.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-14-119-2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Concomitant medication or treatment</title><p>The trial participants receive conventional ATD treatment. Treatment of hyperthyroidism, will take place within the participating clinical trial sites, according to the clinical standards set by the departments. ATD treatment withdrawal must be considered or attempted 18 months after randomisation at the latest.</p><p>Participants are advised not to take extra selenium supplementation during the trial. A dose of &#x0003c;70 &#x003bc;g per day is allowed (the content in multivitamin tablets is 55 &#x003bc;g). The participants&#x02019; consumption of additional selenium supplements will be monitored during the trial through self-report forms.</p></sec><sec><title>Monitoring for intervention compliance</title><p>Participant compliance with the intervention will be monitored by self-reported tablet intake at 6 and 12 weeks, and 6, 12 and 24 months (Table&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), and by tablet-counting at trial visits at 18 months and at the end of the intervention (24 to 30 months).

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], according to epidemiological studies in areas with very high selenium content in the soil. Thus, no signs of chronic intoxication have been observed in areas with daily intakes of up to about 800 &#x003bc;g daily.

Therefore, it was decided to conduct a pragmatic trial
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], with as little interference with daily clinical practice as possible. This could be accomplished by letting the patients follow their usual treatment at their usual hospitals by whichever physician was involved in their treatment. At the same time, we found it important to collect high quality data on the clinical course and QoL. We have, therefore, put great effort into the design of a trial management system, which could solve this schism of distance from participants compared to close monitoring. The system initiates and keeps track of patient input (QoL-measurements and other patient-reported outcomes), identifies need for trial personnel input and action, and collects data on thyroid function from medical chart systems. The system also identifies the site of the information-provider, as well as the disease status of new participants, and delivers randomisation codes stratified by site and disease status. Meticulous follow up on missing responses to the QoL measurements is incorporated into the system, to minimise the usual major problem with missing QoL data in clinical trials.</p><p>Somewhat similarly, the need to monitor adverse reactions and events in accordance with the ICH guidelines was in conflict with the intent to interfere as little as possible and with the fact that no previous selenium trial has identified any adverse reactions, which would also be quite surprising, given the wide therapeutic range of this dietary supplement. This is solved by a combination of thorough instruction of the participants to contact their trial person in case of symptoms indicative of adverse reactions or events, surveillance of patient-responses to prompts through the trial management system, and integration with national databases regarding hospitalizations.</p><p>The third issue was the decision to continue trial intervention until one year after stopping anti-thyroid drugs (ATD treatment withdrawal). Patients are not considered in remission unless they are still euthyroid one year after stopping medication. Since selenium is considered to have an attenuating effect on thyroid autoimmunity, a long duration of treatment was considered necessary to test our hypothesis, that is, that selenium can indeed lead to more patients staying in remission (and not just reaching euthyroidism faster and obtaining better QoL).</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>The first patient was enrolled in December 2012.</p></sec><sec><title>piations</title><p>ATD: Anti-thyroid drug; AR: Adverse reaction; CAS: Clinical activity score; CRF: Case report form; GCP: Good Clinical Practice; ICH: International Conference on Harmonization; QoL: Quality of life; SAE: Serious adverse event; SAR: Serious adverse reaction; s-Se: Serum selenium; SmPC: Summary of products characteristics; SUSAR: Suspected serious adverse reaction; T3: Triiodothyronine; T4: Thyroxine; ThyPRO: Thyroid patient related outcome (thyroid-specific quality of life questionnaire); TPOAb: Thyroid peroxidase antibody; TSH: Thyroid stimulating hormone; TRAb: Thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibody (TSH receptor antibody).</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interest</title><p>None of the investigators have any financial or non-financial competing interest.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p>All authors contributed to the design of the trial, preparation and review of the manuscript and all authors read and approved the final manuscript.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Funding</title><p>The GRASS trial is part of the ThyQoL project, a strategic project headed by Ulla Feldt-Rasmussen and funded by the The Danish Agency for Science, Technology and Innovation (grant 271-09-0143).
