The immersion treatment programme was costly.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RCT to explore the long-term effects of a camp-based intervention in which both children and parents with obesity undergo a long-term immersion treatment programme. Although a recent review<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> reported on average 20% reduction of overweight at follow-up, the observational uncontrolled design and short follow-up of these studies may have inflated the results. Nevertheless, a Belgian randomised controlled study of children aged 7&#x02013;16&#x02005;years who participated in a healthy-eating lifestyle programme at a 10-day summer camp, demonstrated more than 10% reduction in percent overweight at 1-year and 5-year follow-up.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
