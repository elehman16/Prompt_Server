In addition, everolimus initiation between 4 and 6 weeks after surgery appears to provide a better safety profile as compared with immediate initiation, retaining antirejection efficacy, whereas everolimus discontinuation due to AEs appears to be more frequent when the drug is initiated in the immediate postoperative period. On the other hand, CMV infection was more common with delayed rather than early everolimus initiation.</p><p>To date, 4 multicenter randomized studies have evaluated the efficacy of everolimus combined with CsA in de novo HTx recipients with major differences in everolimus dosing and administration strategies.<sup><xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> PCEs and PLEs were reported more frequently in the everolimus arm in 2 of the 4 studies,<sup><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> which is consistent with the higher incidence in the EVR-I arm (44.9%, EVR-I arm vs 32.6%, EVR-D arm), for which everolimus was introduced within 5 days of HTx. Therefore, we suggest that delayed everolimus initiation could markedly reduce the incidence of critical AEs, like PCEs/PLEs, which can compromise safety in heart transplant recipients.</p><p>Previous studies in which everolimus was introduced with sCsA in the immediate postoperative period,<sup><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> impaired renal function appeared as a concern.<sup><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In contrast, renal insufficiency events in the present study were low; moreover, eGFR was maintained and not significantly different between study arms probably because everolimus initiation was concomitant with CsA reduction in both the arms. In this context, a recent randomized study demonstrated that CsA discontinuation combined with everolimus and MMF at weeks 7 to 11 after transplantation improved renal function versus sCsA and MMF,<sup><xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> but was associated with higher rate of BPAR. In our study, both everolimus arms with reduced-dose CsA showed stable renal function during the study period (<bold>Figure S2, SDC,</bold>
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/TP/B489">http://links.lww.com/TP/B489</ext-link>), suggesting a strategy of effective compromise between the risk of BPAR and the need to preserve renal function.</p><p>Previous studies<sup><xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and a meta-analysis by Zuckermann et al<sup><xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> revealed a high incidence of wound healing delays in the everolimus arms compared with the standard calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) arms. A systematic review by Pengel et al,<sup><xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> involving 4 HTx studies, found that patients receiving mTORis experienced more wound complications (OR, 1.82, 95% CI, 1.15-2.87). However, sirolimus was used in 2 of these studies,<sup><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> and wound infections alone were categorized as wound healing complications in 1 study involving everolimus.<sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Although none of these studies was statistically powered to determine significant differences in early AE occurrence, there existed a rather homogeneous understanding among clinicians that surgical trauma and patient frailty seem to amplify wound complications with an everolimus-based regimen. In the present study, however, the frequency of wound healing delays in the EVR-D arm (11.2%, EVR-I vs 8.7%, EVR-D) was lower than that reported previously as AEs,<sup><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> thereby indicating that delayed everolimus initiation could help prevent this complication.</p><p>Composite efficacy endpoint of BPAR, rejection with hemodynamic compromise, graft loss, or death was not significantly different between the EVR-I and EVR-D arms. Nonetheless, the numerically higher incidence in the EVR-I arm was mainly driven by BPAR &#x02265; 2R, which was higher than that reported previously.<sup><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>Kobashigawa et al<sup><xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> previously reported that an everolimus-based regimen initiated within 72 hours post-HTx is associated with a lower incidence of CMV infections compared with azathioprine- or MMF-based regimens. Indeed, the risk of CMV disease in our study was significantly higher in the EVR-D versus EVR-I arms, indicating that delayed initiation may not alleviate baseline CMV infection, most likely because preemptive strategy was usually preferred over prophylaxis in most centers, thereby exposing the patients to high risk of early reactivation during the initial phase of MMF intake.</p><p>Evidence from randomized trials and observational studies support the concept that everolimus improves long-term outcomes by reducing early CAV development and malignancy onset.<sup><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Thus, if the goal of everolimus-based therapies is long-term benefit, a strategy that avoids early toxicity could improve patient management, reduce the chances of early discontinuation, and increase potential benefits for patients.</p><p>The main limitation of this study was a slightly underpowered sample size, resulting from dramatic decrease in the number of HTx procedures performed in Italy during the study period. Patient enrollment began in June 2009 and had to be repeatedly prolonged until December 2013. When the study was first designed, 320 to 350 HTx procedures/year were being performed in Italy.<sup><xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> However, since initiation, the number of procedures dramatically reduced to less than 250 cases/year. To avoid excessive prolongation of study period, we terminated enrollment at 93% of the planned population, accounting for a 77% power for the initial assumptions. The study power was additionally affected by the discrepancy between expected versus observed incidences of the primary endpoint.<sup><xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The use of CsA instead of tacrolimus, the current CNI of choice, may appear as another study limitation. However, little clinical evidence of tacrolimus and everolimus was available when the study was designed; moreover, the objective of our study was evaluation of everolimus-related safety profile, rather than the CNI combination therapy. Finally, it must be noted that as in most of randomized controlled studies, the current cohort of patients represents a healthier subgroup when compared with the overall population of patients undergoing HTx. It is possible that this selection may be driven by the need for patient stability between screening and randomization at day 5, with unstable patients unlikely to get enrolled.</p><p>In conclusion, in the context of an immunosuppressive regimen based on everolimus and reduced-dose CsA, delayed initiation of everolimus with MMF as a bridge appears to provide a better safety profile than immediate initiation, by reducing the incidence of PCEs, especially those requiring pericardiocentesis, and by improving overall drug tolerability, with less AE-driven discontinuations, without compromising antirejection efficacy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx" xlink:href="tp-102-493-s001.docx" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e874" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx" xlink:href="tp-102-493-s002.docx" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e875" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx" xlink:href="tp-102-493-s003.docx" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e876" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank Raffaella Guarisco, Vincenza Vinaccia, and Marta Bartezaghi, Novartis Pharma, Italy, and Prachiti Narvekar, Novartis Healthcare Pvt.
