Data from four double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies (two with 6-month open-label extension phases) and a 1-year, open-label safety study were included. Safety measures included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), adverse events leading to discontinuation, serious adverse events (SAEs), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and electrocardiograms. The most common TEAEs for short-term treatment with duloxetine were nausea (29.3%), headache (20.0%), dry mouth (18.2%), insomnia (14.5%), fatigue (13.5%), constipation (14.5%), diarrhea (11.6%), and dizziness (11.0%; all <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 vs. placebo). Most TEAEs emerged early and were mild to moderate in severity. The profile of adverse events in patients enrolled at least 6&#x000a0;months, and for patients in the 1-year study, was similar to that found in the short-term treatment studies, with no new adverse events emerging at a notable rate. About 20% of patients discontinued due to adverse events in the short-term treatment studies and in the 1-year study. SAEs were uncommon, and none occurred at a significantly higher frequency for duloxetine compared with placebo. Mean changes in vital signs and weight were small. Rates of treatment-emergent potentially clinically significant (PCS) vital sign, laboratory, and electrocardiogram measures were low, with only PCS rates of alanine aminotransferase being significantly higher for duloxetine compared with placebo in the placebo-controlled treatment studies. In the 1-year study, four patients (1.1%) had suicide-related behavior. The data provided here summarize short- and long-term safety from five clinical studies in patients treated with duloxetine for fibromyalgia. In addition, postmarketing surveillance continues for adverse events reported with duloxetine in fibromyalgia, as in other indications.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Adverse events</kwd><kwd>Duloxetine</kwd><kwd>Fibromyalgia</kwd><kwd>Safety</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Clinical Rheumatology 2009</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic musculoskeletal disorder characterized by widespread pain. The overall prevalence of FM is about 2%, although rates are higher for women compared with men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. FM is associated with substantial functional disability, work impairments, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and high rates of health care utilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>To diagnose primary FM, pain must be evident in all four quadrants along with axial skeletal pain for at least 3&#x000a0;months and tenderness must be elicited on physical exam at 11 or more of 18 specified tender point sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The pain and tenderness in FM is thought by some to be due to central sensitization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Consistent with this hypothesis, patients with FM have qualitatively altered nociception compared with pain-free patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Both serotonin and norepinephrine are believed to play a role in the modulation of pain via the descending inhibitory pain pathways in the brain and spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Dysfunction in pain perception is one of the proposed etiological factors in FM, although the exact pathophysiological mechanism of FM is unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Duloxetine has shown efficacy in placebo-controlled trials in both psychiatric and pain disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP), and FM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The safety of duloxetine has been reported in individual trials and some pooled study analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] in patients with MDD, GAD, DPNP, FM, and lower urinary tract disorders. While the safety and tolerability of duloxetine for the treatment of FM have been previously published for the individual clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], a pooled analysis may offer a better overview of this topic than what individual study results can provide. Patients with fibromyalgia are often perceived as having poor tolerance for medications, perhaps related to overall heightened central sensitivity. The purpose of the current article is to present a comprehensive profile of the safety and tolerability of duloxetine during both short- (up to 6 months) and long-term (up to 60 weeks) use in patients with fibromyalgia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>To evaluate the safety of duloxetine in the treatment of FM, data were drawn from five studies. Studies 1 to 4 were double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter efficacy studies. Study 5 was a 1-year open-label safety study without a placebo control.</p><p>In study 1, patients were randomly assigned to fixed dosages of duloxetine 60&#x000a0;mg BID (twice per day; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;104) or placebo (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;103). In study 2, patients were randomly assigned to fixed dosages of duloxetine 60&#x000a0;mg QD (once daily; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;118), duloxetine 60&#x000a0;mg BID (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;116), or placebo (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;120). In study 3, patients were randomly assigned to fixed dosages of duloxetine 20&#x000a0;mg QD (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;79), duloxetine 60&#x000a0;mg QD (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;150), duloxetine 120&#x000a0;mg QD (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;147), or placebo (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;144). After 15&#x000a0;weeks, patients in the 20&#x000a0;mg duloxetine group were increased to 60&#x000a0;mg QD and continued on that dose for 13 more weeks. Patients receiving 60&#x000a0;mg duloxetine, 120&#x000a0;mg duloxetine, or placebo during the first 15&#x000a0;weeks were also continued on their respective treatments for 13 more weeks, for a total of 28&#x000a0;weeks of placebo-controlled treatment. Patients who completed the 28-week course of treatment in study 3 were eligible to participate in a further 28-week extension phase in which all patients received 120&#x000a0;mg QD of duloxetine. In study 4, patients were randomly assigned to 23&#x000a0;weeks of duloxetine treatment (8&#x000a0;weeks at 60&#x000a0;mg QD followed by 15&#x000a0;weeks of duloxetine continuing at 60&#x000a0;mg QD or increasing to 120&#x000a0;mg QD depending on clinical response and tolerability; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;162) or placebo (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;168). All patients who completed the initial therapy phase in study 4 were eligible to enter a 29-week double-blind extension phase at either 60 or 120&#x000a0;mg QD depending on dose at the end of the short-term therapy phase. Study 5 had an open-label phase of 8&#x000a0;weeks of duloxetine 60&#x000a0;mg QD treatment (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;350), followed by a 52-week double-blind phase in which patients were randomly assigned in a 1:2 ratio to continue at 60 mg QD (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;104) or 120&#x000a0;mg QD (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;203) of duloxetine, respectively. In all studies, patients assigned to doses at or above 60&#x000a0;mg/day were titrated briefly using doses of 20 or 30&#x000a0;mg/day. At study completion or discontinuation, a blinded taper phase lasting 1 or 2&#x000a0;weeks was implemented in all studies to prevent abrupt discontinuation of duloxetine treatment.</p><p>All patients provided written informed consent, and all study protocols were approved by the ethical review board at each investigative site. Further details about the methods and procedure of studies 1 through 5 can be found in published reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients were &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years of age, male or female outpatients (only female for study 2), with or without MDD. All patients met the criteria for FM as defined by the American College of Rheumatology. Patients in all studies were also required to have a score of &#x02265;4 on either the pain intensity item of the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] (study 1) or the average pain item of the Brief Pain Inventory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] (studies 2&#x02013;5). Patients were excluded from each study if they had any current primary psychiatric diagnosis other than MDD, including a current or past year diagnosis of dysthymia; had a previous diagnosis of psychosis, bipolar disorder, or schizoaffective disorder; had any anxiety disorder as a primary diagnosis within the past year; had a history of substance abuse or dependence within the past year (excluding nicotine and caffeine); or had a positive urine drug screen for any substances of abuse. Patients with an abnormal C-reactive protein level that is indicative of an autoimmune disease, an antinuclear antibody with a dilution of &#x0003e;1:320, or a rheumatoid factor of &#x02265;15&#x000a0;IU/mL were excluded. Patients who were pregnant or breastfeeding, were a serious suicidal risk, or had a serious medical illness were also excluded. At baseline and over the course of the studies, concomitant medications with primarily central nervous system activity were not permitted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Safety measures</title><p>All studies evaluated safety on the basis of discontinuation rates, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs); serious adverse events (SAEs); laboratory test results, including blood chemistry and hematology; vital signs; weight; and electrocardiograms (ECGs). TEAEs were assessed at each visit by recording patient responses to a general question such as, &#x0201c;How have you been feeling?&#x0201d; TEAEs were coded to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities preferred terms by blinded clinical personnel. An adverse event was considered treatment emergent if it was either new or existing but worsened after initiation of study medication. The severity of each adverse event as mild, moderate, or severe was also recorded. Discontinuation-emergent adverse events were assessed during the 1&#x02013;2-week tapered discontinuation phases. Suicide-related events were identified by a text string search of adverse events and investigator comments to allow for evaluation of incidences of suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior.</p><p>Vital signs consisting of supine and standing blood pressure (BP) and pulse were recorded at each visit. Laboratory tests were performed at regular visits through the treatment periods; ECGs were conducted at the final visit of the short-term phase for study 1, weeks 15 and 28 for study 3, and weeks 13 and 27 for study 4 (ECGs not conducted postbaseline in studies 2 and 5). The criteria for potentially clinically significant (PCS) ECG values were as follows: PR interval: low&#x02014;any value &#x0003c;20, high&#x02014;any value &#x0003e;200; QRS interval: low&#x02014;any value &#x0003c;50, high&#x02014;any value &#x0003e;120; QTcF interval: abnormal&#x02014;increase &#x02265;30 from baseline and postbaseline value &#x02265;450&#x000a0;ms for males, &#x02265;470 ms for females.

Longer-term safety and tolerability of duloxetine was examined in two ways: (1) all patients that enrolled in the 60-week study (study 5) and (2) all patients continuing into the 6-month extension phases of studies 3 and 4 and all patients from study 5 maintaining enrollment for at least 6&#x000a0;months (to assess safety in patients with a minimum of 6&#x000a0;months of drug exposure). All analyses were intent-to-treat analyses, unless otherwise specified, using all participants by the groups to which they were assigned by random allocation. Statistical significance was indicated when <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05. No adjustments were made for multiplicity.</p><p>For the placebo-controlled data, comparisons of duloxetine and placebo on rates of TEAEs, reasons for discontinuation, and rates of PCS values for vital signs, weight, laboratory test results, and ECGs were performed using the Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel general association test controlling for study. For vital signs, weight, and ECGs, treatment group differences in mean change from baseline to endpoint (last observation on treatment) were analyzed using an analysis of variance model containing terms for treatment group and study. Time-to-onset and time-to-resolution of adverse events were examined using the product limit approach, and tests for significance between treatment groups were based on the log-rank test. Suicidal ideation and behavior were compared between the duloxetine and placebo groups based on exposure-adjusted Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel incidence rates derived from the above-mentioned text string search.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Patient characteristics</title><p>The study population of patients (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1,411) receiving short-term treatment was primarily (94.8%) women.

In the 1-year study, two treatment-emergent PCS values occurred at a rate &#x0003e;1%: high cholesterol (2.1%) and high GGT (1.5%; PCS criteria for GGT = greater than 135,000&#x000a0;U/L for women and greater than 195,000&#x000a0;U/L for men).</p><p>There were no significant differences in the incidence of hepatic-related treatment-emergent adverse events and hepatic-related serious adverse events for duloxetine compared with placebo in the short-term studies. No patients in the short-term studies, 1-year study, or the sample that was enrolled for 6 months or more met Hy&#x02019;s rule (Hy&#x02019;s rule is defined as an ALT value greater than three times the upper limit of normal together with a total bilirubin greater than two times normal and reflects the presence of hepatocellular injury) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. There was a significantly (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) higher incidence of duloxetine-treated patients (0.6%) who discontinued due to a hepatic-related adverse event compared with placebo-treated patients (0%). There was no evidence that longer-term treatment added to the risk of discontinuation due to a hepatic-related adverse event: 0.6% of the 350 patients in the 1-year study discontinued due to a hepatic-related adverse event.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This comprehensive safety analysis revealed that the most common TEAEs seen during duloxetine treatment of FM were similar to those seen during duloxetine treatment of other indications, including MDD, GAD, and DPNP. Most TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity and were transient. In the short-term 3- and 6-month studies, adverse events leading to discontinuation varied, with no one event responsible for more than 2% of patients discontinuing. Overall, 19.5% discontinued due to an adverse event.</p><p>Duloxetine-treated patients had significantly larger increases in BP and heart rates, compared with placebo-treated patients, in short-term 3- and 6-month studies. These increases, however, were not of clinical significance. Furthermore, there was no evidence of higher rates of PCS abnormal laboratory values, ECG parameters, vital signs, or changes in body weight, for duloxetine-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients during 3&#x02013;6-month treatment, with one exception: A significantly higher incidence of ALT values &#x0003e;5 times upper limit of normal was found for duloxetine-treated patients (0.6%) compared with placebo-treated patients (0%).</p><p>Over the course of 1-year open-label of treatment with duloxetine, there was a somewhat higher total incidence of certain adverse events and PCS values on laboratory parameters. In the absence of a comparator, it seems most likely that these increased rates were due to the longer observation period compared with the 3- and 6-month studies. Overall, instances of PCS laboratory values were very low in the sample enrolled for 6&#x000a0;months or longer, as well as in the 1-year study, with no discernable clinical pattern suggestive of a specific body system or disease state.</p><p>While the overall pattern of adverse events during duloxetine treatment was similar for the FM studies compared with other disorders, the base rate of such adverse events appears somewhat higher in FM. In the treatment of MDD, for example, the incidence of common adverse events has been reported to be generally lower for both placebo and duloxetine than found here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Although initial occurrences of adverse events tend to occur early in treatment, the shorter duration (8&#x02013;9&#x000a0;weeks) of the MDD trials may account in part for this apparent difference. Discontinuations due to adverse events occurred in about 20% of patients in both the short-term 3- and 6-month studies and the 1-year study. This rate is somewhat higher than the discontinuation rate due to adverse events of 11% reported in a review of 19 studies of short-term treatment (duration, 8&#x02013;26&#x000a0;weeks) of MDD with serotonin reuptake inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Rates of 9&#x02013;10% for discontinuation due to adverse events were found across six studies of venlafaxine, a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor of similar class to duloxetine, and four studies of duloxetine, in the short-term treatment of MDD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. These findings suggest that patients with FM report slightly more adverse events and have somewhat higher rates of discontinuation due to adverse events compared with other disorders for which duloxetine has been studied, whether on drug or placebo. Nevertheless, clinicians need to be aware of the risk of discontinuation due to adverse events with duloxetine in the treatment of fibromyalgia and balance this risk against the likelihood of treatment response.</p><p>The cardiovascular safety of duloxetine has been previously investigated across all conditions for which duloxetine has been studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Using a database of 42 clinical trials, plus postmarketing safety studies, this recent study found no evidence of cardiovascular risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Similarly, in the treatment of FM, no evidence of clinically significant changes in ECG parameters or sustained increases in BP was seen for duloxetine relative to placebo. Although duloxetine&#x02019;s noradrenergic effect suggests that it is likely to cause increases in heart rate, only 0.5% of patients in the 3- and 6-month studies, 0.1% of patients enrolled for 6&#x000a0;months or more, and 0.6% of patients in the 1-year study had a clinically significant increase in pulse rate. The QTc interval was prolonged to a clinically meaningful degree in 0.4% of duloxetine-treated patients compared with 0.3% of placebo-treated patients.</p><p>In the 3- and 6-month FM studies, small numbers of patients lost or gained &#x0003e;10% in body weight. However, among those duloxetine-treated patients who were enrolled for at least 6&#x000a0;months, 7.6% gained &#x0003e;10% in body weight and 4.0% lost &#x0003e;10% in body weight. Similarly, in the 1-year study, 8.0% gained &#x0003e;10% in body weight and 4.9% lost &#x0003e;10% in body weight. In the absence of a placebo or other comparator, these changes over 6&#x000a0;months and 1&#x000a0;year are difficult to interpret. A previous longer-term (1&#x000a0;year) open-label study of duloxetine (80&#x02013;120&#x000a0;mg/day) for MDD found early (first few weeks) decreases in mean body weight followed by a return to baseline and then an increase on average of 1.1&#x000a0;kg by the end of the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. This pattern is consistent with what was found here, with more patients losing &#x0003e;10% weight than gaining &#x0003e;10% weight in the 3&#x02013;6&#x000a0;months studies, but more patients gaining &#x0003e;10% weight than losing &#x0003e;10% weight after being enrolled for 6&#x000a0;months or more and in the 1-year study. The overall mean change, however, was small (0.7&#x000a0;kg gain by endpoint of the 1-year study).</p><p>The effect of duloxetine on ALT has been previously found in other populations and is described in the product labeling. Changes in ALT do not appear to predict hepatotoxicity, and the absence of cases that met criteria for Hy&#x02019;s rule during either short- or long-term use supports the conclusion that the risk of hepatotoxicity associated with duloxetine in patients with FM is very low.</p><p>There has been considerable attention to the issue of suicide risk with antidepressants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Because rates of suicidality are typically very low, analysis of a pooled study database is a particularly useful to test for any potential drug-placebo difference. In the analyses of short-term placebo-controlled studies of FM, there were no significant differences between duloxetine and placebo in the incidence of suicidal behavior or ideation according to adverse event reporting. In the 1-year open-label study, four patients were reported to have suicide-related behavior. However, in the absence of a placebo control, these rates of suicide-related behavior in the longer-term study are difficult to interpret, particularly because elevated rates of suicide have been found for individuals with widespread pain syndromes like FM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p>Strengths of this study include the large number of patients treated with duloxetine in the shorter-term studies (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;876). In addition, a broad range of safety assessments were conducted. This report on the safety of duloxetine in the treatment of fibromyalgia is limited by the fact that all patients were participants in clinical trials with extensive inclusion/exclusion criteria. In particular, patients with certain comorbidities and patients on most other centrally acting medications were excluded from the trials. In clinical practice, psychiatric and medical comorbidity and polypharmacy is common among patients with FM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Thus, the generalizability of the findings to typical clinical practice patients who have psychiatric or medical comorbidities and who also receive concomitant medications is not known.</p><p>Another limitation of this pooled safety analysis includes the lack of a placebo group in the long-term safety study. However, the fact that the safety findings from the longer-term study are generally similar or show only slightly increased rates of adverse events or laboratory/vital sign values, relative to values from the 3- and 6-month studies, may provide reassurance about longer-term use of duloxetine in fibromyalgia.</p><p>In conclusion, duloxetine in dosages from 20 to 120&#x000a0;mg/day demonstrated a similar safety and tolerability profile in the treatment of FM to that seen in the treatment of other indications. Most patients tolerate duloxetine without clinically meaningful effects on vital signs, cardiovascular parameters, or laboratory (chemistry, hematology) analytes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the many clinical investigators who participated in the five studies included in this article.
