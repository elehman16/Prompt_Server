This investigation set out to determine whether magnesium in a cream could be absorbed transdermally in humans to improve magnesium status.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and findings</title><p>In this single blind, parallel designed pilot study, n = 25 participants (aged 34.3+/-14.8y, height 171.5+/-11cm, weight 75.9 +/-14 Kg) were randomly assigned to either a 56mg/day magnesium cream or placebo cream group for two weeks. Magnesium serum and 24hour urinary excretion were measured at baseline and at 14 days intervention. Food diaries were recorded for 8 days during this period. Mg test and placebo groups&#x02019; serum and urinary Mg did not differ at baseline. After the Mg<sup>2+</sup> cream intervention there was a clinically relevant increase in serum magnesium (0.82 to 0.89 mmol/l,p = 0.29) that was not seen in the placebo group (0.77 to 0.79 mmol/L), but was only statistically significant (p = 0.02)) in a subgroup of non-athletes. Magnesium urinary excretion increased from baseline slightly in the Mg<sup>2+</sup> group but with no statistical significance (p = 0.48). The Mg<sup>2+</sup> group showed an 8.54% increase in serum Mg<sup>2+</sup> and a 9.1% increase in urinary Mg<sup>2+</sup> while these figures for the placebo group were smaller, i.e. +2.6% for serum Mg<sup>2+</sup> and -32% for urinary Mg<sup>2+.</sup> In the placebo group, both serum and urine concentrations showed no statistically significant change after the application of the placebo cream.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusion</title><p>No previous studies have looked at transdermal absorbency of Mg<sup>2+</sup> in human subjects. In this pilot study, transdermal delivery of 56 mg Mg/day (a low dose compared with commercial transdermal Mg<sup>2+</sup> products available) showed a larger percentage rise in both serum and urinary markers from pre to post intervention compared with subjects using the placebo cream, but statistical significance was achieved only for serum Mg<sup>2+</sup> in a subgroup of non-athletes. Future studies should look at higher dosage of magnesium cream for longer durations.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Trial registration</title><p>ISRCTN registry ID No. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.isrctn.com/search?q=15136969">ISRTN15136969</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="4"/><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec005"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mineral elements, such as magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>), are required by the human body in modest amounts for the maintenance of health and the development of optimal functioning[<xref rid="pone.0174817.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]). Mg<sup>2+</sup> is an important mineral element and it is the fourth most abundant cation in living organisms, with Mg<sup>2+</sup> being a cofactor to over 325 enzymatic reactions within the body [<xref rid="pone.0174817.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Around 99% of total body Mg<sup>2+</sup> is located in the bone, muscles and non-muscular soft tissue [<xref rid="pone.0174817.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Mg<sup>2+</sup> supplementation has been shown to significantly improve blood pressure [<xref rid="pone.0174817.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0174817.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] as well as modifying vascular tone by regulating endothelium and smooth muscle cell function [<xref rid="pone.0174817.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>To maintain an adequate Mg<sup>2+</sup> status humans must consume Mg<sup>2+</sup> at regular intervals [<xref rid="pone.0174817.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The daily recommendation for Mg<sup>2+</sup> is controversial, as the literature is conflicting and varies between countries, although values of &#x02265; 300 mg/day are usually reported for healthy adults with adjustment for age, sex and nutritional status [<xref rid="pone.0174817.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Oral magnesium supplementation has been shown to affect various parameters, such as blood pressure [<xref rid="pone.0174817.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0174817.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], immune function [<xref rid="pone.0174817.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], cardiovascular system [<xref rid="pone.0174817.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and metabolic syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0174817.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis by Zhang et al (2016) in the Journal of Nutrition [<xref rid="pone.0174817.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] found that in a healthy population group there was a dose dependent increase in both serum Mg concentration and urinary Mg excretion with supplemental oral magnesium intake ranging from 250&#x02013;500mg/day. Kass, Weekes and Carpenter (2012) identified that a supplement of &#x0003e;370 mg/day of Mg<sup>+</sup> shows greater efficacy than a lower dose in improving blood pressure and that magnesium supplementation gives a dose dependent response with regards to blood pressure [<xref rid="pone.0174817.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>An alternative method of perhaps attaining recommended magnesium intakes might be through topical application. Current formulations include magnesium oils and trans-dermal creams, from which the magnesium may be absorbed across the skin and into the systemic circulation. However, in contrast to gastrointestinal epithelium, a primary function of the skin is to act as a barrier, which restricts the absorption of exogenous chemicals into the body. The barrier function of the skin is thought to lie predominately in the outermost layer of the epidermis, the stratum corneum. The stratum corneum is thought to largely present a hydrophobic barrier to the absorption of transdermal creams. The dermis, immediately below the epidermis, contains the blood vessels that are able to transport substances that have permeated the skin into the systemic circulation.</p><p>Although less studied than organic molecules, metal ions are known to be able to cross the skin, with the literature having focussed on metals that are known to cause irritant/toxic effects [<xref rid="pone.0174817.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The lower resistance to permeation of the skin appendages, skin structures that serve a particular function including sensation, lubrication and heat loss, and the ionised nature of metals means that their permeation across these skin appendages is considered to be the most likely route of absorption [<xref rid="pone.0174817.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0174817.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, the low surface area available for this in human skin means that metal ion absorption across skin is expected to be relatively low. Therefore, it has been questioned that a transdermal route of administration might provide sufficient Mg<sup>2+</sup> absorption to help meet systemic Mg<sup>2+</sup> requirements. This investigation aims to determine if transdermal absorption of Mg<sup>2+</sup> from a topical cream occurs &#x0201c;in vivo&#x0201d; in humans.</p><p>To date, no study has investigated the absorbency of transdermal magnesium cream in human subjects. Commercially available Mg<sup>2+</sup> topical applications range from 75mg to 400mg depending on the dosage recommended by manufacturers. This ranges from 5&#x02013;30 sprays of magnesium oil or 2&#x02013;4 teaspoons of magnesium cream, which can be applied in one application or throughout the day. Disappointingly, many commercial topical creams and oils do not state the concentration of magnesium in the product.</p><p>This study was designed as a first time, pilot study to ascertain whether such a topical Mg<sup>2+</sup> preparation might affect urinary or serum Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Since less than 1% of magnesium is contained in the blood, assessment by serum status may be problematic [<xref rid="pone.0174817.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It is often considered that 24-hr urine excretion of Mg<sup>2+</sup> may be a better indicator of intestinal absorption than serum concentration; however, urinary Mg<sup>2+</sup> excretion is also highly variable and it is questionable whether it can be used reliably to assess an individual&#x02019;s Mg<sup>2+</sup> status [<xref rid="pone.0174817.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, serum Mg<sup>2+</sup> can reflect a longer term dietary Mg<sup>2+</sup> status over weeks or months whilst urinary Mg<sup>2+</sup> can be a better marker of one&#x02019;s recent dietary intake [<xref rid="pone.0174817.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These studies using serum and urinary Mg<sup>2+</sup> markers in dietary Mg<sup>2+</sup> research could not be assumed to be helpful in the design of this study. Djurhuus et al,[<xref rid="pone.0174817.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], however, reported that although it is unlikely that a single determination of serum Mg<sup>2+</sup> can be used in assessing whole-body Mg<sup>2+</sup> status in an individual, serial determinations of serum Mg<sup>2+</sup> might prove useful as an indicator of changes in whole body Mg<sup>2+</sup> status. These authors also found that 24-hr urinary Mg<sup>2+</sup> excretion is unlikely to be a reliable measure of whole body Mg<sup>2+</sup> status and is not a good marker to measure changes in whole body Mg<sup>2+</sup> status. Nonetheless, we decided to use 24-hr urinary Mg<sup>2+</sup> as well as serum Mg<sup>2+</sup> in this pilot study.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of this pilot study was to investigate whether a 56 mg/day dose of magnesium in a cream, applied transdermally to humans, would affect either serum magnesium levels or urinary excretion over a two-week period and to measure effect, if any, and variance to inform a properly powered future study, if warranted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Subject recruitment started April 2014 and data collection and follow-up was completed by February 2015.

Randomisation was determined by allocation to a group selected from a box with equal amounts of paper stating either placebo or magnesium and selected at time of recruitment. The trial was single blind with only the lead investigator being aware of the content of the cream. One participant dropped out of study before completion. Participants were excluded if they were taking magnesium supplementation in any form within a month of recruitment onto the trial, were under the age of 18y or above the age of 60y.There were no height or weight restrictions, Written informed consent was completed and ethical approval was granted by the University of Hertfordshire Health and Human Science Ethics Committee on 14<sup>th</sup> April 2014. Blood collection and blood and urine analysis was undertaken at the University of Hertfordshire Human Physiology Laboratory.</p><p>Dietary magnesium intake was below the RNI in one of the placebo participants and three of the magnesium participants. This was not considered a bar to inclusion into the study as any change in serum or urinary Mg2<sup>+</sup> from the cream could still be shown. High levels of physical exercise have been shown to deplete human Mg<sup>2+</sup> status ([<xref rid="pone.0174817.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

All other 20 participants who completed the study were considered &#x0201c;non-athletes&#x0201d;, i.e. engaging in less than 2 hrs physical exercise per day for no more than 3 days per week during the study. Participants were instructed not to exercise 24h before blood draws, but &#x0201c;athletes&#x0201d; may have disregarded this instruction, so results were statistically analysed in two ways: 1. &#x0201c;all subjects&#x0201d;, including both athletes and non-athletes (n = 24 who completed the study) and 2. &#x0201c;non-athletes&#x0201d; (n = 20) which excluded the 4 athletes.

A meta-analysis of 27 trials by Zhang et al [<xref rid="pone.0174817.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] investigating oral Mg<sup>2+</sup> supplementation, showed a significant (p&#x0003c;0.001) rise in serum Mg with 200 mg/day oral Mg supplement or one month supplement duration but that higher doses (&#x02265; 300 mg/day) or durations of supplementation (&#x02265;2 months) were required to achieve a mean rise of 0.05 mmol/l in serum Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Additionally, studies included in the Zhang et al [<xref rid="pone.0174817.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] meta-analysis show a baseline mean C.V. for the 27 serum Mg<sup>2+</sup> studies of 9.3% for Mg groups and 10.8% for placebo groups, i.e. as little as half of the variance for baseline serum Mg<sup>2+</sup> measurements in this study (C.V. = 21.9% and 17.3% for Mg<sup>2+</sup> groups, all subjects and non-athletes respectively; C.V. = 20.7% and 12.3% for placebo groups, all subjects and non-athletes respectively). This pilot study of all subjects, both athletes and non-athletes, shows that transdermal Mg<sup>2+</sup> may possibly influence serum Mg<sup>2+</sup> in a relatively short time frame (12&#x02013;14 days), but a higher concentration of Mg<sup>2+</sup> cream, a larger number of subjects given the serum Mg<sup>2+</sup> variance, and perhaps a longer study is required to make any real conclusion.</p><p>Although participants were told to refrain from exercise for 24 hours before blood and urinary collection, 4 participants were undertaking regular high intensity training, the effects of which may affect Mg<sup>2+</sup> parameters that can last longer than 24 hours [<xref rid="pone.0174817.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. When the data from these four subjects were removed from the statistical analysis a significant effect of the Mg<sup>2+</sup> cream on serum Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations could be seen.(p = 0.02). Additionally, the %rise in serum Mg<sup>2+</sup> in the non-athletes (+22.7%) was much larger than that shown in all subjects, i.e. both athletes and non-athletes (+8.54%). This is too small a sample size to reach a firm conclusion but this increase in percentage change in the non-athlete intervention group may be due to an additional uptake of Mg<sup>2+.</sup>from the cream which may have been utilised during exercise or for replenishment of Mg<sup>2+</sup> stores rather than being transferred to serum in the athletic participants. This is an area of interest for further study.</p><p>Further, this analysis of the serum Mg data for the non-athletes in the intervention group showed a mean increase from 0.75 to 0.92 mmol/l which may have clinical relevance in particular with relation to cardiovascular disease. In a meta-analysis by Del Gobbo et al (2013)[<xref rid="pone.0174817.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], it was found that a rise of 0.2 mmol/L circulating Mg was associated with a 30% lower risk of cardiovascular disease and fatal ischemic heart disease. In addition, Lutsey et al.(2014) [<xref rid="pone.0174817.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] found that after 20+ yrs follow up serum Mg showed a linear inverse association with the risk of incident heart failure.

It has been suggested that 24-hour urine excretion of Mg<sup>2+</sup> may be a better indicator of tissue status than the serum Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration, but it is highly variable and it is questionable whether it can be used to reliably assess a given individual&#x02019;s Mg<sup>2+</sup> status.</p><p>The trans-dermal cream contained 56 mg of Mg<sup>2+</sup> administered daily. This is at the lower end of creams sold commercially. The recommended dose of the few commercially available creams range between 70mg/d to 400mg/d per day, therefore results of this study may represent an &#x0201c;underdose&#x0201d; of transdermal Mg<sup>2+</sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec022"><title>Conclusion</title><p>No previous studies have looked at effects of transdermal Mg<sup>2+</sup> in human subjects. In this two-week pilot study, transdermal delivery of 56 mg Mg/day (a low dose compared with commercial transdermal Mg<sup>2+</sup> products available) showed a larger percentage change in both serum and urinary markers from pre to post intervention compared with subjects using the placebo cream. In addition, the rise in mean serum Mg<sup>2+</sup> seen in the Mg<sup>2+</sup> group was clinically relevant although only statistically significant (p&#x0003c;0.05) when non-athletes were analysed separately.</p><p>Given the high variance in serum Mg<sup>2+</sup> of these subjects, we suggest that future research focus on a larger number of human subjects given higher concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup> cream application administered for longer durations to investigate whether transdermal application may show a significant contribution to improvement in magnesium status. It would also be of interest to look at the effect of transdermal Mg<sup>2+</sup> supplementation on athletes as compared to a sedentary population group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0174817.s001"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Ingredients list.</title><p>Ingredients for magnesium and placebo creams <bold>list</bold>.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0174817.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0174817.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist.</title><p>Checklist of information to include when doing a randomised trial.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0174817.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0174817.s003"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Dataset for repository.</title><p>Subject data.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0174817.s003.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0174817.s004"><label>S2 Text</label><caption><title>Protocol</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0174817.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Dr. Andrea Rosanoff declares a beneficial interest in transdermal magnesium cream products.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0174817.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Lukaski</surname><given-names>HC</given-names></name>. <article-title>Micronutrients (magnesium, zinc, and copper): are mineral supplements needed for athletes?</article-title>
