Without proper treatment, T2DM can lead to long term complications such as neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, cardiovascular disease, a poorer quality of life, and higher mortality rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The world prevalence of adults with diabetes in 2012 was estimated to be 371 million and is rapidly increasing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In the Netherlands this number was estimated to be 1 million in 2012 and is increasing with 70.000 patients per year. The number of T2DM patients is expected to rise to over 1.300.000 in 2025, of which more than 90% will have T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The treatment of T2DM demands lifestyle changes and additional medication. When insulin is required patients need to self-monitor their blood glucose levels. Self-management is recognized as the cornerstone of overall diabetes management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The Association of American Diabetes Educators (AADE) has defined 7 key self-management behaviors important for T2DM patients: healthy eating, being active, monitoring, taking medication, problem solving, reducing risks and healthy coping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. To promote this daily self-management for T2DM patients, educational and behavioral support programs have been developed and shown to be effective in terms of behavioral and medical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Similarly web-based self-management programs have demonstrated improvements in health behaviors and health-related outcomes, and offer the possibility to increase both effectiveness and reach of clinical-based consultations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Furthermore web-based self-management programs have the potential to decrease the workload of diabetes care providers. However it is unclear to what extent patients are motivated to use and adhere to online self-management programs. Face-to-face or telephone coaching can improve program adherence and online program effectiveness, both for medical and psychological outcomes. Moreover it can enhance satisfaction with the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. To date, some studies that included coaching to their online T2DM self-management intervention showed improvements in dietary behavior, systolic blood pressure and a reduction in depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] where as other studies found no effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, the coaching in these studies targeted specific predefined health behaviors and instructions for diets and exercises. More flexible and adaptive style of coaching, attuned to the patients&#x02019; own chosen specific goals and health behaviors (and consequently possible multiple health behaviors), would seem more appropriate. To our knowledge this has not been investigated yet in T2DM patients. It is therefore unknown what the effect is of online (asynchronized) individual coaching on multiple goals and health behaviors as chosen by the patient. To our knowledge we would be the first to test the effectiveness of adaptive online asynchronized coaching in a web-based self-management program.</p><sec><title>Aims</title><p>We aim to test the hypothesis that self-management behaviors and biomedical outcomes improve in the group receiving an online self-management program with adaptive coaching versus those who don&#x02019;t receive additional adaptive coaching. We expect online coaching to have neutral or favorable effects on well-being, quality of life and satisfaction with care. We will test our hypotheses using an existing patient web-portal, which offers diabetes information and an overview of personal clinical outcome measures, supplemented with a self-management support program (SSP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The combination of the web-portal with SSP is referred to as an interactive care platform (ICP) and will be discussed in further detail below.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The current study design is nested within an ongoing cohort and intervention study, that focus on different constructs within the ICP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. We chose a two-arm nested randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test our hypotheses. Measurements are scheduled at three points in time: at baseline, 6&#x000a0;months and 12&#x000a0;months after baseline. During first log-on to the ICP, 220 patients (see power calculation) will be randomized into two groups. These groups are: 1) patients receiving the ICP with additional online coaching in the SSP, 2) patients offered only the ICP without coaching in the SSP. A visual representation of the situation is shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. The medical ethical committee of the VU University Medical Center (certified by the Central Committee on Research involving Human Subjects in the Netherlands) approved the study protocol.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart of participants.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1472-6823-13-53-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Recruitment</title><p>In line with the guidelines, the most patients in the care group are seen four times a year, of which one visit is the more extensive annual check-up. T2DM patients will be recruited when visiting their general practitioner (GP) or primary care nurse (PN) three months before the annual check-up. During their visit, PNs attend their patients to the existing studies, and to the availability of the ICP. After agreeing on participating in the studies and agreeing on using the ICP, patients receive a manual and login instructions for the ICP. During the first login to the ICP, patients are requested to provide additional informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Study population</title><p>The sample consists of people with T2DM who are treated in primary health care. The available sample pool consists of approximately 8300 T2DM patients.</p><p>Inclusion criteria are: a diagnosis of T2DM, where the GP is defined as the main care giver; and aged &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years. Exclusion criteria for the RCT are: Mental retardation or psychiatric treatment for schizophrenia, organic mental disorder or bipolar disorder currently or in the past. Insufficient knowledge of the Dutch language to understand the requirements of the study and/or the questions posed in the questionnaires. Life expectancy &#x0003c;1&#x000a0;year due to malignancies or other terminal illnesses. Cognitive impairment, including dementia, which interferes with trial participation. Any condition that the Investigator and/or coordinating Investigator feel would interfere with trial participation or evaluation of results.</p></sec><sec><title>Description of the intervention</title><sec><title>Development of Interactive care platform</title><p>For the creation of the ICP an existing patient web-portal was modified and merged with a SSP. This existing patient web-portal allows for a connection between health care practitioner and the patients, and allows patients to track their laboratory results as well as read personalized educational T2DM information online [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. A SSP was developed and added to the patient web-portal to improve patients&#x02019; self-management, promote empowerment and patient autonomy, and to counter attrition of the web-portal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The development of the SSP was informed by a literature review and previous experience in developing and testing theory-based self-management programs for people with diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Additionally the development of the SSP was guided by the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) model of behavior change. This model integrates key features of social-cognitive theories of behavior change, and has strong empirical evidence from studies in the prevention and management of chronic diseases, including diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The HAPA model identifies self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, and risk-awareness, as key determinants of intention formation (motivation), while goal setting and planning are crucial for bridging the intention-behavior gap, such as actual practice of desired health behaviors, which allows for the formation of behavioral maintenance. Self-efficacy is an important determinant throughout the different stages of behavior change, including maintenance, relapse prevention and relapse management. Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> provides an overview of the application of the HAPA model and behavioral change techniques as proposed by Michie et al. (2011), as guidance for developing the SSP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Application of the HAPA model and behavioral change techniques used for the SSP development</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><bold>HAPA model component</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Components used in the SSP</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Used behavioral change techniques</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td rowspan="8" align="left" valign="top">Risk awareness, outcome-expectancy, self-efficacy<hr/></td><td rowspan="2" align="left" valign="top">- Information and education about T2DM in general and personalized to patients&#x02019; current health situation.<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">- Provide information on consequences of behavior in general/to the individual.<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">- Model/Demonstrate the behavior.<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">- Overview of patients&#x02019; personal clinical results.<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">- Prompt self-monitoring of behavioral outcome.<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">- Patients&#x02019; clinical measures are compared to norm values and GPs&#x02019; advice, showed in a table and in a graph.<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">- Prompt review of outcome goals.<hr/></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3" align="left" valign="top">- Information about the clinical measurements and information on behaviors that influence these clinical measurements.<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">- Provide information on consequences of behavior in general/to the individual.<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">- Provide instruction on how to perform the behavior.<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">- Model/Demonstrate the behavior.<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">- Patients can fill-in a motivation why they want to change their behavior.<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">- Motivational interviewing.<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Goal setting<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">- Patients are guided to choose a goal from a list of 4 behavioral goals (diet, exercise, medication &#x00026; stop smoking)<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">- Goal setting (behavior).<hr/></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="6" align="left" valign="top">Action planning, Self-efficacy<hr/></td><td rowspan="4" align="left" valign="top">- Patients are guided to create a behavioral action-plan for the chosen goal.

In PRISMA patients are encouraged to set personal goals and formulate a realistic action plan that is then followed during routine clinical encounters with the diabetes care provider.

Furthermore within the SSP patients are stimulated to compare their personal clinical health outcomes to the GP&#x02019;s advice and are triggered to think of ways to improve their health status. Additionally they receive information about relevant health related behaviors for improving these clinical outcomes (HAPA: Self-efficacy and Outcome expectancy). Based on this information, patients can choose behavioral goals derived from 4 of the 7 self-management behaviors defined by the AADE (diet, exercise, medication &#x00026; stop smoking) where the other 3 defined self-management behaviors are integral part of the web-portal. In addition patients can compose self-chosen action plans to support these goals (HAPA: goal setting and planning). Patients receive automatic reminders and encouragements while they carry out their planned actions. Eventually patients are prompted to evaluate their behavioral goals and action plans, based on graded tasks and barrier identification with help from the SSP. After the evaluation, patients are encouraged to restart the behavioral goal setting and action planning (HAPA: maintenance loop).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Intervention group</title><p>Hundred and ten randomized patients are offered the ICP with additional online (asynchronized) coaching to receive feedback on behavioral goals, action plans and evaluation of the executed health behaviors. These goals and planned health behaviors are chosen by the patient. The coaches follow a protocol where they serve as facilitator, and focus on process to specify action plans and let patients think for themselves. Coaches refrain from advising the patient with regard to medication or medical tests and refer to the GP if the patient requests such medical advice. After the patient has executed the planned health behaviors, the coach can support the patient by offering constructive and empowering feedback on the process of behavior change based on the HAPA model. Coaching will be carried out by trained master health-sciences students, by using asychronized messaging within the ICP.

To evaluate differences in target variables within and between groups over time we will use a linear mixed model for repeated measures (after 6 and 12&#x000a0;months). Baseline variables will be used as covariates. Analyses will be based on Intention-to-treat. Longitudinal linear regression, using Generalized Estimation Equations (GEE) will be used to investigate the differences between the two groups on primary (self-care activities) and secondary outcome variables over time. With GEE the relationships between the variables at different time-points are analyzed simultaneously, reflecting the relationship between the longitudinal development of the outcome variables and the longitudinal development of the predictor variables. GEE adjusts for the correlation between repeated observations taken in the same patient and has the advantage of handling longitudinal data on subjects with varying numbers of unequally spaced observations. The latter is important, because the assessments are scheduled within routine care and as a consequence, the time between the consultations can differ. Multi-level analyses will be applied to correct for the different primary care groups. All analyses will be corrected for baseline values, gender and age.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>Change in self-care behavior is the primary endpoint as measured by the SDSCA total score.

Primary care physicians can use the intervention as support for the standard treatment of T2DM patients. Health care professionals play an active roll in recruiting, informing and motivate patients for using the ICP. By doing so, people who are unmotivated and who would initially not consider using an ICP could be recruited, which can further increase external validity. With the integration of the ICP in standard primary diabetes care, we hope to reduce attrition, which is a known problem for web-based interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. With the use of reminders and online contact between participants and coaches we hope to limit attrition rates.</p><p>The flow of patients in this study is limited by the three different informed consents and agreements patients have to sign before they can be randomized for the RCT. This can create a bias of including only highly motivated patients in the RCT study.</p><p>The study participants will consist of primarily older patients who may be lacking computer skills which could have affect participation and attrition rates of the intervention.</p><p>In the current study proposal, the measurements will be executed at baseline, 6&#x000a0;months and 12&#x000a0;months after baseline.
