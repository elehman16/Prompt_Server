However, no study has examined exergaming-based interventions for the elderly that last several years. Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness and safety of a 12-week intervention using step training with exergaming for the elderly (12-week study). Moreover, we conducted an exergaming-based intervention for 3&#x000a0;years (3-year study).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><p>12-week study: Forty-two elderly persons participated in this study. Using an in-house developed exergaming protocol, a step training was performed for 15&#x000a0;min/session twice a week for 12&#x000a0;weeks. We investigated post-intervention changes in motor functions, successful step-rate, the intensity of exercise, which was evaluated using Borg scale (Rating of Perceived Exertion). 3-year study: An intervention using exergaming was conducted for 12&#x000a0;weeks by 20 elderly participants. Two courses/year of exercise were performed at 3-month intervals. This was continued for 3&#x000a0;years. The exercise continuation rate, its influence on motor functions were investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>12-week study: Lower-limb muscle strength, balancing capacity, and whole body reaction time significantly improved in the exercise group.

In order to prolong not only average life spans, but also healthy life expectancy, it is important to maintain and/or improve motor functions. Since muscle strength and balancing capacity decrease with age, the risk of falls may be avoided by exercise interventions that improve these functions. A systematic review presented by Sherrington et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2008</xref>) revealed that complex training, involving various types of muscle strength-potentiating and balance-maintaining exercises, decreased the risk of falls.</p><p>Muscle strength around the ankle and hip joints is weaker in the elderly than in the young (Bemben et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1996</xref>; Kirkendall and Garrett Jr <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1998</xref>; Doherty <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2003</xref>; Janssen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2000</xref>). In the likelihood of a fall, muscles around the ankle and hip joints in the young respond in order to prevent the fall (ankle/hip strategies) (Manchester et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1989</xref>; Woollacott <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1993</xref>; Mackey and Robinovitch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2006</xref>). On the other hand in the elderly, stepping predominantly contributes to the prevention of falls (stepping strategy). Because the ankle/hip strategy-dependent prevention of falls is compromised, if the elderly cannot prevent falls through the stepping strategy, proximal femoral fractures may occur (McIlroy and Maki <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1996</xref>; Maki and McIlroy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2006</xref>; Luchies et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1994</xref>; Rogers and Mille <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2003</xref>). Among elderly-specific fractures, proximal femoral fractures have the strongest impact on healthy life expectancy and prognosis. Therefore, reinforcing lateral stability is important for preventing these fractures (Greenspan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1998</xref>; Aizen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2003</xref>; Hwang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2011</xref>). Repetitive step training is useful for improving the lateral stability of subjects (Maki and McIlroy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2005</xref>).</p><p>Repetitive step exercises are monotonous, which may reduce compliance (Oman and King <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2000</xref>; Dishman and Buckworth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1996</xref>). Exercise training using a computer game (exergaming) was developed as a compliance-improving training method in order for training to become more enjoyable (Warburton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2007</xref>; Tamura et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2007</xref>; Baranowski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2008</xref>). The positive effects of exergaming, involving repetitive step exercises, have been reported in elementary school children, healthy young adults, and obese adults (Taylor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2011</xref>; Bailey and McInnis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2011</xref>; Sell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2008</xref>). The safety, efficacy and lower-limb motor functional changes of exergaming for several months have been reported in the elderly (Skj&#x000e6;ret et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2015a</xref>). However, the exercise continuation rate, its safety, and its influence on motor functions in the elderly periodically subjected to interventions with exergaming for several years have not yet been examined.</p><p>Since the game speed in commercially available computer games is fast, it is difficult for the elderly to acquire a high score (Clark and Kraemer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2009</xref>; Skj&#x000e6;ret et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">b</xref>). Therefore, the degree of difficulty in exergaming needs to be regulated so that the elderly may enjoy it (Smith et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2011</xref>). Smith et al. investigated the success rate of stepping in the elderly using a stepping device that was developed based on a conventional computer game. They indicated that the successful step-rate was 100&#x000a0;% at a pace of 1 step per 2&#x000a0;s. When the degree of difficulty was changed, the success rates of stepping were approximately 80&#x000a0;% at a pace of 1&#x000a0;step/s and approximately 66&#x000a0;% at a pace of 1.25&#x000a0;steps/s (Smith et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2011</xref>). A commercially available stepping game, Dance Dance Revolution (DDR, Konami), initially provides a stepping pace of approximately 1&#x000a0;step/s, and this is gradually accelerates as the game progresses, ultimately reaching approximately 3&#x000a0;steps/s. This pace is too fast for the elderly (Smith et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2011</xref>); therefore, the degree of difficulty needs to be regulated.</p><p>We had to develop software for step training program, in which the degree of difficulty was regulated. We had to develop software for a step-training program, in which the degree of difficulty was regulated. When we developed the software, there had been only one previous report that had investigated the relationship between successful steps and the step-rate of exergaming for the elderly. (Smith et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2011</xref>). Therefore, we referred to this report and regulated the step-rate of the training program accordingly. In this software, the step-rate was established as 1&#x000a0;step/s (Smith et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2011</xref>), a pace at which the elderly have the potential to acquire a high score.</p><p>Past researchers have reported that adults start with easier games and progress to more difficult games (Baranes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2014</xref>). Therefore, clearly the difficulty level of exergaming should be set at a low level when setting up step training. In order to improve their motivation to continue exercising, we prepared a local festival (Yosakoi Festival) model as the game design. Residents in the area are familiar with this festival. The model, with a musical instrument as the symbol of the Yosakoi Festival, was set to move at every step so that everyone was capable of enjoying. The participants recorded their results in their notebooks after every session. They were also able to compare them with previous scores. We utilized their notebooks to maintain their motivation to continue exercising.</p><p>The aim of this study was to verify our hypotheses: 1. Exergaming, in which the degree of difficulty was regulated, is safe for healthy individuals, has the high successful step-rate of the training and it is effective for improving lower-limb motor functions; and 2. Periodic interventions with exergaming for several years are safe with a high continuation rate (attendance rate, number of participants) and are useful for improving motor functions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>12-week study</title><p>Forty-two healthy elderly persons [28 males, 14 females, mean age: 71&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;5&#x000a0;years (64&#x02013;85&#x000a0;years)] participated in this study. This group of subjects consisted of very healthy elderly citizens paid a regular salary for physical labor. Therefore, their motor function ability was better than the average elderly citizen. The criteria for participation included an age of 60&#x000a0;years or older, orthosis-free walking, and a healthy status without exercise restrictions. Exclusion criteria included a history of lower limb surgery (fracture/artificial joint), history of cerebrovascular disorders, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases (such as Parkinson&#x02019;s disease) that cause balance disturbances, exercise-affecting diseases (heart/lung/kidney diseases), numbness/sensory disturbances in the hands/legs, and dementia. Institutional review board approval was obtained prior to the study. All subjects agreed in writing to participate in the study after reading and signing an informed consent form. They were randomly allocated to the exercise or control group. Randomization was performed by using a list of random numbers and a sealed envelope method. Participants were divided into two groups: exercise and control groups, based on their agreement with random assignment in order to achieve a male-to-female ratio of 1:1. Their daily activities remained unchanged during the study period. Eight out of the 42 subjects had a history of falls in the past year (exercise group: 5, control group: 3).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>3-year study</title><p>Subjects were 20 elderly residents in a fishery town (population: approximately 12,000, proportion of elderly persons: approximately 39&#x000a0;%) who wanted to participate in this study. This group of subjects consisted of frail elderly persons who scored low on motor function in a musculoskeletal function examination carried out in a residential area. They consisted of 4 males and 16 females, with a mean age of 78&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;years. Exclusion criteria included exercise-affecting diseases (heart/lung/kidney diseases), neurodegenerative diseases (such as Parkinson&#x02019;s disease) that cause balance disturbances, dementia, and gait disorders (hemiplegia after cerebral infarction and neurodegenerative diseases).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Step exergaming program</title><p>We developed software for a step training program, and used it (exergaming) in the exercise group. The system consisted of a stepping mat that was connected to a universal serial bus (USB), a 19-inch display, and a uniquely prepared program (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The mat for stepping measured approximately 1&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup>, and the distance between the center of the mat and the display was approximately 1.5&#x000a0;m. The game contents were as follows: 4 yellow disks, entitled &#x0201c;Front&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Back&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Left&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;Right&#x0201d;, randomly appeared from the outer boundary of the display, and were slowly transferred toward the center of the display. The disk color changed from yellow to red, and disappeared after 1&#x000a0;s. If one leg was stepped in the direction indicated by the disk within 1&#x000a0;s from red coloration until its disappearance, the subject got a score. The model had a musical instrument as the symbol of the Yosakoi Festival (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). It moved the musical instrument with each score; therefore, increasing the likelihood that each subject would enjoy the exercise. Upper row: If the &#x0201c;Front&#x0201d; disk was transferred from the upper area of the monitor toward its center, one leg had to step out in the front direction before the disk disappeared. The stepping leg was then returned to the center. In this study, we did not decide whether to use the same foot in the front step or not. Lower row: If the &#x0201c;Left&#x0201d; disk was transferred from the left side of the monitor toward its center, the left leg had to step out in the left direction before the disk disappeared. The stepping leg was then returned to the center (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Appearance of the newly developed exergaming program</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40064_2016_2379_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Game monitor</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40064_2016_2379_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig><fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Scheme of the step training</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40064_2016_2379_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p>The step-rate based on disk indications was established as 1&#x000a0;step/s.

However, exercise continuation rates or changes in motor functions in elderly people subjected to periodic interventions with exergaming for several years have not yet been examined. In the exercise group involving a 12-week intervention, lower-limb muscle strength parameters, quadriceps and gluteus medius muscle strength, and balance parameters, the duration of one-footed standing and platform stabilometry findings, significantly improved. A parameter of lower-limb agility, the WBRT, also significantly improved. These results were attributed to exergaming, which required unexpected multi-directional stepping; the body&#x02019;s center of gravity was transferred to the front, back, left, or right with every step, and loading to the lower limbs with every step may have improved quadriceps and gluteus medius muscle strength. The frequent transfer of the center of gravity may have simultaneously played the role of balance training. Furthermore, it was necessary to promptly and repeatedly step in the correct direction based on an instant evaluation according to the disk&#x02019;s indications on the monitor; this may have contributed to improving the agility of the lower limbs. No significant differences were observed in the 10-m walking or tandem gait tests, which may have been because the baseline values before the start of exercise training were approximate to the upper limit of the normal range.</p><p>Motor function in the 12-week and 3-year exercise group was significantly different. The 12-week group consisted of very healthy elderly citizens who receive a regular salary for physical labor. Therefore, their motor function ability is better than the average elderly citizen. We think that they were able to stand on one foot longer than the average elderly citizen. Those selected for the 3-year group consisted of elderly citizens who scored low on motor function ability in the musculoskeletal function examination carried out in a residential area. In addition, members of the 3-year group were, on average, older than members of the 12-week group. There was a significantly higher proportion of women in the 3-year group than in the 12-week group. For these reasons, we believe that there is a significant difference in motor function between the two groups.</p><p>Out of the four reports on step exergaming in the elderly, only one report had described the step-rate. The step-rate that had been adapted to the elderly was a lower-step rate (0.5&#x02013;1&#x000a0;step/s). However, this report did not describe how successful the step-rate was (Schoene et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2013</xref>). In this study, the step-rate was established as 1&#x000a0;step/s. The mean success rate of this step was 77.2&#x000a0;% on the first day of the step exercise, which is similar to the previous report&#x02019;s finding (Smith et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2011</xref>). The mean success rate of this step was 90.4&#x000a0;% on the final day, showing a significant increase (P&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). It is possible that this was caused by an improvement in lower limb muscle strength, balance function (how long subjects could stand on one foot and platform stabilometry) and whole body reaction time, which is an indicator of agility. We think that the lower-step program has two benefits. First, it has a highly successful step-rate. Secondly, Watanabe et al. suggested that slow speed exercise is more effective than normal speed exercise (Watanabe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2015</xref>). Therefore, a lower-step program may be more effective than a higher-step one.</p><p>The results of this study involving a 12-week intervention showed that the mean score on Borg scale at the start of the exercise was 12, which confirmed that the intensity of the exercise was appropriate for the elderly. The mean score was 9 at completion of the exercise. The results showed that the exercise tolerance improved. The mean score on Borg scale at the start of the exercise was 12, which was appropriate as an aerobic exercise for the elderly. There was no excessive exercise loading and no adverse events, such as falls or pain, during the intervention. This result was similar to previous reports (Skj&#x000e6;ret et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">b</xref>).Therefore, exergaming was considered to be safe.</p><p>Previous studies reported the efficacy of exergaming using conventional game machines, such as DDR and Nintendo Wii (Taylor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2011</xref>; Bailey and McInnis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2011</xref>; Sell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2008</xref>). These reports were not intended for the elderly. In integrative review (Skj&#x000e6;ret et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">b</xref>), there are four reports of step exergaming in the elderly. Two reports (Pichierri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">b</xref>) were a study of cognitive-motor function, which are not relevant to the focus of our study. Another report (Studenski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2010</xref>) did not show a detailed motor function evaluation. Schoene et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2013</xref>) conducted an intervention with DDR 2 or 3 times a week for 8&#x000a0;weeks in 15 elderly people, with a mean age of 78&#x000a0;years. They reported that the interval until stepping to the front, back, left, or right was shortened, suggesting that this program was useful for preventing falls. In their study, no increase was observed in knee-extending muscle strength and TUG, which was different from our results. This may have been because the intervention period in their study (8&#x000a0;weeks) was shorter than in our study (12&#x000a0;weeks). Muscular weakness in the lower limbs is the most important risk factor for falls (American Geriatrics Society, British Geriatrics Society, and American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Panel on Falls Prevention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2001</xref>). Exergaming, which improved lower-limb muscle strength, resulted in successful outcomes.</p><p>Regarding the effects of interventions with exergaming, although short-term (6&#x02013;12&#x000a0;weeks) interventions have been reported (Taylor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2011</xref>; Bailey and McInnis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2011</xref>; Sell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2008</xref>; Maloney et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2008</xref>; Anderson-Hanley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2011</xref>; Lamoth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2011</xref>; Natbony et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2013</xref>; Skj&#x000e6;ret et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">b</xref>), no study has conducted an intervention that lasted for several years. Annesi previously reported the dropout rate of a new exercise program started in a public exercise facility (Annesi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2007</xref>). The exercise continuation rate a few months after starting the exercise was relatively low (Annesi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2007</xref>). We performed an intervention with exergaming for 3&#x000a0;years, and exercise was continued by 16 out of the 20 subjects, showing a high continuation rate. The attendance rate (%) was high (79&#x000a0;% in the 1-year group, 82.6&#x000a0;% in the 2-year group, 82.4&#x000a0;% in the 3-year group). These changes were not significant. A possible reason for the high attendance rate is a report that exergaming increases exercise compliance (Warburton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2007</xref>; Tamura et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2007</xref>; Baranowski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2008</xref>). In addition, Motor functions also significantly improved. This may have been related to adequate exercise loading and enjoyable game features. This is the first study on the exergaming continuation rate and its influence on motor functions during a long-term intervention for the elderly. Exergaming was safe and useful for maintaining/improving motor functions.</p><p>This study had several limitations. It involved healthy elderly people; high-risk elderly people with a history of frequent falls were not included. Furthermore, subjects in the twelve-week study were arbitrarily divided into exercise and control groups. If a cross-over trial had been conducted, the results obtained may have been more accurate.</p><p>In this study, we did not decide whether to use the same foot in the front step or not. Although it often appeared that front stepping was conducted with the right foot, the correct proportions have not been evaluated. In the previous four reports on the elderly (Pichierri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">b</xref>; Studenski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2010</xref>; Schoene et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2013</xref>), there was no mention of whether subjects were front stepping with one or both feet, a point left open to debate.</p><p>For step exergaming we set the step rate at a constant 1&#x000a0;step/s. A benefit of establishing a constant step rate is that the elderly can obtain a higher score. Since we have not investigated other step-rates, the most effective step-rate for the elderly is open to question. It has been reported that adults start with easier games and progress to more difficult games (Baranes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2014</xref>). In order to maintain motivation over the long term, researchers should consider creating a program which gradually increases the degree of difficulty. There is room for further investigation.</p><p>In the three-year study, there was no comparison with an age-/sex-matched control group. In addition, the number of subjects was relatively small. A larger sample size may be more representative. The exercise parameters, such as the duration and frequency most effective on lateral instability, remain to be elucidated. Nevertheless, this study has provided a basis for further studies on the preventative effects of a step exercise on falls in the elderly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Exergaming was useful for safely improving the motor functions of the elderly, including lower-limb muscle strength, at an adequate intensity of exercise in a short period. In addition, the 3-year intervention confirmed its safety and had a high exercise continuation rate. Furthermore, improvements were observed in motor functions, suggesting the usefulness of exergaming for the prevention of falls in the elderly. A large-scale study needs to be conducted in the future in order to more concretely determine whether exergaming prevents falls.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>YN participated in the study design, performed the statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript.
