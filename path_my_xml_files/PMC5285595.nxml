Various measures such as application of ice, analgesics, anti-inflammatory agents, and proteolytic enzymes have been practiced to minimize these complications.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Bromelain is a blend of enzymes extracted from the stem and fruit of pineapple, Ananas comosus, and is known for its proteolytic action. It belongs to a family of sulfhydryl proteolytic enzymes, which also contain components such as acid phosphatase, peroxidase, many protease inhibitors, and organically bound calcium.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] It is prepared by centrifugation, ultrafiltration, and lyophilisation of pineapple juice.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>In the past, studies have been carried out to determine the effect of orally administered bromelain in reducing the postsurgical complications; these studies suggested few mechanisms of actions such as the following.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>

However, its actions have been found to vary in different persons and different tissues in the same person.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Several clinical studies have been carried out to determine the therapeutic uses of bromelain, and it has been found to be effective in minimizing the severity of angina pectoris and transient ischemic attack, osteoarthritis, autoimmune diseases, diarrhoea, cancer (by activating apoptosis), renal diseases, and respiratory diseases such as asthma, sinusitis, and eosinophilia. The other significant benefit of bromelain is that it enhances the permeability of antibiotics such as penicillin and tetracycline, thereby increasing their absorption.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Even though studies have shown bromelain to have very low toxicity, its IgE-mediated allergenic potential cannot be underestimated. It is recommended to administer bromelain before food and daily dosage should be 750&#x02013;1000 mg/day in divided doses.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>The aim of our study was to assess the effectiveness of bromelain in reducing swelling and pain after surgical removal of third molars.

We found bromelain to be more effective in mesioangular impactions followed by vertical, distoangular, and horizontal types. We also found bromelain to be more effective in impactions of position A than position B and class I than class II. This might be due to less tissue trauma and time taken for removal of mesioangular, position A, and class I types of impactions in later types.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Effectiveness of bromelain in reducing swelling among each subtypes (angulations, positions, and classes) was also compared. We found that bromelain was most effective for mesioangular impactions and least effective for horizontal impactions. Similarly, it was more effective for position A than position B and class I than class II types. Assessment of bromelain for three different difficulty index (mild, moderate, and difficult) were also evaluated. It was found that bromelain to be most effective (86.7%) for mild difficulty index, followed by difficult index (62.5%) and moderate difficult index (58.8%). Less effectiveness of bromelain for moderate difficulty index might be due to the fact that more horizontal angulations, position B, and class II index score were added in this category, which needed more operating time and experienced more intraoperative tissue trauma.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>We recommend further such studies on a larger sample size and using placebo as controls to determine the effectiveness of bromelain in reducing pain and swelling after removal of impacted third molars, so that we can utilize its multitherapeutic benefits. There is also a need to conduct studies comparing different routes of administration as well as different doses of bromelain in altering pain and swelling after third molars removal.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Key findings</title><p>

<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Less cost: We used only Bromelain in our study which costs about 8 Rupee per tablet to the patient.

</p><p>Many controversies between various studies regarding different anti-inflammatory effects obtained after administering bromelain might be mainly due to a lack of knowledge of the effective dosage of bromelain indicated for postoperative inflammation after the extraction of third molars. We suggest further studies focusing on the dose and time-dependant effects of bromelain in reducing postoperative inflammation after third molars extraction, as previous studies and this study has shown that lower dosage at shorter intervals of time was more effective than higher dosage at longer intervals of time.</p><p>Hence, in future, studies with a higher sample size should be carried out to know exactly the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of oral enzymes such as bromelain after third molars extraction.</p><p>Our study evaluated the efficacy of bromelain for winters classification (angulation, position and class) and difficulty index specifically, which was not done in any other previous studies. In our study, we highlighted indications, contraindications, dosage, side effects, and toxicity of bromelain, which should act as reference for future studies on it.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>A prospective randomized clinical study was done on 40 patients requiring surgical removal of impacted mandibular third molars. All the patients were administered bromelain after surgery to assess postoperative pain and swelling on day 1, 3, and 7. It was found that, in 28 patients, there was reduction in pain and swelling. Further studies have to be carried out to establish bromelain as a successful oral enzyme therapy for oral surgery patients.</p><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Financial support and
