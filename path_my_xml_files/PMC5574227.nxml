A recent prospective observational cohort study performed at multiple institutions in five European countries has documented an incidence of AOM of 256 cases per 1000 persons-years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been shown that up to 75% of children will develop AOM at some time before the age of 5&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. AOM is the most common indication for antimicrobial therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, otitis media with effusion (OME), a condition often misdiagnosed as AOM and which does not require antibiotics, is actually the most common condition for which antibacterial agents are prescribed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">It is essential to correctly identify children with AOM, but the diagnosis is often challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. While children with AOM typically present with clinical symptoms of fever, ear pain, and irritability, these findings are nonspecific and frequently overlap with OME and viral upper respiratory infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Proficient skills in pediatric otoscopy is critical for making an accurate diagnosis of AOM as the condition is confirmed by the identification of an effusion and acute inflammatory changes in the middle ear. Diagnostic uncertainty due to a lack of pediatric otoscopy skills has led to an over-diagnosis of AOM, which has resulted in an increased incidence of antimicrobial resistance and higher healthcare costs due to unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions and surgical referrals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">The serious consequences of inaccurate diagnosis of AOM have led to a call for greater education regarding the diagnostic certainty of AOM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Revised clinical guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics have specifically stressed that &#x0201c;educational and dissemination methods both at the practicing physician level and especially at the resident level need to be examined.&#x0201d; Furthermore, &#x0201c;instruction in the proper evaluation of the child&#x02019;s middle ear status should begin with the first pediatric rotation in medical school and continue throughout postgraduate training&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Developing proficient skills in pediatric otoscopy is essential for the diagnosis of AOM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. While formal curricula for pediatric otoscopy are emerging, studies have yet to assess the effectiveness of these interventions using real patients in a clinical setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, curricula with formal standardized content and assessment instruments for medical students have not been described in the literature. While the topic of AOM is prevalent in the learning realm of the medical student, students report that their confidence at arriving at an accurate diagnosis of AOM is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. To meet this educational gap with the overarching aim to impact patient care by improving the accuracy of diagnosing AOM, we evaluated a curriculum for pediatric otoscopy incorporated into the Pediatric medical student clerkship with the use of outcome measures that included assessment of skills with real patients. We hypothesize that students who received the formal curriculum intervention would demonstrate significant gains in pediatric otoscopy skills and the diagnosis of AOM when compared with students with only routine immersion learning exposure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par9">The objective of our study was to document significant gains in pediatric otoscopy skills and the diagnosis of AOM following a formal curriculum intervention. To meet this objective, medical students at the same university were divided into an intervention group (IG) performing their Pediatric clerkship at a large university hospital who received the curriculum and a non-intervention group (NIG) performing their Pediatric clerkship during the same time period at a large off-site community hospital who did not receive the curriculum. Gains in knowledge and skills over the course of the Pediatric clerkship were assessed using objective outcome measures. The study design allowed simultaneous enrollment of students at different institutions in the IG and NIG over the same time period to closely track them longitudinally, to enable outcome measures to be assessed in all students at the same time before and after the curriculum to decrease other factors that might influence post-intervention scores, and to prevent students in the NIG from becoming aware of the content of the curriculum and outcome assessment instruments through interactions with students in the IG.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Subjects</title><p id="Par10">The study was approved by our Institutional Review Board (IRB). The IG consisted of 100 consecutive third year medical students (47 males and 53 females with an average age 26.2&#x000a0;years) performing their Pediatric clerkship at a large university hospital who received the curriculum. A non-intervention group (NIG) consisted of 30 consecutive third year medical students (15 males and 15 females with an average age of 25.6&#x000a0;years) at the same university performing their Pediatric clerkship during the same time period at a large off-site community hospital with strong clinical, educational, and research affiliations with the university hospital. Training including the didactic lecture schedule, inpatient and outpatient clinical experiences, and educational objectives was similar for both groups except for the curriculum. Assignment of medical students to the university and community hospitals was based upon many factors including site availability and scheduling issues. A retention group was created to investigate whether gains in pediatric otoscopy skills and the diagnosis of AOM following the curriculum intervention could be maintained over time. The RG consisted of 79 students (38 males and 41 females with an average age of 25.8&#x000a0;years) in the IG who chose to complete a survey and written test at the end of medical school.

Based upon the needs assessment, a curriculum was developed as a two-hour &#x0201c;mini-lab&#x0201d; session performed in a clinical skills center which included a didactic lecture, a small group session focusing on clinical interpretation of tympanic membrane findings, and hands-on training. The curriculum&#x02019;s content was adapted from Enhancing Proficiency in Otitis Media (ePROM), a peer reviewed web curriculum containing validated images and expert content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A 12-item pediatric otoscopy skills checklist was developed which highlighted the key components of the approach to the pediatric ear exam and consisted of multiple content domains: discussion with the caregiver, equipment usage, child distraction techniques, holding positions, and specific portions of the exam including general technique, pneumatic otoscopy, and cerumen removal. The faculty used the skills checklist to demonstrate the proper method to perform the pediatric ear exam. Students used the checklist to practice otoscopy skills on each other and on mannequins chosen to represent children of varying ages and received facilitated faculty feedback on their skills in a serial manner until they demonstrated competent technique (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Description of the pediatric otoscopy curriculum</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Curriculum Component</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Objectives</td><td>&#x02022; Demonstrate Approach to Pediatric Ear Exam<break/>&#x02022; Differentiate Clinically AOM, OME, and Normal Ear</td></tr><tr><td>Learning Methods</td><td>&#x02022; Interactive Didactic Lecture<break/>&#x02022; Small Group Discussion<break/>&#x02022; Hands-On Training</td></tr><tr><td>Content</td><td>&#x02022; Overview of Ear Anatomy<break/>&#x02022; Discussion of Clinical Presentation and Diagnostic Criteria of AOM, OME, and Normal Ear<break/>&#x02022; Illustration of Tympanic Membrane Findings Using ePROM Images<break/>&#x02022; Discussion of Systematic Methods to Describe Tympanic Membrane<break/>&#x02022; Live Demonstration of Pediatric Ear Exam by Faculty<break/>&#x02022; Practice on Other Students and Mannequins Chosen to Represent Children of Varying Ages Using Skills Checklist with Facilitated Faculty Feedback</td></tr><tr><td>Outcome Measures</td><td>&#x02022; Pre-Intervention and Post-Intervention Written Tests for Intervention Group and Non-Intervention Group<break/>&#x02022; Pre-Intervention and Post-Intervention Assessment of Skills in Real Patients using Skills Checklist for Intervention Group and Non-Intervention Group<break/>&#x02022; Post-Graduation Written Tests for Retention Group</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

It is well recognized that curricula assessment instruments should measure gains in skills in direct patient care settings and that such gains should then translate into the ultimate outcome measure, namely improved patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Yet, this translation of skills from the classroom to the bedside is typically assumed and rarely objectively evaluated. However, our study demonstrated that pediatric otoscopy skills gained in the curriculum intervention were translated into actual skills demonstrated with real patients which were objectively assessed using a validated skills checklist in a direct patient care setting.</p><p id="Par19">Formal curricula for pediatric otoscopy are emerging but remain limited. Kaleida and associates first described the use of the ePROM web curriculum to teach pediatric otoscopy skills to residents but only used a written test as an outcome assessment measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Morris and associates reported the use of an ear simulator to improve the diagnostic accuracy of medical students to detect simulated ear effusions in mannequins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Dinsmore and associates reported the use of a skills checklist to evaluate the otoscopy skills of audiology students using patient actors but did not describe a formal curriculum being evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. There has been a recent emphasis in medical education to evaluate gains of clinical skills with real patients but not specifically with pediatric otoscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. To our knowledge, no previous studies have documented that pediatric otoscopy skills gained after a curriculum intervention could translate into actual skills demonstrated with real patients and assessed using a validated skills checklist.</p><p id="Par20">However, our study also showed that significant learning gains could regress over time. This regression occurred not only with pediatric otoscopy, our selected topic here, but also with other skills which the clinical year student must learn and demonstrate proficiency including medical history taking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], advanced cardiac life support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and airway intubation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Previous studies have emphasized that continued re-assessment and practice opportunities are needed to reinforce students&#x02019; skills and diminish the risk of regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Unfortunately, our students at the end of medical school reported that they received few further real patient opportunities to practice their otoscopy skills.</p><p id="Par21">Our study has limitations. While we compared gains in knowledge and skills between a NIG with only routine immersion learning exposure and an IG group that received a formal curriculum intervention, we acknowledge that our study was not a randomized control study or even a quasi-randomized study given the fact that the IG and NIG were of unequal sizes and performed their Pediatric clerkship at different hospitals. However, there was no significant difference in demographic factors and pre-intervention scores between the IG and NIG, and the clerkship grades, final written exam scores, and choice of residencies of medical students performing their Pediatric clerkship at the different hospitals have been closely tracked to ensure that all students receive the same educational experience. Nevertheless, we recognize that our study cannot account for differences in intelligence or prior pediatric otoscopy exposure between students, differences in clinical experiences provided by the university and community hospitals, or more immeasurable factors including &#x0201c;immersion effects&#x0201d;. Another limitation was that the retention of gains of the IG was only assessed using a written test as it was not possible to schedule time for students voluntarily participating in the RG to have their otoscopy skills assessed with real patients at the end of medical school. Finally, clinical preceptors could not be blinded to the groups being evaluated which may have created bias in their assessment of students&#x02019; otoscopy skills with real patients.</p><p id="Par22">In conclusion, our study adds a formal curriculum intervention to the important topic of pediatric otoscopy which was evaluated using rigorous outcome measures and was found to yield significant gains including skills with real patients. The curriculum could be incorporated into the didactic lecture series included in the third year Pediatric medical student clerkship at most institutions and would provide an excellent complement to the routine immersion learning of pediatric otoscopy skills obtained in the hospital in-patient units and ambulatory clinics. However, learning gains diminished over time, emphasizing the need for continued practice opportunities to reinforce students&#x02019; skills. The educational content, multiple learning strategies, and rigorous assessment instruments described in our curriculum could be adapted for other clinical topics and other learner groups.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec10"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par29">
