The patients are then followed for 96&#x02005;weeks. The primary outcome measure is the time to the event, defined as getting 2 points or more on the PPQ-B score or PPQ-C score, which is assessed using a survival time analysis. The hypothesis being tested is that donepezil prevents psychosis in patients with PD. Efficacy will be tested statistically using the intention-to-treat analysis including a log-rank test or Cox proportional hazard models.

These motor symptoms are caused by the depletion of dopamine in the striatum. Dopamine replacement therapy can improve motor disturbances in PD. However, many patients suffer from psychiatric symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, during their long therapy process.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> and risperidone,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> was investigated based on the possibility that psychosis may be caused by excessive dopamine replacement therapy. Although the efficacy of clozapine against psychosis without worsening of motor symptoms of PD was established in the French Clozapine Parkinson Study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> and the PSYCHOPLOS study,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> clozapine has a risk of granulocytopenia and requires careful blood cell monitoring. Previous randomised clinical trials (RCTs) demonstrated that olanzapine improves psychosis, but there were no significant differences in improvement between the olanzapine groups and the placebo groups. In addition, olanzapine worsened motor symptoms in PD compared with placebo.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> Two other RCTs demonstrated that quetiapine does not worsen motor symptoms; however, its efficacy against psychosis was not superior to placebo.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> A small-sized RCT comparing risperidone and clozapine demonstrated that risperidone improves psychosis as well as clozapine; however, risperidone worsened motor symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> There have been no clinical trials regarding other antipsychotic drugs against psychosis in PD. Taken together antidopaminergic drugs, except for clozapine, insufficiently improve psychosis.</p><p>Cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain play an important role in cognitive function and disruption of the cholinergic system has been proposed in Alzheimer's disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> Previous reports demonstrated that the cholinergic neurons are degenerated, as are dopaminergic neurons in PD,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> suggesting the possibility that psychosis could be caused by cholinergic neuronal damage, but not by dopaminergic replacement therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></p><p>Previously we investigated the clinical risk factors for psychosis in a retrospective cohort study (unpublished data). In this study, 334 patients with PD were followed until the occurrence of psychosis in 24&#x02005;months. PD psychosis was significantly associated with the severity of PD, PD duration and cognitive function. These data demonstrated that psychosis is associated with the severity of the disease and cognitive function and the results are very consistent with previous reports.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13 R14 R15">13&#x02013;15</xref> In addition, the influence of medications was analysed using a case-crossover study comparing medications at the endpoint (occurrence of psychosis or end of the study) and those for 1 or 3&#x02005;months before the endpoint, and the analysis showed that the use of anticholinergic drugs was a significant risk factor for psychosis. In these results psychosis may have been caused by the degeneration of cholinergic neurons and deterioration of cognitive function.</p><p>Donepezil hydrochloride is an inhibitor of acetylcholine esterase in brain neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16 R17 R18">16&#x02013;18</xref> and activates cholinergic neurons.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> Manganelli <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> have demonstrated, by using a neurophysiological technique, the short latency afferent inhibition, a functional involvement of central cholinergic circuits in patients with PD with visual hallucinations. In this context donepezil could reduce the risk of psychosis in patients with PD. In this study we will investigate the efficacy of donepezil against psychosis in a multicentre double-blinded placebo-controlled study.</p><p>Except for clozapine, in previous placebo-controlled RCTs against psychosis, the ratio of participants who dropped out from the trials was relatively high, ranging from 18%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> to 50%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> A high drop-out ratio may be due to patients' worry about being assigned to placebo. In addition, psychosis may spontaneously improve even if assigned to placebo. These conditions make it difficult to demonstrate significant differences between active drugs and placebo. Therefore, in this study, the main outcome measure is the prophylactic efficacy of donepezil and the efficacy will be analysed using a survival time analysis.</p><p>Because psychosis may be overlooked and underestimated, it is assessed using Parkinson Psychosis Questionnaire (PPQ)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> given every 4&#x02005;weeks. The PPQ consists of four categorical dimensions: sleep disturbance, hallucinations/illusions, delusions and orientations. Eligible patients are those whose scores on the PPQ-B (hallucinations/illusion) and PPQ-C (delusion) are zero at least for 8&#x02005;weeks before enrolment and the primary endpoint is the occurrence of psychosis that is defined as PPQ-B &#x02265;2 or PPQ-C &#x02265;2, because the situations when PPQ-B or PPQ-C is &#x02265;2 can result in clinically harmful conditions.</p><p>To exclude patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and PD with dementia, patients with Minimental State Examination (MMSE) score less than 24 are excluded. The risk of psychosis is low in patients with an H-Y stage of 2 or less and the evaluation of psychosis is difficult in patients with H-Y stage of 5. Therefore, patients with H-Y stage of 1&#x02212;2 or 5 are excluded. The length of time to the occurrence of psychosis is compared between participants who were prescribed placebo and those who were prescribed donepezil.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Hypothesis to be examined in the study</title><p>Psychosis may be caused by dysfunction of brain cholinergic neurons.

In determining the cut-off points for PPQ-B and PPQ-C, we think that the lower threshold (or mild psychosis) is better for this trial because of the following three reasons: (1) a lower threshold will allow for higher statistical power in the limited-size trials; (2) higher threshold (or severe psychosis) will make the interpretation of the trial results difficult because investigators will reduce dopaminergic drugs even if mild psychosis occurs, prior to worsening of psychosis; (3) a higher threshold is difficult to set because of the concern over safety of the participants (severe psychosis will be documented as a severe adverse event in the trial). A condition where the PPQ-B or PPQ-C score is 2 or higher is harmful to daily living. A condition with PPQ-B or PPQ-C &#x02265;1 would not always be harmful to daily living and may also be encountered under healthy conditions. Therefore, in this study, psychosis is defined as PPQ-B or PPQ-C &#x02265;2.</p><sec id="s2e1"><title>The first occurrence of psychosis</title><p>To specify the date of the first occurrence of psychosis, patients and their caregivers are requested to fill a diary on visual or auditory hallucinations or illusions. If the date of the occurrence of psychosis cannot be specified by the diary, midpoint between the last visit and the current visit will be regarded as the date of psychosis occurrence.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>In our previous study that followed patients with PD, about 20% patients required antipsychotic medications because of psychosis that was defined as the use of antipsychotics (unpublished data). In the EDAP trial the definition of psychosis is defined according to the PPQ-B (hallucinations/illusions) and PPQ-C (delusions) because of a high inter-rater reliability of the PPQ. According to the definition of psychosis in this study (PPQ-B &#x02265;2 or PPQ-C &#x02265;2), we assumed the cumulative occurrence of psychosis as 45% in the placebo group. According to the previous study, the use of donepezil hydrochloride will reduce the risk of psychosis occurrence by 0.5, and therefore, the cumulative occurrence of psychosis would be 22.5% in the active group. The sample size was calculated on the condition that &#x003b1; is 0.05 (bilateral), power is 0.8 and the statistical test is the log rank test. The sample size was calculated as 84 in each group and 142 in the total participants.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Allocation</title><p>Eligibility is checked at V1 according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Additionally, scoring of PPQ-A&#x02013;D is performed at V2 and we will confirm eligibility, including that the PPQ-B as well as the PPQ-C scores are 0 at V2. The allocation will be carried out with stratification of the subjects according to sex (male and female) and modified H-Y (2.5&#x02013;3.0 and 4.0), because the rate of psychosis is associated with sex and H-Y grades.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Observations</title><p>V1 screening&#x02014;At V1 the following tests or examinations will be performed:
