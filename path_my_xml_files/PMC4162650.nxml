We aimed to examine under controlled experimental conditions how empathy from a partner and personal attachment style affect pain report, tolerance, and facial expressions of pain. Fifty-four participants, divided into secure, anxious, and avoidant attachment style groups, underwent a cold pressor task with their partners present. We manipulated how much empathy the participants perceived that their partners had for them. We observed a significant main effect of perceived empathy on pain report, with greater pain reported in the high perceived empathy condition. No such effects were found for pain tolerance or facial display. We also found a significant interaction of empathy with attachment style group, with the avoidant group reporting and displaying less pain than the secure and the anxious groups in the high perceived empathy condition. No such findings were observed in the low empathy condition. These results suggest that empathy from one's partner may influence pain report beyond behavioral reactions. In addition, the amount of pain report and expression that people show in high empathy conditions depends on their attachment style.</p></sec><sec><title>Perspective</title><p>Believing that one's partner feels high empathy for one's pain may lead individuals to rate the intensity of pain as higher.

Partners may also be important support providers in medical settings, for example, during labor pain or chronic pain consultations.<xref rid="bib32 bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32,37</sup></xref> Several models, ranging from early behaviorist models<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> to recent broader, cognitive-behavioral accounts,<xref rid="bib8 bib19 bib22 bib57" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8,19,22,57</sup></xref> have addressed the role of interpersonal factors in pain. A handful of laboratory<xref rid="bib18 bib34 bib65" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18,34,65</sup></xref> and neuroimaging studies<xref rid="bib16 bib66" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16,66</sup></xref> have also examined causal relations between pain and partner support variables. These studies have focused on different facets of social support, ranging from active, solicitous partner behaviors<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> to &#x0201c;priming&#x0201d; partner support cognitions by picture viewing<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref>; not surprisingly, they have found conflicting results.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Empathy has long been considered a critical feature of supporting, close relationships, but to our knowledge no experimental study has examined the effects of a partner's empathy on pain.</p><p>The precise definition of empathy has been debated in many fields. For example, empathy can be defined as a cognitive ability similar to cognitive perspective-taking (eg, a third-person perspective on someone else's pain), an embodied ability to share another's state (eg, a first-person perspective on sharing someone else's pain), or an interpersonal communicative phenomenon that can shape individual experiences. The latter second-person perspective on empathy<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> is highly relevant to health studies, as perceived emotional support and understanding by health professionals is considered a critical determinant of therapeutic effects and health outcomes.<xref rid="bib2 bib56" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,56</sup></xref> To experimentally investigate the potential modulatory effects of this latter notion of empathy on pain, we recently examined how perceived empathy, defined as the degree to which an individual knew that an observer understood and shared his or her pain, can affect pain.<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref> Perceived empathy was found to influence pain ratings, but only when individual differences in attachment style were taken into account. The observer in that study was an unfamiliar research confederate. In the current study, we focused on perceived empathy from a highly attached, romantic partner, under the assumption that romantic partners are more likely to respond emotionally to each other.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> We thus expected high perceived empathy to reduce subjective ratings of pain in comparison to low perceived empathy. We further expected high perceived empathy to reduce facial expressions of pain, a measure that we had not included in our previous study but that has been shown to be important when the role of other social variables on pain is considered.<xref rid="bib59 bib60 bib61" ref-type="bibr"><sup>59-61</sup></xref> Facial expression is considered by many to be the most prominent way of communicating affect,<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> and displaying and recognizing pain in facial expressions is a fundamental human ability.<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr"><sup>63</sup></xref> Therefore, when empathy is perceived to be high, it may reduce the communicative need and thus reduce facial expressions of pain.</p><p>Because individual differences in attachment style have been found to be critical in moderating the relationship between the social context of pain and pain,<xref rid="bib48 bib65" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48,65</sup></xref> we also examined the role of attachment style in the relationship between perceived empathy and pain perception. Theories of adult attachment style emphasize 2 dimensions of insecurity<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref>: <italic>attachment anxiety</italic> is associated with worry over the availability and responsiveness of others, with exaggerated appraisal of threat, ruminative worry, and reliance on others,<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr"><sup>49</sup></xref> and <italic>attachment avoidance</italic> is associated with discomfort with closeness and a need to maintain autonomy, even in close relationships.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref></p><p>Thus, we expected that the effects of perceived empathy would be moderated by attachment style. Specifically, based on our previous study,<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref> we expected anxious attachment to be associated with amplified communication of pain to the partner, more so when the partner was perceived to be low in empathy. We also expected avoidant attachment to be associated with less expression of pain to the partner, and expression to be lower when the partner was perceived to be high in empathy.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec1.1"><title>Participants</title><p>The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of King's College London. All participants gave written, informed consent to participate in the study. Three hundred ninety-two people responded to a university circular email and completed an online survey. The online survey included questions on demographic characteristics and on the following inclusion criteria: 1) older than age 18&#x000a0;years and in a long-term romantic relationship (&#x0003e;1&#x000a0;year) with someone else older than age 18&#x000a0;years; 2) both partners should be available to attend testing at the same time and both should be willing to take part in the cold pressor task. Exclusion criteria were any previous psychiatric or neurologic history, previous or current chronic pain disorders, history of substance misuse, or drinking more than 28 units of alcohol per week. Participants were also selected based on their attachment style and divided into 3 groups, as explained in the following section.</p><p>The final sample consisted of 54 healthy volunteers aged between 19 and 33&#x000a0;years (mean [M]&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;24, standard deviation&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3.2), 28 (52%) of whom were female. Most participants were in heterosexual couples (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;48, 89%). Sixty-seven percent (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;36) considered themselves to be of &#x0201c;White&#x0201d; ethnic background, 6% (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3) described their ethnic background as &#x0201c;Black,&#x0201d; 17% (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9) as Asian, 7% (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4) as Chinese, 2% (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1) as Arab, and 2% (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1) as of mixed ethnic background.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.2"><title>Attachment Style Recruitment Strategy</title><p>Previous research has not attempted to sample individuals or couples on the basis of their attachment style but instead only measured attachment style retrospectively. This strategy results in participants who tend to score in the low-to-mid range of insecurity dimensions.<xref rid="bib20 bib65" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20,65</sup></xref> Because we aimed to answer specific hypotheses about the role of attachment anxiety and avoidance on the social modulation of pain, we were not interested in recruiting a representative sample of the population in terms of attachment style. Instead, we created our sample by selecting participants on the basis of their scores on the attachment anxiety and avoidance subscales of the Experiences in Close Relationships&#x02013;Revised questionnaire (ECR-R; see measures). This measure derives these 2 main dimensions of attachment style on the basis of continuous scores. We ensured that each couple had to have at least 1 member who scored highly on either the anxiety or avoidance subscale of the ECR-R; a cut-off criterion of higher than the 60th percentile per category was set on the basis of normative data<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> in order to recruit participants who scored in the high end of the distribution of either the attachment anxiety or attachment avoidance subscale. As &#x0201c;secure&#x0201d; is the most common attachment style in the general population,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> it was assumed that a sufficient number of partners' scores on the ECR-R would tend to be low in both anxiety and avoidance, so recruitment was not targeted in this respect. Finally, couples in which either of the partners scored above both the anxiety and avoidance cut-offs (suggesting a more disorganized-disorientated or fearful-avoidant attachment style, 18 in total) were not recruited, as previous studies have found that attachment anxiety and avoidance may have separate effects on social manipulations (see introduction). Accordingly, in this study we were primarily interested to examine the potential modulatory role of attachment anxiety and avoidance separately, and not their combined effect.</p><p>We thus formed 3 mutually exclusive groups: 1) a group consisting of individuals characterized by high anxious attachment scores (scoring above the 60th percentile on the ECR-R anxiety subscale but below the 60th percentile on the ECR-R avoidance subscale), hereafter referred to as the &#x0201c;anxious attachment group&#x0201d;; 2) a group consisting of individuals characterized by high avoidance attachment scores (scoring below the 60th percentile on the anxiety subscale but above the 60th percentile on the avoidance subscale), hereafter referred to as the &#x0201c;avoidant attachment group&#x0201d;; 3) a group consisting of individuals scoring below the 60th percentile cut-offs on both ECR-R subscales, hereafter referred to as the &#x0201c;secure attachment group.&#x0201d; The accompanying partner (who was also tested; see below) was similarly classified as belonging to 1 of the 3 subgroups using the ECR-R questionnaire. The effects of the observing partner's attachment style were also taken into account in the analysis (see below).</p><p>On the basis of the survey responses, 42 couples (84 participants) were eligible to attend testing, and this sample included 25 people who scored above the cut-off on the anxiety subscale of the ECR-R and 27 people who scored above the cut-off on the avoidance subscale of the ECR-R. The remaining 32 participants scored below both cut-offs so were grouped in the secure attachment group. Therefore, all couples eligible had at least 1 member of the couple who scored high on either the anxiety or avoidance subscale of the ECR-R (ie, there was no couple in which both members had a secure attachment style). The precise attachment style scores of each group are presented in the results below. Of all 42 eligible couples invited to attend testing, 30 couples (60 participants) responded and attended. Although 30 couples completed the study, data from only 27 couples (54 participants) was used for the analyses for the following reasons: 2 couples' data were unusable because of filming errors and 1 couple spoke during testing, invalidating the empathy manipulation (see Procedure section below).</p></sec><sec id="sec1.3"><title>Design and Statistical Analyzes</title><sec id="sec1.3.1"><title>Main Design and Analysis</title><p>This study used a mixed 2 (low or high perceived empathy levels, the <italic>within</italic>-subjects factor) by 3 (anxious, avoidant, or secure attachment group, the <italic>between</italic>-subjects factor) design. To test for the effects of each factor and their interactions on our 3 main measures, pain report at tolerance, pain tolerance time, and facial expressions of pain (see Measures section below for details), we implemented 3 separate analysis of covariance models, using the regression command in&#x000a0;Stata (version 11; StataCorp, College Station, TX). We tested the skewness and kurtosis of distributions using the &#x0201c;sktest&#x0201d; command in Stata.<xref rid="bib12 bib46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12,46</sup></xref> We used logarithmic transformations where it restored normality (pain report; see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> and <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref> for the raw, untransformed data), and because of remaining distribution issues we conducted statistical inferences using nonparametric bootstrapping estimation (1,000 repetitions), which does not make distributional assumptions on the data.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> The bootstrap procedure in Stata uses chi-squared statistics to test for statistical significance, which we report (equivalent F values can be obtained by dividing the chi-squared statistic by its degrees of freedom). Finally, we corrected for the nonindependence of observations (the within-subjects factor and testing both partners in a couple) using robust regression methods that appropriately adjust the standard errors (using the &#x0201c;vce(cluster)&#x0201d; option in Stata).<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr"><sup>64</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="sec1.3.2"><title>Secondary, Control Factors and Analyses</title><p>We also controlled for a number of factors that have been shown to be important moderators of the relationship between social support variables and pain.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Specifically, we controlled for gender and order effects by including them as covariates in all analyses. As age and relationship quality (7-item short form of the Dyadic Adjustment Scale [DAS-7]) were not statistically related to our dependent measures, and neither were there statistically significant subgroup differences in these variables, they were not included in the analyses.

Another camera, placed behind the participant partner, was used to film the observing partner and thus control for any facial expressions, gestures, or actions in the observing partner.

Before completing the cold pressor task, participants completed independently a measure of relationship quality (DAS-7) and the PCS. Additionally, to prime participants to think about empathy and to ensure they understood the concept, they were given the following definition of empathy &#x0201c;People often confuse the words empathy and sympathy.

Finally, only the aforementioned study by Sambo and colleagues<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref> assessed the effects on pain of the interaction between empathy and attachment style. Unlike us, they found that higher scores in attachment anxiety, but not in attachment avoidance, predicted higher pain ratings in the low compared to the high empathy condition. However, as that study, and most other studies on the role of attachment style in pain, did not test couples and used unselected samples in terms of attachment style, direct comparisons require caution. Future studies need to assess whether pain in individuals with high attachment anxiety is differentially influenced by partners' versus strangers' empathy, and related facets such as their trustworthiness.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><title>Limitations</title><p>Caution is warranted in extrapolating to clinical pain; experimental pain is far less threatening and personally meaningful than clinical pain.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> In addition, health professionals, friends, and family members may have different effects on pain than romantic partners. Furthermore, partner empathy, operationalized here by a rating, would normally be signaled differently in naturalistic contexts. Moreover, given the aims of the study, we used a within-subject design with a relatively small sample that was not representative of the general population in terms of attachment styles; for example, we excluded individuals with fearful/disorganized styles and couples in which both partners were secure. Given that our findings suggest contrasting results between individuals with high attachment avoidance and individuals with high attachment anxiety, individuals who score high on both dimensions are likely to present with intermediate results on reporting and displaying pain. This prediction would need to be tested in future studies. Future experimental studies could also usefully include an alone condition to contrast with partner present, and measure physiological reactions, as the attachment system may contribute to regulation of arousal.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Additionally, a limitation of our study is that we did not use a validated method of measuring the amount of pain displayed through facial expressions, as the available methods, for example, FACS,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> do not measure the intensity of pain displayed. The development of future measures of this kind could provide more reliable conclusions in this respect. Finally, our results cannot be used to conclude that the absence of empathy from one's partner would lead to a reduction of pain; in our study, partners were represented (by false feedback) as always having some empathy. Although not examined in this study, a related construct of validation of pain has been explored by a number of researchers<xref rid="bib9 bib30 bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9,30,31</sup></xref> and may be usefully included in future research. Thus, future studies could evaluate the effects of &#x0201c;true&#x0201d; and multidimensional partner empathy, the potential effects of absent perceived empathy, or even negative partner reactions such as intolerance, misunderstanding, and invalidation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bartholomew</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Horowitz</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Attachment styles among young adults: A test of a four-category model</article-title><source>J Pers Soc Psychol</source><volume>61</volume><year>1991</year><fpage>226</fpage><lpage>244</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1920064</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Di Blasi</surname><given-names>Z.</given-names></name><name><surname>Harkness</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ernst</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Georgiou</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kleijnen</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Influence of context effects on health outcomes: A systematic review</article-title><source>Lancet</source><volume>357</volume><year>2001</year><fpage>757</fpage><lpage>762</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11253970</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref3"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bowlby</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The making and breaking of affectional bonds.
