The only devices suitable for percutaneous closure of the 20 French arteriotomies of the common femoral artery (CFA) are the Prostar&#x02122; and Proglide&#x02122; devices (Abbott Vascular). Positive effects of these devices seem to consist of a lower infection rate, and shorter operation time and hospital stay. This conclusion was published in previous reports comparing techniques in patients in two different groups (cohort or randomized). Access techniques were never compared in one and the same patient; this research simplifies comparison because patient characteristics will be similar in both groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Percutaneous access of the CFA is compared to surgical cutdown in a single patient; in EVAR surgery, access is necessary in both groins in each patient. Randomization is performed on the introduction site of the larger main device of the endoprosthesis. The contralateral device of the endoprosthesis is smaller. When we use this type of randomization, both groups will contain a similar number of main and contralateral devices. Preoperative nose cultures and perineal cultures are obtained, to compare colonization with postoperative wound cultures (in case of a surgical site infection). Furthermore, patient comfort will be considered, using VAS-scores (Visual analog scale). Punch biopsies of the groin will be harvested to retrospectively compare skin of patients who suffered a surgical site infection (SSI) to patients who did not have an SSI.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The PiERO trial is a multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial designed to show the consequences of using percutaneous access in EVAR surgery and focuses on the occurrence of surgical site infections.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl">NTR4257</ext-link> 10 November 2013, NL44578.042.13.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Percutaneous endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (pEVAR) has been stated to be safe and feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], even though several publications report a substantial number of complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. With evolving experience, various risk factors have been identified, including obesity, groin scarring, common femoral artery (CFA) morphology and tortuous iliac arteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Many current devices successfully close percutaneous punctures of the CFA up to 8 Fr.: such as the Angio-Seal&#x02122; (St. Jude Medical, Minnetonka, MN, USA), Mynx&#x02122; (AccessClosure, Mountain View, CA, USA), and the Starclose&#x02122; device (Abbott Vascular, Redwood City, CA, USA). The Prostar XL&#x02122; device (Abbott Vascular) has been used in femoral arteries, after sheaths of 18 to 24 Fr., with high rates of procedural success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Wound infections appear to be absent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] or few (0.2&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In contrast, open femoral access has wound infection rates varying from 6.4&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] to 7.3&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Also, a longer surgery and hospital stay have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In percutaneous access, secondary interventions were more commonly seen, compared to surgical cutdown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Still, in suitable patients, this seems to be the only device capable of closing a 20 Fr. percutaneous arterial access site.</p><p>Although research has been performed, comparing both techniques, a comparison of both techniques in one patient has never been performed prior to now. Risk factors (obesity, CFA morphology and tortuosity of the iliac arteries) will be equally divided in this study design. Therefore, postoperative complications will mainly depend on the technique used and on the diameter of the device implanted. Also, each patient will be able to compare the result of both techniques by subjective pain sensation or discomfort.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>In the current study, percutaneous femoral access is compared to open femoral access. Bilateral femoral access is required in each patient treated with a bifurcated EVAR. Therefore, each patient can serve as his/her own control. Randomization is performed for the caliber of the endovascular device (main device versus contralateral extension) that is introduced within the aorta.</p><p>The PiERO trial is designed as a randomized, controlled, nonblinded, multicenter superiority trial with two parallel groups and a primary endpoint of wound infection during the 30&#x000a0;days after surgery.

Intention-to-treat implies that open access because of failed percutaneous access is not excluded from analysis but remains in the percutaneous group. Reasons why percutaneous access may not be successful are inability to obtain access to the arterial lumen with a needle, rupture of the threads of the Prostar XL&#x02122; device/2 Proglide&#x02122; devices, necessitating open repair and persistent bleeding despite successful use of the Prostar XL&#x02122; device/2 Proglide&#x02122; devices.

The cost of an SSI is estimated to be between US $10.000, and $20.000 per infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In pEVAR, a trend was noticed to reduce procedure and hospitalization times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The aim of this study is to contribute to the rationale of using percutaneous devices for femoral access in EVAR.</p><p>Analysis will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis. When a percutaneous access, for some reason, is not successful, open access will be obtained. Reasons why percutaneous access may not be successful are described in the Statistical Analysis section.</p><p>For all participants, cultures of the nose and the perineum will be taken preoperatively. In addition, two punch biopsies from the right groin will be obtained to evaluate the presence of microorganisms in deeper layers of the skin or intracellularly (by culture/molecular methods and PA research). The intention is to compare cultures and SSIs as it becomes more apparent that differences in hostility between bacterial species and/or clones exists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Therefore, the assumption was made, that a SSI does not only develop due to flaws in sterility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], but also because some bacteria might be able to conceal themselves better in or on their host, than other bacteria. We know that bacteria can hide intracellularly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and take over resistance genes from each other. Therefore, it might be interesting to compare <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains not causing SSIs, to those that do cause an SSI.</p><p>In conclusion, the PiERO trial is a multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial designed to show the consequences of using percutaneous access in EVAR surgery, when considering surgical site infections. In addition, patient comfort, estimated hospital stay and other wound complications are taken under consideration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Trial status</title><p>Patients have been included as follows in the various participating centers:</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p>adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CERTE</term><def><p>the name of the infectious laboratory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CFA</term><def><p>common femoral artery</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CMO</term><def><p>Commissie Mensgebonden Onderzoek&#x02009;=&#x02009;Commission Research on Humans</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRF</term><def><p>case report form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EVAR</term><def><p>endo-vascular aneurysm repair</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FISH</term><def><p>fluorescence in situ hybridization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Fr.</term><def><p>French</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Nm</term><def><p>Not mentioned</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>pEVAR</term><def><p>percutaneous endovascular aneurysm repair</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PiERO</term><def><p>Percutaneous access in Endovascular Repair versus Open access</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAE</term><def><p>serious adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SSI</term><def><p>surgical site infection</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SWA-score</term><def><p>Southampton Wound Assessment score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p>Visual Analog Scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>BV designed the study, drafted the manuscript and is supervising the progression of the trial.
