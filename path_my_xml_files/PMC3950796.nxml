Accordingly, thermoregulatory and non-thermoregulatory reactions are responsible in this regard.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] So, different pharmacologic interventions were studied considering these reactions, but the precise origin of it is not understood yet.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Opioids have significant role among the identified drugs because the effects of different opioids have been studied frequently in this regard and some of them such as pethidine are commonly used for both treatment and prevention of PAS and it considered as the most effective anti-shivering drug.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] But some adverse effects such as respiratory depression, especially in patients with previous history of opioids and anesthetics administration, hypotension, postoperative nausea and vomiting have limited its use.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Recent studies have investigated the effectiveness of tramadol, a synthetic opioid with low risk of respiratory depression, tolerance, and dependence, in treatment and prophylaxis of PAS.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Tramadol is a centrally acting analgesic with a dual mechanism of action which inhibits the reuptake of 5HT, norepinephrine, and dopamine, and also facilitates 5-hydroxytryptamine 5HT release.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Different studies have evaluated the effect of tramadol, mostly intravenous form, in reducing or preventing PAS, whereas there are reports regarding the side effects of intravenously administrated tramadol and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also has not approved the use of this form of tramadol.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In addition, it seems that oral form of the drug is of low cost compared with its intravenous form.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] So, considering the importance of proper prevention of PAS in order to reduce its related adverse complications in patients undergoing surgery, in this study, we investigated the effect of orally administrated tramadol in the prevention of this common complication of general anesthesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>In this prospective randomized double-blind clinical trial, 80 ASA I and II patients aged 15-70 years, scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia in hospitals affiliated to Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, were enrolled.</p><p>Patients with a history of convulsions and drug history of using antidepressants, carbamazepine, and sedatives, narcotic or alcohol dependence, or patients who had recent febrile disorder or were dehydrated were excluded from the study. In addition, patients who were hemodynamicaly unstable or had severe bleeding during surgery were excluded.</p><p>The Medical Ethics Committee of the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences approved the study protocol and all subjects gave their written consent.</p><p>The patients were randomly allocated according to a random number table to receive oral tramadol (50 mg capsule) in the intervention group and placebo (50 mg capsule) with 50 ml water in the placebo group, 1 h before surgery by a physician who was blinded to the name of drugs.</p><p>The anesthetic management of the patients was performed according to the standard protocol similarly in the two study groups. The anesthesia was induced with IV fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg, atracurium 0.5 mg/kg, and thiopental sodium 5 mg/kg. After orotracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide 60% in oxygen and isoflurane 1-1.5%. Morphine was also administered in a dose of 0.1 mg/kg IV to all patients of the study groups.</p><p>Oxygen saturation, electrocardiography (ECG), non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), pulse oximetery (SpO<sub>2</sub>), and end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) were recorded during surgery. BP (systole and diastole) was monitored before induction of anesthesia, every 5 min during the first 15 min, and every 10 min till the end of surgery. EtCO<sub>2</sub> during surgery was maintained at 30-35 mmHg. Central body temperature was recorded via tympanic thermometer during surgery and in the recovery room every 15 min.</p><p>Residual neuromuscular blockade was antagonized using neostigmine 0.04 mg/kg and atropine 0.02 mg/kg at the end of surgery. During surgery, skin surface and IV fluid warming were not used. The operating room temperature was set at 22&#x000b0;C-25&#x000b0;C.</p><p>After the completion of surgery, when the patient had adequate respiratory efforts and responded to verbal commands properly, the trachea was extubated. The type and duration of anesthesia and surgery were recorded. Anesthesia time was considered as the duration between induction of anesthesia and tracheal extubation. Also, the time from starting of skin incision till wound suture was considered as the surgery time.</p><p>In the recovery room, all patients were evaluated for PAS for 1 h and its occurrence was recorded by a trained nurse.</p><p>The severity of shivering was evaluated by a four-grade scale by another physician who was not aware of the drugs used. The grading was as follows: 0, no shivering; 1, no muscle contraction but mild fasciculations of face or neck or peripheral vasoconstriction; 2, visible tremor involving one muscle group; 3, visible tremor involving more than one muscle group; and 4, gross muscular activity involving the entire body.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>In cases with grade 3-4 shivering for more than 4 min duration, the prophylaxis was considered ineffective and intravenous pethidine 25 mg was administered.</p><p>Also, drug side effects and duration of extubation were evaluated and recorded. Patients were discharged from recovery based on modified Aldrete Score criteria.</p><p>Side effects of the studied drug, including nausea, vomiting, constipation, light headedness, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, seizure, fever, diarrhea, rash, and itching, were recorded if any.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The obtained data were analyzed using SPSS version 15 for windows software, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Chi-square test for all quantitative and qualitative data. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered as significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In this study, 80 patients (ASA I-II) were randomized in two groups (40 in intervention and 40 in placebo groups).</p><p>Demographic characteristics and operative details of the studied population in the two study groups are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic and operative details of patients in intervention (tramadol) and placebo groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ABR-3-64-g001"/></table-wrap><p>PAS was seen in 5 (12.5%) in the intervention group and 10 (25%) in the placebo group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.12).

The results indicated that the overall prevalence of PAS was not significantly different from placebo, but the higher grades of shivering which needed treatment were significantly lower in the tramadol group than in the placebo group, and those patients who received tramadol experienced milder form of shivering.</p><p>Though many trials have investigated the efficacy of different agents in preventing PAS, in this study, considering the advantages of tramadol, we studied the effect of its oral form for the above-mentioned purpose.</p><p>Tramadol is a synthetic opioid which was synthesized in 1962. It has duel mechanism of action by blocking norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake and weak activating the &#x003bc;-opioid receptors MORs.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>The opioid effect of tramadol, mainly mediated through &#x003bc; receptor and kappa or sigma binding sites, is minimal. But it is suggested that the anti-shivering effect of tramadol is due to the additive or synergistic action of both kappa opioid receptor and &#x003b1;2 adrenergic mechanisms.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Tramadol has higher oral bioavailability and it is highly metabolized, and these characteristics make it an appropriate drug for PAS.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>The usefulness of tramadol in PAS has been investigated in many studies. They reported equal or even superior effect to pethidine for tramadol in the prevention of PAS.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Considering that tramadol has less respiratory depression effect and low risk of tolerance and dependence than pethidine, the importance of evaluating its effect becomes more useful.</p><p>Many studies conducted for preventing PAS commonly have investigated the effect of IV form of the drug. But there were reports regarding the side effects of its IV form and FDA did not approve the use of tramadol in IV form.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In addition, the cost of oral tramadol, even its Sustain Release form, is lower than IV form.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] So, in this study, the effect of oral tramadol in preventing PAS was determined. We did not find any similar study on literature review.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, several studies have confirmed the effectiveness of tramadol in IV form for preventing PAS. Mohta <italic>et al</italic>. have investigated the effect of different doses of tramadol, i.e., 1, 2, and 3 mg/kg, for prevention of PAS and showed that in all mentioned doses tramadol was useful for the purpose. Moreover, they indicated that tramadol in a dose of 2 mg/kg had the best combination of anti-shivering and analgesic efficacy without excessive sedation. They concluded that tramadol could be a good agent for both anti-shivering and analgesic effects if it is administrated at the time of wound closure.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Heid <italic>et al</italic>. reported that compared with placebo, intraoperative intravenous administration of tramadol in a dose of 2 mg/kg reduced the incidence and severity of postoperative shivering.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>De Witte and colleagues showed that administration of higher dose of tramadol (3 mg/kg) at the time of wound closure prevented PAS in all studied patients.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In this study, we used a single dose of 50 mg tramadol capsule; it seems that the dose is lower than 1 mg/kg and if we had used higher dose of oral tramadol, it would have been more effective for preventing PAS.</p><p>The effect of tramadol for PAS has been investigated in some studies in Iran. In Tabriz, Atashkhoyi <italic>et al</italic>. studied the effect of single dose of tramadol on prevention of PAS prior to induction of general anesthesia and showed that the rate of PAS was significantly lower in the tramadol group than in the placebo group.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>Javaherforoush <italic>et al</italic>. have reported similar results; accordingly, their findings support the safety and effectiveness of tramadol in prevention and treatment of PAS.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>In this study, though the overall incidence of PAS was not significantly different in the two groups, severe grades of PAS were significantly lower in the tramadol group. It may be due to small sample size and the administered dose of tramadol. It seems that 100 mg tramadol would have better anti-shivering and analgesic effects. However, it would be investigated in future studies.</p><p>The limitation of our study was the small sample size of the studied population. We recommended that for achieving more conclusive results, the effect of tramadol in preventing postoperative shivering is to be compared with pethidine, the most effective drug in this field. Also, studying different doses of tramadol would be helpful in this regard.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>This study was funded by the Bureau for Research, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.
