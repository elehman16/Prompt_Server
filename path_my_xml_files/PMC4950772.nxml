As a result, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended administering TS prophylaxis to this group. However, the applicability of the results to individuals taking ART and living in sub-Saharan Africa has not been definitively evaluated. This study aims to determine if TS prophylaxis benefits HIV-infected Malawian adults after a good response to ART. If TS prophylaxis does indeed show benefit, it is important to determine if this is due to its antibacterial and/or antimalarial properties.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>A randomized, controlled, open-label, phase III trial of continued standard of care prophylaxis with daily trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TS) compared to discontinuation of standard of care TS prophylaxis and starting weekly chloroquine (CQ) prophylaxis or discontinuation of standard of care TS prophylaxis. The study will randomize 1400&#x02013;1500 HIV-infected adults (equally divided over the three study arms) with a nondetectable viral load and a CD4 count of 250/mm<sup>3</sup> or more from antiretroviral therapy clinics in Blantyre and Zomba. The expected rate of primary endpoint events of death and WHO stage 3 and 4 events is 6.8 per 100 person-years of follow-up in all participants. Assuming the number of events follows a Poisson distribution and average participant follow-up after 10&#x000a0;% loss to follow-up is 41.6&#x000a0;months, the study will have approximately 85&#x000a0;% power to rule out a reduction of 35&#x000a0;% or more in primary endpoint events in the TS or CQ arms compared to discontinuation of TS prophylaxis&#x02014;i.e., to show that discontinuation of TS prophylaxis is noninferior to either TS or CQ, with a noninferiority margin of 35&#x000a0;%.

As a result of these studies the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended administering TS prophylaxis to this group. However, these studies were completed prior to the widespread availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and the applicability of the results to individuals taking ART has not been definitively evaluated. A critical question remains about the need for, and duration of, TS prophylaxis and its public health impact: Is there a benefit to TS prophylaxis after patients have initiated and responded to ART?</p><p>In North America and Europe, TS prophylaxis prevents <italic>Pneumocystis jirovecii</italic> pneumonia (PCP) and toxoplasmosis, and is discontinued after the CD4 cell count reaches 200/mm<sup>3</sup>. However, a recent multicenter study demonstrated that even with a CD4 cell count of 100&#x02013;200/mm<sup>3</sup>, there is minimal benefit of TS prophylaxis if the patient is taking ART and the viral load is undetectable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The risk of opportunistic infections, at least those infections common in Western countries, is very low once ART is successful, even with low CD4 cell counts.</p><p>In contrast, studies in Africa have not determined whether there is a point when TS prophylaxis no longer confers an advantage with respect to survival or morbidity. There is consistent evidence to support the use of a CD4 cell count of more than 200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> as a threshold above which TS prophylaxis survival benefit is absent among individuals receiving ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, the broad benefit of TS to prevent bacteremia, pneumonia, enteritis and malaria has not been consistently documented in adults taking ART who live in sub-Saharan Africa. In the Development of Antiretroviral Therapy in Africa (DART) study, the only clear disease-specific benefit of TS was in the prevention of malaria; TS did not prevent WHO clinical stage 4 illnesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A clinical trial to assess the benefit of TS prophylaxis in a population of Ugandan adults taking ART was stopped early because the group taking TS prophylaxis had fewer nonsevere clinical events, such as uncomplicated malaria and diarrheal illnesses, than the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A similar study of TS discontinuation was recently conducted in Ugandan adults to assess the TS prophylaxis benefit with respect to hematological adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Although the main outcome is not yet published, investigators did report a decrease in malaria among participants taking TS therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Another study randomized Kenyan adults taking ART to continue or stop TS prophylaxis, and found that after 1&#x000a0;year of follow-up, TS did not change morbidity and mortality with the exception of fewer malaria cases in the TS arm, and no changes in CD4 count or ART failure were noted over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Malaria prevention is potentially important, as it is associated with transient increases in HIV viral load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, it is not known if these increases are associated with loss of virologic suppression leading to HIV disease progression.</p><p>At the study sites, daily TS prophylaxis is currently used by all persons taking ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and is recommended to be continued for life in the absence of severe side effects as there are no randomized, controlled trials to determine whether or when to stop TS in persons taking ART.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Rationale</title><p>The role of TS prophylaxis in the context of long-term ART is an important issue now facing ART programs in Africa. Currently, the updated WHO recommendation calls for TS prophylaxis in those with a CD4 count of 350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> or less in areas where bacterial infection and malaria are prevalent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, this recommendation is based on expert opinion and not on randomized, controlled trials. Some data from resource-limited settings suggest that it may be safe to discontinue TS among those with immune recovery and a CD4 count above 200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> in response to ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. To date, no randomized clinical trials have assessed the safety and timing of discontinuation of TS prophylaxis following immune recovery in response to ART in resource-limited settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The main study hypotheses are that TS confers a long-term benefit on survival and disease control and that the benefit is largely attributable to the prevention of malaria. The study design takes advantage of the unique opportunity in Malawi, where malaria is uniformly susceptible to CQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In addition to a TS continuation arm and a TS discontinuation control arm, a third arm receives only CQ prophylaxis. Individuals who receive CQ will be receiving extremely effective malaria prevention but will not be protected against bacterial infection. Thus, one study arm prevents both bacterial and parasitic infection, a second arm prevents just malaria and the third arm will not receive prophylaxis.</p><p>This study will inform HIV policy throughout Africa. TS prophylaxis at approximately one billion doses/year could potentially be removed from the ART regimen or, if it is beneficial, its use could be more broadly reinforced as a method of saving lives and prolonging the efficacy of the available ART. A control arm that discontinues TS prophylaxis after good clinical and virologic response to ART is included in the study because of clinical equipoise regarding the benefit of prophylaxis in this population. A randomized clinical trial is needed to definitively inform health policy in Malawi and other sub-Saharan African countries that currently continue TS prophylaxis after successful ART therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Overview of the trial</title><p>A randomized, controlled, open-label, phase III trial of continued standard of care prophylaxis with daily TS compared to (1) discontinuation of standard of care TS prophylaxis and starting weekly chloroquine (CQ) prophylaxis, or (2) discontinuation of standard of care TS prophylaxis.</p><p>Study aim: to assess the need for antimicrobial prophylaxis in HIV-infected adults taking ART in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>Intervention: continue daily TS, stop daily TS, or stop daily TS and start weekly CQ.</p><p>Randomization: 1:1:1 to each study intervention, using block randomization and stratified by site.</p><p>Primary endpoint: the occurrence of a severe event (WHO stage 3 or 4 event or death, see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Revised World Health Organization clinical staging for HIV/AIDS for adults and adolescents with confirmed HIV infection</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Clinical stage 2</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022;

The study staff then ask the participant about their plans to remain in the area and their willingness to attend the research clinic for all scheduled and unscheduled follow-up. Potentially eligible participants are then requested to read the informed consent in either English or Chichewa. The informed consent is read and explained verbally in Chichewa to those who are unable to read. This verbal explanation is attended by a witness who will also sign the consent form. After reading or listening, the potential participant is asked to sign the informed consent form. For those who cannot write, a thumbprint is placed on the form, with the signature and date of a witness. The document also allows the participant to indicate how to handle specimens that remain after the study procedures have been completed. Any use of study samples that is outside the scope of the objectives of this protocol will be submitted for prior review and approval by the appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB).

An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) study product/intervention(s), whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) study product/intervention(s).</p><p>An unanticipated problem (UP) is defined as an event (including onsite and offsite AE reports, injuries, side effects, breaches of confidentiality, deaths or other problems) that occurs any time during or after the research study, which, in the opinion of the principal investigator (PI):<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Involves harm to one or more participants or others, or places one or more participant or others at increased risk of harm <italic>and</italic></p></list-item><list-item><p>Is unexpected <italic>and</italic></p></list-item><list-item><p>Is related to the research procedures</p></list-item></list></p><p>The occurrence of an AE may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews or by a study participant presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor. Any medical condition that is present at the time the participant is enrolled will be considered a baseline condition, and not reported as an AE. However, if it deteriorates at any time during the study it will be recorded as an AE.</p><p>AEs will be captured on the appropriate case report forms. AEs will be recorded in study source documents, and an assessment of whether they are associated with the study drug, the ART regimen, an intercurrent illness or another cause will be made. Information to be collected includes event description, date of onset, clinician&#x02019;s assessment of seriousness and severity, relationship to study product, expectedness and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. AEs will be followed to adequate resolution or stabilization.

We estimate that loss to follow-up will amount to approximately 15&#x000a0;% of the potential follow-up time, so that the follow-up time available for analysis will average about 41.6&#x000a0;months per study participant, for a total of approximately 1619 person-years of follow-up in each study arm.</p><p>For estimating the power of the study, the statistical null hypothesis is that the effect of TS prophylaxis in preventing the first occurrence of a severe event, relative to no prophylaxis, is at least a 35&#x000a0;% reduction in the hazard rate for first occurrences over the study period (i.e., that the hazard ratio, HR, is &#x02264;0.65). Our assumption (alternative hypothesis) for power calculation is that there is no preventive effect of TS, i.e., that HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1. The comparison will be based on the upper limit of a two-sided 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval (CI) for the TS effect. An upper limit of less than 35&#x000a0;% &#x02013; i.e., a reduction significantly less than 35&#x000a0;% at the one-sided 2.5&#x000a0;% significance level &#x02013; will be considered sufficient evidence for discontinuing TS prophylaxis in this population.</p><p>Assuming that the number of severe events follows a Poisson distribution, the mean of the distribution for a participant with average follow-up time (41.6&#x000a0;months) will be approximately 0.236 events, and the probability that the participant will experience at least one severe event will be about 0.210. Assuming that this incidence rate applies to participants taking TS prophylaxis and those without prophylaxis (i.e., no effect of TS prophylaxis), we then expect for the comparison about 196 study participants in both study arms combined to experience at least one severe event, which gives us an expectation of about 85&#x000a0;% power that the upper limit of the 95&#x000a0;% CI for the effect of TS will be less than 35&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The same consideration applies to the comparison of discontinuation of prophylaxis and CQ prophylaxis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec50"><title>Analysis</title><sec id="Sec51"><title>Analysis of the primary endpoint</title><p>The primary analysis will compare continuation of TS and discontinuation of TS. It will consist of a 95&#x000a0;% CI for the effect of TS, relative to no prophylaxis, in preventing the occurrence of a severe event, based on proportional hazards (Cox) regression modeling. The TS effect is defined as 1&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;HR, where HR is the hazard ratio from the Cox regression model. The analysis will be done according to the intention-to-treat principle; that is, each individual&#x02019;s data will be analyzed according to the study arm to which the individual was randomized, regardless of the treatment and amount of treatment actually received. Study participants who develop a WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 illness, experience a sustained decline in their CD4 count below 200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, or who experience ART failure will be given TS prophylaxis and will continue to be followed in the study. The analytical method for comparing CQ prophylaxis and no prophylaxis (i.e., discontinuation of TS) will be the same as for comparing continuation and discontinuation of TS.</p><p>In addition, one or more protocol analyses may be done if there is substantial lack of adherence or administration of a treatment other than the one to which an individual was randomized. This consideration is particularly important since we will be performing noninferiority analysis of discontinuation of TS prophylaxis.</p><p>Secondary analyses will compare TS prophylaxis to no prophylaxis, and CQ prophylaxis to no prophylaxis, with respect to the total number of severe events experienced (i.e., including multiple events in individual study participants), using Poisson regression modeling. TS and CQ prophylaxis will also be compared to each other with respect to the first occurrence and all occurrences of severe events. We do not plan to adjust <italic>p</italic> values or CIs for multiple comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="Sec52"><title>Analysis of loss of viral suppression</title><p>Besides severe events, we are interested in assessing the value of TS and CQ prophylaxis in preventing loss of viral suppression. As for the first occurrence of a severe event, separate comparisons of (1) TS continuation and discontinuation, (2) TS continuation and CQ prophylaxis, and (3) CQ prophylaxis and TS discontinuation will be done using Cox regression modeling to estimate two-sided 95&#x000a0;% CIs for treatment effects, expressed as HRs. Since severe events are expected to occur mainly in participants who do not maintain their viral suppression (i.e., who develop a detectable viral load), we define minimally acceptable prophylaxis, as for the occurrence of a severe event, as at least a 35&#x000a0;% effect in preventing loss of viral suppression. Then the same numbers of losses of viral suppression are needed for 80&#x000a0;% power to obtain a CI for effect of prophylaxis with upper bound less than 35&#x000a0;%, assuming there is no effect, as for the first occurrence of a severe event. We expect the probability of maintaining viral suppression to be approximately 75&#x000a0;% for participants taking TS prophylaxis who have the average amount of follow-up (49&#x000a0;months) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Then about 75 participants in each of the study arms will be expected to lose their viral suppression during the study. The power to obtain an upper confidence limit less than 35&#x000a0;% for effect of prophylaxis is then about 75&#x000a0;% for each of the comparisons.</p><p>Intention-to-treat analysis will be used for all primary comparisons. This analysis will include all participants who were randomized, regardless of attendance at follow-up visits and the duration of study drug administration. For participants who are no longer being actively followed at the end of the study, every effort will be made to obtain their vital status. Per-protocol analysis will be performed as a secondary analysis for those who complied with follow-up visits at least every 8&#x000a0;weeks and for study and ART medication. Analyses will be done in which data on study volunteers who switch from one study intervention to another are censored at the time that they develop an indication for TS prophylaxis, regardless of treatment assignment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec53"><title>Data safety and monitoring</title><p>In addition to the regular safety monitoring conducted by the investigators, this trial will be reviewed at least annually by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) NIAID Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).

Follow-up intervals of reporting will be at the discretion of the DSMB based on trends in the data, but these are planned to occur approximately every 6&#x000a0;months for safety and once per year for efficacy.

They have both been widely used for many decades throughout the world and particularly in Africa, at the doses and for the indications they will be used for in this trial. Their safety profiles are favorable and well known. However, as with any drug, risks do exist. Though CQ is considered safe, adverse reactions to this drug may occur. Commonly reported symptoms include headache, malaise, dizziness, blurred vision, difficulty focusing, muscle weakness and mild gastrointestinal upset. Nonurticarial pruritis, without rash, is a problem that is more common among dark-skinned patients. The symptom usually begins within the first day after the initial dose and may last for up to 7&#x000a0;days. Severe adverse reactions are extremely rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. CQ is well known to be safe in pregnancy and is routinely recommended for both malaria treatment and malaria prophylaxis in pregnant women.</p><p>Common adverse reactions associated with TS use include rash, urticaria, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting. Rare, serious side effects include agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, disease of the hematopoietic system, fulminant hepatic necrosis, severe allergic reaction, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. TS is considered to be relatively contraindicated in pregnancy (class C) because of theoretical risks of neural tube defects in the first trimester and kernicterus in the third trimester. However, both the WHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and the Malawi Ministry of Health presently recommend TS prophylaxis for people living with HIV (PLHIV), including in pregnant women.</p><p>Finger pricks and venipuncture are associated with small risks of bleeding, hematoma and infection. To minimize this risk, the skin will be cleaned with alcohol prior to puncture and sterile, unused needles and lancets will always be used and pressure will be held at the puncture site after removal of the needle or lancet. Although the quantity of blood drawn would not lead to any ill effects on the participants&#x02019; health, some adults feel faint following phlebotomy. The risks will be minimized by having trained technicians perform the procedure. Clinicians will be available to evaluate the participant if there is any untoward effect.</p><p>Study subjects who are assigned to the CQ or no treatment arms may be at increased risk for opportunistic infections. However, the fact that immune reconstitution will have already taken place in these individuals reduces this theoretical risk substantially [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Additionally, the risk of TS prophylaxis-associated adverse reactions must be weighed against the unknown, potential benefit of TS prophylaxis in this population. The potential risk of increased infection in those not taking TS will be minimized by close follow-up and monitoring, which will lead to prompt diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections and malaria should they occur.</p><p>As with any study involving HIV-positive individuals, there is a risk of loss of confidentiality regarding HIV status. Our study team is well known in the community for conducting studies of malaria, so clinic attendance and home visits will not necessarily identify participants&#x02019; HIV status. Efforts to reduce this risk will be a priority. Patients&#x02019; medical records will be kept in a locked cabinet in a locked room.

The investigative team will provide direct access to source data/documents and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by the sponsor and inspection by local and regulatory authorities. The data manager will implement quality control procedures beginning with the data entry system and generate data quality control checks that will be run on the database. Any missing data or data anomalies will be communicated to the site for clarification and resolution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec65"><title>Monitoring</title><p>Study monitoring will be conducted to ensure participant safety compliance of study conduct with 45 CFR 46, GCP, ICH and DAIDS guidelines. A separate monitoring plan will be developed by DAIDS and implemented by the DAIDS Clinical Site and Study Monitoring Contractor.</p><p>The site monitors will visit participating clinical research sites to review individual subject records, including consent forms, CRFs, supporting data, laboratory specimen records, and medical records (physicians&#x02019; progress notes, nurses&#x02019; notes, individuals&#x02019; hospital charts), and to ensure protection of study subjects, compliance with the protocol and accuracy and completeness of records. The monitors also will inspect sites&#x02019; regulatory files to ensure that regulatory requirements are being followed and sites&#x02019; pharmacies to review product storage and management.</p></sec><sec id="Sec66"><title>Plans for dissemination of results</title><p>The PI and co-investigators regularly participate in local and national meetings in Malawi to discuss malaria and HIV issues as well as local research meetings at the University of Malawi College of Medicine. The findings will be presented at the annual College of Medicine Research Dissemination Day and at other appropriate conference venues. Study results will also be shared expeditiously with Malawian HIV and malaria control officials and the Malawi Ministry of Health and its local representatives. Results will be submitted for publication to local and international journals in accordance with authorship guidelines established by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. The study protocol will be provided in publication supplementary materials.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec67"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec68"><title>Clinical trial coordination</title><p>Daily study activities are managed onsite by a study physician, with visits twice weekly by a senior study physician with HIV management expertise. Challenging clinical cases are scheduled on days when senior physicians are onsite. The local study teams participate in weekly teleconferences with international investigators to discuss study progress, challenges and planning. SAEs are identified by the study team and reported to senior physicians and international investigators via email and/or phone to refine diagnostics and management as needed. International investigators make regular visits to the study sites approximately every other month to review progress and assist in study coordination.</p></sec><sec id="Sec69"><title>Trial status</title><p>The study began recruitment activities at the Ndirande site in November 2012. By mid-February 2015, 900 participants had been recruited. The DSMB evaluated study progress as planned, starting in 2013, and determined that the study was being conducted well and should continue.</p><p>During the first year of follow-up in 2013, study investigators noted several pregnancies in study participants who had agreed to practice contraception during the informed consent process. As a result, the study team implemented checks at scheduled follow-up visits to ensure that participants were able to access family planning methods in the community, and to facilitate referral to family planning clinics for contraception. As a result, the incidence of pregnancy in the study population has decreased.</p><p>Initially, the trial was designed to recruit 900 participants, with the rationale that the primary endpoint event rate in the entire participant population would be 15 per 100 person-years. As no prospective data were available at the time, this assumption was based on a post-hoc analysis of retrospective data from a similar population. As the study accrued participants, the overall event rate was reviewed regularly due to this uncertainty, and the event rate observed in the study population was 6.8 per 100 person-years as of an interim database lock of July 2014. Sample size determination was revisited at that time, and it was determined that adding approximately 500&#x02013;600 participants and 2&#x000a0;years of follow-up should provide the expected 350 primary endpoint events needed for primary endpoint analysis. The sponsor agreed to extend and expand the study in early 2015, and a second site, Zomba, was added for recruitment and follow-up in mid-2015.
