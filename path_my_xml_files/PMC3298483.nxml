Cystatin C is independently associated with cardiovascular disease and our objective was to investigate the relation between this novel biomarker and standardized bed rest. Research of immobilization physiology in humans is challenging because good biological models are in short supply. From the Women International Space simulation for Exploration study (WISE) we studied markers of atherosclerosis and kidney function, including cystatin C, in a standardized bed rest study on healthy volunteers. Fifteen healthy female volunteers participated in a 20-day ambulatory control period followed by 60 days of bed rest in head-down tilt position (-6&#x000b0;) 24 h a day, finalized by 20 days of recovery. The subjects were randomized into two groups during bed rest: a control group (n = 8) that remained physically inactive and an exercise group (n = 7) that participated in both supine resistance and aerobic exercise training.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Compared to baseline values there was a statistically significant increase in cystatin C in both groups after bed rest (P &#x0003c; 0.001). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), calculated by both cystatin C and Cockcroft-Gault equation, decreased after bed rest while there were no differences in creatinine or creatine kinase levels. CRP did not change during bed rest in the exercise group, but there was an increase of CRP in the control group during recovery compared to both the baseline and the bed rest periods. The apo-B/apo-Ai ratio increased during bed rest and decreased again in the recovery period. Subjects experienced a small but statistically significant reduction in weight during bed rest and compared to baseline weights remained lower at day 8 of recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>During and following prolonged standardized bed rest the concentrations of several clinically relevant cardiovascular risk markers change.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Sedentary lifestyle is associated with inflammation in population-based studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and increases cardiovascular risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Bed rest causes muscle atrophy, which in turn leads to lower creatinine levels and decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), when calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula or Cockcroft-Gault formula dependant on creatinine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Cystatin C is also a marker of GFR but is unaffected by muscle mass. However, age, sex, weight, smoking and high concentrations of CRP affect the plasma level of cystatin C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Because bed rest and cystatin C levels are both cardiovascular risk factors we found it of interest to investigate how cystatin C, together with other risk markers, are affected by prolonged standardized bed rest.</p><p>It has been proposed that elevated cystatin C levels are directly correlated to both inflammation and atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. High cystatin C levels are independently associated with cardiovascular risk factors such as BMI, low HDL cholesterol and smoking even in patients without chronic kidney disease or microalbuminuria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Cystatin C is independently associated with cardiovascular disease after adjustment for major cardiovascular risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].

We also measured traditional markers of inflammation and kidney function. Eight days after a bed rest period of 60 days was completed cystatin C levels increased and GFR decreased and for GFR this was independent of calculation method.</p><p>Bed rest is probably the single most applied therapy for hospitalized patients no matter the underlying disease. It is therefore of great importance to understand the pathophysiological changes during immobilization as it may influence treatment. The growing problem of "sedentary lifestyle" could also be considered as a global immobilisation experiment. Future trips to Mars require further information of the effect of immobilization to the human body.</p><p>Patients with elevated levels of cystatin C are at higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Low glomerular filtration rate is a risk factor for cardiovascular mortality, independent of other cardiovascular risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Peralta el al discussed the probability that cystatin C might be a better parameter for identifying patients with chronic kidney disease at risk of developing cardiovascular complications than a creatinine-based equation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Other researchers found that elderly people with the highest quintile of cystatin C (1.29 mg/i) have a significantly elevated risk of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, and stroke after multivariate adjustment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Cystatin C is linearly associated with cardiovascular mortality, but creatinine on the other hand predicts worse outcome only in patients with severe kidney dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>It has been described that high cystatin C levels correlate to an extensively increased risk of cardiovascular events in persons who do not meet the criterion of eGRF &#x02264; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, a definition of chronic kidney disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. High cystatin C levels have been found to be associated with elevated levels of CRP and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and other inflammatory markers such as IL-6, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;), and two soluble TNF-&#x003b1; receptors, even with creatinine-based eGFR &#x02265; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. How non-renal factors influence cystatin C concentrations need further research.</p><p>In our study CRP was elevated after bed rest in the non-exercise group. Our finding might reflect that bed rest increases inflammatory activity, which in turn advances the atherosclerotic process leading to enhanced risk of CVD as well as elevated cystatin C levels by atherosclerosis in the kidneys and thereby a decreased glomerular filtration rate. In a recent study of overweight/obese postmenopausal women practising physical activity, it was shown that women with the highest tertile of physical activity energy expenditure had lower concentrations of hsCRP after adjustment for fat mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This can give an explanation to the difference in CRP between the control group and the exercise group in our study.</p><p>Cystatin C also has a different role in relation to inflammation/atherosclerosis. Inflammatory cytokines associated with atherosclerosis stimulate the production of lysosomal cathepsins and increase the plasma concentration of cystatin C. Cystatin C is a cathepsin inhibitor and might therefore play a roll in counterbalancing a potentially destructive greater elastolytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Mice deficient in cystatin C have increased elastic lamina degradation and greater atherosclerotic plaque formation. Studies have shown that both cathepsins and their inhibitor cystatin C could act either pro- or antiatherogenic in the different stages of atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This role of cystatin C probably plays a lesser part in our study.</p><p>A limitation to our study is that the blood samples were taken in 2005 and analysed five years later. This might have influenced our results. A recent study however, has shown that when using the Gentian method the cystatin C levels were stable when comparing blood samples over four years of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>All samples were analyzed in a single batch and in a random mode with the same reagent batch and the same calibration on a single instrument. The instrument has a high assay capacity so the time interval between first and last assay were less than 30 min. This in combination with the low assay CVs makes it unlikely that the differences in this study are due to variation in the assay or sample evaporation during the assay. Our findings were done in women only and the groups were relatively small. Knight et al. found in a cross-sectional study that male gender was independently associated with higher serum cystatin C after adjusting for creatinine clearance. Older age, greater height and weight have a similar effect. Previously, serum cystatin C levels have been found to correlate somewhat with weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In our study there was a statistically significant weight reduction in both groups after 44 days of bed rest and in the recovery period compared to baseline. According to Knight et al. because of weight loss a reduction in cystatin C levels could have been expected. In vertebrates both metabolic rate and glomerular filtration rate are positively correlated to body size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, we found the opposite - an increase in cystatin C levels. This could indicate that cystatin C is a marker of other physiological processes than kidney function. Knight et al. showed that high CRP levels are independently associated with increased cystatin C levels after adjustment for creatinine clearance. Cystatin C can also be a biomarker for inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In another substudy of WISE it was shown that bed rest causes both mechanistic and functional impairment of endothelial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. These results could serve as a possible explanation for the cystatin C findings in our study - because early changes in endothelial function are part of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.</p><p>The decrease in GFR calculated with the Cockcroft-Gault formula can be explained by a combination of weight reduction and stable creatinine values. Weight reduction in the control group was most likely due to muscle atrophy and stable fat mass. Unexpectedly, Bergouignan et al. showed that the desire to eat was reduced in the exercise group - leading to a negative energy balance and a decrease in fat mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. It is a limitation to our study that a golden standard measurement, as e.g. iohexol clearance, was not used. We did, however, use two different methods to calculate GFR, both dependent (the Cockcroft-Gault formula) and independent of weight (cystatin C) and the findings were identical - a decrease in GFR after bed rest. In a recent cross sectional study of persons with early stages of chronic kidney disease, light and total physical activity were positively correlated to kidney function when measured by MDRD. This relationship lost statistical significance after adjustment for BMI, cholesterol, CRP and mean arterial blood pressure. Increased physical activity may reduce the progression of chronic kidney disease by decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation and reducing blood pressure besides the positive effect of weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Conceivably decreased physical activity, in our study bed rest, has the opposite effect with an increase in oxidative stress and inflammation.</p><p>We cannot explain why the changes were seen first <italic>after </italic>the bed rest study was completed and not <italic>during </italic>bed rest. The effect could be due to the change from resting to standing position as it has previously been shown that body position per se influences renal perfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Further studies are required to determine the mechanism of the effect of bed rest on cystatin C as well as other cardiovascular risk markers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, cystatin C increased and cystatin C estimated GFR decreased in healthy female volunteers after a standardized bed rest period of 60 days. As cystatin C is a cardiovascular risk marker, this study may implicate that longer time periods of immobilization augment the risk of atherosclerosis. This is however only a hypothesis. Further studies are warranted to explore the role of cystatin C as a link between inactivity and cardiovascular risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KA, KC, AL and OF were involved in the conception and design of this project.
