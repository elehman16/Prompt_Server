But 98% of all serious adverse events during EGDEs are ascribed to sedation. The S3 guideline for sedation procedures in gastrointestinal endoscopy published in 2008 in Germany increases patient safety by standardization. These new regulations increase costs because of the need for more personnel and a prolonged discharge procedure after examinations with sedation. Many patients have difficulties to meet the discharge criteria regulated by the S3 guideline, e.g. the call for a second person to escort them home, to resign from driving and working for the rest of the day, resulting in a refusal of sedation. Therefore, we would like to examine if an acupuncture during elective, diagnostic EGDEs could increase the comfort of patients refusing systemic sedation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A single-center, double blinded, placebo controlled superiority trial to compare the success rates of elective, diagnostic EGDEs with real and placebo acupuncture. All patients aged 18 years or older scheduled for elective, diagnostic EGDE who refuse a systemic sedation are eligible. 354 patients will be randomized. The primary endpoint is the rate of successful EGDEs with the randomized technique. Intervention: Real or placebo acupuncture before and during EGDE. Duration of study: Approximately 24 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Organisation/Responsibility The ACUPEND - Trial will be conducted in accordance with the protocol and in compliance with the moral, ethical, and scientific principles governing clinical research as set out in the Declaration of Helsinki (1989) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP). The Interdisciplinary Endoscopy Center (IEZ) of the University Hospital Heidelberg is responsible for design and conduct of the trial, including randomization and documentation of patients' data. Data management and statistical analysis will be performed by the independent Institute for Medical Biometry and Informatics (IMBI) and the Center of Clinical Trials (KSC) at the Department of General, Visceral and Transplantation Surgery, University of Heidelberg.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>The trial is registered at Germanctr.de (DRKS00000164) on December 10<sup>th </sup>2009.

The standard use of systemic sedation to facilitate the performance of esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGDE) and to increase patient comfort has contributed to the widespread use and acceptance of this procedure. But the perceived benefits of improved patient comfort and satisfaction afforded by parenteral sedation must be measured against the increased risk of adverse cardiopulmonary events and higher attendant costs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Complications that arise from EGDE are usually associated with the use of systemic sedation and the dose given. More than 98% of serious adverse events in upper GI endoscopy like hypotension, aspiration and respiratory depression are ascribed to systemic sedation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Recently, the first S3-guideline for sedation in GI endoscopy in Germany was published to improve patient safety, which demands additional trained personnel and endoscopy equipment[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Therefore, it is estimated that sedation and related issues account for up to 40% of total endoscopy costs including overhead and indirect costs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In detail, an additional specialized nurse or physician is required to perform and monitor systemic sedation. Furthermore, systemic sedation impedes the rapid discharge from the hospital, resulting in absence of work of patients concerned.</p><p>Acupuncture has been used as a part of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TMC) for more than 2000 years[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Many studies have investigated the benefits and success of acupuncture in reducing pain for various acute and chronic diseases. However, most of them had methodological difficulties, e.g. the inclusion of an adequate control group[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. A Cochrane review from 2009 on acupuncture for migraine prophylaxis reports that even acupuncture at the "wrong" place (sham-acupuncture) could have a significant effect on the primary endpoint[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Therefore, the use of a real placebo needle is necessary. With the introduction of a placebo acupuncture needle system some years ago a new and valid instrument to measure placebo effects became available (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Image of real and placebo acupuncture needle system</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-12-52-1"/></fig><p>If the use of acupuncture could improve tolerance and examination quality of diagnostic EGDE without sedation it should be possible to increase the willingness of patients to undergo this examination without systemic sedation. Consequently, it would be possible to reduce the rate of serious adverse events due to systemic sedation and to lower the costs for personnel and material.</p><p>Up to now, only one double-blind, controlled trial with 90 patients undergoing EGDE was performed in 1978, using real versus sham-acupuncture (1 cm away from the acupuncture point) with 10 needles and electrical stimulation and showing that upper endoscopy was much easier and better tolerated after real acupuncture[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. But this study misses a clearly defined primary endpoint and a detailed sample size calculation and has the disadvantage of using sham-acupuncture instead of a real placebo acupuncture technique in the control group. An adequately designed randomized double-blinded placebo controlled clinical trial with a well-defined primary endpoint and detailed sample size calculation comparing placebo acupuncture versus real acupuncture to improve success rates in EGDE has not yet been conducted.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Aim of study</title><p>The objective of this trial is to compare the rate of successful EGDE (combination of patients' satisfaction and examination quality) in patients receiving pharyngeal anaethesia as well as either real or placebo acupuncture.</p></sec><sec><title>Number of patients needed</title><p>The sample size calculation is based on the two-sided chi-square test for difference with respect to the primary endpoint.</p><p>A review of the previous literature identified a randomized controlled trial from Abraham et al. with a group of 419 patients comparing the rate of successful EDGE with and without sedation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In both groups a pharyngeal anaesthesia was performed. This trial showed a successful examination rate of 46% in the group without sedation. A successful examination was defined as a composite score of patient satisfaction with the procedure as well as quality of the examination (technical adequacy) as assessed by the endoscopist. These were determined by the administration of standardized Likert scales (patient satisfaction on a scale of 1-5, quality of examination on a scale of 1-4). An EDGE examination was only counted as successful if the patient rated 1 or 2 on the satisfaction scale and the endoscopist rated 4 on the quality of examination scale. Based on the results from this large trial we decided to adapt the definition of successful EDGE for our trial and use the 46% success rate of the non sedated group as baseline for the sample size calculation. We believe that an increase of the success rate by 15% or more to &#x0003e; = 61% in the acupuncture group would be clinically relevant and therefore could impact clinical practice. To detect this difference at a type I error rate of &#x003b1; = 0.05 (two-sided) with power 1-&#x003b2; = 80%, a sample size of n = 173 evaluable patients per group is necessary (SAS 9.1 proc power). The drop out rate within the intervention is expected to be about 2% overall. Therefore, another 8 patients in total have to be randomized to obtain the required number of evaluable patients. The total number of patients needed to be randomized is therefore 354 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Flowchart according to CONSORT</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-12-52-2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Eligibility</title><p>Inclusion criteria</p><p>&#x02022; Age equal or greater than 18 years</p><p>&#x02022; Patients scheduled for elective diagnostic EGDE without systemic sedation</p><p>Exclusion criteria</p><p>&#x02022; Patients classified ASA V</p><p>&#x02022; Participation in another clinical trial which could interfere with the primary endpoint of this study</p><p>&#x02022; Expected lack of compliance</p><p>&#x02022; Impaired mental state or language problems</p><p>&#x02022; Patients with known allergy to lidocaine anaesthetic spray or acupuncture needle material</p><p>&#x02022; Necessity of systemic sedation</p><p>&#x02022; Emergency procedures</p><p>&#x02022; Pregnancy</p><p>Subject withdrawal criteria</p><p>&#x02022; At their own request or at request of the legal representative</p><p>&#x02022; If, in the investigator's opinion (physician performing the acupuncture or physician performing the examination), continuation of the trial would be detrimental to the subject's well-being (e.g. strong pain at the insertion points, allergical reactions, other independent acute health problems).</p><p>All withdrawn patients will be reported in the final results to guarantee maximum transparency.</p></sec><sec><title>Consent</title><p>The ACUPEND- Trial will be conducted in accordance with the protocol and in compliance with the moral, ethical, and scientific principles governing clinical research as set out in the Declaration of Helsinki 1989[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and Good Clinical Practice <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Scientific_guideline/2009/09/WC500002874.pdf">http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Scientific_guideline/2009/09/WC500002874.pdf</ext-link>.

All patients scheduled for elective, diagnostic EGDE in the Interdisciplinary Endoscopy Center (IEZ) who refuse sedation will be referred to and screened by members of IEZ or the Clinical Study Center Surgery (KSC). The result of the screening will be recorded in the screening-log.</p><p>Approximately 4300 patients per year undergo an EGDE including about 900 patients without systemic sedation in the Interdisciplinary Center for Endoscopy (IEZ) of the Universitiy of Heidelberg. The estimated time frame to randomize 354 patients is 20 months.</p><p>Sponsor of the ACUPEND trial is the University Hospital of Heidelberg.</p><p>The independent data management and statistical analysis will be carried out by the Institute of Medical Biometry and Informatics (IMBI) of the University of Heidelberg according to a prespecified Statistical Analysis Plan.</p><p>The principal investigator has the right to terminate the trial and to remove all trial material from the trial centre at any time in consultation with the Clinical Study Team Leader and the Biostatistician. Reasons that may require a termination of the trial include the following:</p><p>&#x02022; The incidence or severity of adverse events in this trial indicates a potential health hazard caused by the study treatment</p><p>&#x02022; It appears that patient's enrolment is unsatisfactory with respect to quality or quantity or data recording is severely inaccurate or incomplete</p><p>&#x02022; External evidence that renders the necessity to terminate the trial</p></sec><sec><title>Financial support</title><p>The trial will be sponsored by the regular research budget (State of Baden-W&#x000fc;rttemberg) of the Clinical Study Center Surgery (KSC), Department of General, Visceral and Transplantation Surgery of the University of Heidelberg and the IEZ.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>PK, CB, CMS, KP and AS are responsible for the study design, definitions of the primary and secondary endpoints and preparation of the protocol.
