Patients with advanced melanoma enrolled onto our phase II clinical studies have been treated with autologous DC loaded with autologous tumor lysate/homogenate matured with a cytokine cocktail, showing a clinical benefit (PR&#x02009;+&#x02009;SD) in 55.5% of evaluable cases to date. The beneficial effects of the vaccine were mainly restricted to patients who developed vaccine-specific immune response after treatment.

Although it accounts for only 4% of incident cases of skin cancers, it is responsible for more than 80% of all skin cancer deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Moreover, its incidence has dramatically increased in recent decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Whilst early stage melanoma (i.e. primary thin melanomas without regional lymph node or distance involvement) has a very favourable prognosis with a recurrence rate of less than 10% at five years, patients with advanced disease experience a very poor clinical course, with median survival ranging from 4 to 12&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, until very recently, the clinical efficacy of the available treatments was disappointing. In early 2011, the FDA approved the clinical use of ipilimumab, a CTLA 4-blocking monoclonal antibody which, in addition to significantly improving the survival of patients with metastatic melanoma, primarily demonstrated the effectiveness of anti-cancer therapy based only upon immune system targeting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, ipilimumab causes a generalized activation of the immune system which can, in extreme cases, induce severe autoimmune side-effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. On this basis, immunotherapeutic approaches capable of eliciting effective anti-tumor immune responses without the related autoimmunity must be sought developed.</p></sec><sec><title>Dendritic cell vaccination</title><p>Vaccination with dendritic cells (DC) loaded with tumor antigens has been shown to elicit tumor-specific immune responses potentially capable of killing cancer cells without inducing significant side-effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. DC are widely distributed antigen-presenting cells that play a central role in the activation and regulation of the immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In particular, DC determine the final outcome of adaptive immune responses against a specific antigen, <italic>i.e</italic>. whether it will be tolerated or whether a specific immune response will be triggered against it. The final outcome depends on the balance between different signals acting on the DC and DC antigen uptake. Indeed, if immature DC recruited to peripheral tissues find appropriate &#x0201c;danger signals&#x0201d; (<italic>i.e</italic>. pathogen products capable of triggering toll-like receptors), they undergo maturation and migrate to lymph nodes where they initiate a specific immune response. Conversely, if danger signals are not present, or if concurrent immunosuppressive stimuli occur, DC maturation does not take place, thus inducing immune tolerance against the antigens they are presenting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. As cancer progresses, tumor cells acquire the ability to evade the immune response by selecting lesser immunogenic variants (&#x0201c;cancer immunoediting&#x0201d;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and/or by producing immunosuppressive cytokines and other biologically active substances that strongly influence the ability of DC to prime and sustain effective immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>In 1996, Schadendorf&#x02019;s group was the first to test, in melanoma patients, the feasibility of a vaccination strategy aimed at reconditioning DC function by their differentiation and loading with tumor antigens <italic>ex vivo</italic>, thus permitting the effects of a DC-tolerant tumor microenvironment to be overcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Since this first experience, it has been estimated that over 1,000 patients with different tumors have been treated using different starting cells and differentiation/maturation protocols, as well as different antigen sources and administration routes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Since 2001, patients with advanced melanoma enrolled onto our phase II clinical studies have been administered autologous DC loaded with autologous tumor lysate/homogenate matured with a cytokine cocktail, showing a clinical benefit (PR&#x02009;+&#x02009;SD) in 55.5% of evaluable cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Like de Vries et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], we saw that patients who developed anti-tumor immunity after vaccination experienced a better clinical outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In particular, we observed that patients developing delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) against autologous tumor lysate or keyhole lympet hemocyanin (KLH) after at least four courses of the vaccine showed a median overall survival (OS) of 22.9&#x000a0;months compared to the 4.8&#x000a0;months of DTH-negative cases (Log-rank test, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.007) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Intriguingly, both the disease control rate (DCR) and OS obtained with DC vaccination considerably exceeded those obtained with ipilimumab in a similar patient setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, although differentiation and maturation conditions used for the production of DC vaccines have been standardized, only two-thirds of patients develop potentially effective anti-tumor immune responses. We recently reported that patients showing upregulated expression of tumor endothelial marker-8 (TEM-8) in monocyte-derived DC upon maturation do not develop immune reactivity against autologous tumor lysate (ATL) or KLH on DTH and experience a very poor clinical outcome after DC vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>TEM-8 is an integrin-like cell surface protein specifically expressed by embryonic and tumor endothelial cells (not, however, in the adult endothelium) whose functions are still not fully understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. It was recently shown that TEM-8 is upregulated in tumor-associated endothelial cells after exposure to interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]; interestingly, IL-1&#x003b2;, together with tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) and other cytokines produced by tumor cells (melanoma included) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], can negatively affect the differentiation of monocyte-derived DC in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. As IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; are components of the cytokine maturation cocktail currently used to prepare the DC vaccine, it would not be surprising that, at least in a subset of patients, these cytokines support the differentiation of DC toward an immunosuppressive TEM-8&#x02009;+&#x02009;phenotype rather than the more immunogenic and clinically active phenotype. In light of this, new treatment conditions capable of preventing such an occurrence should be identified.</p></sec><sec><title>Potential effects of Interferon-&#x003b1; (IFN-&#x003b1;) on circulating precursors of DC</title><p>IFN-&#x003b1; is a cytokine belonging to type-I interferons that is currently approved for clinical use in B-cell non-Hodgkin&#x02019;s lymphoma, advanced renal cell cancer and, in the adjuvant setting, malignant melanoma. This cytokine is secreted by virtually all cells after challenge with viral or bacterial products, but it can also be produced by transformed cells or by normal cells under mitogenic stimulus. Its effects on tumor or virus-infected cells are pleiotropic, ranging from the direct inhibition of proliferation to the suppression of oncogene expression and the induction of tumor suppressor genes. Moreover, IFN-&#x003b1; positively affects the activity of both the adaptive and innate immune system, and enhances immune recognition of tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Furthermore, IFN-&#x003b1; inhibits the expression of the proangiogenic inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-8 (IL-8), and IL-1&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], both of which induce an immunosuppressive phenotype in monocyte-derived DC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>It is tempting to speculate that treatment with IFN-&#x003b1;, whilst inhibiting the expression of IL-1&#x003b2;, may also suppress the maturation-induced TEM-8 upregulation of DC observed in non-immunoresponsive patients, thus revertingthe TEM-8 associated immunosuppressive phenotype. In partial support of this hypothesis is our observation of positive immunization to DTH in all patients who underwent therapy with IFN-&#x003b1; a maximum of 30&#x000a0;days before starting DC vaccination (our unpublished data), suggesting that IFN-&#x003b1; priming performed <italic>in vivo</italic> before leukapheresis may enhance the immunostimulatory profile of DC. Moreover, IFN-&#x003b1; priming may also have a &#x0201c;mobilizing&#x0201d; activity on DC precursors: it was recently reported that 1&#x02013;3 MU subcutaneous IFN-&#x003b1; enhances the proportion of circulating CD14+ and CD14&#x02009;+&#x02009;CD16+ monocytes in both healthy donors and melanoma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>In the light of these findings, administration of IFN-&#x003b1; before leukapheresis may positively modulate the immunological and clinical efficacy of DC vaccination.</p><p>In particular, preemptive IFN-&#x003b1; should:</p><p>&#x02013; (1.) lead to the production of more highly immunogenic monocyte-derived DC;</p><p>&#x02013; (2.) mobilize peripheral DC precursors, thus enhancing leukapheresis yields;</p><p>&#x02013; (3.) positively modulate the immunogenicity of melanoma cells <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunomodulating effects of radiotherapy</title><p>Ionizing radiation therapy (RT) is known for its capacity to kill cancer cells and other cells within the tumor stroma, including endothelial cells and intratumoral lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Although tumor cells killed by RT may represent a suitable source of antigens for DC uptake and presentation to T cells, it is widely accepted that optimal activation of T cells by DC can be achieved only in the presence of inflammatory or &#x0201c;danger&#x0201d; signals. On this basis, the hypothesis that exposure to ionising radiation (IR) generates a proinflammatory &#x0201c;danger&#x0201d; microenvironment supports claims made of a strong synergy between radiotherapy and immunotherapy. In particular, IR induces the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; in both animal cancer models and cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Moreover, IR upregulates the expression of Fas/CD95 receptor and NKG2D-L in cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], encouraging the recognition and killing of the &#x0201c;altered self&#x0201d; and MHC-I and co-stimulatory molecules, which leads to a more accurate recognition by immune effectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Finally, RT can facilitate the homing of both antigen-presenting and effector T cells to the tumor bed by eliciting inflammatory signals and changes in extracellular matrix proteins and by inducing the expression of adhesion molecules by endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Demaria S. <italic>et al</italic>. showed that irradiation of a tumor xenograft in a murine model protected against rechallenge from the same tumor cells outside the irradiation field. This anti-tumor effect was probably the result of a specific immune response as it is not observed in immunodeficient nude mice. It would seem to be tumor-type specific <italic>i.e</italic>. (growth of a second graft of a different cell line is not affected by irradiation of the first graft) and is synergistic with administration of the Flt-3 (FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3) ligand. Flt-3 alone (no RT) has no effect on the second graft, probably because of a nonspecific immunity boost provided by the Flt-3 ligand. Overall, these data suggest that RT delivered to a tumor site may also prime the immune system against related tumor cells at some distance from the irradiation field (&#x0201c;abscopal effect&#x0201d;) and that, in the absence of additional immune system stimulation, the radiation-induced immune response has no clinical effect. Accordingly, the combined use of DC vaccination and RT with &#x0201c;immunological&#x0201d; intent should theoretically strengthen the effect of the vaccine by acting as an <italic>in situ</italic> boost in which tumor antigens are released and captured by intratumoral DC in a microenvironment positively conditioned by ionising radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Description of the investigational product</title><p>Since 2001, IRST Somatic Cell Therapy Laboratory has produced an advanced medicinal product in the form of a therapeutic vaccine composed of autologous DC pulsed with autologous tumor lysate or homogenate for patients with metastatic melanoma or kidney cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].

After leukapheresis, a part of the monocytes obtained are cultured and the remainder is cryopreserved in aliquots to be used for the manufacture of subsequent vaccine doses. Monocytes are cultured for six days in serum-free, GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) certified medium supplemented with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) to obtain immature dendritic cells (iDC). These immature DC are pulsed with autologous lysate or homogenate prepared from surgically removed metastatic lesions. After pulsing, DC are then matured for 48&#x000a0;hours in the presence of a cytokine cocktail (TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL6, and PGE2). Mature DC (mDC) are then collected, washed, counted and re-suspended in sterile saline (total 7&#x02013;15 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells) for immediate intradermal administration to patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Cryopreserved vaccine</title><p>The vaccine is produced from the whole leukapheresis product according to the previously described protocol.

Before administration, the mDC are thawed, washed, re-suspended in saline and immediately injected intradermally into patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Delayed-type hypersensitivity test (DTH)</title><p>DTH testing is a classic method for measuring cellular immune reactivity. This technique involves the intradermal administration of an antigen preparation and the monitoring of the degree of erythema and induration produced 24&#x02013;48 hours after injection. The response reflects antigen-specific recruitment and the activation of CD4+ to release T-helper 1 cytokines (in particular, IFN-&#x003b1;) and CD8+ effector T cells into the injection site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In our experience, as in that of other groups, a positive response to the DTH test performed with soluble antigen (in our studies with ATL) after vaccination with DC in metastatic melanoma patients was strongly correlated with a better clinical outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. DTH testing using another antigen, KLH, has been studied and its positivity has also been found to be associated with improved clinical outcome in vaccinated patients. We use KLH as an immunological adjuvant in the preparation of our DC vaccine and have seen that positive DHT testing to this protein is a reliable indicator of immunologic competence in vaccinated patients. DTH testing does not require extensive training or the use of costly equipment and can easily be performed at the patient&#x02019;s bedside. All these features make it a feasible, low-cost immunomonitoring method that permits the evaluation of immunologic efficacy in a clinical trial setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial design and statistical considerations</title><p>This is a phase II, randomized, open-label trial aimed at assessing whether different external immunostimulant conditions, <italic>i.e</italic>. preleukapheresis IFN-&#x003b1; and external RT to one target lesion, enhance, alone or in combination, the immunological efficacy of autologous DC loaded with tumor lysate or homogenate in metastatic melanoma patients.

This approach, based upon the assumption that immunotherapy is only expected to be effective in patients showing efficient induction of anti-tumor immune responses (&#x0201c;targeted endpoint&#x0201d;), allows us to reduce the number of patients required to evaluate the potential efficacy of an experimental treatment.</p><p>Randomization guarantees the avoidance of selection bias, excluding the preferential inclusion of patients in certain treatment arms. This approach, whilst not identifying which factors contribute to immunogenicity or which regimens are significantly better than others, will, however, highlight a treatment or treatment combination that warrants further investigation. The sample size per treatment must be large enough to ensure, with strong probability, that if one treatment or treatment combination is superior to all others by a specific amount, then it will have the largest sample mean and will therefore be selected. In particular, if one of the external immunostimulant conditions investigated shows higher clinical activity than that observed in the other conditions by a predetermined amount, that condition will be superior to the others with a given probability and will merit further clinical investigation. By enrolling six patients in each treatment arm, we will obtain a 90% probability of correctly selecting the best investigated external immunostimulant condition if the superior arm, if present, has a true expected outcome that is at least 15% higher in terms of irDCR (immune-related disease control rate) than that of the inferior arms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Otherwise, the immunological primary endpoint (immunological efficacy) will guide the choice of treatment combination to further develop using the same method. If a treatment or a combination of treatments is not identified as superior, the vaccine regimen (without external immunostimulant conditions) will be considered for further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary objectives</title><sec><title>Clinical objective</title><p>To select the regimen that has the best irDCR defined as the proportion of subjects with an immune-related best overall response (irBOR) of confirmed immune-related complete response (irCR), immune-related partial response (irPR) or immune-related stable disease (irSD).

All time-dependent clinical endpoints (irTTP, OS) will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log rank test will be performed on differences in these endpoints across the treatment arms. Frequency tables will be created for all categorical variables. Continuous variables will be presented using mean and standard deviation or median and range. Given the explorative intent of the study and the limited sample size, we are aware that we may be exposed to a high level of false positive results. Unless otherwise indicated, the analysis of demography and baseline characteristics will be performed on all randomized patients.

Tumor tissue will be stored in the Therapeutic Cell Bank of the STC Lab until use for vaccine manufacturing. Only patients from whom autologous tumor tissue has been collected by the STC Lab under GMP will be eligible for the study. After informed consent has been obtained, patients will enter the screening phase (tumor staging and clinical and laboratory assessments) to determine their eligibility for the trial. In particular, patients must have at least one measurable and one non-measurable lesion.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Induction and maintenance phase schedule.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1479-5876-12-209-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Leukapheresis and vaccine manufacturing</title><p>At the end of the screening phase, patients will be randomized and will enter the leukapheresis and vaccine manufacturing phase.

Before the first dose of the vaccine (day 1), patients will undergo blood sampling for immunological markers (quantification of circulating tumor-specific immune effectors) and the baseline DTH test. Three MU IL-2 will be administered subcutaneously daily for five days starting from the second day after each vaccine dose. Vaccine doses will be given intradermally in two sites close to inguinal or axillary lymph node stations that have not been the site of previous surgical exeresis. The first dose (wk1) will consist of the freshly prepared vaccine, whereas cryopreserved aliquots will be used for all other doses. The second dose will be administered after three weeks (wk4) to allow for the completion of quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) assessments on the cryopreserved vaccine batches that will be used across all further phases. The remaining two doses of the induction phase will be administered after a 2-week interval (wk6 and wk8). At wk2, patients randomized to receive RT will undergo the planned treatment: one non-measurable (or non-index measurable, if available) lesion will be irradiated using IMRT-IMAT techniques to facilitate tumor antigen release and and antigen uptake by intratumoral DC under &#x0201c;danger&#x0201d; conditions created by ionising radiation, thus potentially boosting immunization induced by the DC vaccine. The remaining measurable lesion (s) will be used as an index lesion (s) to evaluate objective response according to irCR.. The induction phase will end with tumor restaging, blood sampling for immunological biomarkers and DTH test (the day before wk12 vaccine dose).</p></sec><sec><title>Maintenance</title><p>Patients showing irCR, irPR or irSD or non-confirmed irPD will enter the maintenance phase during which they will receive further vaccine doses at four-week intervals until irPD is confirmed, for up to a maximum of 14 vaccinations (wk48). Tumor assessments, blood sampling for immunological biomarkers and DTH tests will be performed every 12&#x000a0;weeks (wk24, 36 and 48).</p><p>In the event of vaccine shortage, patients will undergo additional leukapheresis at least two weeks after the last RT (according to treatment arm) and at least one week before the next vaccine dose: patients assigned to the IFN-&#x003b1; arms will repeat this treatment for seven days before leukapheresis with the same schedule and dosage. Patients undergoing additional leukapheresis must have negative tests for HBV, HCV, HIV and treponema not dating back more than 30&#x000a0;days. This procedure will be performed to facilitate the completion of the QA/QC assessment on the new cryopreserved vaccine batch. At week 22 (between vaccine doses V7 and V8), patients randomized to RT can optionally repeat this treatment on a non-index, not previously irradiated lesion, if available. On the basis of irCR, patients showing irPD will continue treatment until confirmation of progression. Patients with confirmed irPD showing positive DTH may, at the physician&#x02019;s discretion, continue treatment until the next tumor assessment. If, at the next re-staging, further progression is observed, these patients will be discontinued.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Study population</title><p>Patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma with at least two measurable lesions who may or may not have undergone previous lines of specific therapy (i.e. chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, etc.).</p><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>(1.)

This GMP-validated method relies on the capacity of co-stimulatory signals provided by DC, <italic>per se</italic> unable to fully activate responder T cells, to trigger a proliferative response or cytokine secretion in allogeneic T cells stimulated with substimulating doses (0.005&#x000a0;mg/ml) of the anti-CD3 antibody OKT3.

The Steinberg and Venzon approach permits the researcher to select one among a number of different treatment arms as being worthy of further evaluation in a subsequent study. This method requires an adequate gap in the number of immune responses among different arms be observed in order to limit the probability that the selected arm is, in actual fact, inferior to the others. Assuming an error probability of selecting an inferior arm of 10%, a gap of 2 patients with an immune response out of a total of 6 enrolled patients per arm is sufficient, regardless of the proportion of irOR expected in each arm, to show that the difference between the highest probability of response and the best response of the remaining arms is 15%. If the gap is inferior to 2 patients, no treatment arm can be considered better than another and new immunostimulating therapies will have to be identified to combine with the DC vaccine.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The recent development of targeted agents and new drugs has partially changed the clinical course of advanced melanoma patients. Toxicities from BRAF inhibitors or anti-CTLA-4 antibodies for melanoma, albeit low grade, are continuous and chronically impact on quality of life. Furthermore, some toxicities with an initially mild presentation can progress, if not rapidly recognized, into severe and potentially life-threatening events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Conversely, the use of vaccines in melanoma patients has been historically associated with negligible toxicity, although clinical results are disappointing and somewhat contrasting. However, encouraging results have been reported in several studies of vaccination with dendritic cells, albeit obtained on small series of patients.</p><p>In this context we recently reported the results from a phase II clinical study of DC-based vaccine in metastatic melanoma in which 55.5% of evaluable patients showed a clinical benefit (PR&#x02009;+&#x02009;SD), with very low toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Like us [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], other groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] also observed that, patients who developed anti-tumor immunity after vaccination experienced a better clinical outcome. In particular, we saw that individuals developing delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) against autologous tumor lysate or KLH after at least four courses of the vaccine showed a median OS of 22.9&#x000a0;months compared to 4.8&#x000a0;months for DTH-negative cases (Log-rank test, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.007) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>These results prompted us to use combination treatments aimed at improving the rate of patients showing positive immunization after vaccination. In particular, we observed that all those who underwent therapy with low-dose IFN-&#x003b1; in the month before starting DC vaccination (unpublished data) showed positive immunisation after the first induction doses, suggesting that IFN-&#x003b1; priming, performed <italic>in vivo</italic> before leukapheresis, may enhance the immunostimulatory profile of DC. Moreover, IFN-&#x003b1; priming may also have a &#x0201c;mobilizing&#x0201d; activity on DC precursors: it was recently been reported that 1&#x02013;3 MU subcutaneous IFN-&#x003b1; enhances the proportion of circulating CD14+ and CD14&#x02009;+&#x02009;CD16+ monocytes in both healthy donors and melanoma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. On this basis, the administration of IFN-&#x003b1; before leukapheresis may positively modulate the immunological and clinical efficacy of DC vaccination. In addition to the potential for preleukapheresis IFN-&#x003b1; to improve the immunological efficacy of monocyte-derived DC vaccine, a synergism between immunotherapy and radiotherapy (the abscopal effect) has hypothesized in which radiotherapy &#x0201c;immunizes&#x0201d; the patient against cancer cells, converting the irradiated tissue into an <italic>in situ vaccine</italic>. Although, in some cases, radiotherapy alone can induce immunological memory protection, in others it loses its initial efficacy when recurrence occurs. Overall, findings from the literature suggest that radiotherapy may also act as an &#x0201c;immune response modifier&#x0201d; which can correct the immunosuppressive network created by tumor cells. In that respect, radiotherapy would seem to be capable of recovering the cancer-specific immune response after failure of immunotherapy, of boosting the naturally occurring anti-tumor immune response, and cooperating with cancer vaccines to facilitate the priming of a non-immunodominant response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p><p>We designed a randomized, proof-of-principal study in which preleukapheresis radiotherapy and/or IFN-&#x003b1; are added to the DC vaccine with the aim of enhancing the vaccine-induced tumor immune response and, in doing so, of potentially improving survival. Moreover, these combination therapies should, in theory, maintain the same low toxicity profile observed in our previous studies. Dose and fraction of radiotherapy and the correct sequencing of therapies will also be evaluated. The identification of an effective treatment regimen could be used in a phase III trial or be applied to clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AE: Adverse event; ALT: Alanine aminotransferase; ANC: Absolute neutrophil count; ASAT: Aspartate aminotransferase; AR: Adverse reaction; ATL: Autologous tumor lysate; CBC: Complete blood count; CI: Confidence interval; CNS: Central nervous system; CTLA-4: Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4; CTscan: Computed tomography; CTC: Common toxicity criteria; DC: Dendritic cells; DCR: Disease control rate; DFS: Disease free survival; DM: Ministerial Decree; DTH: Delayed type hypersensitivity; ECOG: (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, ECOG Scale) Performance status; GCP: Good Clinical Practice; GM-CSF: Granulocyte/Monocyte colony stimulating factor; GMP: Good Manifacturing Practice; iDC: immature dendritic cells; IFN-&#x003b1;: Interferon &#x003b1;; Il-1&#x003b2;: Interleukin-1&#x003b2;; IL2: Interleukin 2; IL4: Interleukin 4; IL6: Interleukin 6; IL8: Interleukin 8; IR: Ionizing radiations; irBOR: immune-related best overall response; irCR: immune-related complete response; irDCR: immune-related disease control rate; irDOR: immune-related duration of response; irORR: immune-related overall response rate; irPD: immune-related progressive disease; irPFS: immune-related progression-free survival; irPR: immune-related partial response; irRC: immuno-related response criteria; irSD: immune-related stable disease; irTTP: immune-related time to progression; irTTR: immune-related time to response; KLH: Keyhole lympet hemocyanin; MHC: Major histocompatibility complex; NK: Natural killer; OS: Overall survival; PGE2: prostaglandin E2; PD: Progressive disease; RECIST: Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors; RT: Ionizing radiation therapy; SD: Stable disease; SFC: Spot forming cells; SPD: Sum of the perpendicular diameters; TEM-8: Tumor endothelial marker-8; TNF-&#x003b1;: Tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1;; TPFS: Total progression-free survival; irTTP: Immune-related time to progression; WBC: White blood cells; WHO: World Health Organization.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interest.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>RR, LV, ON and MG designed and wrote the study protocol.&#x02009;LR and FdR are responsible for the clinical activity.
