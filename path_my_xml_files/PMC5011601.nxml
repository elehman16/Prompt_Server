exercise using various foot wedges. [Subjects and Methods] Nine females participated in
this study. Surface electrodes measurements were taken over the hamstring and quadriceps
under 3 squat exercise conditions, and the hamstring/quadriceps ratio was calculated.
[Results] The hamstring/quadriceps ratio was significantly increased during squat exercise
in inclined wedge condition (7.4 &#x000b1; 1.8), compared to the declined wedge condition (5.3 &#x000b1;
2.2) and no wedge condition (6.4 &#x000b1; 3.2). [Conclusion] This study suggests that squat
exercise in the inclined wedge condition may be effective for increasing the
hamstring/quadriceps ratio in females.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Females</kwd><kwd>H/Q ratio</kwd><kwd>Wedge</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Female athletes are reported to be much more likely to sustain an anterior cruciate
ligament (ACL) injury than male athletes<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Hamstring muscle strength, however, is relatively preserved because the hamstring can be
facilitated or activated in response to an ACL tear<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. A high incidence of ACL injury has been reported in pivoting sports
such as soccer, basketball, and handball, and the incidence is 3 to 5 times higher among
women than men<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. A decreased
hamstring/quadriceps (H/Q) ratio may increase the stress on the anterior cruciate ligament
(ACL), with increased risk of knee injury<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, this study compared the H/Q
ratio in females during squat exercise using various foot wedges.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was performed in 9 asymptomatic females aged 27.2 &#x000b1; 2.2&#x02005;years (mean &#x000b1; SD); their
average height and weight were 174 &#x000b1; 3.1&#x02005;cm and 67.9 &#x000b1; 4.3&#x02005;kg, respectively. The study
purpose and methods were explained to the subjects, who provided informed consent according
to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki before participating. Electromyography
(EMG) signals were sent to the data acquisition unit of an MP150 system (BIOPAC Systems,
Santa Barbara, CA, USA). The EMG data were analyzed using a program created with the
AcqKnowledge software (version 3.9.1) and expressed as the maximum voluntary contraction
(MVC). Surface electrodes were attached over the hamstring (medial part) and quadriceps
(rectus femoris) and then the H/Qratio was calculated. The squat exercise involved
descending to 90&#x000b0; of knee flexion, and ascending to the initial position at the individual&#x02019;s
natural speed. The 90&#x000b0; of knee flexion angle was controlled by a guide bar in the habitual
usual-speed squat exercise. The trunk posture was defined as anterior rotation of the pelvis
for neutral lumbar lordosis, and relaxation of the thorax with an upright head posture. The
experimental protocol specified 3 squat exercise conditions: condition 1 applied no foot
wedge board; condition 2 applied an inclined wedge board to the foot; condition 3 applied a
declined wedge board to the foot. The angle of the wedge was 20&#x000b0; (L&#x000d7;W&#x000d7;H: 30 &#x000d7; 30&#x000d7;15&#x02005;cm). To
test for differences in H/Q ratio among the various foot wedge board conditions,
repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to determine if there was a significant
effect of the muscles and ratio. For the significant main effect, Bonferroni&#x02019;s correction
was performed to identify the specific mean differences. Differences were defined as
significant at p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The H/Q ratio was significantly increased during squat exercise in inclined wedge condition
(7.4 &#x000b1; 1.8) compared to the declined wedge condition (5.3 &#x000b1; 2.2) and no wedge condition (6.4
&#x000b1; 3.2).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The squat exercise in inclined wedge condition resulted in a much greater increase in the
H/Q ratio. This may be because gastrocnemius muscle tension decreased due to the declined
board. Thus, the gastrocnemius muscle acted more on knee extension, thereby relatively
reducing the activity of the quadriceps muscles<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Declined wedge squat exercise was more effective in activating the
quadriceps than the same exercise on the ground because it minimized the effect of the
gastrocnemius muscle. On the other hand, gastrocnemius muscle tension increased due to the
inclined board. Thus, the gastrocnemius muscle acted more on knee extension, thereby
relatively reducing the activity of the quadriceps muscles. Finally, these changes increased
the H/Q ratio. Studies suggested that a decreased H/Q ratio was thought to contribute to the
higher incidence of ACL injuries in women<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, and that the development of preventive
strategies in women was needed<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Further
research on risk factors and preventive strategies for the female ACL is needed, because the
cause of the disparity in injury rates remains equivocal and controversial. Individualized
treatment for the injured knee is necessary<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kim et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>
presented the kinematic differences in landing motions between male and female college
students and reported that the valgus angles of women were more increased than those of men
during vertical landing motion. They suggested future studies to measure activities of the
muscles that are used for landing motions and the evaluation of the imbalance of these
muscles<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The balance between quadriceps
and hamstring muscle strength is usually assessed as the H/Q ratio. Therefore, this study
suggests that squat exercise in inclined wedge condition may be effective for increasing the
H/Q ratio in females.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Giugliano</surname><given-names>DN</given-names></name><name><surname>Solomon</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>ACL tears in female athletes</article-title>. <source>Phys
