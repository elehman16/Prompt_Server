Studies and statistics show that the age of using drugs in these countries has reduced and that drug abuse is rapidly on the rise.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Besides, most addicts are not aware that they are infected with HIV.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>According to estimates 3.4% of the world population or 4.7% of the world population aged 15 and older are drug addicts. In Iran, between 1.7% and 2.8% of the population aged 15 and older and 7.5% and 8% of the country's adult population are addicted to opium.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] According to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO), the numbers of countries that report HIV infection in drug addicts are on the rising and this problem is particularly severe in developing countries.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>According to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education to 92/7/1 in sum 27,041 persons with AIDS/HIV has been detected in the country. About 89.3% of men and 10.7% of women have been infected. 45.9% of patients at 25&#x02013;34 have been that highest proportion among the age groups into account. The total of infection cases so far have been records in the country, sequencing intravenous drug abuse (68.15%), sexual intercourse (12.66%), blood and blood products (0.9%), mother to child (1.22%), (17.05%) is unknown.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>The majority of HIV infection cases in Iran are IDUs. Injection drug use-related HIV transmission accounts for 5&#x02013;10% of HIV cases in the world, 36% in the US and more than 60% of infection cases in Iran.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Studies have showed that IDU's are able to change their behaviors in a manner to protect themselves and others from HIV infection, and this point is very important for researchers that study in this field.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] According to the WHO the only effective way to combat AIDS is health education and vulnerable groups should be prioritized.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] HIV infection are highest among drug users and the problem of addiction combined with issues such as poverty, illiteracy, unemployment, and homelessness contributes to the risk of HIV infection.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The emerging HIV epidemic in Iran is serious and doubtlessly the rise of this epidemic will have a vast negative impact on the economic, social, and political situation in the country. Thus, efforts to contain this epidemic in Iran are a national obligation and urgent intervention strategies in the risk groups specifically injecting drug users is key to solving this problem.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Unawareness of or disregard for correct health behaviors is inevitable in any society. Individuals and societies require learning correct health behaviors through education in order to recognize and adopt a good lifestyle, maintain their health and prevent diseases.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The only way to combat this disease in the absence of treatment and effective vaccines is health education and behavior change.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Informing the society can be very effective in reducing HIV infections.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Designing and implementing an effective HIV prevention and control program based on reducing high-risk behavior has turned into a major challenge for health workers and researchers all over the world.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The value of educational health programs are assessed based on their effectiveness and their effectiveness is highly dependent on the correct utilization of theories and models in teaching health education. In other words, the existence of an appropriate support theory in accordance with the major health needs increases the effectiveness of educational health programs.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>The effectiveness of the health belief model (HBM), which has been used as a theoretical framework in this study has been proved to be very useful in predicting AIDS preventive behaviors by different researchers. The HBM constructs have also proved to be effective in HIV/AIDS education programs as it helps understand behaviors that prevent AIDS and drug abuse.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The health belief model is one of the oldest health behavior theories and different researchers have applied it in different behavioral fields in order to design and evaluate behavioral interventions. Plus the effectiveness of this model has been proved in the area of AIDS education in different internal and foreign researches.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Based on this model, a person's decision to adopt a certain health behavior is influenced by three main categories of variables; individual perceptions, modifying factors and the likelihood of action. Individual perceptions refer to the subjective ideas regarding one's well-being, factors that affect the understanding of the disease or illness and the consequences of adopting a certain health behavior. Modifying factors are those variables, which affect an individual's appraisal of risk for disease or illness and include demographic variables, perceived threat of disease and ques to action: Which are influences external to the individual that provide a stimulus for activity.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Likelihood of action discusses the collective weighing of risks, benefits and costs in order to determine whether to take action or not. In fact, the health belief model allows us to study the probable psychological factors that influence individuals&#x02019; decision-making process.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>According to this model in order to implement HIV prevention methods, people should understand their chances of being infected by AIDS (perceived susceptibility), understand the seriousness of its symptoms in all physical, social, psychological, and economical aspects (perceived severity) and with the how-to information they receive from others or in the form of incentives (cues to action) they believe in the efficacy of the advised action, its benefits and applicability (perceived benefits) and find the deterring factors in taking the action less costly (perceived barriers), so that ultimately they take the measures.</p><p>The researcher considers the HBM constructs of self-efficacy, perceived benefits and perceived barriers as important factors that influence health behaviors, specifically HIV/AIDS prevention behaviors. The constructs of self-efficacy, perceived benefits and perceived barriers are common in most health behavior theories and are three of the major components of the health belief model. Self-efficacy refers to the depth of one's trust in his/her ability.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The association between self-efficacy and AIDS prevention behaviors has been proved in different researches and can be effective in reducing high-risk behavior, which leads to HIV infection.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] The shallow analysis of benefits minus barriers can happen in a situation where individual assess the benefits of taking of an action more costly, dangerous, unlikeable, saddening, and time-consuming compared with the barriers to it. Based on such an analysis, an individual adopts a certain behavior or refrains from doing so.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In order to change and improve health behaviors, professional health workers apply the constructs of self-efficacy, perceived benefits and perceived barriers as a theoretical basis in many of their health education programs. In fact, understanding factors that influence health behaviors can develop better health promoting strategies and success indicators can be chosen in a more logical manner.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] A study by Mahmoud Karimi[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and researches[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] prove the predictive nature of the health belief model. This research was carried out due to the fact that there have been very few educational intervention programs as to lower high-risk behaviors in drug addicts based on this very model. The current research studies the influence of education on knowledge, perceived self-efficacy, perceived benefits and barriers as well as the performance of Khorramabad drug addicts when it comes to AIDS prevention behaviors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A quasi-experimental and pre- to post-test research design was used to assess the impact of the HIV/AIDS educational intervention program. The selected population included 88 male addicts that were being kept in a rehabilitation center. The samples were selected from four different centers; 44 out of 2 of the centers were regarded as the intervention group and 44 of the 2 other centers as the control group. Due to limitations in the sample size, the samples were selected through the census method. And all of the addicts were being kept in the rehabilitation centers were entered to research.</p><p>In the rehabilitation centers, HIV prevention and education programs are not offered. Patients are monitored 24 h, 7 days a week by trained staff. Apart from addicts that are under treatment by caregivers, no specific drugs are given to other patients. The researcher presented an official introduction letter from Isfahan University of Medical Sciences to the drug rehabilitation center in Khorramabad. In the beginning of the study, sufficient information regarding the aim of the study was given to the participants, and they were reassured that their data will remain confidential.</p><p>Data gathering was undertaken by a questionnaire designed in four sections including:[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Personal information (age, marital status, occupation, and&#x02026;);[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] the second segment consisted of 10 questions to evaluate the knowledge level about HIV/AIDS pointed on a scale from 0 and 1 meaning that for a correct answer, 1 point and for a wrong answer or &#x0201c;I don&#x02019;t know no&#x0201d; no point was given.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The third segment consisted of 10 questions related to the perceived self-efficacy regarding AIDS preventive measures using a 4-point Likert scale, which ranged from &#x0201c;strongly agree&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;strongly disagree.&#x0201d; Four-eight questions regarding the perceived benefits related to AIDS preventive measures with their answers scored on a 4 Likert scale that ranged from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Five-seven questions related to the perceived barriers related to AIDS preventive, which were also measured on a 4 Likert scale. Six-six yes/no questions related to the Practice, which were scored 0 and 1 therefore the maximum points acquired was 6 and the minimum.</p><p>A knowledge and practice questionnaire was developed by the researcher. In order to evaluate the scientific validity of the questionnaire it was handed out to a couple of professional and experienced health education professors working at Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. As to examine the scientific reliability of the questionnaire the internal consistency test was used and the Cronbach's alpha was calculated (Cronbach's alpha = 76.3%).</p><p>The self-efficacy, perceived benefits and barriers questionnaire used in this research was devised by Mahmoud Karimi under the title &#x0201c;Perceived benefits and perceived barriers to preventive behaviors of AIDS in addicts in Zarandieh&#x0201d;.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Its validity and reliability of the questionnaire through content validity and test&#x02013;retest methods was evaluated. Thus, the questionnaire was designed with the resources and scientific articles and polls research experts and use their feedback has been confirmed. Its reliability test&#x02013;retest correlation coefficient Cronbach's alpha was calculated as 76% of health belief model.</p><p>The information from the research departments were gathered through interviews (from the illiterate or less literate) and written responses from the samples themselves and analyzed through the SPSS 20 (IBM Corp. in Armonk, NY) descriptive analyses (means, standard deviations, and ranges) and analytical statistical methods (paired <italic>t</italic>-tests, independent <italic>t</italic>-test, Chi-square, and analysis of covariance).</p><p>After extracting the necessary information from the pretest questionnaires, the results were analyzed and an educational model was designed. Pirzadeh conducted a study on students (27) in which educational interventions were implemented in 2 &#x000d7; 45 min sessions. These sessions were based on acquainting drug addicts with AIDS, its transmission and prevention along with improving the perceived self-efficacy, benefits of and barriers to this disease. The educational sessions was carried out among groups of 10&#x02013;12 inside the center by means of speeches, face to face Q and As, group discussions and displaying educational films. Every group had 3 &#x000d7; 1.5 h sessions. To sustain the educational program, pamphlets, booklets, and educational films were distributed among the treatment group. The control group received no kind of education. Given that the addicts were retained in the center for an average 1 month period, to carry out the research phone contacts had to be made with the samples to complete the data gathering process. Therefore, 2 months after the educational intervention, the samples were invited to come over to complete posttest questionnaires through phone or personal visits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The mean age of the study participants was 33.31 years.

According to the social cognitive theory, a person who has low self-efficacy is more probable to engage in a dangerous-risky behavior compared to a person with high self-efficacy.[<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] In Adih's study in Ghana, people with high self-efficacy had used condoms 3 times more than those with low self-efficacy.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] Kasen's study showed that students who had a low self-efficacy had engaged in sexual activity twice more than students with high self-efficacy and they had used condoms 5 time less.[<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] Lin's study in Taiwan also showed that self-efficacy is the most reliable predictor in safe or unsafe sexual behavior.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>The results of this study showed that there is a significant relationship between the perceived benefits of applying preventive AIDS behavior and perceived self-efficacy meaning that with the growth of the perceived benefits of a person regarding AIDS preventive behaviors, the self-efficacy of the person toward practicing this behavior increases. Besides, with the growth of perceived self-efficacy, practicing preventive behaviors also increases. According to the results of this study, there is a significant relationship between the perceived self-efficacy toward taking preventive measures and the actual adopting of those behaviors.</p><p>Future studies should contain strategies to increase perceived self-efficacy and benefits as well as strategies to decrease perceived barrier to adopt preventive behaviors.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>The results of this study show that there is a significant relationship between the demographic variable of age and the variable of performance in a way that the higher the age, the performance of the samples improved. Plus the demographic variable of age had no relationship with knowledge or any other studied construct and from this aspect it complies with the results attained by Momenion the students in Yasouj city[<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and Mahmoud Karimi on Zarandiyeh addicts.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In addition, the results showed that there was no significant relationship between the samples&#x02019; education and awareness, performance and any of the other studied constructs in this study, which does not comply with studies by Karimi on the students of Yazd[<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and Niknami on self-proclaimed addicts in Kermanshah[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] in the aspect that there is a significant relationship between the education level and performance. However, it did comply with Mahmoud Karimi's study[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] in the sense that there was no significant relationship between the level of education and performance.</p><p>Among the limitations of this study: There was a lack of cooperation among officials at the addicts rehabilitation centers due to their dislike of the educational subject (AIDS), the physical and psychological sickness of the addicts did not made it unlikely for them to take part in the educational sessions or complete the questionnaires, the time-consumingness of filling out the questionnaires for illiterate and less literate addicts, summoning up addicts to complete posttest questionnaires and their lack of cooperation.</p><p>The results of this study show that the health education program designed based on the health belief model had a significant effect on improving the level of awareness of addicts as well as their perceived benefits, barriers and self-efficacy toward adopting preventive AIDS behavior in Khorramabad, which is in compliance with the results of[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3"
