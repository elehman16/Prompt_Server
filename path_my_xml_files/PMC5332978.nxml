abilities because of instability in their postural control and body balance, as well as
reduced motor functions<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. They have an
imbalance in body weight support, with 60&#x02013;90% of their body weight leaning too much toward
the normal side because of asymmetrical body weight support at standing position<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. As
a result, this imbalance affects their gait cycle; that of a normal person consists of 60%
of the stance phase and 40% of the swing phase<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hemiplegic patients have a shorter cycle of the stance phase and a
longer cycle of the swing phase in the affected side than in the normal side<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In terms of clinical therapy for walking, treadmill walking training<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, side walking training<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, and unstable surface training<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> have been introduced to improve weight movement capability.
Traditionally, a variety of methods, such as using walkers or canes and ankle-foot orthosis,
have been utilized to recover gait abilities<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. These methods provide not only support of
physical disability during the performance of an action but also methods for independent
daily living<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Most of the previous studies on improvements in gait abilities conducted with hemiplegia
patients have focused on the determination or comparison of the effects of gait training on
flat ground, slope ground and stairs.</p><p>In this regard, the present study aims to determine the effect of stair task training on
gait abilities by conducting stair task training. In this training, step training is applied
in various directions with hemiplegia patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted with patients who were diagnosed with stroke and admitted in C
Hospital located in C City for their treatment. Forty patients with stroke were selected on
the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria, and they were randomly divided into 18
patients in the experimental group and 18 patients in the control group via draw. All
subjects provided written informed consent prior to participation according to the ethical
standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The selection criteria were as follows: patients diagnosed with stroke and with a disease
duration of more than six months, those who can walk 15&#x02005;m or longer independently without
assisted devices, with a below grade 2 Modified Ashworth Scale score in the lower extremity,
with an MMSE-K (Mini-mental state examination Korean version) score more than 24, have no
other diseases and orthopedic diseases in the lower extremity, and those who understood the
purpose of this study and gave consent to participation in this research.</p><p>On the basis of the above-mentioned inclusion criteria, 36 patients were selected and
divided into 18 members of the experimental group and 18 members of the control group for
the conduct of the pre and post test, with the same measuring tools used by the same rater.
Eighteen patients in the experimental group and eighteen patients in the control group
conducted the training of 30&#x02005;min per session, five times a week for six weeks. The
measurement method used the Dartfish program, in which time at the stance and swing phases
during gait were measured before and after the intervention.</p><p>The experimental group used 10&#x02005;cm-high steps in the stair task training. This value was set
on the basis of a previous study<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> stating
that 10&#x02005;cm-high steps were more stable and easier to perform for stroke patients and
resulted in changes in muscle activity and increases in clinical balance abilities. With the
use of 10&#x02005;cm-high wooden blocks, a 40&#x02005;cm &#x000d7;40&#x02005;cm wood block layout consisting of two
10&#x02005;cm-high foot-step wooden blocks and one 20&#x02005;cm-high block was fabricated to have a 10&#x02005;cm
block height difference between adjacent blocks. For safety, sliding prevention tapes were
applied at the bottom of the wooden block, and the front of the arranged block had
handrails, and 1 m-high desks were placed on the sides to prevent a fall; the handrails and
desks can be supported, if needed, during the training. A single physiotherapist guided and
supervised the training to prevent safety-related accidents.</p><p>For the control group, weight support and balance training for the affected leg was
conducted, and a 10&#x02005;min warm-up was applied at the sitting and standing positions. The
weight support and balance training method for the affected legs was conducted in the
following order: weight support on the affected side, climbing the stairs by placing the
normal side in the front direction, and coming down the steps by placing the normal side
from the block to the original position<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For kinematic motion analysis of the walking of hemiplegia patients, videos were recorded
for all groups before the intervention and six weeks after the intervention, and the data
were analyzed with Dartfish (Pro Suite, Dfkorea, Korea). It uses videos to analyze and
interpret the motions and trace trajectories of the target subjects. All subjects did not
wear shoes during measurements and were induced to walk freely and most comfortably on a
walking path, about 15&#x02005;m in length, to enable the accurate measurement of a step length. The
video was shot from the 5&#x02005;m point on the path, which was the middle point of the path. The
analysis of gait with the use of the Dartfish program utilized only videos that showed a
complete step cycle from initial contact of the heel to the next initial contact of the
heel. A mean value was calculated from the performance of two sets of walking iteratively to
increase the validity of the measurement.</p><p>In the statistical analysis of this study, means and standard deviations were calculated
using SPSS/Windows (version 20.0). In order to examine the effects prior to and after the
intervention of each group, a paired t-test was conducted, and in order to look at
differences between the groups, independent t-test was performed. The significance level was
set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Comparative analysis of the experimental group&#x02019;s prior -test and post-test results showed

patients and result in improvements in performing independent activities<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. A study on stair gait conducted with 30
adult hemiplegia patients to determine changes in balance and muscle activity after gait
training with different stair heights reported that the 10&#x02005;cm-high stair gait training group
showed the most significant difference in balance abilities, as well as larger changes in
muscle activities than stair gait groups with other heights<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The results of this study indicate that stair task training improved walking ability and
suggest the applicability of stair task training for clinical rehabilitaion. It was
conducted on hemiplegia patients for six weeks and provided an approach to improve the
mobility functions of stroke patients.</p><p>The findings showed that the stair task training group had effective results in the swing
phase time affected lower extremity, compared with the group that applied weight support on
the affected lower extremity and balance training.</p><p>In this study, the Dartfish program was used to measure gait capabilities. The changes in
stance phase time before and after the training showed that the experimental group had a
significant increase in stance phase time within the group, but no significant increase was
found between groups (p&#x0003e;0.005). The control group showed no significant increase before
and after the training. The comparison result on change in swing phase time before and after
training showed that the experimental group had a significant increase in swing phase time.
The comparison result between groups showed that the swing phase time of the experimental
group was &#x02212;0.08 &#x000b1; 0.10, and that of the control group was &#x02212;0.00 &#x000b1; 0.02, which indicated a
significant increase between groups (p&#x0003c;0.005). The control group showed no significant
increase before and after the training. These results were due to the study subjects&#x02019;
adaptation to the performance of overpassing obstacles, such as steps<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, the central nervous system attempted to
maintain body weight balance and apply the moving pattern strategically.</p><p>The limitations of this study were as follows. It was done with a small number of patients
in a specific region. Furthermore, the effects of factors other than those used in the
present measurement cannot be excluded, so these effects cannot be generalized to all stroke
patients. Determining long-term effects is also difficult because of the short-term training
period at six weeks.</p><p>This study proposes the use of stair task training because it is not limited spatially to
stroke patients, it is economically efficient, and it can be applied more easily and safely
than gait training methods by using general steps.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Horstman</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name><name><surname>Beltman</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Gerrits</surname><given-names>KH</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Intrinsic muscle strength and voluntary activation of both
