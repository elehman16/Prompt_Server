Primary efficacy endpoint results have been published previously (Rauck et al., 2015). The current paper focuses on patient-reported outcomes for health-related quality of life (HRQL), work productivity, and activity impairment that were assessed during this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study in patients with moderate-to-severe CLBP. After a screening period (&#x02264;2 weeks), patients entered an open-label titration period (4&#x02013;6 weeks). Treatment responders were then randomized to a double-blind placebo-controlled treatment period (12 weeks). HRQL was assessed using changes in the Short Form-36 v2 Health Survey (SF-36v2) and the EuroQol-5 Dimensions Health Questionnaire 3-Level version (EQ-5D-3L). Work productivity and regular activities were evaluated using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Specific Health Problem (WPAI:SHP).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">A total of 410 patients received ALO-02 during the open-label titration period, of which 280 (intent-to-treat (ITT) population) were treated during the double-blind placebo-controlled treatment period (placebo, n = 134; ALO-02, n = 146).

In 2012, approximately 25 million Americans were living with chronic pain, which resulted in reduced health-related quality of life (HRQL) and work productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The economic impact of chronic pain has been estimated to be $560&#x02013;635 billion per year in 2010 US dollars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">The long-term management of chronic pain with opioids should only be initiated when other pain treatments, such as non-opioid pain medicines or immediate-release opioid medicines, are ineffective or are not tolerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Guidelines developed by the American Pain Society, the American Academy of Pain Medicine, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stress the importance of patient assessment and monitoring to avoid opioid misuse or abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Despite these measures, opioid abuse is a recognized problem that is approaching epidemic proportions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Abuse-deterrent opioids (ADOs) have been developed as part of a multifaceted approach to enable safer use of opioids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. ADOs include formulations that impede tampering by physical (e.g., crush-resistant) or chemical (e.g., opioid receptor antagonist) means [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Designed as an ADO, ALO-02 capsules comprise pellets of extended-release oxycodone hydrochloride and sequestered naltrexone hydrochloride, an opioid receptor antagonist.</p><p id="Par22">The efficacy and safety results of a phase III clinical trial to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of ALO-02, when compared with placebo, in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic low back pain (CLBP) have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This study showed that treatment with ALO-02 was superior to placebo for low back pain as measured on the 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)-Pain. Similar results were also seen on the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-sf). Patients treated with ALO-02 reported improvement during the open-label titration period on other assessments such as the Patient&#x02019;s Global Assessment (PGA) of Low Back Pain and Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ). Satisfaction with Treatment favored ALO-02 over placebo. Overall, this study found that ALO-02 was efficacious in treating CLBP and presented a safety profile similar to that of other opioids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">The current paper focuses on secondary objectives of this study that relate to additional patient-reported outcomes of ALO-02 in treating CLBP. Assessments of HRQL, work productivity, and activity impairment in patients treated with ALO-02 for the management of moderate-to-severe CLBP are reported here.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par24">This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study in patients from the United States with moderate-to-severe CLBP (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01571362).

Major exclusion criteria were history (within the past 2&#x000a0;years) of lumbosacral radiculopathy, spinal stenosis, documented drug or alcohol abuse, or a positive urine drug test for illicit substances or opioid medications not prescribed to the patient.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par26">This study consisted of four periods, starting with an initial screening period lasting &#x02264;2&#x000a0;weeks during which standard medical assessments were conducted to determine patient eligibility. Eligible patients entered an open-label ALO-02 conversion titration period (4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;weeks) during which pain management was individualized by titrating ALO-02. At the end of the open-label titration period, patients tolerating ALO-02 and with NRS-Pain scores of 4 or lower were then randomized to either continue on active ALO-02 treatment or placebo. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio using an interactive voice or web response system to receive a randomization number and blinded treatment assignment. Randomization was stratified by prior pain analgesic (opioid or non-opioid) and study center. Patients, investigators and clinic personnel were blinded to the randomized drug. The double-blind randomization period included a two-week blinded taper for both the treatment and placebo arms to ensure integrity of blinded data, followed by 10&#x000a0;weeks of treatment with ALO-02 or placebo. During the two-week post-treatment follow-up period, patients were tapered off ALO-02 and converted to standard of care treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Patient-reported outcome assessments</title><p id="Par27">HRQL was measured using the Short Form-36v2 Health Survey (SF-36v2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and the EuroQol-5 Dimensions Health Questionnaire 3-Level version (EQ-5D-3L) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">The SF-36v2 is a self-administered questionnaire measuring physical functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, social functioning, bodily pain, mental health, role limitations due to emotional problems, vitality, and general health perception. These eight domains also combine to form two component summary scores, the Physical Component Summary and the Mental Component Summary. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health states.</p><p id="Par29">The EQ-5D-3L is a self-completed standardized instrument used as a generic measure of health status using a simple descriptive profile consisting of five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression), each of which is assessed on a three-level severity scale (no problems, some or moderate problems, extreme problems). These scores are combined to form a single index utility value with higher scores indicating better health. Additionally, a standard vertical 20&#x000a0;cm visual analog scale (VAS) was used to record an individual&#x02019;s rating of their current health status.</p><p id="Par30">Work productivity and activity impairment were measured using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Specific Health Problem (WPAI:SHP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The WPAI:SHP questionnaire measured the effect of a specific health problem (i.e. low back pain) on work productivity and activity impairment. Specific outcomes were absenteeism (work time missed), presenteeism (impairment while working), overall work impairment (absenteeism plus presenteeism), and activity impairment (impairment in regular activities) due to CLBP. Each score is represented as a percentage, with higher scores indicating less productivity or greater impairment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Endpoints</title><p id="Par31">The endpoints assessed were mean changes in the SF-36v2, EQ-5D-3L, and the WPAI:SHP from screening period to the end of titration period (open-label titration period), from randomization baseline to the end of study (double-blind treatment period), and from screening period to the end of double-blind treatment period (overall study period).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p id="Par32">Analysis of patient-reported outcomes was conducted on all patients during the titration period and on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, consisting of all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication after randomization.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par37">Patient-reported outcomes are useful in evaluating treatment efficacy and interpreting clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This study assessed these outcomes in a chronic pain population enriched by treatment responders. A randomized withdrawal trial design is recommended by the FDA to reduce placebo exposure and minimize high dropout rates associated with clinical trials of opioids. This design may be especially suitable to test reformulations of approved opioids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) guidelines suggest this trial design may increase assay sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The results of the open-label titration period may provide valuable insights since it is thought to closely mimic clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">The primary efficacy and safety data from this study showed that ALO-02 was superior to placebo in reducing pain in patients with CLBP and exhibited a safety profile similar to that of other opioids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In the current analysis, patients reported significant improvement in HRQL, work productivity, and activity impairment with ALO-02 during the open-label titration period, which parallels the significant pain reduction associated with CLBP observed after ALO-02 administration during this period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The change in the EQ-5D summary index from screening to the end of the open-label titration period of 0.14 is above a previously reported mean minimal important difference of 0.074 (range, &#x02212;0.011&#x02013;0.140), indicating a clinically relevant change in health status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This minimal important difference for the EQ-5D summary index was determined using studies in different patient populations, including those with back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The change in the physical component score of 8.2&#x02013;9.6 derived using the SF-36v2 questionnaire during the open-label titration period was also above the 1.26&#x02013;5.95 range for clinical relevance reported previously in patients recovering from lumbar spine surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">The bodily pain subscale of the SF-36v2 significantly favored patients randomized to continue ALO-02 compared with patients randomized to placebo during the double-blind treatment period, but other measures of HRQL, work productivity, and activity impairment did not show significant differences. This may be due to effects of ALO-02 persisting from the open-label period in patients randomized to placebo for the double-blind period. The specific design of randomized withdrawal trials, where the outcome of the double-blind treatment period is assessed on the worsening of pain with placebo relative to the active arm, may also contribute to the lack of significant differences between placebo and ALO-02 treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">When considering the overall study period, the bodily pain subscale of the SF-36v2 showed a significant difference. This is supported by the significant difference between ALO-02 and placebo in the WPAI:SHP measure of activity impairment due to low back pain during the overall study period.</p><p id="Par41">There are limitations of this study that should be taken into consideration. First, the results may not be generalizable to a wider population because the placebo-controlled double-blind treatment period included a population enriched with treatment responders, whereas the open-label period of the study, which included all eligible patients, was uncontrolled. Second, improvements on various patient-reported outcome measures in the open-label titration period were based on comparison to baseline only, as this portion of the study by design was not placebo-controlled. Finally, the study was powered for the primary efficacy endpoint of NRS-Pain and not these secondary outcome measures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par42">ALO-02 may improve HRQL, work productivity, and activity impairment in patients with chronic low back pain. Improvement was generally maintained during the randomized double-blind treatment period, although few treatment differences were observed. ALO-02 appears effective for pain relief and potentially also functional improvement in this chronic pain population. Further studies are needed to evaluate patient-reported functional outcomes as a primary or secondary endpoint in chronic pain populations.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ADO</term><def><p id="Par6">Abuse-deterrent opioids</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BPI-sf</term><def><p id="Par7">Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CLBP</term><def><p id="Par8">Chronic low back pain</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQ-5D-3L</term><def><p id="Par9">EuroQol-5 Dimensions Health Questionnaire 3-Level version</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HRQL</term><def><p id="Par10">Health-related quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IMMPACT</term><def><p id="Par11">Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p id="Par12">Intent-to-treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NRS</term><def><p id="Par13">Numeric Rating Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PGA</term><def><p id="Par14">Patient&#x02019;s Global Assessment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RMDQ</term><def><p id="Par15">Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF-36v2</term><def><p id="Par16">Short Form-36v2 Health Survey</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p id="Par17">Visual analog scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WPAI:SHP</term><def><p id="Par18">Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Specific Health Problem</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Medical writing support was provided by Mary Kunjappu, PhD and Alexandra Bound, PhD of Engage Scientific Solutions and funded by Pfizer.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par43">This study was sponsored by Pfizer.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par44">Data reported in this study are available on ClinicalTrials.gov (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT01571362">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT01571362</ext-link>).</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>All authors have contributed to the conception and design of the study, or acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and approval of the final version.</p></notes><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><sec id="FPar3"><title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title><p id="Par45">Informed consent and institutional review board approval were obtained before study initiation.</p></sec><sec id="FPar4"><title>Consent for publication</title><p id="Par46">No individual patient level data are presented in the manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="FPar5"><title>Competing interests</title><p id="Par47">Elizabeth T.
