Clinical audits indicate substantial scope for improved detection and treatment. Improvement strategies should ideally be tailored according to identified needs and barriers to change. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a tailored intervention to improve the secondary care management of suspected encephalitis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The study is a two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial with allocation by postgraduate deanery. Participants were identified from 24 hospitals nested within 12 postgraduate deaneries in the United Kingdom (UK). We developed a multifaceted intervention package including core and flexible components with embedded behaviour change techniques selected on the basis of identified needs and barriers to change. The primary outcome will be a composite of the proportion of patients with suspected encephalitis receiving timely and appropriate diagnostic lumbar puncture within 12&#x000a0;h of hospital admission and aciclovir treatment within 6&#x000a0;h. We will gather outcome data pre-intervention and up to 12&#x000a0;months post-intervention from patient records. Statistical analysis at the cluster level will be blind to allocation. An economic evaluation will estimate intervention cost-effectiveness from the health service perspective.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Controlled Trials: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN06886935">ISRCTN06886935</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13012-014-0201-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Encephalitis</kwd><kwd>Cluster randomised controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Guideline implementation</kwd><kwd>Protocol</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>There is evidence that the current clinical management of serious acute neurological infections is suboptimal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Encephalitis, inflammation of the brain tissue, is most commonly caused by herpes simplex virus in the United Kingdom (UK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. When herpes simplex virus encephalitis is treated promptly with aciclovir, there is a significant improvement in patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Encephalitis affects between five and eight people per 100,000 per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Sequelae after hospital discharge can include significant morbidities such as epilepsy, memory loss, and speech and behavioural disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], which also impair patients return to work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Whilst herpes simplex virus encephalitis is relatively rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], clinical presentations including features consistent with suspected encephalitis occur relatively frequently but in different ways to other brain injuries. Encephalitis typically presents with one or more of headache, fever, new-onset seizures, altered consciousness, and behavioural disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This variable and non-specific presentation often results in delayed diagnosis, especially in children who may only present with fever and irritability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, delays in using the main diagnostic technique, lumbar puncture, may further delay treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Clinical guidelines have been developed in response to these problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, simple dissemination of clinical guidelines is often unlikely to bring about significant changes in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, interventions to implement clinical guidelines should ideally be based upon a diagnosis of barriers to change, preferably focusing on those most amenable to change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims</title><p>We developed a multifaceted intervention package including core and flexible components with embedded behaviour change techniques selected on the basis of identified needs and barriers to change (Backman, submitted).

In order to reduce the likelihood of any unintended co-intervention effects we sought hospitals not directly participating in other ENCEPH UK studies. Sites had to have facilities to perform lumbar punctures and neuroimaging and willing to be randomised to intervention or control arms. We aimed to recruit a range of types of hospital, providing secondary, tertiary, (specialist) and paediatric care, to broadly represent national provision and improve the generalizability of subsequent findings.</p><p>We were aware that trainee doctors, one key target intervention group, work and rotate between different hospitals within postgraduate deaneries. If we randomised hospitals to intervention and control arms within the same deanery, there would be a risk of contamination.

Staff in participating hospitals will identify suspected cases retrospectively by performing two mandatory searches, of discharge codes for encephalitis in the preceding 12&#x000a0;months and of all patients undergoing a lumbar puncture within the same time period. Hospitals can also find eligible patients via records of intravenous aciclovir prescriptions or of orders for cranial CT scan or MRI within the last 12&#x000a0;months. We are using these combined approaches to maximise likelihood of case identification and reduce differences in ascertainment between hospitals. We included both adult and paediatric cases.</p><p>Pre-intervention, we collected data to pilot outcome measures and provide data for the feedback intervention. We aimed for 30 adult and paediatric cases per hospital to allow for possible under-recruitment in some of the smaller hospitals; however, we later sought some additional cases from higher recruiting hospitals to better inform exploratory analyses of the baseline data and to compensate for lower recruiting sites. We plan to ask for a further 30 cases per hospital in the final trial data collection, thus the total patient sample size will be a maximum of 720. We anticipate a degree of imbalance between hospitals to achieve the total required sample size, limited by the upper limit of 40 cases per hospital.</p><p>Data are collected using structured case review forms. No patient identifiable information is sent to the central trial team. We trained data collectors, mainly nurses and trainee doctors, via face-to-face meetings and/or written briefing materials. We emphasised the need for a systematic approach to case identification to reduce the likelihood of selection bias. The trial research fellow (RB) is monitoring fidelity to the intervention via regular telephone and email contact with relevant hospitals. She is also collecting qualitative data from staff interviews and observational field notes in a sub-sample of four intervention hospitals data as part of a process evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Sample size</title><p>Using pilot data from 315 patients across 26 hospitals in four deaneries, we estimated the standard deviations of the deanery and hospital random effects to be 0.244 and 1.108, respectively, and the current proportion of adherence to the primary outcome to be 5%.

We defined two blocks of deaneries, a block of six including hospitals (outside of the trial) where research teams were already actively involved in other ENCEPH UK studies and a block of six where there were no such ongoing studies (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). An independent statistician randomised equal numbers of clusters within each block to the intervention and routine arms, blinded to hospital identity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We will analyse the results in R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org">http://www.r-project.org</ext-link>) using a generalised linear mixed model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] with binomial errors, logistic link, fixed effects for blocks and treatments, random effects for deanery and for hospital. If the intervention is effective, it will raise awareness of suspected encephalitis and lead to increased documentation in the clinical records of encephalitis as a differential diagnosis. In our baseline (pre-intervention analysis), we found that cases mainly included on this basis (method two) tended to be less likely to comply with the primary outcome criteria. One explanation is that these may represent clinical presentations at lower risk of having encephalitis and may therefore tend to be investigated and treated less thoroughly compared with more strongly suspected cases. It is therefore likely that the intervention will result in differential case mixes between the intervention and control arms, in this scenario diluting any real intervention effect. In our analysis of the outcome data, we will adjust for any relationship between the method of inclusion and compliance with the primary outcomes and analysis will be undertaken by a statistician blind to hospital assignment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Cost-effectiveness analysis</title><p>The economic evaluation will take the perspective of the UK National Health Service (NHS). We will use trial records and observations to estimate the costs of intervention delivery. Data on health care resource utilisation will be gathered from case record reviews. Unit costs will be obtained from publicly available routine data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Costs and health benefits occurring over 12&#x000a0;months will be discounted at 3.5% per annum. Therefore, results will include, in addition to incremental costs and benefits, an estimate of total cost per patient for each arm. In order to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), utility values will be estimated from the results of administering the EQ-5D, primary economic outcome, and the SF-6D utility scores derived from the SF-36, following Brazier&#x02019;s methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>We will analyse cost data using regression methods for handling censored cost data and accounting for clustered nature of the data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. We will analyse costs and benefits jointly using a bivariate probability distribution. Sample uncertainty in estimated cost difference and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios between arm groups will be described using bootstrapped confidence intervals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] as well as with cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Parameter uncertainty and robustness of findings will be accounted for through univariate sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.</p><p>Estimates of costs and health outcome (utilities) will be used to populate a model of suspected encephalitis patient management in both intervention and control conditions. The model will cover the remaining patient lifetime within which the (probability of) cost-effectiveness of the alternative will be analysed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Data analysis will be performed using Stata [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Ethical review</title><p>The study was reviewed by Preston North West Research Ethics Committee (13/NW/0279) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is ongoing with pre-intervention data collection completed; we are yet to undertake post-intervention outcome data collection and analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec20"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13012_2014_201_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
