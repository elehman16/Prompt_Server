It is caused by disruption of the ocular surface, driven by tear hyperosmolarity and tear film instability.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The tear film can be destabilized by decreased tear production or altered tear composition, damaging the ocular surface and resulting in inflammation.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Dryness of the ocular surface epithelium can induce apoptosis of epithelial cells, which eventually leads to aggravation of dry eye.<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>The current managements of dry eye include tear supplementation, tear stimulation, anti-inflammatory agents, immunomodulatory agents, and environmental strategies.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Currently, the main therapy for dry eye is artificial tears, with anti-inflammatory therapy and punctual occlusion therapy as second and third line therapies.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>Sodium hyaluronate (SH) is a glycosaminoglycan with a viscoelastic rheology and a natural component of the tear film.

There was one primary objective end point which is FCS score at week 12 (last observation). Secondary objective end points were TBUT, lissamine green conjunctival staining (LGCS) score, meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) index, and Schirmer's test value. Secondary subjective end point was ocular surface disease index (OSDI) questionnaire for the grading of the symptom score.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The sum of the scores was used in the analysis. All of these parameters were assessed at baseline, week 6, week 12, or at treatment discontinuation.</p><p>For FCS scores, 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;L of 2% fluorescein solution was instilled in the conjunctival sac as the patient blinked normally. Corneal staining was examined under standard illumination using a slit-lamp microscope with a cobalt blue filter. According to the National Eye Institute/Industry Workshop report, the cornea was divided into 5 fractions.<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> FCS scores were measured on a 0&#x02013;3 point scale, in the superior, inferior, nasal, temporal, and central corneal zones: 0 (no staining), 1 (mild superficial stippling), 2 (moderate punctate staining, including superficial abrasion of the cornea), and 3 (severe abrasion or corneal erosion, deep corneal abrasion or recurrent erosion). The total score was then calculated.</p><p>For LGCS scores, 20&#x02009;&#x003bc;L of 1% lissamine green solution was instilled in the conjunctival sac, and the conjunctiva was divided into 6 fractions.<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Conjunctival staining was evaluated under low illumination by slit-lamp microscopy and was scored from 0 through 3 for each fraction, then summed to calculate the total score.</p><p>For TBUT, 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;L of 2% fluorescein solution was instilled in the conjunctival sac, and TBUT was then evaluated by slit-lamp microscopy. The elapsed time from a normal blink to the first appearance of a dry spot in the tear film was measured thrice.</p><p>Schirmer test was performed without anesthesia to measure tear volume as follows. A Schirmer test strip was placed on the lower eyelid between palpebral conjunctiva and bulbar conjunctiva without touching the cornea. The tear volume then was measured for 5&#x02009;min. The length in millimeters of tear fluid absorbed on the strip measured from the edge of the strip was recorded as tear volume.</p><p>The expressibility of the meibum was scored by the application of the digital pressure to the upper tarsus, and the degree of ease with which the meibum was induced was evaluated semiquantitatively as follows: 0, clear meibum easily expressed; 1, cloudy meibum expressed with mild pressure; 2, cloudy meibum expressed with more than moderate pressure; and 3, meibum not expressed, even with the hard pressure.<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>The quality of the meibum was scored by the digital pressure over 8 meibomian glands of the lower lids. The meibum secretion was graded as follows: 0, clear; 1, cloudy; 2, cloudy with granular debris; and 3, thick like toothpaste.</p></sec><sec id="s008"><title>Safety assessments</title><p>The safety variable was the occurrence of adverse events (AEs), determined at various visits by means of physical signs and symptoms, external eye examination, slit-lamp microscopy, visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and funduscopy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s009"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All patients who were enrolled in the study were included in the efficacy and safety analyses. Considering the multiplicity of the test, closed testing procedures were used to verify noninferiority by FCS score. Noninferiority of SH to CS was determined if the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the intergroup difference was calculated, and if the upper limit did not exceed the 0.34 inferiority margin. In addition, intergroup comparison between SH and CS groups at week 12 was done using the <italic>t-</italic>test. Furthermore, an analysis of change from baseline of FCS and LGCS score at each visit and secondary end points was performed using the <italic>t-</italic>test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test.</p><p>The incidence rates of AEs and adverse drug reactions observed after starting the treatment period were tabulated for each group, and intergroup homogeneity was analyzed using Fisher's exact test. The significance level for tests related to safety and efficacy was 5% for both sides, with CI of 95% on both sides.

SH eye drop was effective at improving both the objective signs and the subjective symptoms of dry eye. Study data were obtained from a population representative of that seen in normal clinical practice, because dry eye commonly affects women who are middle-aged and older.<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>Our study revealed that the effects of 0.1% SH, 0.15% SH, and 0.3% SH versus 0.05% CS were thoroughly comparable during the whole study period. In addition, in within-group analysis, dry eye patients who received 0.15% SH exhibited better improvement versus baseline in FCS score at week 12 although it was not statistically significant. FCS is a measurement of corneal damage reflecting corneal epithelium integrity and LGCS reflecting conjunctival epithelium integrity. Therefore, these improvements at week 6 and 12 showed that 0.1% SH, 0.15% SH, 0.3% SH, and 0.05% CS objectively improved the health of the ocular surface in the primary analysis. Our results are in good agreement with previous clinical data, which reported that SH-containing eye drops stimulate healing of the corneal epithelium.<sup><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p>TBUT is considered a surrogate measure of tear-film stability. The improvements in TBUT with use of SH suggest improved integrity of the tear film, which can prevent evaporation, hyperosmolarity, and progression of dry eye disease due to its rheological, mucomimetic, and water-retention properties.<sup><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>In addition to its benefits on objective measures, 0.1% SH, 0.15% SH, and 0.3% SH were as effective as 0.05% CS on subjective outcomes, showing improvement in symptoms. The subjective improvements in dry eye symptoms observed in this study were supported by improvements in clinical outcome measures. Evaluating the treatment success in dry eye syndrome is a major challenge because of the weak correlation between signs and symptoms in dry eye syndrome, and the high variability of objective signs such as Schirmer test.<sup><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Therefore, the assessment of efficacy using subjective symptoms, as well as objective signs, is particularly important in patients with dry eye.</p><p>However, OSDI scores in the 0.05% CS group showed a tendency for better improvement compared with the other groups although the intergroup difference was not significant. This finding could be partly explained by the higher degrees of dry eye symptoms in the CS group at the beginning of the study although it was not statistically significant. Schirmer test values in the 0.15% SH group showed a significant tendency for better improvement at week 12 compared with those of the 0.1% SH, 0.3% SH, and 0.05% CS group (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). This is most likely to be attributed to unique anti-inflammatory properties of SH indirectly leading to tear secretion.</p><p>Previous study found that SH and CMC had significantly higher ocular surface retention times than physiological saline solution, and of these, 0.3% SH had the highest ability to protect the corneal epithelial cells from desiccation, which was concentration dependent.<sup><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> However, in this study, the efficacy of SH eye drops did not reveal concentration dependent results. The difference between our results and previous study may come from dissimilarities in type and dry eye severity. The participants in this study had a combined aqueous tear-deficient and evaporative dry eye with the severity of moderate to severe grading according to DEWS classification.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Therefore, a single dose of SH did not seem to be significantly effective in moderate to severe dry eye patients. If our study enrolled patients with mild dry eye, concentration dependent results may have been shown. In addition, only 0.05% CS without any kinds of artificial tears is insufficient to allow epithelial healing and reduce dry eye symptoms in moderate to severe dry eye disease and is, therefore, unlikely to cause noticeable alterations after treatment. Artificial tears are typically recommended to use together with anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory ophthalmic solutions as primary treatment options for moderate dry eye and in combination with other therapies for severe dry eye in clinical practice.<sup><xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p>0.1% SH, 0.15% SH, 0.3% SH, and 0.05% CS were well tolerated. All AEs were resolved by the end of the study period. Some of the AEs were not distinguishable from exacerbations or fluctuations of dry eye symptoms clearly. No serious events occurred and no safety issues were raised.</p><p>This study has some limitations. First, the duration was short. It may be insufficient to compare the impact of the SH and cyclosporine treatment on long-term dry eye disease since CS eye drop is believed to effect subconjunctival inflammation by preventing the recruitment of T cells, which may take 3&#x02013;6 months. However previous study has shown that although CS eye drop improves objective and subjective measures of the dry eye, it may take up to 4&#x02013;8 weeks to show its maximum effect.<sup><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Therefore even though this study is limited in duration, it still justifies the results. A larger and longer study is warranted to more thoroughly address important clinical issues, including the effects of SH and CS eye drops on controlling ocular surface inflammation, reducing tear hyperosmolarity, and repairing corneal epithelium. Second, the difference of instillation frequency between SH and CS may influence the outcomes. Third, the lack of a placebo for the SH and CS ophthalmic solution could be the weakness in this study. Further studies will be required to investigate whether the improvements reported with SH are maintained in the longer term.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s020"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, this is the first study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the 0.1% SH, 0.15% SH, and 0.3% SH compared with 0.05% CS in patients with dry eye. Our study showed that a 12-week, 4&#x02013;6 times daily treatment with 0.1% SH, 0.15% SH, and 0.3% SH was as effective as 0.05% CS in improving the objective signs and subjective symptoms of dry eye. These results suggest that it may lead to improved treatment of corneal and conjunctival epithelial damage and improvement in symptoms in patients with dry eye. Such efficacy, in addition to the well-tolerated profile of 0.1% SH, 0.15% SH, and 0.3% SH, makes them potentially useful treatment options for dry eye in clinical practice.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s021" sec-type="ack"><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>This study was supported by an unrestricted educational grant from Taejoon Pharm (Seoul, Korea).
