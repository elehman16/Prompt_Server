A stroke patient with a flaccid shoulder also has a high likelihood of experiencing HSP during rehabilitation and daily life.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> HSP has negative effects on poststroke functional recovery, activities of daily living, quality of life, and length of hospital stay.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Several interventions, including physical modalities, exercise, medication, and local injections, have been used to treat HSP in patients with stroke.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Rotator cuff injury may play an important role in HSP after acute stroke.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> The physician may prescribe steroid or hyaluronic acid (HA) injections to alleviate pain associated with rotator cuff lesions.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> Although immediate pain reduction can be significant, the long-term side effects of steroid injections include tissue degeneration and tendon rupture.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> Therefore, HA injection is an alternative intervention for reduction of pain and inflammation; HA protects the cartilage and inhibits degeneration, and improves the metabolism in synovial fluid, tendons, and ligaments. Meloni et al<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> found that intraarticular HA injection in patients with supraspinatus tendinitis resulted in positive effects on shoulder pain and motion and activities of daily living. In previous studies, researchers found that subacromial HA injection in patients with rotator cuff injury resulted in significant pain reduction for 6 to 12 weeks.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> To the best of our knowledge, no studies have explored the effects of HA injection in patients with HSP, or the treatment of rotator cuff tears in stroke patients with hemiplegia. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of HA injection for pain reduction and motor function recovery in subacute stroke patients with hemiplegic shoulder injury and pain.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The study was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial (clinical trial registration number NCT02465853). A parallel-group design with allocation concealment was used in this study. We did not estimate the sample size because this was a pilot study to investigate HA effects on HSP for stroke patients with rotator cuff dysfunction. The participants were enrolled between February 2015 and May 2016, at a rehabilitation unit of a single medical center.</p><p>Of the 115 stroke patients admitted to our rehabilitation unit for an inpatient rehabilitation program, 26 stroke patients with a hemiplegic shoulder met the inclusion criteria and completed the procedures of this study (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The inclusion criteria were as follows: stroke patients with unilateral hemiplegia (stroke onset within 6 months), hemiplegic shoulder injuries (on sonography), and pain (visual analog scale [VAS] &#x02265;3). The exclusion criteria were shoulder pain or injury before stroke, systemic neuromuscular disease, or poor cognition leading to difficulty in understanding study procedures. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at our hospital. We followed the ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects according to the Declaration of Helsinki 2013. The patients understood the study procedures and provided written informed consent before the assessments and interventions.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of eligible patients selected for this study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-95-e5547-g001"/></fig><p>We randomly divided the patients with stroke into 2 groups before treatment. Randomization was performed by a research assistant using sequentially numbered, sealed, and opaque envelopes. In the experimental group, 16 patients with stroke received a 2.5&#x0200a;mL sodium hyaluronate injection (ARTZ Dispo, Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan) into the subdeltoid bursa under ultrasound guidance (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) once per week, for 3 weeks, and were also enrolled in a regular inpatient rehabilitation program (1&#x0200a;hour of physical therapy and 1&#x0200a;hour of occupational therapy/d, 5 days/wk). In the control group, 10 patients who were also enrolled in the inpatient rehabilitation program received a 0.9% sodium chloride injection (2.5&#x0200a;mL) into the subdeltoid bursa. The injections were administered by the same physiatrist, who was experienced in ultrasound-guided injections. The enrolled patients with stroke were blinded to the content of the local injections in this study.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Subdeltoid hyaluronic acid injections under ultrasound guidance.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-95-e5547-g002"/></fig><p>A physical therapist, who was blinded to the interventions, assessed the following parameters before and after treatment: shoulder spasticity, measured by the modified Ashworth scale (MAS)<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>; shoulder subluxation, with a fingerbreadth of displacement between the acromion and humeral head; pain-free range of motion of the hemiplegic shoulder, as measured with a goniometer; Fugl&#x02013;Meyer assessment of the upper extremity (FMA-UE)<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>; and HSP.

A greater reduction in HSP was evident following treatment with HA injections, compared to that observed in the control group. Additionally, HA may also be beneficial for reducing HSP in subacute stroke patients with rotator cuff injury. Our study showed that patients with stroke exhibited significantly improved shoulder flexion and abduction following HA treatment. In contrast, only shoulder flexion appeared to improve significantly following treatment with placebo. Chou et al<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> and Merolla et al<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> reported that subacromial HA injections were effective in alleviating shoulder pain and improving shoulder function in patients with rotator cuff injury or tendinopathy. Similarly, our findings revealed a beneficial effect for hemiplegic shoulder function and pain reduction after HA injection in stroke patients with HSP and shoulder injury.</p><p>HA may provide antiinflammatory effects in patients with rotator cuff injuries by inhibiting the mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines and cyclooxygenase-2/prostaglandin E2 production.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> Therefore, the inhibitory effects of HA on inflammatory cells may lead to superior pain management in subacromial bursitis associated with rotator cuff injury.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> In our study, we also found that subacute stroke patients with rotator cuff lesions showed better pain management following HA injection. Additionally, shoulder abduction significantly improved after subacromial HA injections, which were also associated with further reductions of HSP.</p><p>Similar improvements in motor function were also evident from the FMA-UE scores in both groups after 3 weeks of conventional inpatient rehabilitation. A tendency toward improvement was noted in the FMA-UE scores of patients with stroke who received subacromial HA injections, compared to the scores in the placebo group; however, this was not statistically significant. This may be accounted for by the reduction in HSP following HA injections, which would lead to improved upper extremity function and mobility, as the patient would no longer be limited by pain. Nonetheless, we considered that conventional rehabilitation might have also played a major role in the recovery of upper extremity motor function in the subacute stage after stroke.</p><p>The limitations of this study included the following. First, a small sample size of patients with stroke was obtained from only 1 source: a rehabilitation unit at a single medical center. Second, the details of the physical modalities used for HSP pain management were not recorded in this study. Third, we did not include a more extensive follow-up period in our study protocol for patients with stroke who received HA injections; long-term observation of structural changes in the rotator cuff muscles is needed. In the future, multicenter studies with a long-term follow-up period should be performed to explore the clinical benefits of subacromial HA injections in the management of hemiplegic shoulders with pain and soft tissue injuries.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, HA injections could provide an additive effect for reduction of HSP, and may improve shoulder abduction in subacute stroke patients with HSP and injury.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank Professor Hsuen-Wen Chang for statistical guidance, Dr. Po-Cheng Chen for drawing the figures, and Mr. Chia-Wen Wu for data collection at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: FMA-UE = Fugl&#x02013;Meyer assessment for the upper extremity, HA = hyaluronic acid, HSP = hemiplegic shoulder pain, MAS = modified Ashworth scale, VAS = visual analog scale.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Funding: This study was supported by grants from Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CMRPG8C0771).</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Najenson</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Yacubovich</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Pikielni</surname><given-names>SS</given-names></name></person-group>
