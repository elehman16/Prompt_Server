In Central and Northern Europe, apple sensitization has been associated with initial sensitization to an aeroallergen, with Betula pollen allergen the most often involved <xref rid="pone.0107304-Eriksson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107304-Ortolani1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107304-FernandezRivas2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.

By contrast, in Southern European countries, apple allergic patients more frequently have GS, no association with Betula sensitization and cross-reactions to other fruits, especially peach <xref rid="pone.0107304-CuestaHerranz1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107304-FernandezRivas1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107304-FernandezRivas2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107304-GonzlezMancebo1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.

Moreover, atopic patients allergic to peach and apple may have OAS in an environment where the prevalence of Betula pollen sensitization is low. In this situation, profilin is an important sensitizer <xref rid="pone.0107304-CuestaHerranz2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0107304-Andersen1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, in the Mediterranean area, the origin of apple allergy is generally attributed to LTP sensitization <xref rid="pone.0107304-CuestaHerranz1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107304-FernandezRivas1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107304-FernandezRivas2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107304-GonzlezMancebo1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, although the relevance of sensitization to other allergens has not yet been fully established, particularly for patients with pollen allergy. Therefore OAS can be caused both by labile (such as PR-10 and profilins), as well as stable allergens (such as LTPs), whereas systemic symptoms are associated with the latter and seldom with labile allergens. The aim of this study was to undertake a detailed analysis of allergen sensitization profiles in an important number of patients diagnosed as allergic to apple from a Mediterranean population. A clinical questionnaire was used to record the allergic response or tolerance to other fruits and vegetables. Inhibition ELISA was performed using the four apple allergens identified, as well as other important related allergens such as rBet v 1, rPru p 3 and Pho d 2 (equivalent to rMal d 1, rMal d 3 and rMal d 4, respectively).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients and controls</title><p>Patients referred to the Allergy Unit of Malaga Hospital (south of Spain area) with a history of apple allergy that could be confirmed by positive prick-prick test and/or double-blind-placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC), were included. Patients were classified according to symptoms: OAS when they were restricted to the skin or mucosal sites of direct contact with the allergen (itching of the oral mucosa and lips with or without angioedema immediately after eating apple), and GS when reactions involved organs far from the site of initial contact with the food (urticaria, with or without angioedema, and anaphylaxis) accompanied or not to OAS.

Patients were selected based on a consistent clinical history, skin test, specific IgE and/or DBPCFC. Considering the clinical symptoms, in our population over 50% of patients developed GS, with almost half developing anaphylaxis. This is contrary to what occurs in Central and Northern European countries, where OAS is the most frequent clinical entity <xref rid="pone.0107304-Kanny1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107304-Kivity1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107304-Ortolani1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107304-FernandezRivas2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.

These results indicate that when all patients with apple allergy are analysed together the picture is more complex than previously thought <xref rid="pone.0107304-FernandezRivas1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107304-FernandezRivas2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and that in some cases profilin may be the sole agent responsible for the symptoms. Nevertheless, our results are in agreement with some studies detecting a high association between profilin sensitization and OAS in peach and/or apple allergic patients <xref rid="pone.0107304-CuestaHerranz2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107304-Asero1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107304-Pastorello2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>Importantly, this study confirmed different patterns of IgE recognition through the use of detailed inhibition studies. Our data indicate the recognition of Mal d 3 with high cross-reactivity with Pru p 3 in those with LTP sensitization and of Mal d 4 with high cross-reactivity with Pho d 2 in those sensitized to profilin.</p><p>Another important point is that in our population 87.65% of all cases were sensitized to pollen with 76.05% of all cases having clinical symptoms of asthma or rhinitis. When we consider apple allergy in the context of pollen sensitization we found that those positive to these inhalant allergens had less severe symptoms as have been described by Pastorello in peach allergy where patients positive to Pru p 3 were significantly less likely to develop severe symptoms when also sensitised to Pru p 1 and Pru p 4 <xref rid="pone.0107304-Pastorello2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. More specifically, among those with GS, 66.7% did not have pollen allergy compared to 44.6% who did have pollen allergy.</p><p>Although <italic>Betula</italic> is not normally encountered in our area we detected positive SPT to <italic>Betula</italic> pollen and specific IgE antibodies to Bet v 1 in 43.41% and 20.29% of cases, respectively, with no differences between patients with OAS and with GS. Differences were also observed between the <italic>Betula</italic> major allergen Bet v 1 and the homologous Mal d 1, with higher percentages of specific IgE antibodies in patients with OAS (33.32% and 31%, respectively) compared with GS (3% and 23.14%, respectively). These figures, although lower than those detected in central and northern Europe <xref rid="pone.0107304-FernandezRivas2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107304-Ebner1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, are nevertheless higher than those previously detected in a Spanish population allergic to apple <xref rid="pone.0107304-FernandezRivas2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In our geographical area, people are not exposed to <italic>Betula</italic> and the clinical expression of this sensitization is not relevant. Other, <italic>Betula</italic> related species, such as such as hazel and oak from the Fagales order, have been shown to cause cross-reactivity in <italic>Betula</italic>-free areas <xref rid="pone.0107304-Mari1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107304-Mari2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. However, in our study the inhibition results indicate that <italic>Betula</italic> recognition in our population could be due to cross-reactivity with Mal d 1, the latter being the primary sensitizer.</p><p>Finally, we detected a low frequency of Mal d 2 sensitization, 2% in those with OAS and 9% in those with GS. These results are similar to those detected throughout Europe <xref rid="pone.0107304-FernandezRivas2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107304-Palacin1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107304-Palacn1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>Summarizing, we have analysed a population of patients with apple allergy and a high percentage of pollinosis. Within this population we have seen various patterns of sensitization, with LTP being the most prevalent sensitizer for patients with GS while profilin, though more prevalent for those with OAS, is an important sensitizer for patients with both type of symptoms. Moreover, Mal d 1 was also detected and associated with mild symptoms. All these results indicate that, given the different recognition patterns, it would be desirable to include profillin, LTP and also PR-10 allergens in routine diagnosis of apple allergic patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank to Stefan Vieths (Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Federal Institute for Vaccines and Biomedicines, Division of Allergology, Langen, Germany) for the provision of different allergens necessary for the study.
