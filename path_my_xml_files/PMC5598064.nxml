However, there was an unexpected imbalance in events of hospitalization for heart failure (hHF), one of six components of the secondary CV composite endpoint, with a greater number of events observed with saxagliptin.

In healthy participants and patients with T2D, there were no findings suggestive of myocyte injury or fluid overload.

Saxagliptin, an orally active, highly potent, selective dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] was first approved in the United States in 2009 as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with T2D at doses of 2.5 or 5&#x000a0;mg once daily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The safety profile of saxagliptin is well-established, with its use in patients with T2D associated with a low risk of hypoglycaemia and weight neutrality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In compliance with postmarketing requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], the Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 53 trial (SAVOR-TIMI 53; NCT01107886) was conducted&#x02014;a large randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 4 study in 16,492 patients with T2D at high risk of CVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the CV safety of saxagliptin.</p><p id="Par54">The SAVOR study met the objective of the 2008 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance for Industry on treatments for diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] by demonstrating saxagliptin was non-inferior to placebo for the primary composite major adverse CV event (MACE) endpoint of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal ischaemic stroke (primary safety objective); hazard ratio (HR) 1.00 (95% CI 0.89, 1.12). Superiority of saxagliptin versus placebo on the composite MACE endpoint was not demonstrated (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.986). For the secondary composite endpoint of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, CV death, hospitalization for heart failure (hHF), hospitalization for unstable angina, or hospitalization for coronary revascularization, no statistically significant treatment differences were observed between saxagliptin and placebo [HR 1.02 (95% CI 0.94, 1.11); nominal p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.66 without multiplicity adjustment]. There was, however, an imbalance in the hHF component of the secondary composite endpoint, with a greater number of events observed with saxagliptin versus placebo [HR 1.27 (95% CI 1.07, 1.51); nominal p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.007 without multiplicity adjustment]. This represented an excess of 61 cases among patients treated with saxagliptin (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;289/8280; 3.5%) versus placebo (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;228/8212; 2.8%) over the median follow-up of 2.1&#x000a0;years.</p><p id="Par55">The imbalance in events of hHF observed with saxagliptin in SAVOR was an unexpected finding because no signal for increased CV risk (including heart failure) had been previously detected for saxagliptin in nonclinical or clinical development or in postmarketing surveillance. Despite considerable evidence supporting the CV safety of saxagliptin and other DPP-4 inhibitors, the unexpected findings of SAVOR raise questions about the CV effects of saxagliptin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Patients with T2D often require treatment with multiple glucose-lowering agents to achieve and maintain glycaemic control in the long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A clear understanding of the CV safety of saxagliptin is therefore important for guiding treatment decisions, particularly in patients with comorbidities or those with multiple CV risk factors. Here, we aimed to identify any evidence of a potential signal that may have predicted or may explain the unexpected imbalance in events of hHF observed with saxagliptin in SAVOR. To this end, we interrogated the available cardiovascular safety data from the nonclinical safety and clinical pharmacology development program for saxagliptin, with specific attention to potential findings that may have been indicative of a nonclinical or early clinical signal of myocardial injury.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Nonclinical</title><p id="Par56">Numerous nonclinical studies including in vitro and in vivo safety pharmacology and toxicology studies evaluated the potential effects of saxagliptin and 5-hydroxy saxagliptin, the major active metabolite of saxagliptin (50% the potency of the parent inhibition of DPP-4) on the CV system, amongst other endpoints. In vitro assessments included high concentrations (&#x02264;30&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M, 9.5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL) of saxagliptin and 5-hydroxy saxagliptin, which are &#x0003e;200 times the maximum plasma concentrations for saxagliptin (0.024&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL) and 5-hydroxy saxagliptin (0.047&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL) observed in healthy individuals following ingestion of the highest recommended saxagliptin therapeutic dose of 5&#x000a0;mg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Treatment durations for in vivo oral toxicology studies were up to 2&#x000a0;years in rodents and up to 12&#x000a0;months in non-rodents using high doses, representing large multiples of human exposures [up to 2200-times based on area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC)].

A pooled analysis based on 20 active- and placebo-controlled Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9156, of whom 5701 were treated with saxagliptin and 3455 were treated with placebo or active comparator) did not demonstrate an increased risk of &#x02018;cardiac failure&#x02019; with saxagliptin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The patients in these studies were at lower risk of CV events than those studied in SAVOR. There were a total of 39 heart failure events and the incidence rate ratio (saxagliptin/control) was 0.55 (95% CI 0.27, 1.12).</p><p id="Par88">Observational data have also not suggested an increased risk of heart failure among patients with T2D treated with saxagliptin versus other therapies. Although observational studies have important limitations compared with randomized clinical trials such as SAVOR, including but not limited to incomplete information and potential bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], they do provide valuable data about drug efficacy and safety in routine clinical use. A retrospective study using a US insurance claims database (Truven Health MarketScan Commercial and Medicare Supplemental databases) found no association between hHF and treatment with a DPP-4 inhibitor relative to sulfonylureas, and no association between hHF and treatment with saxagliptin relative to sitagliptin among patients with and without baseline CVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This finding was also seen in a retrospective large cohort study conducted within the Mini-Sentinel pilot program (a program created to assist the US FDA in developing a national active safety surveillance system) where a higher risk of hHF was not observed among users of saxagliptin or sitagliptin compared with other selected glucose-lowering agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Similarly, analyses of the Taiwan National Heath Insurance database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and the Italian Nationwide OsMed Health-DB database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] did not find an increased risk of hHF with saxagliptin compared to other DPP-4 inhibitors, including in patients with high CV risk.</p><p id="Par89">The question arises as to whether the increased rate of hHF seen in SAVOR is a class effect or unique to saxagliptin. Most studies of DPP-4 inhibitors have shown a neutral effect on heart failure risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The findings of large CV outcome trials for other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class, alogliptin and sitagliptin, both of which are non-DPP-4 substrate mimics, have now been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. As was the case with SAVOR, these studies showed no evidence of harm for the primary MACE endpoint. With regards to hHF, the findings of these studies were inconsistent. There was an adverse trend for hHF in the Study of Examination of Cardiovascular Outcomes with Alogliptin versus Standard of Care (EXAMINE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], but there was no evidence of an increase in hHF risk in the Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin (TECOS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. While there are some differences in study design, including the level of CV risk in the patient population enrolled and length of study follow up, no one factor has emerged that can adequately explain the discrepant findings for hHF among the different DPP-4 inhibitor CV outcome studies. However, a reanalysis of the SAVOR, EXAMINE and TECOS trials using the difference in restricted mean survival time as a measure of CV risks, instead of the HR, found no clinically relevant differences between the three DPP-4 inhibitors and placebo in CV outcomes, including hHF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Retrospective observational studies have also suggested that DPP-4 inhibitors are not associated with an increased risk of hHF compared with other antidiabetes drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and have not identified significant intraclass differences among DPP-4 inhibitors in incidence or events of hHF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par90">The nonclinical and clinical pharmacology studies presented here have several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results. Nonclinical studies were conducted in a small number of healthy animals and may not be reflective of the experience in humans with T2D. Similarly, clinical pharmacology studies involved small numbers of usually young, healthy individuals or a small number of patients with T2D (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;40) without known CVD and were conducted over a short period of time (2&#x000a0;weeks or less). While the findings of these nonclinical and clinical pharmacology studies are consistent in showing no evidence of CV harm overall and specifically no evidence of a signal suggestive of heart failure risk, these studies were not designed to assess heart failure as an end point.</p><p id="Par91">The data presented here, as well as results from other studies of saxagliptin specifically and DPP-4 inhibitors in general, provide reassurance of the CV safety of saxagliptin treatment in patients with T2D and the drug class overall. As many patients require more than one antiglycaemic therapy to achieve glycaemic control, the use of a combination of glucose-lowering medications with different mechanisms of action is a key therapeutic strategy as long as there are no safety implications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For example, the combined use of saxagliptin with the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor dapagliflozin has been demonstrated to be more effective than using either agent alone in patients with T2D receiving metformin therapy who have inadequate glycaemic control, without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Despite the availability of multiple antidiabetes agents to help achieve and maintain glycaemic control, options are still limited among patients with diabetes who often also have renal dysfunction. In particular, the use of metformin and SGLT-2 inhibitors may not be options for patients with significant renal disease, while saxagliptin at a reduced dose of 2.5&#x000a0;mg can be used even in patients with severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Saxagliptin has a well-established safety profile, with a low risk of hypoglycaemia and weight neutrality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Therefore, the risks and benefits of saxagliptin should be weighed when considering saxagliptin for patients with known risk factors for heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par92">The results of nonclinical and clinical pharmacology studies did not identify any evidence of myocardial injury and/or CV harm associated with saxagliptin use that may have predicted or may explain the unexpected imbalance in the rate of hHF observed in SAVOR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec25"><p>
