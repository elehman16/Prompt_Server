the eyes closed and eyes open on the joint position sense of chronic stroke patients.
[Subjects and Methods] Thirty patients with chronic stroke participated in this study.
Patients performed the timed up and go test and were assigned to one of two treadmill
training groups with and without visual deprivation. The treadmill gait training for each
group lasted 40 minutes, and sessions were held 3 times a week for 4 weeks. The knee joint
proprioception was measured using the Biodex System Pro 3 before and after the
intervention. [Results] The knee joint proprioception of the treadmill training with
blocked vision group showed more significant improvement after the treadmill training
sessions than that of the eyes open group. [Conclusion] This study demonstrated that
treadmill training with blocked vision may be useful for the proprioceptive sensory
rehabilitation of patients with chronic stroke.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Chronic stroke</kwd><kwd>Knee joint proprioception</kwd><kwd>Visual deprivation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Balance and gait problems require that stroke patients seek assistance from others and
decrease their quality of life<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Bonan et al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when stroke patients attempted
to maintain balance or to walk relying on visual information, they had to use a strategy to
compensate for their insufficient proprioceptive and vestibular senses. They also suggested
that excessive visual dependence may become a hindrance to the improvement of balance and
gait abilities<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recovering balance and
gait abilities is an important component of rehabilitation programs aiming to improve the
daily activities and quality of life of stroke patients. Such rehabilitation programs should
minimize excessive visual dependence and facilitate the proprioceptive and vestibular
functions of stroke patients<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Whereas normal adults use their visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive senses properly by
integrating them systematically, stroke patients control their postures by relying on visual
information, due to reduced interaction with sensory stimulation and weakened central
integration, instead of maintaining balance by selecting the appropriate sensations<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
When excessive visual dependence in stroke patients leads to information that contradicts
the somatic sensations in the lower limbs, the conflicting afferent information may cause
confusion in terms of central sensory integration<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Methods to enhance the postural control abilities of stroke
patients include blocking visual information<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, using treadmills<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, and providing weight support with visual feedback on a
force platform<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Treadmill gait training
can provide stroke patients with continuous visual and proprioceptive information for
control of posture and maintenance of balance. Therefore, it has the advantage of
facilitating gait abilities through integration of sensory and motor control in stroke
patients<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kim and Krebs<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that treadmill training with
visual feedback for stroke patients improved their postural control abilities by
facilitating motor learning, whereas treadmill training with distorted visual feedback had
negative effects on gait symmetry. In contrast, Zanetti and Schieppati<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that treadmill training with visual feedback
blocked was effective at improving gait ability through the improvement of postural control
elicited by enhancing proprioceptive and vestibular sensations during visual
restriction.</p><p>A number of previous studies have reported that blocking visual information during gait
training using treadmills is effective at recovering the balance and gait abilities of
stroke patients. However, few studies have examined changes in proprioceptive sensation of
the knee joint in stroke patients. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify the
effects of treadmill gait training with and without blocked vision on the perception of knee
joint position of stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The subjects in this study were 30 stroke patients who were undergoing comprehensive

This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki, and the local research ethics committee approved the study protocol. The
subjects were given a detailed explanation of the study procedure by the researcher before
providing their informed consent to participation in this study. The subjects were
recruited using the following criteria: subjects who had experienced hemiplegia at least
12 months prior; subjects who were able to perform independent standing and treadmill
walking without an aid; and subjects who scored at least 24 points in the Korean version
of the Mini-Mental State Examination, indicating an ability to understand and follow the

similar levels of dynamic balance were placed into the two groups using the matching
method. Isokinetic equipment (Biodex System Pro 3&#x0201a; Biodex Medical System, Inc.&#x0201a; NY&#x0201a; USA)
was used for the joint position sense test.</p><p>Both groups received traditional physical therapy and then performed three sets of
treadmill gait training lasting for 10&#x02005;min per set using Gait Trainer 2. Gait training was
performed three times a week for 4 weeks. The subjects were given a 5-minute break after
each set of exercise to prevent fatigue. Subjects were also allowed to discontinue gait
training at anytime while training. Subjects in the TEC group were instructed to perform
treadmill gait training with their vision blocked by an eye cover, following the method
suggested by Zanetti and Schieppati<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The TEO group performed treadmill gait training with their eyes open. For the treadmill
gait training, each subject was instructed to stand in the middle of a stopped treadmill
in a comfortable manner and to wear a harness that would prevent falls while not
disturbing the gait training. Each subject&#x02019;s gait velocity was gradually increased until
the maximum speed at which the subject could maintain comfortable walking was reached.</p><p>Knee joint proprioception is commonly used to assess passive joint position sense
(PJPS)<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The PJPS test was conducted without prior practice to exclude
testing effects resulting from familiarity with the measuring equipment. The PJPS test
required subjects to reproduce a target angle, and the difference between the measured
angle and the target angle was calculated. Smaller values were assessed as good joint
position sense<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. To assure the
accuracy of these measurements, subjects wore an eye cover and earplugs to prevent input
of visual and auditory information. For the PJPS test, the target joint angle was 45&#x000b0; knee
flexion. The subjects were instructed to stop for 10 sec and perceive the target joint
angle position in advance. The starting angle of the PJPS test was 90&#x000b0; knee flexion, and
during passive extension of the knee joint at an angular velocity of 2&#x000b0;/s, each subject
was instructed to press a stop button when he or she recognized the target angle. The PJPS
test was conducted three consecutive times, and the average of the three measured values
was calculated as the value for the subject&#x02019;s joint position sense. The test-retest
reliability of the PJPS test in the sitting position has been reported to have an
ICC=0.82<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Mann-Whitney U-test, the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>-test, and the independent t-test were used
before the experiment to assess differences in the general and medical characteristics of
the two groups. To examine differences within each group before and after training, the
paired t-test was used, and the independent t-test was used to examine differences in the
differential PJPS scores between the two groups. IBM SPSS (version 20.0) was used for
statistical data processing with a statistical significance level of 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>During the experiment, three patients in the TEC group and four patients in the TEO group

on the joint position sense of stroke patients. Proprioception is an essential element in
the prior perception of information in various movements, joint position sense, and muscle
contraction<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The distortion of
proprioception results in unstable posture due to confused sensory input in a standing
position<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Westlake and Culham<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> trained elderly
people aged &#x02265;65&#x02005;years of age to activate their somatosensory system at optimal levels using
various changes in sensory conditions. They reported that the experimental group showed a
significantly higher level of postural stability than the control group. They suggested that
this result was due to the various types of sensory training promoting somatosensory
activation which improved postural stability. In particular, they reported that the
vibration sense of muscles is important for the perception of muscle length. The present
study showed a significant difference in changes in knee PJPS between the two groups after
treadmill gait training. In addition, the pre-post comparison within each group showed that
both groups had significantly improved PJPS scores after the intervention. The reason for
the change in PJPS in the TEC group, whose vision was blocked, may have been treadmill gait
training facilitated somatosensory and vestibular sensory input, thereby improving
proprioception. Bonan et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> measured
the amount of postural sway according to three types of sensory information to identify the
effects of vision, proprioception, and vestibular sense on balance maintenance by stroke
patients. Their results suggest that visual, proprioceptive, and vestibular information are
important in balance maintenance. Our study results agree with those of previous studies
reporting that blocking visual information elicits the use of the proprioceptive and
vestibular senses. Our study also revealed that the selection of proper sensory information
and training is required for the functional recovery of stroke patients. Treadmill gait
training was performed in this study while encouraging the subjects to maintain postural
control, motor learning, and symmetric weight support. These processes may have enhanced
knee joint proprioception by properly integrating somatosensory, vestibular, and visual
stimulation, all of which are necessary for postural control.</p><p>The present study had some limitations. First, the number of subjects was insufficient for
the generalization of the results to all patients with stroke. Second, during the gait
training, the Velcro harness did not support the patients&#x02019; trunk firmly. Therefore, further
studies are required to verify the effects of vision-blocked treadmill gait training on
PJPS, balance, gait, and various functions of stroke patients addressing the present study&#x02019;s
limitations.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Hesse</surname><given-names>SA</given-names></name><name><surname>Jahnke</surname><given-names>MT</given-names></name><name><surname>Bertelt</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Gait outcome in ambulatory hemiparetic patients after a
