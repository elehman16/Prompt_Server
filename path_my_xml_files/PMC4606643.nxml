Extrinsic erosion is the result of exogenous acids. One of the extrinsic causes of dental erosion is excessive consumption of carbonated beverages, fruit juices, high-energy drinks, and candies. Most of the carbonated drinks, noncarbonated drinks, sports drinks, and medicated syrups have a low pH rendering them acidic in nature. Studies reporting the frequency of ingestion of soft drinks and other low pH beverages have shown increased potential in the formation of the dental erosive lesion.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Soft drink consumption has increased dramatically over the past 50 years. In this era, a growing trend toward increased consumption of canned juices, sports drinks, and high-energy beverages has been seen among adolescents.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The commercial sale of soft drinks has increased by 56% over the last 10 years and now it is estimated that it will keep rising at about 2&#x02013;3% a year.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] It has been recognized as an important cause of tooth loss not only in adults but also in children. Children with chronic diseases often require long-term drug regimens. Several medicines can alter plaque composition and oral pH being potentially harmful to the teeth.</p><p>The solubility of enamel is pH dependent, and the rate at which apatite precipitates depends on certain factors like calcium binding in saliva. Since the critical pH of enamel is approximately 5.5, any solution with a lower pH may cause erosion, particularly if the attack is lengthy and intermittent over time. The total acid level (titratable acidity) of acidic drinks is considered to be more important than the pH alone as it determines the concentration of damaging hydrogen ions available to interact with the tooth surface.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>In the erosive lesions of the tooth, the coronal margins of restoration are usually in enamel while the cervical margins are in dentin and cementum. Erosion of enamel may also cause micro leakage between restoration and hard tissue of the tooth. Subsequent erosion poses special challenges to the dentist for their restorations.</p><p>Considering the erosive potential of various beverages and medicated syrups on dental enamel, a study was designed to evaluate the erosive potential of carbonated drink, noncarbonated drink, high-energy sports drink, medicated syrup and distilled water, and their effects on enamel surface and on the restoration of teeth.</p><sec disp-level="2" id="sec2-1"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>The study was conducted in the Department of Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry, Ahmedabad Dental College and Hospital with an aim to determine erosive potential of commonly used beverages: Carbonated beverage, noncarbonated beverage, high-energy sports drink, medicated cough syrup, and control (distilled water).</p><p>Their effect on dental enamel with following objectives;</p><p>

Dietary erosion may result from food or drinks containing a variety of acidic ingredients.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Children and adolescents consume significant amounts of erosive beverages and, therefore, their risk of developing dental erosion is high. Soft drink intake in children is greater than in adults but has a huge individual variation.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Carbonated and noncarbonated beverages have a low pH, are sweetened by highly refined carbohydrates (sugar and/or sugar substitute components) that are metabolized by plaque microorganisms forming organic acids, and also contain additional additives, all of which can contribute to the demineralization effect and erosive potential of dental hard tissues (enamel).[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, the test media selected were the commonly consumed beverages; carbonated beverage, noncarbonated beverage, high-energy sports drink, medicated syrup for respiratory tract infection for children in Indian market, and distilled water as control. As it would be unethical to create actual erosive lesions in patients, the erosive potential of these test media was evaluated in an <italic>in vitro</italic> study design.</p><p>Two ways to quantify the acid content of a foodstuff or beverage include pH and total or titratable acidity. The pH or actual acidity is the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration (actual hydrogen ion concentration) and is measured on a scale of 0 to 14 with a reading below 7 indicating an acid content or environment. Neutralizable acidity is the total number of acid molecules, both protonated and nonprotonated and determines the actual hydrogen ion availability for interaction with the tooth surface. Beverages with lower pH values have greater erosive effect; However the neutralizable acidity level may be a more realistic and accurate method for measuring the potential acidity in a given beverage.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>The present study showed that high-energy sports drink needed the most base (17.50 ml) to neutralize it thereby having greater erosive potential than the carbonated and the other noncarbonated beverage. This was quite similar to the findings of other studies by Jensdottir <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006; Bamaise <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007; Touyz 1994.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The most common type of acid used in sports drinks is citric acid, which has greater erosive potential.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Actually citric acids and/or citrates are added as buffering and flavoring agents, but they can concurrently bind to calcium and phosphorus thereby promoting increased titratable acidity levels.</p><p>The medicated syrup contains diphenhydramine hydrochloride, ammonium chloride, sodium citrate, menthol, and ethanol. As mentioned by Maganur that a larger quantity of citric acid is added in the form of sodium citrate to mask the unpleasant taste of medication, which adversely affects medicine.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Furthermore, diphenhydramine hydrochloride and ethanol may contribute for its increased neutralizable acidity. Similarly, different concentration of acid may be the reason for different neutralizable acidity in a high-energy sports drink and medicated syrup.</p><p>Quantitative (profilometer) analysis was performed verifying the erosive potential of all test medias. Arithmetic average roughness has been conventionally evaluated on enamel as an indicator of acid erosion using the contact stylus surface profilometry and the most frequently reported surface roughness parameter in the dental literature.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Ra value in present study significant differences was exhibited between different beverages.</p><p>At baseline, the mean surface roughness values ranged between 0.986 and 1.620 with no significant inter-group difference was present. In case, of high-energy sports drink study shows significant posttreatment Ra value (8.305) as compared to baseline Ra values (1.620). It contains sodium citrate (sodium salt of citric acid), which is added as buffering and flavoring agents; these additions can concurrently bind to calcium, promoting increased erosion potential.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Study by Tahmassebi <italic>et al.</italic>, Edwards <italic>et al.</italic>, Duggal and Curzon have reported that beverages containing citric acid have shown an increased potential for the dissolution of hydroxyapatite due to the formation of calcium citrate by the chelating (calcium binding) action of citric acid that withdraws Ca ions from the beverage, resulting in an increased dissolution tendency.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Its posttreatment Ra values are significant higher compared to other test media.</p><p>In case, of noncarbonated beverages, there was significant posttreatment Ra value (6.630) as compared to baseline (1.450) after the test period of 14 days. These findings could be due to the presence of mango pulp, sugar, citric acid, ascorbic acid, salts, anti-oxidants which are responsible for the erosive potential of noncarbonated beverage.</p><p>The present study shows a significant increase in Ra value (3.533) as compared to baseline (1.485) after the test period of 14 days in case of carbonated beverages. The carbonated beverage despite having the lowest pH on opening was easy to neutralize than the high-energy sports drink, noncarbonated beverage, and medicated syrup. The carbonated beverage contains inorganic acids such as phosphoric acid to stimulate taste and counteract the sweetness. Edward <italic>et al.</italic> reported that even when the carbon dioxide has been blown off, and the drinks have become &#x0201c;flat&#x0201d; still the pH remains low.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] This indicates that soft drinks have inherent acidity due to other acids that are added to stimulate taste and counter sweetness. Carbonated beverages contain carbonic acid formed by carbon dioxide in solution that is, carbonated. Carbonic acid is present in the carbonated beverage; it acts as a mild acid and does not readily bind with cations and forms chelate. As mentioned earlier, beverages containing citric acid have shown an increased potential for the dissolution of hydroxyapatite due to the formation of calcium citrate and the chelating (calcium binding) action of citric acid.</p><p>The present study shows a significant increase in Ra value (2.9825) as compared to baseline (1.485) after the test period of 14 days in case of medicated syrup. A long term use of sugar containing drugs has been considered a cause of dental caries in children.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] As the sugar content in liquid medication tend to dissolve enamel quickly when they remain for a longer time. This contributes toward the increase in surface roughness (Ra) value. For medicated syrup, this could be related to chelation. Chelation is independent of pH of the medium so that removal of such metallic ions as calcium from even a biological calcium phosphorous system may occur at a neutral or even alkaline pH.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Besides, the acid components found in such medications, other factors such as high frequency of ingestion (two of more times a day), bedtime consumption, high viscosity, presence of ingredients such as hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, stearic acid, and titanium dioxide may contribute to the increase in the Ra values.</p><p>The erosive effect of these beverages causes loss of minerals from teeth surface and restoration.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Long term use of these beverages cause adverse effect leading to microleakage in between tooth and restoration, which ultimately lead to restoration failure or secondary caries. When the microleakage scores were evaluated, the results obtained for microleakage are as follows: High-energy sports drink 3.05 &#x0003e;carbonated beverage had 2.90, &#x0003e;noncarbonated beverage it was 1.80, &#x0003e;medicated syrup 1.30, &#x0003e;for distilled water the score was 0.20.</p><p>The samples placed in high-energy sports drinks showed significantly higher microleakage scores compared to the noncarbonated beverage, medicated syrup, and distilled water. This could be due to the higher degree of erosion between restoration and tooth surface. This correlates with the highest surface roughness values obtained in this group. Carbonated beverages had shown significant higher microleakage score compared to noncarbonated beverages, medicated syrup, and distilled water. This finding was similar to study by Maganur <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Surface roughness value of noncarbonated beverage is higher compared to carbonated beverages. The main reason was higher surface roughness that is, the higher erosive potential for the enamel of noncarbonated beverages, but microleakage is lower than a carbonated beverage. This shows a lesser erosive effect of noncarbonated beverage on tooth and restoration interface. Among four test group least the microleakage score was found in medicated syrup, mainly because of significantly lower surface roughness values as compared to other test groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>From the present study, the following conclusion can be drawn:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Digital pH of all test media is as follows: Carbonated beverage &#x0003e; noncarbonated beverage &#x0003e; high-energy sports drink &#x0003e; medicated syrup &#x0003e; distilled water.

</p><p>However, it is inappropriate to extrapolate the findings of our study to the conditions existing <italic>in vivo</italic> in humans. In the oral cavity, any drink or foodstuff will be instantaneously mixed with saliva with a subsequent rise in its pH. After consuming a low pH drink, the pH on the tongue stays low only for a short duration. A possible limitation of this study would include a small sample size. The group size was determined to be small enough to facilitate the logistics of the experimental design, yet large enough to demonstrate significant differences statistically. This study attempted to identify which drinks were the most aggressive toward enamel using quantitative analysis and explore and/or confirm the possible reasons for the erosive effect of these beverages.</p><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by the MSME Tool Room, Indo German Tool Room, Ahmedabad and by Chemistry Department, School of Sciences, Gujarat University, Ahmedabad.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Imfeld</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Dental erosion.
