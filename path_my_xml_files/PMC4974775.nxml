The aim was to improve knowledge on healthy diet and lifestyle in GDM. Evaluation of the intervention explored women&#x02019;s knowledge and understanding of GDM, healthy diet, healthy food, and healthy lifestyle, after using the web-based program compared to women receiving standard clinic-based GDM education.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 116 women, aged 18&#x02013;45 years old, newly diagnosed with GDM, participated (Intervention (<italic>n</italic>)&#x02009;=&#x02009;56 and control (<italic>n</italic>)&#x02009;=&#x02009;60). Women were randomly allocated to the intervention or control groups and both groups attended a standard GDM education class. Group 1(Intervention) additionally used an online touch screen/computer program. All women completed a questionnaire following the computer program and/or the education class. All questions evaluating levels of knowledge had more than one correct answer and scores were graded from 0 to 1, with each correct component receiving a score, eg. 0.25 per each correct answer in a 4 answer question. Chi-square test was performed to compare the two groups regarding knowledge of GDM.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Findings indicated that the majority of women in the intervention group reported correct answers for &#x0201c;types of carbohydrate foods&#x0201d; for pregnant women with GDM, compared to the control group (62.5&#x000a0;% vs 58.3&#x000a0;%, respectively). Most women in both groups had an excellent understanding of &#x0201c;fruits and vegetables&#x0201d; (98.2&#x000a0;% vs 98.3&#x000a0;%), and the majority of women in the intervention group understood that they should exercise daily for 30&#x000a0;min, compared to the control group (92.9&#x000a0;% vs 91.7&#x000a0;%). Both groups had a good understanding across all categories, however, the majority of women in the intervention group scored all correct answers (score&#x02009;=&#x02009;1) in term of foetal effects (17.9&#x000a0;% vs 13.3&#x000a0;%, respectively), maternal predictors (5.4&#x000a0;% vs 5&#x000a0;%), care requirements (39.3&#x000a0;% vs 23.3&#x000a0;%), GDM perceptions (48.2&#x000a0;% vs 46.7&#x000a0;%) and GDM treatment (67.9&#x000a0;% vs 61.7&#x000a0;%), compared to women in the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The study suggested that both approaches, standard education and standard education plus web-based program, resulted in excellent knowledge scores, but not statistically significant difference between groups. Multiple and immediate access to the web-based education program at home may prove useful as a source of reference for women with GDM. Future study comparing results pre and post intervention is needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anzctr.org.au/TrialSearch.aspx?searchTxt=ACTRN12615000697583&#x00026;isBasic=True">ACTRN12615000697583</ext-link>; Date registered: 03/07/2015; Retrospectively registered.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12884-016-0996-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Gestational diabetes mellitus</kwd><kwd>Knowledge</kwd><kwd>Understanding</kwd><kwd>Food choice</kwd><kwd>Management</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001047</institution-id><institution>Ian Potter Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201200017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carolan-Olah</surname><given-names>Mary</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Knowledge is considered as a significant component of health literacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Poor health literacy is associated with limited understanding of disease and may result in limited knowledge of disease management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Recent studies have reported that many women misunderstand gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), with women reporting that GDM only affects them during pregnancy, and that once the baby is born the complication is no longer a health threat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Although GDM usually resolves postpartum, there are long term consequences of obesity and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) following diagnosis of GDM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. There is also strong evidence indicating that promoting healthy lifestyle habits such as weight loss, exercise, and healthy diet will reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, follow up doctor appointments, and postpartum Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), are important for early diagnosis and prevention of type 2 DM in women with GDM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Nowadays, the internet has become a very popular source of health information for pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Many women utilise the internet as a primary resource for information about pregnancy, and as a means to help them deal with concerns, or to navigate pregnancy-related decisions, and to improve knowledge about pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This popularity may relate to advantages, such as immediate access, usually at home, which avoids travel and is cost saving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Pregnant women with GDM are one such group of users. The present study introduced a web-based education program for women with GDM which aimed to support GDM education and self-management. The program was developed in close cooperation with potential users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and is based on national guidelines for diabetes care.</p><p>Finally, although a number of studies have reported on knowledge evaluation among women with type 1 and type 2 DM, literature related to knowledge evaluation among women with GDM is limited, and no studies were located which used a web-based educational intervention to improve the knowledge about GDM. For these reasons, this study focused on evaluating knowledge of GDM, self-management, healthy diet, exercise, and lifestyle habits.</p><p>The aim of this study was to explore whether or not the knowledge/understanding of GDM could be improved by introducing this additional web-based education compared to standard GDM education alone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This study was a randomised controlled trial (RCT) study comparing two groups of participants.

Access to the web-based education intervention (A touch screen computer) took place at the Maternity diabetes clinic at Western Health Sunshine Hospital, supervised by the researcher. The program provided information on healthy diet and healthy lifestyle and included pictures and simple instructions. The program took 15&#x02013;30 min to complete. Women were also given the URL link for the website, so they could access the website as they wished at home.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Control group</title><p>Women in the control group attended the standard clinic-based education class alone. The single, group education class, lasting 1.5&#x000a0;h, is run by Western Health&#x02019;s dieticians and diabetes educator nurses. Generally 5&#x02013;8 newly diagnosed pregnant women with GDM attend. Session and content is based on healthy diet, exercise, healthy lifestyle, and blood glucose level monitoring.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study tools and measurement</title><p>A structured questionnaire and a web-based educational intervention/touch screen computer were used in this study.</p><sec id="FPar3"><title>Questionnaire</title><p>The questionnaire included health questionnaires developed/adapted by the authors and used in previous studies of Australian women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], which included demographic information, health, knowledge of GDM, knowledge of testing blood glucose level, knowledge of food choice and self-managing GDM. The Diabetes Knowledge Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] was specifically adapted to focus on pregnancy and GDM, and used in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] to assess knowledge about GDM. Most questions had one correct answer and were scored as correct/incorrect. (eg, &#x0201c;in uncontrolled diabetes the blood sugar is: (a) Normal; (b). Increased; and (c). Decreased&#x0201d;. The correct answer is <italic>b. increased</italic>) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Questions evaluating levels of knowledge had more than one correct answer (eg, &#x0201c;Because I have gestational diabetes, my baby may be: (a). Larger than usual; (b). Smaller than usual; (c).

The website was developed and tested prior to this study and was described in our previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The four modules covered: (1) healthy food choices, (2) healthy habits/healthy lifestyle, (3) emotions, family and food, and (4) testing blood glucose level. The four information resources were: (1) What is gestational diabetes?, (2) Healthy eating and exercise in GDM, (3) What to do if you&#x02019;re still hungry?, and (4) A guide to healthy shopping.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Women, who met the study criteria, were recruited from the Maternity Diabetes Clinic.

Written consent was obtained prior to participation. Women in the intervention group were invited to complete a questionnaire after they had finished the standard education class plus web-based education. Meanwhile, the control group were invited to complete a questionnaire once they had finished the standard education class at the hospital.

Most of these websites provide static content and are difficult to understand. The present study introduced a web-based education that provides GDM educational information with pictures and simple structures, and convenient ways for self-learning. This study estimated knowledge levels of women who used the web-based education intervention in addition to the standard education class, compared to women who attended the standard education class alone. It also sought to understand if the web-based education was a useful support and additional source of information for women newly diagnosed with GDM. The overall findings of this study indicated that both groups of participants had a good understanding of GDM, food choices, exercise during pregnancy and GDM management. The most probable reason for this finding is that all participants in the intervention group completed the questionnaire following the use of the website and attended the GDM education class before answering questionnaires, and all participants in the control group also completed the questionnaire after they attended the GDM class. Therefore, the information that the women had received from the internet and the class may improve their knowledge about GDM. Future research involving a comparison between pre and post intervention knowledge for both the website and education class would help to clarify this point.</p><p>Although both groups of participants had a good understanding across all categories, the majority of women in the intervention group reported excellent understanding of GDM in term of foetal effects, maternal predictions, care requirements, GDM predictions and GDM treatment compared to women in the control group (score =1) (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This finding suggests that our current online education program does not make an immediate impact on women&#x02019;s knowledge by improving their understanding of GDM. However, the program has potential as a support for the current education approach, and may need some revision to fill this potential. The literature supports this potential as Moore et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], who studied an internet-based nutrition education program and explored its effect on weight, blood pressure, and eating habits after 12&#x000a0;months of participation. They found the effectiveness of online programs for health, delivered via the Internet, can provide benefits to large numbers of subjects at low cost and may help address the nutritional public health crisis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Similarly, the present web-based education intervention can be used as a source of information for women with GDM.</p><p>In addition, another objective of this study was to estimate how much women understand healthy diet/ healthy food and healthy lifestyle following the use of a web-based education compared to women with a standard clinic-based education. The findings indicated that both groups of participants had an excellent understanding of healthy diet and food choices, except one question regarding types of carbohydrate food. This question was answered correctly by the majority of women in the intervention, compared to the control group. The possible reason for this finding is that the information on the online educational website may be easier to understand compared to the education class. As our online education uses pictures of food choices, healthy diet, appropriate portions, healthy lifestyle and exercise, and also simple instructions describing what are healthy diets, food portions, and healthy lifestyle. The present findings are supported by number of studies using web-based nutrition education programs for weight management which confirm that e-learning education/web-based education improves knowledge and promotes behaviours associated with weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Other key findings indicated that the poorest knowledge levels were observed for a question on &#x0201c;how hard can they exercise during pregnancy?&#x0201d; with most women in both groups reporting incorrect answers. Most women understood that they should only do gentle exercise during pregnancy. Although the web-based education and class education provided all the necessary information to answer the questions, many women did not assimilate this information. The possible reason for this finding may be the level of education that women in this study had completed, as the majority of women in both groups had lower than average education levels. Women with primary education had the lowest knowledge scores, whereas, women who had bachelor degree/post graduate degree level education showed highest knowledge scores (score =1). Poor knowledge seemed to be associated with lower education level. This finding is supported by a recent study on evaluation of knowledge of GDM among Malaysian women, which found that educational level was a strong influencing factor for level of knowledge across all knowledge domains. This study similarly found poorest knowledge of GDM among women with lower education levels and highest scores in women with higher educational levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, women with lower education level might experience barriers in understanding the web-based education and may have difficulty communicating with diabetes educators and dieticians. The findings from this study confirmed previous research outcomes that showed the education had a strong impact on health literacy. Low educational level leads to low health literacy which results in limited knowledge about conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Participants with low health literacy may have difficulty understanding patient-orientated health literature, medication instructions, appointment cards from clinic and hospital signage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p>Finally, the present study found that one question regarding &#x0201c;where to prick the fingers for testing blood glucose level?&#x0201d; - was answered incorrectly by nearly half of women in the intervention group compared to less than one third of women in the control group. A statistically significant difference was reported on questions regarding pricking fingers for testing blood glucose (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). The probable reason for this finding is that women were new to the website and may have misunderstood the question. However, although this study collected questionnaire information at one time only, women can access the website at home at any time, whereas, women in the control group attend the education class once only. These women may find a difficulty following a self-management plan after they attend the class, and this may increase the incidence of complications, and decrease coping skills. Similar concerns were raised in a study in Malaysian women where GDM participants reported poor knowledge and difficulties related to the management of GDM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Implications</title><p>Practice implication:</p><p>There is a need to translate the findings of this study into practice as our findings reveal a number of areas that require greater attention. In particular, the online education program/web-based needs to be improved, as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Providing clearer information on the amount of exercise during pregnancy,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Providing clearer information on pricking fingers for blood glucose test, and</p></list-item><list-item><p>Providing clearer information on the correct time for testing blood glucose levels.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Additionally, women with GDM should be able to attend the hospital education class more than once as some women displayed incorrect knowledge after a single class.</p><p>These improvements have the capacity to improve outcomes as better knowledge about GDM is associated with better management of GDM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Limitations</title><p>Although, the desirable aims of the study have been achieved, there are some limitations related to the study. This study was conducted in single centre so results of this study cannot be generalized.</p><p>The web-based education was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial comparing two groups of the women: (1) intervention group (women attended the clinic-based education class and additionally used the web-based education intervention) and (2) control group (women attended the clinic-based education class only). There was a limitation in the method of this study due to baseline information/pre-intervention was not collected. Future study comparing results pre- and post-intervention, or a study comparing standard education with web-based education is suggested.</p><p>The number of participants in the intervention group was smaller than the number in the control group. This was because it was difficult to recruit participants for the intervention group as the women have to complete the questionnaire after they have used the program, which was inconvenient for them to do at the maternity clinic. Some women partially completed the questionnaire or requested to complete the questionnaire at home and their data was not considered. Therefore, an online survey or reply-paid envelop is recommended for future studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Both groups of women had excellent results, and results were not significantly improved by the intervention, nonetheless the online educational program has potential to improve GDM education and may provide convenient ways for self-learning about GDM for women. Revision of the program to tailor it to the women&#x02019;s needs in terms of reinforcing information and key messages might be the way forward. Future study comparing results pre and post intervention is needed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>DM, diabetes mellitus; GDM, gestational diabetes mellitus; WH HREC, Western health human research committees</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec23"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12884_2016_996_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Results of Random Numbers by using a Random Number Generator.
