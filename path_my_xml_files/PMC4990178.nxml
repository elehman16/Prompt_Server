We have previously suggested clinical benefit from B-cell depletion using the monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab in a randomized and placebo-controlled study. Prolonged responses were then demonstrated in an open-label phase-II study with maintenance rituximab treatment. Using blood samples from patients in the previous two clinical trials, we investigated quantitative changes in T-lymphocyte subsets, in immunoglobulins, and in serum levels of two B-cell regulating cytokines during follow-up. B-lymphocyte activating factor of the tumor necrosis family (BAFF) in baseline serum samples was elevated in 70 ME/CFS patients as compared to 56 healthy controls (p = 0.011). There were no significant differences in baseline serum BAFF levels between patients with mild, moderate, or severe ME/CFS, or between responders and non-responders to rituximab. A proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) serum levels were not significantly different in ME/CFS patients compared to healthy controls at baseline, and no changes in serum levels were seen during follow-up. Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood T-lymphocyte subsets and T-cell activation markers at multiple time points during follow-up showed no significant differences over time, between rituximab and placebo groups, or between responders and non-responders to rituximab. Baseline serum IgG levels were significantly lower in patients with subsequent response after rituximab therapy compared to non-responders (p = 0.03). In the maintenance study, slight but significant reductions in mean serum immunoglobulin levels were observed at 24 months compared to baseline; IgG 10.6&#x02013;9.5 g/L, IgA 1.8&#x02013;1.5 g/L, and IgM 0.97&#x02013;0.70 g/L. Although no functional assays were performed, the lack of significant associations of T- and NK-cell subset numbers with B-cell depletion, as well as the lack of associations to clinical responses, suggest that B-cell regulatory effects on T-cell or NK-cell subsets are not the main mechanisms for the observed improvements in ME/CFS symptoms observed in the two previous trials. The modest increase in serum BAFF levels at baseline may indicate an activated B-lymphocyte system in a subgroup of ME/CFS patients.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>The Kavli Foundation</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Associated Western Universities (US)Norway Regional Health Authority</institution></funding-source><award-id>911557</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Legal of Torstein Hereid</institution></funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This work has received financial support from The Kavli Foundation, and from Western Norway Health Authority grant no 911557, and also from the legacy of Torstein Hereid.

ME/CFS has a genetic predisposition [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], affects women 3&#x02013;4 times more often than men, and is often triggered by infections [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The disease is characterized by fatigue not alleviated by rest, post-exertional malaise, cognitive disturbances, muscle and joint pain, headache, sleep problems, hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli, and frequently a range of other symptoms related to the immune and autonomic systems [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There is a growing interest in the role of the immune system in the etiology of ME/CFS. Abnormalities of cytokine levels and lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood have been observed [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>In a pilot case series [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], followed by a phase II randomized and placebo-controlled trial (KTS-1-2008) [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], we found that B-cell depletion using the monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab was associated with clinical improvement in a subgroup of ME/CFS patients. In a subsequent open-label phase II trial (KTS-2-2010) using rituximab induction and maintenance to prolong the B-cell depletion period, prolonged clinical response durations were observed [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Thus, based on observations from those two clinical trials, with a lag time of minimum two and up to eight months from initial B-cell depletion until start of clinical responses, we hypothesized that ME/CFS in a subgroup of patients could be an immunological disease, possibly involving B-cells and antibodies (long half-life) for the symptom maintenance. Further arguments supporting this hypothesis are a high occurrence of autoimmunity among first-degree relatives of patients in the previous two clinical studies [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], a modest but significantly increased risk of B-cell lymphomas among elderly ME/CFS patients suggesting a chronically activated B-cell system [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], a female preponderance of ME/CFS as shown in established autoimmune diseases, and the often abrupt start of ME/CFS after infections. Also, emerging data from the partly overlapping syndrome Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) has suggested an immunological disease mechanism. POTS is a frequent finding among ME/CFS patients. One study of 59 patients with ME/CFS showed POTS in 27% (defined as a heart rate increase &#x0003e;30, or heart rate 120) upon standing 10 min [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], another study have shown POTS frequency in 13% of ME/CFS patients [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. An autoimmune pathogenesis for POTS has been suggested, demonstrating functional autoantibodies to adrenergic receptors with specific binding of autoantibody-positive POTS sera to &#x003b2;1-adrenergic receptor, &#x003b2;2-adrenergic receptor, and &#x003b1;1-adrenergic receptor in transfected cells [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In a recent editorial [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], POTS was suggested to belong to the group of autoimmune diseases. Interestingly, elevated serum levels of some of the same autoantibodies have recently been described also in ME/CFS [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] showing that 29.5% of patients with CFS had elevated antibodies against one or more of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and beta-adrenergic receptors.</p><p>The mechanisms by which B-lymphocyte depletion results in clinical responses in a subgroup of ME/CFS patients are currently unknown. In the present study, we used blood and serum samples from patients included in the two mentioned clinical studies KTS-1-2008 and KTS-2-2010, and from healthy controls, to investigate possible associations between the parameters investigated and clinical data such as ME/CFS patients vs healthy controls, mild versus moderate versus severe ME/CFS, and response versus no response after B-cell depletion therapy. The clinical data including inclusion criteria, primary and secondary endpoints, clinical assessments, response characterizations during follow-up (for 12 months in KTS-1-2008, and 36 months in KTS-2-2010) have been described [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and are not repeated in this manuscript. Therefore, we refer only to clinical response status (clinical response versus no response) and the ME/CFS severities (mild, moderate, severe).</p><p>Because previous experiences from the clinical trials using rituximab therapy suggested that B-cells might be implicated in the pathogenesis for a subgroup of patients, we focused on the B-cell survival factors BAFF and APRIL.</p><p>BAFF is a cytokine produced mainly by innate immune cells, but also by stromal cells and epithelial cells in the gut and airways amongst others. The transmembrane protein can be cleaved to a soluble form and bind to its receptors BAFF receptor (BAFF-R), transmembrane activator-calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI), and B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), found on different types of B-cells, and to some extent on other immune cells such as T-cells [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>APRIL is a homologue of BAFF, which also signals through the TACI and BCMA receptors. These cytokines have largely overlapping functions in B-cell maturation, survival and homeostasis, immunoglobulin class switching, maintenance of germinal centres, T-dependent and -independent antibody responses, and in T-cell activation and co-stimulation [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. High BAFF levels during B-cell maturation promote survival at the expense of B-cell tolerance and may thus lead to the survival of low affinity self-reactive B-cells. Increased BAFF serum levels have been reported in autoimmune diseases, allergic asthma and lymphoid malignancy [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The cytokines BAFF and APRIL, acting as proliferation factors for B-lymphocytes regulating maturation and cell numbers [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], were analysed through follow-up. The baseline BAFF and APRIL cytokine levels in ME/CFS patients were also compared to healthy controls.</p><p>As B-cells are both regulated by, and are regulators of, other lymphocyte subsets, including NK-cells and T-cells, we immunophenotyped lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood during follow-up in the previous two clinical trials. Changes in serum immunoglobulin levels following B-cell depletion, from baseline to 24 months follow-up, were investigated in patients participating in the KTS-2-1010 study with rituximab maintenance treatment, to assess the extent of reductions and thus possible risks of developing hypogammaglobulinemia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Patient Inclusion and Treatment Protocols</title><p>A total of 70 ME/CFS patients were available for baseline BAFF analyses, including 38 patients participating in the previous rituximab clinical trials who had repeated blood samples through follow-up. For the remaining 32 other ME/CFS patients, only baseline blood samples were available. The KTS-1-2008 trial (NCT00848692) included 30 ME/CFS patients, 15 in the rituximab group and 15 in the placebo group [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In the open-label phase-II trial KTS-2-2010 (NCT01156909) exploring rituximab induction followed by maintenance, 29 patients participated, including two pilot patients, 9 patients from the placebo group in KTS-1-2008, and 9 patients given rituximab in the KTS-1-2008 study having either clinical response and subsequent relapse (n = 6), or no response (n = 3) [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In both KTS-1-2008 and KTS-2-2010, patients were included according to Fukuda criteria [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], however, all but two patients also met the Canadian criteria for ME/CFS [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Summarized, approximately 60% of rituximab-treated patients experienced clinical response in these two clinical trials, and in the KTS-2-2010 study maintenance rituximab therapy with prolonged B-cell depletion period was associated with prolonged response durations. Among 18 responders in the KTS-2-2010 study, mean response duration was 97 weeks within the 156 weeks study period, and with 11 patients still in remission at end of follow-up [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The 32 other ME/CFS patients included for baseline blood samples all fulfilled Canadian criteria.

In KTS-2-2010 a total of 28 (out of 29 included) patients received rituximab induction with two infusions two weeks apart. Thereafter additional maintenance rituximab infusions were given after 3, 6, 10 and 15 months (all 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, max 1000 mg) [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Treatment could be discontinued if no signs of clinical response were observed after 10 months follow-up, thus omitting the planned 10 and 15-months rituximab infusions. One patient in KTS-2-2010 had an allergic reaction at the end of the first rituximab infusion and did not receive further infusions. According to an approved amendment in the KTS-2-2010 trial, 7 patients in moderate response after 12 months follow-up with gradual but on-going symptom improvement (among 18 responders to rituximab according to predefined criteria) received additional rituximab treatment beyond 15 months follow-up with a range of 2&#x02013;5 extra infusions.

For analyses of serum BAFF and APRIL changes over time, and to avoid inter-plate variations, all time-point samples were run on the same plate as their respective baseline samples.

There were no significant differences between patients with clinical response versus no response during follow-up in the trials, for baseline levels of IgA, IgM, BAFF, CD19+, CD4+, or CD8+ (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec013"><title>Discussion</title><p>The randomized and placebo-controlled phase-II trial (KTS-1-2008) using the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab as a B-lymphocyte depleting intervention for ME/CFS, suggested clinical benefit on ME/CFS symptoms in a subgroup of patients [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The open-label phase-II study KTS-2-2010 [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] with rituximab maintenance treatment showed a similar response rate of approximately 60% of patients, and also showed that symptom alleviation could be prolonged with maintenance rituximab treatment. Although B-lymphocyte depletion in peripheral blood occurs within days after rituximab infusion, the responses had a lag time of at least two months and up to eight months, before the patients started to report clinical improvement. This pattern of responses led us to speculate as to whether there is an underlying immune dysfunction in a subgroup of ME/CFS patients, involving B-cells and antibodies, possibly a variant of an autoimmune process compatible with slow washout of antibodies preceding clinical responses. Alternatively, some other slow alteration in immune function governed by circulating B-cells could underlie the disease process. In order to gain further insight into the reason for the efficacy of rituximab in this subgroup of ME/CFS patients, we investigated if there were any changes in selected immune parameters during follow-up between the rituximab- and placebo group in the KTS-1-2008 trial, or between responders and non-responders in the KTS-2-2010 open-label trial with rituximab maintenance treatment.</p><p>Baseline serum BAFF level was significantly elevated in ME/CFS patients compared to healthy controls. We found no associations between baseline serum BAFF levels in patients with later clinical response after rituximab therapy versus non-responders, and no differences in baseline BAFF levels in ME/CFS patients of different clinical severity. BAFF acts as an important survival factor during B-cell maturation and functions in the regulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Excessive levels of BAFF during maturation causes B-cell hyperplasia and may promote autoimmunity due to enhanced survival of self-reactive B-cells, which are more dependent upon BAFF for survival than non-autoreactive B-cells [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In addition to emergence of autoreactive cells, high BAFF levels may enhance adaptive immune response through stimulating dendritic cell maturation [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Increased BAFF levels have been detected in several autoimmune diseases [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], primary Sj&#x000f6;gren&#x02019;s syndrome (pSS) [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and myasthenia gravis (MG) [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Recently, targeting BAFF has emerged as a therapeutic strategy in SLE [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and in RA where therapeutic effect was reported [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, increased BAFF level is not a prerequisite for an autoimmune disease [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and studies show that many patients with clinically active SLE and RA have normal BAFF levels. BAFF has also been implicated in additional pathologies, including cancer, allergy (asthma) and infection responses [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>In baseline samples from ME/CFS patients, there was no significant correlation between BAFF and total CD19+ B-cells, although the inverse relationship was evident after B-cell depletion. Although statistically significant, the difference in baseline serum BAFF levels was relatively modest in magnitude and there was a broad overlap between ME/CFS patients and healthy controls; thus, serum BAFF level is not suitable as a biomarker for the disease.</p><p>In both our clinical trials KTS-1-2008 and KTS-2-2010, the BAFF responses to B-cell depletion are in accordance with those previously reported in autoimmune diseases [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. We observed the expected increase in serum BAFF levels following B-cell depletion, with a subsequent gradual decline towards baseline levels. Thus, following rituximab-induced B-cell depletion in ME/CFS-patients, BAFF feedback in the B-cell survival system is as expected.</p><p>Contrary to our findings, in patients with SLE baseline elevated serum BAFF levels correlated positively with numbers of CD19+ B-cells [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. After B-cell depletion therapy, serum BAFF levels were higher at SLE relapse compared to disease flare prior to rituximab treatment. Further, serum BAFF correlated positively with anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, suggesting a role for BAFF driving SLE disease flares and that sequential B-cell depletion therapy could promote gradually increasing BAFF levels [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Transgenic mice overexpressing BAFF may develop a SLE-like disease, showing the importance of the BAFF cytokine in this disease [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Whether a similar mechanism could be operative after B-cell depletion therapy in ME/CFS may be investigated after un-blinding of the ongoing randomized, phase-III study in Norway with rituximab maintenance versus placebo (NCT02229942).</p><p>APRIL was not significantly influenced either by the ME/CFS disease itself (no difference in serum APRIL levels at baseline from healthy controls) or by the intervention (rituximab versus placebo). The APRIL cytokine plays a role later in B-cell development than BAFF [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A differential effect between BAFF and APRIL responses to rituximab has previously been observed [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and may be explained by the fact that while BAFF-R receptor is lost during B-cell depletion, TACI receptor (used by both BAFF and APRIL) remains on both plasma cells (lacking CD20 and therefore not depleted) and on activated B-cells [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Abnormalities in cytokine profiles have been reported in ME/CFS [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, the pattern of alterations reported varies between studies, among individuals, and over time for individual patients [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Other studies reported no consistent abnormalities in cytokine expression in ME/CFS patients as compared to healthy individuals [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A study investigating cytokine patterns in peripheral blood from ME/CFS patients [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], revealed abnormalities of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the first three years of the disease, which were not present later in the disease course. The same research group also reported a disturbed cytokine pattern in cerebrospinal fluid of ME/CFS patients, compared to healthy controls and multiple sclerosis patients, which could be consistent with an immune activation and a shift towards a Th-2 pattern [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>The demonstrated increase in serum BAFF levels may be consistent with an activated B-cell system in the ME/CFS patient group. The assumption that a subgroup of ME/CFS patients has a chronically activated B-lymphocyte system is strengthened by a population-based case-control study from the National Cancer Institute (US) [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In that study, among almost 1.2 million cancer cases in elderly and 100.000 elderly controls without cancer aged more than 65 years, with a prevalence of ME/CFS 0.5% in both groups, a significant association was found between ME/CFS and B-cell lymphomas [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and particularly for the low-grade marginal-zone lymphomas known for associations to either chronic infections or autoimmunity. The risk of lymphoma in elderly ME/CFS patients is not of concern to the individual patient, but is yet indicates a biological property of the disease.</p><p>An increased risk of B-cell lymphomas has also been reported in several established autoimmune diseases [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], such as SLE [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and for low-grade marginal-zone lymphomas in pSS [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>In our present data, we did not compare the flow cytometric data from ME/CFS patients to healthy controls, but rather focused on longitudinal changes during follow-up and associations to intervention. This is a limitation of the present data.</p><p>A recent study reported an increased proportion of CD3+, CD8+, and HLA-DR on CD8+ T-cells, and a lower percentage of CD19+ B-cells, among ME/CFS patients compared to healthy controls, but with no associations to ME/CFS severity or disease duration [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In both our clinical studies, T-cell numbers (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD56/16+) were in the normal ranges. Serial samples at multiple time-points during follow-up showed no significant differences over time, between patients treated with rituximab or placebo in the KTS-1-2008 study, or between responders and non-responders to B-cell depletion therapy in KTS-2-2010. Also, for patients in the KTS-1-2008 study, we found no significant differences in the T-cell activation parameters from repeated samples during follow-up, between patients in the rituximab- or placebo groups. The T-cell activation parameters assessed were CD278 (Inducible T-cell costimulator, ICOS) which function as immune checkpoint and belong to the CD28-superfamily, CD154 (CD40 ligand) which is a TNF superfamily molecule binding to CD40 on antigen-presenting cells, CD69 which is a C-type lectin expressed on activated T- and NK-cells, and the MHC class II surface receptor HLA-DR (on CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells).</p><p>Thus, even though B-cells readily interact with other cells of the immune system, we observed no significant changes in numbers of T-cells or NK-cells, or in T-cell activation parameters, after the B-cell depleting intervention, and this is in line with observations after rituximab treatment in RA patients [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>Reduced NK-cell function in ME/CFS patients has been reported in several studies [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In the present study, no NK-cell functional tests were performed. Only investigating quantitative aspects of lymphocyte subsets during follow-up, with no functional assays (e.g. for NK-cells) represents a limitation in the present study. Thus, we cannot exclude functional deficits in specific lymphocyte subsets at baseline or after intervention. We have investigated rather limited subgroups of T-lymphocyte subsets during follow-up. Therefore, other T-lymphocyte subpopulations not investigated in the current study may vary during rituximab treatment.</p><p>Studies of B-cell subsets in patients with ME/CFS have not revealed consistent and reproducible differences from healthy controls. A recent study reported increase in frequency and expression of CD24 on B-cells confined to IgD+ subsets, compared to healthy controls [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. One study on B-lymphocyte subsets in ME/CFS patients showed a higher percentage of na&#x000ef;ve and transitional B-cell subsets compared to healthy controls [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In contrast, another study showed decreased na&#x000ef;ve B-cells and increase in memory B-cells [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Another study reported no B-cell abnormalities, but T-cell and NK-cell abnormalities including increased levels of T-regulatory cells associated with ME/CFS versus healthy [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. T- and NK-cell abnormalities were also reported when comparing ME/CFS patients with moderate or severe disease versus healthy controls [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>The changes in serum immunoglobulin levels, from baseline to 24 months follow-up, after six rituximab infusions in most patients, were included to assess possible toxicity from hypogammaglobulinemia after rituximab maintenance treatment. Through 24 months follow-up, there were slight but significant decreases in IgG, IgA and IgM. The IgG immunoglobulin levels at 24-months were still well within the normal ranges, while the drop in IgM levels were more pronounced, some patients having levels decreased to below the normal range at 24-months. Should one extend the B-cell depletion periods further, a subgroup of patients will be expected to develop hypogammaglobulinemia with clinical risk for infections. However, selective preservation of specific antibodies (or autoantibodies), and reductions of others, may occur depending on whether the actual plasma cells express the CD20 antigen or not, as shown in a mouse model of RA demonstrating that rituximab specifically depleted short-lived autoreactive plasma cells [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p><p>Comparing baseline parameters between patients achieving clinical response after B-cell depletion or no response, we observed a significantly higher mean serum IgG level in non-responders compared to responders. A higher IgG level could reflect a nonspecific polyclonal B-cell activation. Previous reports in autoimmune diseases, especially RA, on associations between baseline immunoglobulin levels and subsequent response to B-cell depletion therapy vary. A study among RA patients having relapsed following prior disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs or TNF antagonists, reported higher IgG levels to be associated with non-response after rituximab therapy [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Contrary, serum IgG levels were above the upper normal value in a higher fraction of patients with refractory RA responding to rituximab treatment than among non-responders [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. A review article discussing predictive factors in RA, suggested that lower serum levels of interferon-&#x003b3; and of BAFF, presence of the Fc&#x003b3; receptor III genotype, the C/G-174 IL-6 polymorphism, or rheumatoid factor positivity, were associated with clinical response after rituximab therapy [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p><p>These possible association between low IgG level and clinical response after B-cell depletion therapy in ME/CFS reported here is uncertain due to the low number of patients, and will be analyzed after un-blinding of the ongoing randomized, double-blind phase-III study in Norway, with rituximab maintenance or placebo.</p><p>The data presented in this study cannot lend support to any specific disease mechanism. The clinical data from the previous trials evaluating B-cell depletion for ME/CFS [<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161226.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], indicates that a subgroup of ME/CFS patients has an immunological disease in which B-cells and possibly antibodies may be important for symptom maintenance. However, the present data neither strengthen nor weaken this hypothesis. Taken together, the data reported here do not support B-cell induced quantitative modifications of specific T-lymphocyte subsets or NK-cells as mechanisms for the observed clinical responses to B-cell depletion therapy in ME/CFS. Non-responders to rituximab treatment had higher baseline levels if serum IgG than responders. ME/CFS patients had increased baseline serum BAFF levels compared to healthy controls, which supports the presence of a chronically activated B-lymphocyte system.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful for the staff at the Laboratory for flowcytometry, Dept. of Transfusion Medicine and Immunology, Haukeland University Hospital, for skillful analyses of immunophenotyping from peripheral blood.
