Clinicians have limited face-to-face consultation time with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease patients, making it difficult to comprehensively address non-adherence. Here we share the results from a multi-centre (seven centres) randomised controlled trial conducted in England and Scotland to assess the impact of using a smartphone-based Parkinson&#x02019;s tracker app to promote patient self-management, enhance treatment adherence and quality of clinical consultation. Eligible Parkinson&#x02019;s disease patients were randomised using a 1:1 ratio according to a computer-generated random sequence, stratified by centre and using blocks of variable size, to intervention Parkinson&#x02019;s Tracker App or control (Treatment as Usual). Primary outcome was the self-reported score of adherence to treatment (Morisky medication adherence scale &#x02212;8) at 16 weeks. Secondary outcomes were Quality of Life (Parkinson&#x02019;s disease questionnaire &#x02212;39), quality of consultation for Parkinson&#x02019;s disease patients (<italic>Patient-centred questionnaire for Parkinson&#x02019;s disease</italic>), impact on non-motor symptoms (Non-motor symptoms questionnaire), depression and anxiety (Hospital anxiety and depression scale) and beliefs about medication (Beliefs about Medication Questionnaire) at 16 weeks. Primary and secondary endpoints were analysed using a generalised linear model with treatment as the fixed effect and baseline measurement as the covariate. 158 patients completed the study (Parkinson&#x02019;s tracker app&#x02009;=&#x02009;68 and TAU&#x02009;=&#x02009;90). At 16 weeks Parkinson&#x02019;s tracker app significantly improved adherence, compared to treatment as usual (mean difference: 0.39, 95%CI 0.04&#x02013;0.74; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0304) with no confounding effects of gender, number of comorbidities and age. Among secondary outcomes, Parkinson&#x02019;s tracker app significantly improved patients&#x02019; perception of quality of consultation (0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.27; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0110). The change in non-motor symptoms was &#x02212;0.82 (95% CI &#x02212;1.75 to 0.10; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0822). 72% of participants in the Parkinson&#x02019;s tracker app group continued to use and engage with the application throughout the 16-week trial period. The Parkinson&#x02019;s tracker app can be an effective and novel way of enhancing self-reported medication adherence and quality of clinical consultation by supporting self-management in Parkinson&#x02019;s disease in patients owning smartphones. Further work is recommended to determine whether the benefits of the intervention are maintained beyond the 16 week study period.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Digital healthcare: App helps patients stick to plan</title><p id="Par2">A smartphone-based application improves treatment adherence of patients with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (PD). Rashmi Lakshminarayana, from uMotif Ltd, and researchers from the UK and The Netherlands describe the results of a 16 week trial of a Parkinson&#x02019;s tracker app (PTA) that randomised 215 patients from seven different health centres. Patients using the app reported significantly better adherence to their medication plan compared with control patients who continued their treatment as usual. Interestingly, using the PTA also improved the patients&#x02019; perception of the quality of their clinical care, possibly as a result of feeling more involved and in control of their care. These findings suggest that by sending medication reminders and tracking symptoms, the app can help patients with Parkinson&#x02019;s self-manage their increasingly complex treatment regimen as the disease progresses.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, after Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and affects 6.3 million people worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> It is a disabling condition and has a significant impact on patient&#x02019;s Quality of Life (QoL).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> Non-motor symptoms such as depression, anxiety, fatigue and sleep disturbance are frequently overlooked by clinicians<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and contribute to significant burden on people with PD and their carers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> Comorbidity is common in PD.

These findings suggest that the PTA can be useful in improving outcomes and processes of care in people with PD, similar to results seen in other chronic conditions such as diabetes and asthma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> Given that typical clinical follow-up of patients with PD by clinical care teams in the UK occurs approximately every 6 months (by consultants or nurse specialists), this finding suggests PTA is useful in improving care for a significant period of time between clinic consultations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>
</p><p id="Par22">In early stages of the disease, patients usually take a single drug<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and over half of patients take two to three drugs three to four times daily in later stages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> This partly explains why the effect of the PTA in subgroups was significant amongst those older than the median age. The complexity of treatment along with PD affecting cognitive processes such as sorting or planning tasks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> might explain why the PTA helped in improving adherence as medication reminders and symptom tracking were core features.</p><p id="Par23">Factors affecting medication non-adherence in PD patients include clinical (i.e. mood disorders, cognitive impairment, poor symptom control or reduced QoL, younger age or longer disease duration, and regime complexity or polypharmacy) and demographic (lack of spouse or partner, low income, employment status, and gender) factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> We only excluded those with significant cognitive impairment as diagnosed by the clinical team. Baseline HADS scores suggested that a majority of the participants did not have depression or anxiety. There was an indication that women were more adherent than men, but this was not statistically significant. The average age and duration of PD was 61 years and 4 years respectively. Most participants took all their medications on their own with 20.2% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;19) in the PTA group and 25.2% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;27) in the TAU group needing help to take their medications.</p><p id="Par24">Composite QoL scores as measured on the PDQ-39 were low at baseline, indicating that this was not a significant contributor to the outcome. Further investigation is recommended on the impact of improved adherence on non-motor symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> However, this could be a chance finding or a placebo effect, as we had not included a formal non-motor symptom assessment.</p><p id="Par25">PD patients desire more emotional support from healthcare professionals and want more active involvement in clinical decision-making.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> Other studies have found that PD patients who perceived higher involvement in their care were more satisfied with the consultation and intended to be more compliant with treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> Those in the PTA group perceived the service as more patient-centred as measured on the PCQ-PD (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01). This could be linked to clinical teams inviting patients to use the app, personalising the app set-up and jointly reviewing progress using the data collected by patients at the 16-week follow-up.</p><p id="Par26">User retention is a recognised challenge for all Smartphone apps, with less than one in seven people opening apps beyond a day after download.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> The higher level of user retention during the SMART-PD trial can be linked to factors including the simplicity and design of the app&#x02019;s user interface and user experience; that the app is perceived as given by participant&#x02019;s clinical team and thereby acting as an extension of their recommended care; and the direct benefit of understanding their health better as reported by PTA users.</p><p id="Par27">The trial included only those who already had smartphones or tablet devices, thereby excluding those who did not own such a device. Smartphone penetration in the UK is estimated at 66%, ranging from 88% in those aged 25&#x02013;34 to 49% in those aged 55&#x02013;64 and 17% in those over 65.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> These later groups are the most represented in the study group. The study app was available on iOS (Apple operating system) and Android (Google operating system). These were the major operating systems during the study period (August 2014&#x02013;June 2015) with 42.33% being iOS users and 47.95% being Android users. We estimate that users of other operating systems (i.e. 9.72% of total smartphone and tablet device users during the study period used Windows and Blackberry)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> could not take part, further contributing to the reported response rate. As the smartphone market penetration increases, especially in those over 65, it would be anticipated that more patients would be able to use the study app. It should be noted that a mean age of 60 in the PTA group was not a barrier for interaction with the PTA, allaying fears that technology-based interventions are not appropriate for an older age group.</p><p id="Par28">Our results also clearly highlight the difficulty of studying adherence using a pragmatic design. Research into recruitment rates for randomised controlled trials (RCTs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> highlight the challenges of both recruiting patients and of retentaining recruited patients despite implementing various retention strategies along with letters. Since we did not use any other methods of retention, this could explain the study retention rate we found in the study&#x02014;there was a higher than expected loss to follow-up and survey completion rates (64% in PTA arm and 83% in the TAU arm completed as Per Protocol). We relied on the use of online questionnaires that patients completed at home, rather than a standard paper-based questionnaire completed at the clinic during study visits, which likely led to the rate of drop-out. However, questionnaires delivered and completed by the patient at home have the benefit of reduced recall bias and in-situ data collection. It is possible that follow-up drop-outs preferentially affect those with poor self-reported medication adherence, the difference in medications adherence between study arms were maintained in both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis. The higher study drop-out rate in the PTA group is likely due to the participants needing to perform an additional trial task of using the PTA compared to the TAU group. Additionally, the PTA may not have met all participants&#x02019; needs (for example: some of the self-monitoring measures chosen by the trial team may not be applicable to some participants), which could have contributed to the dropouts.</p><p id="Par29">The MMAS-8 was developed to manage hypertension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and the MMAS-4 has been used in PD studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> A 2-point improvement on the MMAS-8 scores was found to link to clinically significant improvement in hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> However, there are no similar measures of the MMAS-8 in PD. Some studies investigating adherence chose participants with lower adherence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> as criteria for inclusion in a trial, which translates to an increased potential for improvement. We did not exclude patients with high self-reported adherence, indicating that PTA can help a range of people with varying levels of adherence.</p><p id="Par30">To study the impact of the PTA on health services use, we need to assess the PTA over a longer duration. Although it seems reasonable to conclude that improvement in adherence is desirable, specifics around how much self-reported adherence is clinically meaningful in PD will require additional studies looking specifically at clinician and carer measures.</p><p id="Par31">In summary, we conclude that the PTA could be an effective and novel way of enhancing short-term self-reported medication adherence and quality of clinical consultation by supporting self-management in PD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par32">An open-label, multicentre RCT was conducted from August 2014 to June 2015.

To detect a 1-point improvement on the MMAS-8 with a standard deviation (SD) of 2.5 and 80% power at the 5% significance level would require 200 subjects (100 in each group, 1:1 allocation). To allow for 10% loss due to dropouts and those lost to follow-up, we aimed to recruit 222 subjects (111 in each group, 1:1 allocation).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p id="Par56">Eligible patients were allocated in a 1:1 ratio to the two arms of the study according to a computer-generated random sequence stratified by centre and using blocks of variable size. The allocation sequence was generated by an independent statistician and was not available to any member of the research team until databases were completed and locked. Copies of the allocation sequence were not held at the recruiting centres. Once randomised, clinicians who enroled participants informed them of their assignment. Blinding to group allocation was not possible, as participants knew whether or not they were receiving PTA. The trial statisticians were blinded to the treatment code when developing the statistical analysis plan and writing the statistical programmes, which were validated and completed using dummy randomisation codes. The actual allocation code was only provided to the trial statisticians after locking of the database and finalisation of the statistical analysis plan.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Statistical methods</title><p id="Par57">A Generalised Linear Model (GLM) was used for analysis of the primary endpoint and had treatment as the fixed effect and baseline measurement of the primary endpoint as the covariate. The treatment difference together with its 95% confidence interval between PTA and TAU in the least square mean of primary endpoint was derived from the GLM model. Model assumptions about residuals in regression analysis were checked by inspection of residuals vs. a fitted values plot and no serious violation of normality assumption was found. In addition, adjusted analysis and subgroup analysis with pre-specified covariates (age, gender and number of co-morbidities) were performed. For the secondary outcomes (QoL, depression, anxiety, non-motor symptoms, and degrees of depression and anxiety and quality of consultation), the analyses were performed in an analogous fashion within the framework of GLM. Analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes were carried out in adherence to the intention-to-treat principle. In addition, supplemental per-protocol analyses were performed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec14"><p>
