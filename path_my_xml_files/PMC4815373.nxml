The participants were randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. Collection of data on cardiac self-efficacy was performed before, 3 months after, and 4 months after the beginning of the intervention using Cardiac Self-Efficacy Scale designed by Sullivan <italic>et al</italic>. During the 3 months of intervention, six messages were sent to the subjects each week and calls were made twice a week in the first month and once a week during the second and third months.

CADs have been the cause of 46% of mortality cases and their incidence rate is 181.4 in every 100,000 individuals. Based on the available statistical reports, the prevalence of CADs in Isfahan is 19.4%.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] In addition to causing congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiogenic shock,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] CADs impose many expenses in the field of care and treatment. The expenses of treatment and absence from work of these diseases are estimated at 26.77 billion Rials per year.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The ideal treatments for CADs include pharmaceutical, interventional, and surgical measures, management of risk factors, and lifestyle modifications.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Although factors such as age, gender, and family history cannot be changed through lifestyle modification interventions in patients with CAD, cognitive-behavioral factors such as self-efficacy can be considered in the promotion of health.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>From the perspective of social cognitive theory, self-efficacy refers to the individuals&#x02019; understanding of their own ability to change or continue a behavior successfully.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Promotion of self-efficacy is effective on the improvement of treatment adherence and healthy behaviors of patients.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Thus, nurses can improve self-care in patients through promotion of their self-efficacy.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Promotion of self-efficacy is an important component of cardiac patient care programs. Previous studies have shown that promotion of cardiac self-efficacy can be effective in lifestyle modification, improvement of cardiovascular risk factors, and prevention of rehospitalization of patients with CAD.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>An intervention implemented to promote cardiac self-efficacy is patient follow-up.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Follow-up is an important component of nursing services.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In the health care system, various methods are used in order to follow patients&#x02019; status. Traditional follow-up methods consist of patients&#x02019; referral to care centers in person or home visits by health care personnel. In spite of these methods being efficient, they require human resources, time, and high expenses.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Therefore, in recent years, use of mobile communications in following patients with chronic diseases has increased.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Use of mobile communication methods in nursing (telenursing), in addition to saving time and money in treatment measures, makes measures such as following patients, performing nursing interventions, and educating and supporting patients and their families by nurses possible.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>An efficient, easy, and cost-effective method of telenursing is follow-up through text message and telephone.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Text message follow-up is a new, effective, and cost-effective communication method which makes following patients&#x02019; status and transference of health information possible in the most remote areas.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Telephone follow-up is one of the most cost-effective and efficient methods of follow-up in chronic diseases, and can reduce unnecessary patient visits and facilitate access to specialized care.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Today, text message and telephone follow-up methods are used as suitable methods of providing training in order to improve patient management, promote patients&#x02019; health behavior, and support patients and their families.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Use of these two-communication methods has made easy, safe, and cost-effective follow-up possible for patients with CAD, and can be effective in the primary and secondary prevention of CAD and promotion of healthy behaviors.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>The efficacy of telenursing through text message and telephone follow-up in the management of CADs has been studied in a number of previous studies.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] These studies have obtained contradictory results regarding the efficacy of these two methods of follow-up.

The study subjects consisted of patients with CAD who were hospitalized in the cardiac wards of Shahid Chamran Hospital (Isfahan, Iran) in October-November 2014 and met the inclusion criteria. The participants were selected using convenience sampling method. The sample size was determined in 95% confidence interval and 80% power as 32 individuals in each group. Due to the possibility of loss of subjects, in total, 70 individuals were entered into the study.</p><p>The subjects were randomly (through the random selection of cards with the numbers 1 and 2 by the patients) divided into two groups of intervention (<italic>n</italic> = 35) and control (<italic>n</italic> = 35).</p><p>The inclusion criteria consisted of diagnosis of CAD by a cardiologist, age 35-75 years, familiarity with Persian language, being literate (able to read and write), having stable physical condition, lack of any recognized mental conditions or mental and motor disabilities, lack of any visual, speech, and hearing difficulties, having access to a telephone at home and a personal or family mobile phone.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] The exclusion criteria consisted of unwillingness to participate in the study, hospitalization or death during the study period, simultaneous participation in cardiac rehabilitation programs, and changing of telephone and mobile number and not informing the researcher.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Data collection was performed in the two groups of patients before, 3 months after, and 4 months after the beginning of the intervention. The data collection tool comprised two parts. The first part consisted of questions on demographic characteristics and information on the disease (age, gender, education level, and marital status, history of risk factors such as increase in blood glucose, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, and history of hospitalization). The second part consisted of the Cardiac Self-Efficacy Scale designed by Sullivan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] This scale is composed of 16 questions which evaluate the patients&#x02019; self-efficacy in terms of maintenance of performance, management of disease symptoms, and regulation of cardiac risk factors using a 5-point Likert scale. Each question obtains a score ranging from 0 to 4, with 4 representing the highest degree of confidence (the option of very much) and 0 the lowest degree of confidence (the option of lack of confidence). The total score of this scale ranges from 0 to 64; higher scores represent higher self-efficacy. Scores of 0-32 show low self-efficacy and scores of 33-64 show high self-efficacy.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] The Cardiac Self-Efficacy Scale is a standard questionnaire, the reliability and validity of which have been approved by researches performed in Iran and other countries. In the study by Shamsizadeh, the validity of this scale was approved in Iran and its reliability was approved through internal consistency method and calculation of Cronbach's alpha (&#x003b1; = 0.977).[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] In previous studies, Cronbach's alpha of this scale has been calculated as 0.87-0.90[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and 0.77.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In the present study, Cronbach's alpha of this scale was 0.935.</p><p>The patients were informed of the goals of the study and informed consents were obtained from them. Then, the researcher's colleague, who was unaware of the groups and goals of the study, completed the questionnaires through interviews with patients. After primary data collection, the home telephone number and mobile number of the patients were obtained. To ensure that messages were sent, the researcher activated the delivery option in her mobile phone.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Finally, the subjects were randomly divided into two groups.</p><p>During the 3 months of text message follow-up, six messages were sent to the subjects each week. In total, during the intervention period, 72 text messages were sent to each study subject. Each text message consisted of a maximum of 160 words.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The context of the text messages sent to the intervention group comprised training based on the content of the Cardiac Self-Efficacy Scale in terms of physical activity, diet, weight management, medication use, and shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pain management, normal social activity level, marital relationship, stress management, smoking cessation, and blood pressure, blood glucose, and lipid level management.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Text message follow-up of the control group patients was achieved through messages with contents other than cardiac self-efficacy, such as health messages.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] It should be noted that in order to comply with ethical principles, all messages related to cardiac self-efficacy were sent to control group participants at the end of the study.</p><p>In the course of the 3 months of telephone follow-up, telephone calls were made two times per week during the first month and once a week during the second and third months. On average, the duration of each call was 15 min, and in total, 16 calls were made to each subject.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The content of telephone conversations in the intervention group was related to the assessment of cardiac self-efficacy in terms of the context of the messages sent to the participants. It should be noted that for the promotion of self-efficacy in the field of marital relationship, a male colleague of the researcher performed follow-up for male patients.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] In case of any problems, the situation was analyzed with the help of the participant in order to find the cause of the problem and propose solutions.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The content of telephone calls made to the control group participants was not related to cardiac self-efficacy, but consisted of greeting and thanking the participants.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In order to comply with ethical principles, during telephone calls made to the control group participants, all their questions regarding CAD were answered. The questionnaire was completed again by the researcher's colleague through interviews in both groups 3 months and 4 months after the beginning of the intervention.</p><p>Statistical analysis of data was conducted using Student's independent <italic>t</italic>-test, Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U test, and repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) in SPSS software (version 18; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

Furthermore, improvement or worsening of patients&#x02019; symptoms in time could affect their cardiac self-efficacy results. This factor could not be controlled by the researcher. Another limitation of the present study was the short follow-up time after the intervention. The limited time available for the student thesis, and thus, performing the intervention resulted in the short follow-up time after the intervention.
