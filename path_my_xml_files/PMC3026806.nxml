Many seamounts are isolated features, occurring in the high seas, where access is limited and thus biological data scarce. There are numerous seamounts within the Drake Passage (Southern Ocean), yet high winds, frequent storms and strong currents make seafloor sampling particularly difficult. As a result, few attempts to collect biological data have been made, leading to a paucity of information on benthic habitats or fauna in this area, particularly those on primarily hard-bottom seamounts and ridges. During a research cruise in 2008 six locations were examined (two on the Antarctic margin, one on the Shackleton Fracture Zone, and three on seamounts within the Drake Passage), using a towed camera with onboard instruments to measure conductivity, temperature, depth and turbidity. Dominant fauna and bottom type were categorized from 200 randomized photos from each location. Cold-water corals were present in high numbers in habitats both on the Antarctic margin and on the current swept seamounts of the Drake Passage, though the diversity of orders varied. Though the Scleractinia (hard corals) were abundant on the sedimented margin, they were poorly represented in the primarily hard-bottom areas of the central Drake Passage. The two seamount sites and the Shackleton Fracture Zone showed high numbers of stylasterid (lace) and alcyonacean (soft) corals, as well as large numbers of sponges. Though data are preliminary, the geological and environmental variability (particularly in temperature) between sample sites may be influencing cold-water coral biogeography in this region. Each area observed also showed little similarity in faunal diversity with other sites examined for this study within all phyla counted. This manuscript highlights how little is understood of these isolated features, particularly in Polar regions.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since the opening of the Drake Passage, some 30 million years ago <xref rid="pone.0016153-Barker1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016153-Huber1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016153-Livermore1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is thought to create a biogeographical barrier to species dispersal, limiting the transport of benthic larvae between the South American and Antarctic continental shelves. The Drake Passage in particular is a highly dynamic environment, where fast currents are likely to hinder meridional larval transport <xref rid="pone.0016153-Clarke1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Antarctic benthic fauna have been thought to be &#x0201c;cut off&#x0201d; from South American fauna since this time, and therefore have a long history of <italic>in situ</italic> evolution on the deep continental shelf <xref rid="pone.0016153-Clarke2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016153-Lipps1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Despite this separation, faunal similarities have been found in both fossil and live benthic groups bringing into question these theories of larval isolation <xref rid="pone.0016153-Clarke2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016153-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. However, to date little is known about the benthic fauna that lives in between these two shelves, within the Drake Passage itself. Though the majority of the passage lies in abyssal depths of over 3000 m, there are numerous ridges and seamounts (from ETOPO 2 bathymetry), largely unexplored lying at depths similar to the two adjacent continental shelves (500&#x02013;1500 m).</p><p>The enhanced productivity around seamounts and other geologic features that rise from bathyal and abyssal depths creates hotspots of diversity for both benthic and pelagic organisms <xref rid="pone.0016153-Stocks1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Seamounts in particular can support a fauna that is distinct from that of the surrounding seafloor, potentially supporting both high levels of endemism and recruits from the regional gene pool <xref rid="pone.0016153-Stocks1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The nutrient-rich upwelling, topographic trapping of migrating zooplankton <xref rid="pone.0016153-Rogers1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and the influence of strong current regimes also make these areas suitable habitat for filter-feeding cold-water corals <xref rid="pone.0016153-Genin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. These coral ecosystems are important for increasing local diversity and are used as nursery, feeding and protection areas for potentially thousands of associated species <xref rid="pone.0016153-Roberts1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Despite their importance as ecosystem engineers and recent increased interest in these habitats, the ecology and biogeography of cold-water corals are poorly known, particularly in relation to their shallow-water counterparts. Furthermore, the linkages between environment and habitat, and larval settling and dispersal on remote and hard to sample seamounts is still not understood.</p><p>The Drake Passage has over 20 seamounts and ridges (peaks of shallower than 2000 m depth) between the southern extension of the South American shelf and the Western Antarctic Peninsula shelf, but the passage is also notorious for large waves, fierce storms and strong currents, making benthic sampling difficult and therefore infrequent. Seafloor photographs, while not a replacement for physical samples, can help supplement the small number of samples that have been obtained from this challenging environment.

The two sites on the WAP margin, though more similar to each other than to sites in the Drake Passage, were only 75&#x00025; similar, likely owing to the large depth difference between these sites (&#x0223c;1500m). Being geographically closer, as expected, the Shackleton Fracture Zone was most similar to the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) margin sites (72&#x00025;), though it was still more closely related to Drake Passage locations. Interestingly, the SFZ was more closely related to Sars Seamount than to the geographically closer Interim Seamount, though this could be because of the depth similarity of these two sites.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Though other studies have suggested that seamount communities are most closely affiliated with those on the nearest continental margin <xref rid="pone.0016153-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> this study, even at phylum level, shows a distinct difference in faunal makeup between the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) continental margin sites and sites within the Drake Passage.</p><p>Similar to other oceans <xref rid="pone.0016153-Stocks2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, corals and other cnidarians are found in large numbers on seamounts and ridges in the Drake Passage, as well as on the WAP margin, yet no morpho-species of coral collected during this cruise (many are presently unidentified) were the same between the WAP margin and the Drake Passage (Robinson &#x00026; Waller, cruise report). It is interesting to note that sponges were present in more than 95&#x00025; of the images from the four Drake Passage sites, and particularly on Sars Seamount where sponges were present in more photographs than corals. Sponges can colonize habitat suitable for coral growth, and can overgrow coral colonies in shallow-water <xref rid="pone.0016153-Macintyre1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016153-Rtzler1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> but it is not known if this occurs in the deep ocean. Deep sponge reefs are important ecosystem builders, attracting similar numbers of associated species as cold-water corals <xref rid="pone.0016153-Cook1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. With the large numbers present in this study, they are likely to be important components of Drake Passage Seamount ecosystems alongside coral communities.</p><p>The coral taxa in this study showed potential biogeographic patterns across the Drake Passage in relation to substrate types, and possibly related to the water temperature increase from south to north (0.5&#x02013;1.0 degrees Celsius at WAP and 1.5&#x02013;2.5 degrees Celsius at Sars Seamount). Higher turbidity within the Drake Passage may also be a factor, as turbidity and sedimentation in particular can be detrimental to deep-water scleractinians <xref rid="pone.0016153-Grigg1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Though the WAP sites show higher percentages of sedimented habitat, the high currents found within the Drake Passage could be the cause of the higher turbidity at Interim Seamount, lifting and retaining particulates around the topology of the seamount.</p><p>Scleractinians are usually found in hard-substrate and high-current-flow environments <xref rid="pone.0016153-Roberts1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, yet this study found they were the most abundant coral on the sediment-covered WAP margin west of Elephant Island and relatively rare on the rocky seamounts within the Drake Passage. Though all scleractinians do require a hard substrate for larval settlement, this requirement can be satisfied by a small pebble, rock or shell in a predominantly sediment habitat <xref rid="pone.0016153-Rogers2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Of the nine species of scleractinian found on the Antarctic Continental Shelf, seven of these are specially adapted for sedimented habitats <xref rid="pone.0016153-Cairns1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Thus the high abundance of scleractinians on the WAP was expected, and though species data have not yet been compiled from this cruise, the species diversity at the WAP sites does appear to be low, being comprised of primarily <italic>Flabellum spp.</italic> cup corals. Few octocorals and stylasterids are adapted to live in sediment habitats <xref rid="pone.0016153-Cairns2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016153-Rogers3" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> so infrequent observations of those groups on the WAP margin compared to the more current-swept areas of the Drake Passage were also expected. <italic>Anthomastus bathyproctus</italic> is the major exception; this exclusively sediment-dwelling octocoral was found in high numbers (59&#x00025; of images) at the 400m Elephant Island site. Stylasterids have been reported in high numbers from the Arctic <xref rid="pone.0016153-Cairns2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016153-Lindner1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and Patagonia <xref rid="pone.0016153-Hussermann1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and often dominate deep polar habitats <xref rid="pone.0016153-Heifetz1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, particularly in areas of low nutrients where they are not outcompeted by faster growing organisms <xref rid="pone.0016153-Cairns2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Since there is no published information on the organic nutrient availability at each of these sample locations, it is difficult to determine if this is also a factor in the coral distribution observed in this study. Stylasterids were present in reduced numbers on the WAP margin, likely inhibited by the predominately fine-grained sediments and lack of extensive hard bottom substrates.</p><p>Within the Drake Passage, however, hard substrate (in the form of bedrock, gravel and rocks) was more abundant, yet surprisingly the presence of scleractinians was low. It should be noted however, of the seventeen species of scleractinian found in Antarctic waters today, only two form large colonial structures and the remaining fifteen species are smaller solitary-living forms such as species of family Flabellum and Caryophyllia <xref rid="pone.0016153-Cairns1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. These smaller scleractinians often occur in cracks and underhangs (pers. obs.), areas that could easily be missed from a downward looking towed imaging system and thus missed from this data set. Attached solitary corals can also often be found in clusters (pers. obs.), and so their influence to an ecosystem is likely to be underestimated in presence/absence data. Future studies can expand this preliminary data set by collecting samples and conducting closer image transects with scaling systems (using drop cameras in tandem with towed packages) to more fully characterize the ecosystem for both biodiversity and abundance data.</p><p>The difficulty in sampling habitats in the Drake Passage has led to a paucity of information on benthic fauna, yet on this expedition seamount composition was found to be rich and diverse, particularly with regards to cold-water coral and sponge ecosystems. At each of the sampling locations, corals comprised greater than a quarter of all benthic fauna, demonstrating their importance to these polar communities. None of the species observed were the same between the WAP and Drake Passage sites, suggesting these two areas have two distinct faunal communities. These images of seamounts and ridges in the Drake Passage are the first indication of the diversity of fauna in this region and its potential interdependence on local environmental conditions. Understanding the prime constituents of seamounts and ridges inside the Drake Passage in relation to the South American and Antarctic continental shelves can enhance understanding of larval transport and evolutionary processes in this dynamic area. This is especially important as anthropogenic ocean warming and acidification are threatening these delicate polar ecosystems before they are studied fully <xref rid="pone.0016153-Kleypas1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and thus biodiversity data are urgently required now to determine the extent of damage that might occur.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the science party, Raytheon science support and crew of ARV Nathaniel B.
