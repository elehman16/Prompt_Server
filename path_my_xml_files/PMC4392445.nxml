We anticipated that neurological function at discharge would predict these outcomes.<sup><xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patient Population</title><p>As detailed previously,<sup><xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> eligible patients were randomized from December 7, 2007, through December 7, 2012, and follow&#x02010;up interviews assessing neurological status were completed by May 1, 2013. Of the 1359 patients in our randomized trial,<sup><xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> 508 (37%) were discharged alive from the hospital. Consent was sought from survivors to participate in a telephone interview to assess neurological recovery after discharge. Of the 508 survivors, 86 (17%) did not give consent to be interviewed, because they could not be contacted (43%), were deceased (41%), or refused (15%). Another 49 (10%) consented, but were not interviewed. In the end, 373 (73%) patients were interviewed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>). Trial activities, including the follow&#x02010;up interviews and vital status ascertainment, were approved by institutional review boards at the University of Washington (Seattle, WA) and participating hospitals in Seattle and King County, Washington.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Follow&#x02010;up flow diagram.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jah3-4-e001693-g1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Variables</title><p>Key variables from the hospital phase of the randomized trial included age, sex, initial rhythm, time from call to first unit (either emergency medical technicians or Medics) arrival, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, witnessed arrest, and neurological status at hospital discharge as measured by Cerebral Performance Category (CPC), which was scored as: (1) good cerebral performance; (2) moderate cerebral disability; (3) severe cerebral disability; (4) coma or vegetative state; or (5) deceased.<sup><xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> The follow&#x02010;up telephone interviews provided sufficient information to define not only CPC, but also the level of functional independence, as measured by the Modified Rankin Scale (MRS), which was scored as: (0) no symptoms; (1) no significant disability; (2) slight disability; (3) moderate disability; (4) moderately severe disability; (5) severe disability; or (6) deceased. The CPC and MRS were coded according to previously specified criteria.<sup><xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>Telephone interviews were conducted by a single research assistant who asked questions that were used to define the CPC and MRS. For the CPC, there were either 3 questions for the patient or 4 questions for the caregiver or family member, depending on who was interviewed. For the MRS, there were 27 questions. Interviews were conducted with the patient (85%), caregiver (3%), or family member (12%).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>We learned of patient deaths as a result of phone calls for the follow&#x02010;up interviews. In addition, Washington State death records for the years 2007 through 2013 were obtained from the Washington State Department of Health. Patient name, date of birth, and gender were used to match to state death records. Social Security number was also used, but was available for less than 20% of patients. If patients were not identified as deceased by these means, they were presumed to be alive as of December 31, 2013. Survival time was calculated as the time from enrollment to death or December 31, 2013, for those presumed to be alive. Survival curves were constructed with the Kaplan&#x02010;Meier method. Statistical analyses included chi&#x02010;square, Student <italic>t</italic> test, or analysis of variance, as appropriate, and the log&#x02010;rank statistic.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="other"><title>Results</title><p>Patient characteristics according to consent and interview status are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl01">Table 1</xref>. Included in the 86 patients who did not consent were 41 (48%) who died during the year after discharge. There were 49 patients who consented, but were not interviewed; 17 (35%) died during the year after hospital discharge. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>, other reasons why patients who consented were not interviewed included: (1) patient or family refusal (6%); (2) inability to contact the patient (35%); and (3) unknown reason (24%). Compared to patients who were interviewed, patients who were not interviewed had worse neurological function at discharge.

This result was consistent with findings from the hospital phase of the trial, in which prehospital hypothermia was not associated with survival or neurological status at discharge.<sup><xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Overall 1&#x02010;year survival was 86%. For all 508 patients, 59% had had good outcomes by CPC and 50% by MRS. Among patients who were interviewed, 68% had MRS &#x0003c;3 or slight disability or better. The finding for MRS was somewhat different from results from the Amsterdam Resuscitation Study, in which 81% had MRS &#x0003c;3 between 6 and 12 months after cardiac arrest.<sup><xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> It was expected that the percentage of survivors with good outcomes would rise over time, because those with poor outcomes are more likely to die, not recover, or not participate in the interview.</p><p>Both neurological status at follow&#x02010;up as well as survival were highly dependent upon neurological function at hospital discharge.<sup><xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Those with a good outcome at hospital discharge by CPC had much better neurological function and survival at follow&#x02010;up than those without a good outcome at discharge. Again, this result was expected given that those with poor neurological function at discharge are unlikely to improve owing to devastating brain injury.</p><p>Those with good function at hospital discharge did not appear to decline, although the measures of neurological function were based on self&#x02010;report and did not include objective measures of function or direct observation of the patient. It is hard to know whether those who declined from CPC 1 at discharge to CPC 2 at follow&#x02010;up experienced a true decline or whether this was because of limitations of the CPC. Rittenberger et al. believe that the CPC has limitations as a gold standard, because its validity and reliability have not been established. They further conclude that neither the CPC nor MRS provide an adequate picture of the post&#x02013;cardiac arrest patient. Instead, a more relevant measure for the cardiac arrest populations is needed.<sup><xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Such a measure might include questions about quality of life and current physical or mental health.<sup><xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>Another limitation of the study was that only 73% of survivors were interviewed. There were 86 patients who did not consent and another 49 who consented to the interview, but were not interviewed. Of these 135 individuals, 58 (43%) died in the year after cardiac arrest. Patients in both groups had worse neurological function at discharge than their counterparts who were interviewed. We also relied on Washington State death records to assess the occurrence of death after hospital discharge. These records are unlikely to include Washington State residents who died out of state and would not include nonresidents who suffered cardiac arrest while visiting King County and ultimately died in another state or country.</p><p>In conclusion, in this prospective follow&#x02010;up study to a randomized trial of prehospital hypothermia, neurological function and survival were not associated with randomization assignment. Survival 1 year after hospital discharge was 86% for all patients and was 90% for those with good outcome at hospital discharge by CPC. In addition to excellent survival, patients who had good outcome at discharge continued to have good function at least 3 months after the event.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Paramedics of Seattle Medic One, South King County Medic One, Bellevue Medic One, Evergreen Medic One, Shoreline Medic One.
