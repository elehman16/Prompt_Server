Observational and interventional experimental evidence suggests that DNA immunogenicity may be prevented by binding of human serum amyloid P component (SAP). SAP is the single normal DNA binding protein in human plasma. The drug (R)-1-[6-[(R)-2-carboxypyrrolidin-1-yl]-6-oxo-hexanoyl]pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid (CPHPC, miridesap), developed for treatment of systemic amyloidosis and Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease, depletes circulating SAP by 95&#x02013;99%. The proof-of-concept HIV-CORE 003 clinical trial tested whether SAP depletion by CPHPC would enhance the immune response in human volunteers to DNA vaccination delivering the HIVconsv immunogen derived from conserved sub-protein regions of HIV-1.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>Human volunteers received 3 intramuscular immunizations with an experimental DNA vaccine (DDD) expressing HIV-1-derived immunogen HIVconsv, with or without prior depletion of SAP by CPHPC. All subjects were subsequently boosted by simian (chimpanzee) adenovirus (C)- and poxvirus MVA (M)-vectored vaccines delivering the same immunogen. After administration of each vaccine modality, the peak total magnitudes, kinetics, functionality and memory subsets of the T-cell responses to HIVconsv were thoroughly characterized.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>No differences were observed between the CPHPC treated and control groups in any of the multiple quantitative and qualitative parameters of the T-cell responses to HIVconsv, except that after SAP depletion, there was a statistically significantly greater breadth of T-cell specificities, that is the number of recognized epitopes, following the DDDC vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The protocol used here for SAP depletion by CPHPC prior to DNA vaccination produced only a very modest suggestion of enhanced immunogenicity.

Serum amyloid P component (SAP) is the single normal human plasma protein that binds avidly to DNA under physiological conditions [<xref rid="pone.0197299.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Studying different animal species, we found a complete concordance between the efficacy of DNA vaccination and either the complete absence of SAP or the presence of SAP that does not bind strongly to DNA. For example, mice respond well to DNA vaccination and have SAP that binds DNA very weakly [<xref rid="pone.0197299.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, transgenic mice expressing human SAP lost potent murine immune responses to DNA vaccination and this inhibition was completely abrogated when the transgenic mice were treated with (R)-1-[6-[(R)-2-carboxy-pyrrolidin-1-yl]-6-oxo-hexanoyl]pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid (CPHPC, miridesap) [<xref rid="pone.0197299.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0197299.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], the SAP-depleting drug [<xref rid="pone.0197299.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In order to investigate whether human SAP might interfere with the immunogenicity of DNA vaccination in humans, we conducted a phase I/IIa clinical trial of DNA vaccination in subjects receiving infusion of CPHPC to deplete their circulating SAP at the time of each injection of DNA.</p><p>To tackle the enormous genetic plasticity of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), we pioneered a strategy, which focuses vaccine-elicited responses on the most conserved regions of the HIV-1 proteome [<xref rid="pone.0197299.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The first generation HIV-1 conserved immunogen, HIVconsv [<xref rid="pone.0197299.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], was presented to the immune system in the form of genetic vaccines using plasmid DNA, engineered non-replicating simian adenovirus ChAdV-63 and non-replicating poxvirus modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) [<xref rid="pone.0197299.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

One hundred and ninety nine 15-mer peptides overlapping by 11 amino acids (15/11) spanning the HIVconsv protein were arranged into six peptide pools P1-P6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197299.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) and used to enumerate HIVconsv-specific T cells to assess the overall magnitude (as the sum of the 6 pool frequencies) and breadth (number of recognized pools) of the vaccine-elicited responses. Of the total of 520 samples tested, 11 or 2.1% failed the quality control. The overall kinetics of the elicited responses throughout the vaccination and follow-up periods for the SAP-depleted and untreated subjects showed very similar patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197299.g003">Fig 3A</xref>).

Availability of the experimental SAP-depleting drug, CPHPC (now known by its recently awarded WHO International Non-Proprietary Name, miridesap) at University College London [<xref rid="pone.0197299.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and of experimental GMP vaccines, including one vectored by plasmid DNA [<xref rid="pone.0197299.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], in Oxford University, uniquely enabled us to test this idea in humans. Infusion of CPHPC for 24 hours before each injection of the DNA vaccine reduced circulating SAP, as expected, to less than 1 mg/l. Multiple parameters of DNA vaccine-primed T cells were compared in the SAP-depleted and control groups: kinetics of appearance, frequency at peak, proliferative capacity, ability to produce intercellular signalling molecules and structure of memory subtypes. However, only the breadth of response, that is the number of different epitopes that T cells as a population recognize at any one time, reached statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> = 0.044) favouring the SAP-depleted recipients. This was observed only after the DNA prime-simian adenovirus boost regimen (DDDC), but not after DNAalone (DDD), and it was no longer detected after the MVA boost (DDDCM).</p><p>After vaccinating the first 7 volunteers with DDDC, we amended the immunization protocol by adding another rather strongly boosting vaccine modality MVA in the hope that any minor differences achieved during the DNA priming phase would be amplified. We have learnt since and here that a strongly boosting vaccine may have the opposite effect; rather than amplifying differences, it blurs them and masks them [<xref rid="pone.0197299.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. For that reason, we focused our search for effects on the vaccine-elicited T-cell responses on the period after DDD priming and before the simian adenovirus boost. Nevertheless, neither cultured IFN-&#x003b3; ELISPOT assays nor profiling of functional molecules produced following a cognate peptide stimulation <italic>in vitro</italic> yielded any statistically separable results between the CPHPC- and placebo-treated groups.</p><p>We conclude that depletion of SAP with the regimen adopted here did not appreciably improve the immunogenicity of the naked DNA encoding the HIVconsv antigen. Our hypothesis may thus be wrong. However, the strong rationale provided by the experimental animal findings, that created the hypothesis, still remains and the present suggestion of a possible effect on breadth of immune response hints that it may be valid. There are several possible reasons for this marginal outcome. We excluded one possibility, namely that SAP does not bind the particular DNA immunogen we used, but the contrary possibility remains: the inhibitory potency of SAP may be so great that even the trace amount of residual SAP after CPHPC infusion was sufficient to block DNA immunogenicity. We may thus have used insufficient CPHPC to achieve our desired objective. Given the potential value to human health of efficacious DNA vaccines, and the possible development of an oral dosing form of CPHPC that would make practical SAP depletion a viable proposition, further clinical studies with more effective SAP depletion ahead of DNA vaccination would be worthwhile. In the present trial, CPHPC was infused for just 24 hours before DNA injection and continued for only 2 hours thereafter, based on logistical feasibility in this volunteer study. While circulating SAP was profoundly depleted, we do not know whether SAP was adequately removed from the extracellular compartment of the tissues, specifically the intramuscular sites of DNA injection. The binding of SAP to DNA is very avid and we do not know how much SAP may be sufficient to suppress the capacity of the DNA to transfect cells and trigger expression of the encoded protein immunogen. Investigation of the effects of SAP depletion on immunogenicity of DNA vaccines delivering different immunogens, if they are available, will also be of considerable interest.</p><p>Meanwhile, the experimental vaccines that were employed in the HIV-CORE 003 trial were the first generation of HIV-1 T-cell vaccines [<xref rid="pone.0197299.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which focuses elicited T-cell responses on highly functional conserved regions of the HIV-1 proteome common to most global variants, which are the most vulnerable parts of HIV-1 [<xref rid="pone.0197299.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These vaccines have now been used in 8 clinical trials in UK, Europe and Africa. They have proven the concept that, in-natural-infection subdominant protein epitopes can be taken out of the context of the whole proteins/virus and delivered by an in-human potent regimen such as the simian adenovirus-MVA sequential administration to induce robust HIV-1-specific T-cell responses. These can inhibit <italic>in vitro</italic> replication of viruses of 4 major global clades [<xref rid="pone.0197299.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0197299.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0197299.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0197299.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and, in HIV-1-positive patients, provided a preliminary signal of controlling HIV-1 viremia after pausing antiretroviral treatment [<xref rid="pone.0197299.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. As we demonstrated previously, having induced robust CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells response in the volunteers of this trial provides a further opportunity to identify novel subdominant, but potentially protective HIV-1 epitopes [<xref rid="pone.0197299.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Accumulation of knowledge about protective epitopes may in turn help predict early success or failure of future candidate T-cell vaccines against HIV-1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec024"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0197299.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>HIV-CORE 003 ex vivo ELISPOT data.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0197299.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0197299.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>HIV-CORE 003 cultured ELISPOT data.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0197299.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0197299.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>HIV-CORE 003 luminex data.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0197299.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0197299.s004"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Gating strategy for tetramer-reactive T-cell analysis.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0197299.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0197299.s005"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0197299.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0197299.s006"><label>S2 Text</label><caption><title>HIV-CORE 003 clinical protocol version 2.2.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0197299.s006.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0197299.s007"><label>S3 Text</label><caption><title>HIV-CORE 003 clinical registry safety.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0197299.s007.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0197299.s008"><label>S4 Text</label><caption><title>HIV-CORE 003 ELISPOT statistical report.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0197299.s008.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are extremely grateful to the volunteers whose participation enabled the trial to be conducted.
