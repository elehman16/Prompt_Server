For extensive areas of dermatoses, the amount of steroids used is comparatively more and the side effects are also high. The extensive and prolonged use of steroids may also produce drying of the skin. This can be minimized by addition of an emollient to the steroid. The first rationale for combining clobetasol propionate with a moisturizer that includes an emollient, dimethicone, and a humectants is that treatment of a dry scaly dermatoses may contribute to overall clinical improvement.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] This combination of steroids and emollient have been proved to be useful in various dermatological conditions such as atopic dermatitis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] and mastocytosis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] In atopic dermatitis, the dry skin has diminished water-binding capacity, higher transepidermal water loss, and decreased water content compared with normal skin and it may worsen dermatitis. The degree of epidermal hydration can directly affect the penetration of steroids through the skin.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Therefore, a combination of steroids and emollients can benefit the patient. High potent topical steroids can cause safety concerns such as suppression of the hypothalamic pituitary axis, acne, atrophy, purpura, and these side effects can be minimized by combining steroids with emollients. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the effect of steroids with varying dilutions of emollients on histamine wheal.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>From this study, we conclude that the dilution of steroid and emollient (1:1) in comparison to topical steroid alone caused a decrease in wheal suppression which was not statistically significant. Dilution of steroid with emollient 1:2 and 1:3 as compared to steroid alone did not decrease wheal suppression which was statistically significant. Steroids and emollients can be mixed in equal proportion (1:1) and the effect would be the same as that of the steroid alone.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> Nil.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gordon</surname><given-names>ML</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The role of clobetasol propionate emollient 0.05% in treatment of patients with dry scaly corticosteroid responsive dermatoses</article-title><source>Clin Therap</source><year>1998</year><volume>20</volume><fpage>26</fpage><lpage>39</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9522102</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rai</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Uppal</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Sharma</surname><given-names>NK</given-names></name><name><surname>Srinivas</surname><given-names>CR</given-names></name><name><surname>Anil</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Half an hour versus three hour contact of topical steroid (clobetasol propionate)</article-title><source>Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol</source><year>2004</year><volume>70</volume><fpage>214</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17642617</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Werner</surname><given-names>YL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The water content of the stratum corneum in patients with atopic dermatitis</article-title><source>Acta Derm Venereol (Stockh)</source><year>1986</year><volume>66</volume><fpage>281</fpage><lpage>4</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2430395</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wolkerstorfer</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Visser</surname><given-names>RL</given-names></name><name><surname>De Waard van der Spek</surname><given-names>FB</given-names></name><name><surname>Mulder</surname><given-names>PG</given-names></name><name><surname>Oranje</surname><given-names>AP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Efficacy and safety of wet wrap dressings in children with severe atopic dermatitis: Influence of corticosteroid dilution</article-title><source>Br J Dermatol</source><year>2000</year><volume>143</volume><fpage>999</fpage><lpage>1004</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11069509</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Heide</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>De Waard van der Spek</surname><given-names>FB</given-names></name><name><surname>den Hollander</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name><name><surname>Tank</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Oranje</surname><given-names>AP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Efficacy of 25% diluted fluticasone propionate 0.05% cream as wet wrap treatment in cutaneous mastocytosis</article-title><source>Dermatology</source><year>2007</year><volume>214</volume><fpage>333</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17460406</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fusaro</surname><given-names>RM</given-names></name><name><surname>Kingsey</surname><given-names>DN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Topical Glucocorticoids: How they are used and misused</article-title><source>Postgrad Med</source><year>1986</year><volume>79</volume><fpage>283</fpage><lpage>91</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3941817</pub-id></element-citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>
