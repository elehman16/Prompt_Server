Critical limb ischemia is estimated to develop in 500 to 1000 people per million per annum [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Epidemiological studies show that from 15% to 20% of patients with symptomatic atherosclerosis will suffer from CLI in the future [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The course of the disease is unfavorable and prognosis is poor [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In spite of the technical advances in interventional and surgical revascularization procedures, only 30% of patients are eligible for limb-preserving arterial surgery [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The effectiveness of traditional pharmacological therapy is limited and does not cease the progression of the disease. Life-saving limb amputation (&#x0201c;life before limb&#x0201d;) is therefore indicated in 40% of the patients [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The mortality rate in the course of CLI is very high (40%), whereas among patients disqualified from arterial surgery, it reaches 25% per annum [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The search for new methods of treatment of CLI is of primary and basic importance in vascular surgery [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Recent evidence from clinical studies suggests that neovascularization induced by CD34+ progenitor cells may permit limb salvage even under conditions of complete vessel occlusion [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Also gene therapy with the application of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plasmid has been conducted in a series of successful studies, on both animals and humans [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It seems probable that both methods could complement each other in the stimulation of angiogenesis in patients with CLI [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The simultaneous use of gene therapy (VEGF) together with progenitor cells may significantly accelerate the formation of collateral vessels in ischemic limbs [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Based on literature data and our previous experience with bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNC), we designed a randomized (open-labeled) human clinical trial to compare two therapies for CLI: experimental using combined VEGF gene and autologous MNC, and conventional drug therapy with pentoxifylline [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, the primary objective of the study was to assess the safety, feasibility and clinical efficacy of intra-muscular application of autologous bone marrow MNC with plasmid encoding human VEGF165 in patients suffering from CLI. The second main objective of our study was to compare the results of management in patients treated with the above method (the use of CD34+ progenitor cells combined with gene therapy by means of plasmid containing VEGF) with the group treated only with classic drug therapy (pentoxifylline). The secondary objective was to determine whether the application of autologous marrow cells with VEGF165 plasmid is associated with an improvement in arterial blood flow and formation of collateral arteries in patients with CLI not eligible for minimally interventional or surgical revascularization. We made an attempt at introducing the new experimental method of therapeutic angiogenesis in patients with CLI with a hope that positive clinical results of our study could provide a wide group of patients with the possibility of at least partial recovery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0002"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="S20003"><title>Patients</title><p>Each year about one hundred patients are hospitalized for CLI in our department.

Therefore, when lesions in arteries of the affected limb are not accessible for any surgical or endovascular procedure, high-level amputation is usually recommended as the solution of choice. Due to a high amputation rate, it is very important to find and develop alternative treatment strategies in such cases [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge, our study is the first one available in English literature dealing with the application of the combination of the following therapies: autologous bone marrow MNC and gene administration in patients with CLI. Previous trials described treatment with the application of either stem cells or VEGF plasmid separately [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Our results are not as encouraging as those obtained in the previous studies [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. During the 90-day observation period we achieved a significant clinical improvement in 12 patients with CLI with non-healing ulcers after combined therapy &#x02013; group 1. In comparison, 8 patients from group 2 also saved their limbs. However, only in the first group did we observe complete healing of skin ulcers and an increase in the ABI: in 11 patients ulcers vanished completely, and in 1 progress in ulcer healing was noticeable. All of them reported a decrease in rest pain, and the ABI increased significantly in all of them. In comparison, only 1 patient from the second group reported a decrease in rest pain, and the healing of ulcers was considerable in none of them. In 4 patients from group 1 and 8 from group 2 with advanced CLI symptoms, amputations were necessary.</p><p>From the perspective of patient safety, significant adverse effects were observed in no patient. Apart from some minor discomfort at the injection sites and peripheral edema in 1 case, no other side effects were noted and &#x02013; in particular during the 90-day follow-up period &#x02013; there was no evidence of any systemic effects of VEGF in terms of the development of retinopathy or new tumor growth.</p><p>Our results also provided preliminary evidence of the potential efficiency of the MNC/gene therapy in treatment of CLI. In particular, the ABI increased significantly in 12 patients from group 1. The ABI increased from 0.29 &#x000b1;0.21 at the baseline to 0.52 &#x000b1;0.23 12 weeks after the injections. To put this in perspective, an increase in ABI of &#x0003e; 0.1 is considered to indicate a successful surgical or percutaneous intervention [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. To our knowledge, such an improvement in the ABI has not yet been achieved spontaneously or with medical therapy in patients with CLI, and the results obtained in group 2 confirm this hypothesis [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Angiography showed an increased flow in calf arterial vessels in the case of group 1. Angiograms also showed evidence of increased collaterals in all 12 survived limbs but probably underestimated the degree of collateral development as well as the size of the newly formed vessels. The significant reduction of pain after cell/gene therapy was additional evidence of improvement of blood circulation in ischemic limbs. It was randomized, but not double-blind. However, the improvement in clinical symptoms observed in our trial and the hemodynamic and imaging data should be cautiously interpreted as promising, and cannot be attributed to the placebo effect [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, the combined autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell and gene therapy seems to be a very promising form of angiogenesis induction; however, we do not know whether the early positive outcomes will last over time. Yet, it is extremely difficult to state why only 12 patients (75%) in group 1 benefited from the treatment. The poor results in 4 cases (25%) can be probably explained by advanced critical ischemia symptoms with irreversible damage to microcirculation. In these cases therapeutic neoangiogenesis was too weak a signal for the restoration of the peripheral vascular bed in critical ischemic muscles. It seems that the MNC gene therapy should be introduced earlier in such cases. Finally, we found that the combined administration of intramuscular MNC and the VEGF gene is a safe and effective method of treatment in our patients with CLI, and should be taken into consideration in patients who have run out of other treatment options.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="S0020"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dormandy</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Mahir</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Ascady</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Fate of the patient with chronic leg ischaemia.
