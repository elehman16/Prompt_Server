stabilization of the trunk of patients with chronic low back pain. The methods comprised
combination patterns of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) and ball exercise.
[Subjects and Methods] The subjects were 40 volunteers who had low back pain. All subjects
were randomly assigned to either a group which received proprioceptive neuromuscular
facilitation or a group which performed ball exercise. Measurements were taken four times
in total, at pre-intervention, two weeks later, four weeks later, and six weeks later. The
main measurement methods used were the visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain and
electromyography (EMG) for muscle activity. [Results] VAS and EMG activity were
significantly reduced in the PNF combination pattern group and the ball exercise group. A
comparison of the groups showed significant differences. In VAS and EMG activity; in
particular, the combination pattern group using PNF increased EMG activity more than the
ball exercise group did after six weeks of intervention. [Conclusion] This study showed
that PNF combination pattern training for six weeks was more effective for patients with
low back pain than performing ball exercise.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>PNF</kwd><kwd>Ball exercise</kwd><kwd>Chronic low back pain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Low back pain is classified as acute, sub-acute, or chronic according to the duration of
symptoms<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Chronic low back pain is
normally consistent back pain experienced for more than 12 weeks<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. More than 80% of the world population experiences low back
pain at least once, and 15% of that 80% suffer from chronic low back pain due to unrecovered
symptoms<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The biggest problem of low back pain is lumbar instability<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Unbalanced mobilization order among stability muscles and mobility
muscles, as well as muscle length, causes low back pain<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For patients with low back pain, deep muscle exercise is required to counteract muscle
atrophy and damage to the deep muscles<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
It was found that patients with low back pain experienced a mobilization delay in their deep
muscles, which generates activation and contraction before the movement of the limbs<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For lumbar region stability, strengthening and co-contraction of the multifidus and
transversus abdominis (TA), which are deep stability muscles, and the erector spinae (ES)
and abdominal muscles, which are superficial stabilizer muscles, is required<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In recent years, the trunk stability approach has been widely used as a method of spine
treatment, and many efforts have been made to objectively prove the effect. Among the
exercises for trunk muscle activity of patients with low back pain, the effect of ball
exercise has been reported to comprehensively improve muscle strength, endurance, and
flexibility, as well as strengthen body reflexes, sense of balance and proprioception<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, Stanton et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the Swiss ball exercise is an
effective stability exercise for trunk core muscles.</p><p>PNF has been recommended for sensory-motor control training, as well as for stimulating
lumbar muscle proprioception<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among the
PNF patterns, the motions of the sprinter (SP) and skater (SK) patterns were reported to
have the advantages of not only strengthening the muscle due to large-scale movement, but
also functional training due to active motor control, the strengthening of coordination,
increases in the active range of motion, and the efficient control of movement<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study aimed to determine effective methods for pain reduction through the activation
of the TA and the ES by comparing lumbar strengthening training using a ball, which is
generally carried out along with traditional physiotherapy treatment for lumbar
stabilization, and PNF combination patterns<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The goal was to increase patients&#x02019; muscle strength, stability, and
coordination control ability by inducing isometric contractions in manufacturing workers who
had chronic low back pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 40 adult manufacturing workers from D Industrial, located
in Daegu Metropolitan City, who had previously experienced cardiovascular system but not
orthopedic illnesses, who currently had no specific exercise plan, and carried out daily
living activities experiencing had chronic low back pain. The participants in this study
were told prior to the start of the experiment about the purpose and procedure of the
experiment, as well as potential effects of the experiment. All the participants understood
the purpose of this study and provided their written informed consent prior to their
participation in the study in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of
Helsinki. Only subjects who participated voluntarily were admitted to the experiment. The
participants were randomly and equally assigned to a PNF combination pattern group
(experimental group) and a ball exercise group (control group). The average age, height, and
weight of the experimental group were 34.75&#x000b1;0.85&#x02005;years, 174.07&#x000b1;1.05&#x02005;cm, and 71.25&#x000b1;4.59&#x02005;kg,
respectively. The average age, height, and weight of the control group were
34.20&#x000b1;0.69&#x02005;years, 172.85&#x000b1;1.24&#x02005;cm, and 70.75&#x000b1;3.81&#x02005;kg, respectively. The experimental group
performed a combination of sprinter/skater posture in a bridge position, sprinter/skater
posture in a side-lying position, sprinter/skater posture in a sitting position, and
sprinter/skater posture in a standing position for 15 minutes in parallel with PNF. The
exercise schedule was four times a week for six weeks. The ball exercise group in the
control group was told that the femoral region must be parallel to the floor while sitting
on the ball, and that their knees should maintain a 90-degree angle, using Janda&#x02019;s<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> basic principle program. Motion speed was
constant during the ball exercise. Fifteen seconds. of rest were taken between sets. The
ball exercise was done with two 20-repetition sets of pelvic tilts (anterior/posterior,
right/left, circle) while sitting on the ball. Then, two sets of hip lifts while lying back
on the ball were performed, lifting one leg while lifting the hip, lifting the hip while
bending the knees, and lifting the hip while bending the knee and lifting one leg for 10
seconds. Following this, one set of marching was performed while lying with the chest on the
ball and crunching, followed by arching while holding the ball between the calves, moving
the body right and left while lifting the legs on the ball, bridging, and right and left
stretches while leaning on the ball, for 10 seconds each. These exercises were performed
four times a week for six weeks.</p><p>The VAS was used to examine pain intensity. The participants subjectively recorded their
pain on a sheet of 10-cm-long paper divided by 10 lines. Pain was rated on a scale of 0 to
10, in which 0 indicated that the participant could not feel the symptom of low back pain
and could carry out daily life without any problems, while 10 indicated that the participant
could not stand the pain and could not conduct daily living activities at all due to
continuous severe pain. Pain measurement was performed prior to the exercises, and again at
two weeks, four weeks, and six weeks after the start of the intervention.</p><p>In order to measure muscle activity, the maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) of
each muscle was obtained by manual muscle testing, and root mean square (RMS) values of the
MVIC of each muscle were calculated. The FlexComp Infiniti EMG (Thought Technology Ltd.
Canada), a surface electromyogram (EMG), was used for muscle activity measurement. Muscle
activity was measured by attaching surface electrodes 3&#x02005;cm away from the spinous process at
the lateral side for ES, and 2&#x02005;cm from the inferior medial area of the anterior superior
iliac spine (ASIS) for TA<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The recorded
surface EMG analog signal was, converted to a digital signal, and then filtered and
processed using Infiniti software (v. 3.0) on a personal computer.</p><p>For statistical processing of data in this study, SPSS v. 18.0 was used to analyze the data
with a its significance level of &#x003b1;=0.05. In order to determine the changes in pain and
muscle activity of the PNF and ball exercise groups, repeated ANOVA measurements were
performed and the Bonferroni correction was used to compare data between measurement times.
In order to find the significance of differences between the groups with regard to muscle
activity and pain, the independent t-test was performed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The PNF combination pattern group and the ball exercise group showed significant reductions

and a weakening of muscle strength and endurance due to decreased motility. As a result, low
back movement depression can lead to increased pain in patients with chronic low back pain
and muscle fatigue. Strengthening low back muscles is essential for the reduction of low
back pain<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, this study aimed
to determine whether conduct of the PNF combination pattern and ball exercise were effective
at increasing trunk muscle activity in patients with chronic low back pain, in order to find
an effective method of exercise for chronic low back pain.</p><p>In this study, low back pain was assessed using the VAS in order to determine the effect of
the exercise treatment on the subjective pain intensity of patients with low back pain. Pain
intensity significantly decreased in both groups following treatment. The reason for the
reduction in pain in both groups was the training of unbalanced trunk muscles, which induced
an interaction between the trunk muscles which reduced pain. In a related study, Lee et
al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> reported a significant reduction
in pain of patients with chronic low back pain after training the patients with a ball, a
result consistent with our study result. Kofotolis and Kellis<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> also reported the reduction of pain in the lumbar muscle of
patients with chronic low back pain after a PNF program consisting of static and dynamic PNF
programs, a result which was also consistent with our study result. Furthermore, our present
study also showed that pain reduction was greater in the PNF combination pattern group than
in the ball exercise group after six weeks of training. The reasons for this are that the
PNF combination patterns used a technique that used the limbs to indirectly affect the pain
area in a posture which did not cause pain to the patients with low back pain, in order to
avoid direct stimulation of the pain area. In particular, the PNF technique is one that
controls the proprioception and sensory-motor functions to reduce pain further. Nachemson et
al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that extensor muscles
are more closely related to low back pain than flexor muscles. In this study, the PNF
combination patterns technique started in a side-lying position, which was followed by a
standing position, so the extensors acted as an anti-gravity muscle, thereby strengthening
extensor muscle strength to effectively reduce pain.</p><p>Hodges and Richardson<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
unbalanced trunk muscles in patients with chronic low back pain should be trained to balance
the trunk muscles interactively, and that trunk muscle strength was an essential element for
maintaining spinal stability, so that muscle strength becomes be a foundational support for
maintaining balance. In that sense, the PNF combination pattern and ball exercise groups in
our study significantly reduced low back pain through the balanced training of trunk muscles
and training induced increase in muscle strength. In a similar study, Kofotolis and
Kellis<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> directly applied the PNF
technique to the shoulder area of the trunk for four weeks. They reported that trunk
endurance increased significantly by indirectly inducing the motion of the trunk, giving
resistance to the limbs.</p><p>In this study, while muscle activity increased in both the PNF combination pattern ball
exercise groups, the PNF combination pattern group showed a more significant increase than
the ball exercise group. This can be explained by the fact that the PNF combination patterns
technique concentrated on sprinter and skater patterns, and that trunk muscle activity
increased more than in the lumbar stabilization group using ball exercise, which used a
combination of isotonic techniques. Accordingly, we anticipate that low back pain would be
reduced if the sprinter and skater PNF combination patterns used in this study are applied
to patients with chronic low back pain, in order to improve trunk stability. Therefore, our
study results can be a clinical foundation for the effectiveness of exercise treatment for
trunk muscle stabilization of patients with chronic low back pain.</p><p>Our study had several limitations. First, the intensity of the application of the isotonic
combination was not uniform when the PNF combination patterns were applied. Also, we did not
measure the subjects&#x02019; balance abilities, so the quantitative improvement of balance ability
due to improvement of stabilizing muscles could not be presented. In the future, the
limitations of this study can be overcome by demonstrating the appropriate application
intensity and proper way of measuring balance ability in order to verify the effectiveness
of the PNF combination patterns.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Wheeler</surname><given-names>AH</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Diagnosis and management of low back pain and
