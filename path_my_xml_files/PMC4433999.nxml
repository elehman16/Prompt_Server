exercise on the balance abilities of elderly individuals by comparing ball exercise with
virtual reality exercise. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty elderly individuals residing in
communities were randomly divided into a virtual reality game group and a ball exercise
group and conducted exercise for 30&#x02005;min 3 times a week for 8 weeks. [Results] Step length
increased significantly, and the average sway speed and Timed Up and Go time significantly
decreased in both groups. A comparison of sway length after the intervention between the
two groups revealed that the virtual reality game exercise resulted in a reduction than
the ball exercise. [Conclusion] The results of this study indicated that the virtual
reality game exercise may improve balance and gait of elderly individuals in
communities.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Elderly</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd><kwd>Virtual reality exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Regular exercises performed by the elderly can improve walking, balance, muscle strength,

approaches in indoor environments and to guarantee the safety of elderly individuals. In
addition, there are difficulties in observing and enforcing exercise at home, which is why
it is difficult to identify the effects of constant balance exercises<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In recent years, intervention methods based on virtual reality have been introduced<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Virtual reality refers to interactive
simulations in which computer hardware and software are used that enable users to have
virtual experiences that are similar to reality<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In virtual reality, a user moves and controls objects and performs
predetermined tasks by reacting as if they are performing the actions in reality<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. This method can increase motivational
effects while the users perform tasks with interest and fun<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As described above, virtual reality has been studied to overcome limitations in existing
interventions, and preventive medicine exercises can be applied with it to prevent falling
in the elderly. However, the existing studies are limited because they only studied the
balance ability of the elderly after the application of virtual reality exercise programs,
and most of them only focused on comparing the application of virtual reality programs and
exercises that combined a virtual reality exercise program and a visual and auditory sensory
feedback exercises. Thus, it is necessary to compare virtual reality exercise with balance
exercises that involve other tasks and are set in other environments. To achieve this goal,
this study aimed to test the effects of ball exercise as a general exercise on the balance
abilities of elderly individuals by comparing ball exercise with virtual reality
exercise.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 30 elderly individuals living in Daegu Metropolitan City, a
local community. The subject selection criteria were as follows: over 65&#x02005;years old, no fall
experience within the most recent year, and no disease that could affect performance during
the experiment. Additionally, elderly individuals with visual and auditory sense damage or
vestibular system problems who could not understand the experimental tasks were excluded.
All the subjects understood the purpose of this study and provided written informed consent
prior to participation in the study in accordance with the ethical standards of the
Declaration of Helsinki (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">VR</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BE</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (M/F)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9/3</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10/2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">66.5&#x000b1;8.1</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.2&#x000b1;7.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">163.3&#x000b1;7.2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">164.2&#x000b1;5.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.3&#x000b1;8.1</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.0&#x000b1;4.2</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Mean&#x000b1;SD.

group. They performed their exercises for 30&#x02005;min 3 times a week for 8 weeks. Three subjects
in each group voluntarily withdrew in the middle of the experiment due to personal matters.
The virtual reality game exercises were chosen from the Wii Fit balance exercise
game/program: Soccer Heading, Snowboard Slalom, and Table Tilt. The subjects spent 10&#x02005;min on
each game for a total of 30&#x02005;min.</p><p>In the Soccer Heading game, the participant &#x0201c;heads&#x0201d; soccer balls as they fly towards them
by shifting his/her body weight to the left and right. In the Snowboard Slalom game, the
participant must pass certain flags one at a time while riding a virtual snowboard by moving
his/her body up and down in the side-standing position. In the Table Tilt game, the
participant moves his/her body in the forward, backward, right, and left directions freely
to get a ball to fall into a hole in the floor.</p><p>The ball game exercise was based on the program principles proposed by Janda<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. It consisted of 20&#x02005;min of bouncing,
pelvic tilting in the right and left directions, pelvic tilting in the forward and backward
directions, and the pelvic circle while sitting on an exercise ball and 10&#x02005;min of tilting
the body to the right and left sides while putting the legs on the ball in the supine
position, bending the knees, and putting the soles of the feet on the ball to form a bridge
positon, for a total of 30&#x02005;min of exercise.</p><p>In this study, the 30 sec sway length and average sway speed with the open eyes and gazing
at the front on the top of an analysis system with biofeedback (AP1153, BioRescue, RM
Ing&#x000e9;nierie, Rodez, France) were measured to determine the subjects&#x02019; static balance abilities
before and after the intervention, and a Timed Up and Go (TUG) test was performed to
determine the subjects&#x02019; dynamic balance abilities. All measurements were expressed as means
and standard deviations.</p><p>PASW Statistics for Windows (version 18.0) was used to analyze the data in this study. To
determine if there were any differences before and after the intervention, a paired t-test
was used, while an independent t-test was used to determine any differences between the
groups. The statistical significance level was set at &#x003b1; = 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>After the intervention, both groups showed a decreased their sway length (p &#x0003c; 0.05),

Shumway-Cook and Woollacott<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> defined balance as the ability to maintain
the center of mass on the base of support. Dynamic balance exercise in particular can reduce
the fall risk factor significantly<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, both the virtual reality game group and the ball exercise group showed a
significantly reduced sway length and average sway speed after the 8-week intervention. In
particular, the virtual reality game group showed a greater decrease in sway length than the
ball exercise group, which reveals that dynamic balance exercise can also affect static
balance abilities.</p><p>In this regard, the effect of introducing virtual reality-based interventions is
positive<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, because they can provide
immediate visual and auditory feedback concerning the exercise results, thereby increasing
the exercise learning effect. This suggests the possibility of using virtual reality-based
games/programs for a broad range of exercise applications<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, the virtual reality game group also showed an increase in TUG time,
revealing improved balance abilities. A study by Walker et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, in which traditional physical therapy and balance
training using visual feedback training and verbal and tactile signals, proved the effects
of visual perception feedback training by improving the TUG time. A study by Geiger et
al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, in which biofeedback/force plate
training and existing balance improvement exercise were compared, also showed improvements
in balance ability, since the TUG time was reduced after the intervention. A study by
Cikajlo et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>, in which remote
rehabilitation using virtual reality tasks was studied, also reported improvement in the TUG
time after the intervention.</p><p>In the present study, which compared functional balance factors before and after the
experiment, the virtual reality game group showed significant differences between before and
after the experiment, whereas no significant difference was found in the ball exercise
group. The above comparison results between the two groups showed that the elderly
individuals did not move within a predetermined movement boundary but rather moved into
larger areas to perform social activities. This study has some limitations, since the study
subjects were limited to patients who satisfied the selection criteria set in this study and
were within the designated geographical area.</p><p>For future research, such limitations can be overcome by studying more older individuals,
and it is necessary to study the effects of long-term exercise over 3 months and changes in
the environment. Furthermore, we hope that more virtual reality exercise programs will be
available for the elderly in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Jacobson</surname><given-names>BH</given-names></name><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Wallace</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Independent static balance training contributes to
