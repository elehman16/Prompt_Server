A total of 72 pregnant women will be studied; 36 gestational diabetics will undergo an aquatic physical exercise program in a thermal pool, 3 times per week over 2&#x000a0;months. The primary endpoint will be glucose level control and use of insulin; secondary endpoints will be the following maternal and fetal outcomes: weight gain during pregnancy, blood pressure, pre-eclampsia diagnosis, intrauterus growth restriction, preterm birth, Cesarean section, macrosomia and maternal or neonatal intensive care admission.

According to the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) and based on the new screening criteria for GDM from the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes (HAPO) study, the incidence of GDM has reached almost 18% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. GDM has been associated with significant rates of adverse perinatal outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Both GDM women and their offspring also have a high risk of developing obesity, type 2 diabetes and metabolic disease throughout life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Physical activity improves glucose utilization by increasing insulin sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Physical activity can delay the progression of impaired glucose tolerance in type 2 patients and also contributes to overweight/obesity control, reduction of medication dose and cardiovascular risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Physical exercise is safe for pregnant women and has been recommended at a level of 30&#x000a0;minutes or more on most days of the week, as a helpful adjunctive therapy for GDM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Physical activity during pregnancy may contribute to improved levels of maternal glucose tolerance and help prevent GDM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, a Cochrane systematic review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend, or advise against, diabetic pregnant women enrolling in exercise programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The physical properties of water make aquatic exercise ideal and safe for pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Aquatic exercise has been recommended during pregnancy due to it having less impact on articulation, and its ability to increase amniotic fluid diuresis and decrease edema, blood pressure and back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, aquatic exercise during pregnancy may decrease maternal stress, discomfort and improve health-promoting behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, there is insufficient evidence on aquatic exercise due to poor methodological and reporting quality and heterogeneity of non-randomized clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Specifically in relation to GDM, there are no clinical trials testing aquatic exercise as an adjunctive treatment.</p><sec><title>Hypothesis</title><p>Aquatic physical exercise is feasible for diabetic pregnant women and contributes to better glycemic control and decreases adverse perinatal outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Research goals</title><p>To verify the efficacy of an aquatic physical exercise program on GDM control and adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Setting and recruitment</title><p>The study will take place at Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof. Fernando Figueira (IMIP), Brazil.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of an aquatic physical exercise program on GDM outcomes. Water provides resistance to muscle movement, resulting in higher workout intensities without gravitational stress and pain as well as a massaging effect. These effects may facilitate the practice of physical exercise by pregnant women and thus increase compliance.</p><p>During pregnancy, women decrease their physical activity level, especially in the last trimester. Physical exercise in water is more feasible and may be more suitable for pregnant women. Additionally, doing exercise in groups can contribute to socialization and help ensure greater adherence.</p><p>Although our study will be performed in tropical weather, temperature approximately 28&#x000b0;C to 30&#x000b0;C&#x000a0;year round, by using a thermal pool our results can be extrapolated to other regions with colder temperatures.</p><p>This project has several methodological strengths. First, it is safe for pregnant women. Aquatic physical exercise will be supervised by a physiotherapist, all participants will wear a heart rate monitor and the intensity of the physical exercise will be low to moderate. Only women who live in the metropolitan region will be included and all transportation cost will be covered. Bathing suits and lunch will also be supplied to the participants. We believe that these measures will ensure greater adherence to the study.</p><p>Our study has some methodological weaknesses that will be taken into account, but that are unlikely to influence ours findings. Our close monitoring of physical activity among all participants via the wearing of a pedometer may allow us to verify if the two groups are maintaining the same physical activity level outside of the aquatic physical exercise.</p><p>In conclusion, this study is expected to provide findings that may reveal the true effect of aquatic physical exercise on GDM control.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>This trial is registered under: NCT01940003.
