Since the long-term survival rates for mastectomy and for lumpectomy with radiation therapy are comparable, patients&#x02019; informed preferences are important for decision-making. Although most clinicians believe that they do include patients in the decision-making process, the information that women with breast cancer receive regarding the surgical options is often rather subjective, and does not invite patients to express their preferences. Shared decision-making (SDM) is meant to help patients clarify their preferences, resulting in greater satisfaction with their final choice. Patient decision aids can be very supportive in SDM. We present the protocol of a study to &#x003b2; test a patient decision aid and optimise strategies for the implementation of SDM regarding the treatment of early-stage breast cancer in the actual clinical setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This paper concerns a pre-implementation and post-implementation study, lasting from October 2014 to June 2015. The intervention consists of implementing SDM using a patient decision aid. The intervention will be evaluated using qualitative and quantitative measures, acquired prior to, during and after the implementation of SDM. Outcome measures are knowledge about treatment, perceived SDM and decisional conflict. We will also conduct face-to-face interviews with a sample of these patients and their care providers, to assess their experiences with the implementation of SDM and the patient decision aid.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This protocol was approved by the Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC) ethics committee. The findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journal articles and presentations at national conferences. Findings will be used to finalise a multi-faceted implementation strategy to test the implementation of SDM and a patient decision aid in terms of cost-effectiveness, in a multicentre cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT).</p></sec><sec><title>Study registration number</title><p>NTR4879.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Shared decision making</kwd><kwd>Quality improvement</kwd><kwd>Patient preferences</kwd><kwd>Patient participation</kwd><kwd>Decision support Techniques</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Several studies have revealed that mastectomy and breast-conserving surgery with radiation therapy are comparable in terms of local control and long-term survival.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In addition, some studies found no difference in quality of life between patients treated with breast-conserving treatment or mastectomy, while other studies reported higher quality of life after breast-conserving treatment compared with mastectomy.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Many patients with early-stage breast cancer face the dilemma of choosing between these two options when considering breast surgery. Deciding between these two can be regarded as being influenced by patient preferences.</p><p>Evidence is growing that patient preferences may vary substantially between individuals.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In addition to survival, important factors in the decision-making process are the patient's age, family history and preference for reconstruction and quality of life. At the time of diagnosis, patients with breast cancer have their own values, concerns and knowledge, which can influence their treatment preferences.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>There is also increasing evidence that most patients want to be involved in treatment decisions.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> For many patients, greater involvement in cancer treatment decisions can improve their knowledge about treatment benefits, enhance their satisfaction with the decision and improve their quality of life.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> It is important to present the information to patients as neutrally as possible and to involve them in the decision, in order to achieve a tailor-made, personalised treatment plan. Shared decision-making (SDM) is regarded as a promising model to achieve such patient involvement. SDM has been defined as: &#x0201c;an approach where clinicians and patients share the best available evidence when faced with the task of making decisions, and where patients are supported to consider options, to achieve informed preferences&#x0201d;.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Nevertheless, there is a problem with the implementation of SDM in clinical practice. Physicians typically feel they do not have the time, or lack the skills, to offer a complete and balanced presentation of the pros and cons of suitable medical options.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> One measure to support SDM would be to use a patient decision aid,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref> which provides information facilitating discussion and deliberation about treatment options. There is strong evidence that these aids are effective in achieving informed preferences and decisions that are more in line with patient preferences.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The distribution and use of patient decision aids is also associated with increased knowledge about options and decreased decisional conflict.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>We feel that integrating a patient decision aid in the daily workflow at the clinic is the first move towards implementing more uniform and objective SDM in an actual oncology setting. In the USA and the UK, patient decision aids have been implemented as part of a usual care programme in breast cancer centres. Both programmes consist of various decision aid materials, including videos and booklets. In addition, both programmes provide tools involving question listing, audiorecording and note-taking services by trained associates, who are either premedical interns or professional counsellors.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Although these are excellent initiatives, one should be cautious about merely copying these approaches, as implementation should take political, cultural and economic conditions into consideration.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>The challenge is to feasibly embed SDM and the patient decision aid in the clinical practice workflow. It is well known that the implementation of new methods in clinical practice can be difficult, as clinicians have busy schedules filled with daily routines and there is often no obvious motivation nor time to change them.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Implementation strategies which do not focus on the problems that health professionals&#x02019; experiences are less effective in accomplishing change.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>One single intervention is probably insufficient to achieve successful implementation of SDM using patient decision aids in clinical practice, so a systematic approach and careful planning of implementation activities is needed.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Achieving successful implementation requires devoting attention to the process of developing the patient decision aid, its scientific basis, its format and its content. The implementation of change model describes the involvement of different target groups in the &#x02018;development, testing and execution of an implementation&#x02019;.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Objectives and research questions</title><p>The objectives of this project are to pilot-test and optimise strategies for the implementation of SDM for patients with early-stage breast cancer in an actual clinical setting.</p><p>Our hypothesis is that a multifaceted strategy would enable us to implement SDM in such a way that it meets the needs and demands of professionals and patients, without disrupting daily practice.</p><p>Primary research questions to support the development of the implementation strategy are:

This draft was &#x003b1; tested in a first trial round for professionals and patients. The decision aid is expected to be an easy-to-use website, which is made available to patients included in the study through a link and a password. It offers an explanation of the surgical options, as well as a brief overview of considerations that could be relevant to women regarding their own values, preferences and concerns, and enables patients to navigate through the decision aid. Comprehensive information is presented about mastectomy and breast-conserving surgery, including numerical information about survival and recurrence rates, pros and cons of treatments and the side effects. The verbal information is supported by pictures and graphs. Finally, the information is summarised in a factsheet. The decision aid further includes a number of questions to help women identify their values.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> To make the information more accessible during the consultation, we have developed an additional options grid, in the form of a one-page table summarising the treatment options, which can also be used at home.</p><p>The patient decision aid will be made available to clinicians in February 2015. Participating clinicians need to learn to use the patient decision aid correctly. To achieve this, they will be instructed regarding SDM and its favourable effects. The instructions include a compact e-learning component with role modelling and suggestions for integrating the patient decision aid in the clinical pathway and for task delegation.

We aim to evaluate the feasibility of the measurement instruments and the potential effect of the implementation strategies (instructions and patient decision aid) on the performance and experience of SDM compared with a historical control group, to enable a power calculation for a large multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT).</p></sec><sec id="s6b"><title>Sample size</title><p><italic>Limitations of the sampling process</italic> in view of the available time, the size of the target group and the nature of the intervention, it is not possible to conduct a random sampling. During the course of the study, all patients with early-stage breast cancer in the participating hospitals will be invited to participate, until we reach the number of 10 participants for each hospital. Thus, over a certain period, the entire accessible population will be studied.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Inviting all members of the accessible population reduces the risk of bias. According to Johanson and Brooks,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> a number of 30&#x02013;40 patients is recommended for a pilot study whose purpose is a preliminary survey. The sample size in this study meets these recommendations.</p><p><italic>Sample size for qualitative data collection</italic> in qualitative studies tends to be small. The number of participants needed depends on the point where data saturation is reached. Data saturation is expected to occur after 12 participants have been interviewed, provided these patients are not verbally vulnerable.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Since little is known about SDM and the use of patient decision aids in the clinical setting with respect to this data, this study will include 20 patients who are exposed to the intervention. We thus expect that data saturation will occur and that the process will yield rich and in-depth findings.</p></sec><sec id="s6c"><title>Implementation of the intervention</title><p>Achieving success requires a systematic approach and careful planning of the implementation strategy. Joseph-Williams <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> argues that barriers could be overcome by behavioural changes at the level of the patient, clinicians/healthcare team and the organisation in daily care. In this study, we primarily focus on the clinicians/healthcare team and the organisation, since interventions are successfully implemented when barriers regarding these factors are overcome.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>Worldwide training programmes on SDM vary greatly in what they offer and how they present it. In addition, evidence of their effectiveness is inconclusive.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> We have opted for e-learning because the purpose in this study is to examine the support and assistance required to develop suitable educational programmes in an RCT. E-learning might be a promising strategy to support the implementation of SDM and patient decision aids in actual clinical settings.</p></sec><sec id="s6d"><title>Measures</title><p>The SDM-Q9 is a recently developed instrument measuring the perceptions of the stakeholders of the SDM process.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> We decided to use this instrument because of the dyadic approach in SDM. Doctors and patients are acknowledged and seen as equally involved in the consultation and decision-making. A study concerning the use of the dyadic OPTION scale supports this dyadic approach.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>The process of SDM will be analysed in this study by means of the OPTION scale. This scale has been validated and is based on the phases of SDM. In her review, Stacey found two studies using the OPTION scale to evaluate the interaction between patient and professional. Recently, the Observer OPTION 5 item was introduced as an instrument focusing on essential aspects of SDM, providing shorter measurements. Despite its promising results, it needs more empirical work<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> to explore its scientific value. To the best of our knowledge, there are few studies combining all of these measurements to gain extensive insights into the process of SDM and the implementation of a patient decision aid.</p><p>We originally intended to measure decisional conflict immediately after the completion of surgical treatment. However, based on recommendations by the professionals, whose experience is that satisfaction or regret does not occur until later in the process, we decided to measure decisional conflict 3&#x02005;months after the surgical treatment.</p><p>In conclusion, this study seeks to examine the main obstacles and success factors for the implementation of SDM using a patient decision aid, and to determine the most favourable way to integrate this in the clinical pathway. In addition, we will investigate the impact of this implementation on several outcome variables. These will be used as a basis to design a multifaceted complex implementation strategy, with the intention of testing the implementation of SDM and a patient decision aid in a multicentre cluster RCT.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> WS, AM and TvdW developed the study protocol.
