Mild hypothermia is currently the only available treatment in widespread clinical use [<xref rid="pone.0170545.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], though difficult to achieve in low income countries. Thus, an affordable, technically uncomplicated alternative is highly desirable. When caffeine was given to treat apneas cerebral palsy significantly diminished [<xref rid="pone.0170545.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], suggesting that caffeine might be a candidate for the treatment of brain HI.</p><p>Much is published concerning the risk of adverse effects of caffeine use. Dosage is of major importance since caffeine is a competitive inhibitor of adenosine A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2A</sub> and A<sub>2B</sub> receptors at lower doses whereas higher concentrations inhibit phosphodiesterase, responsible for many of the adverse effects reported [<xref rid="pone.0170545.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Available prospective randomized studies of perinatal use have been unable to show adverse effects of clinically relevant doses of caffeine [<xref rid="pone.0170545.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>We investigated morphological, behavioral and immunological outcomes after HI in neonatal mice randomized to caffeine or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) treatment. Since the nature of caffeine's immunomodulatory effects has been questioned [<xref rid="pone.0170545.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], a broad spectrum of brain and spleen immune cell populations were investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>All experiments were approved by the regional ethics committee, Stockholms norra djurf&#x000f6;rs&#x000f6;ksetiska n&#x000e4;mnd, in accordance with local institutional guidelines and the Directive 2010/63/EU.</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Hypoxic ischemic brain injury</title><p>The modified Vannucci model was used and evaluated with morphology and behavioral tests.

WT C57/bl6 specific pathogen free (SPF) mice (Charles River Laboratories) of either sex were used, with free access to pelleted food and housed in open cages with standard enrichment with daily monitoring of the animals in accordance with local institutional guidelines. Pups were kept with their mother at all times except during surgery and hypoxia.

In accordance with previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0170545.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], three levels of each brain were collected, corresponding to bregma 1.3 mm, -1.64 mm and -2.92 mm in the adult mouse brain using cryostat 10&#x02013;12 &#x003bc;m sections. Tissue sections were fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked by 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in 3% Normal Horse Serum for 10 min. Microtubule associated protein-2 (MAP-2) staining VECTOR&#x000ae; M.O.M.&#x02122; Immunodetection Kit and VECTASTAIN&#x000ae; Elite ABC-Peroxidase Kit were used according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s specifications. The enzymatic coloration of immunoreactivity was performed by simultaneous full immersion in 3,3&#x000b4;-diaminobenzidine, DAB for all slides. Imaging was performed with a Nikon eclipse E800 microscope with an Olympus DP70 camera with DP controller, and version 3.1.1.267 acquisition software. Percent MAP-2 stained area and infarction size were manually delineated using Adobe Photoshop version 12.0.4 in brain slices with investigators blinded to genotype and treatment. Atrophy was calculated as the remaining tissue loss not described by the infarction area delineated by loss of MAP-2 compared to the uninjured hemisphere using the formula 1-(Damaged hemisphere area including infarction area)/(Undamaged hemisphere area) [<xref rid="pone.0170545.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Behavioral tests</title><p>Behavioral assessments were done at 24 days age, two weeks after HI in caffeine or PBS treated animals (n = 29 and n = 13 respectively). Open Field test (Kungsbacka M&#x000e4;t- och Reglerteknik AB, Fj&#x000e4;r&#x000e5;s, Sweden) was used to investigate explorative behavior during 30 min. The animals were taken directly from their home litters and put in the open field box without further handling. In addition, the beam walking test, where mice walk three times back and forth on a beam (10 mm wide, 600 mm long), was performed directly after the open field test.

Debris was manually removed using a polygon gate in forward and side scatter. A curvfilter was used to filter out immune cell populations. Dead cells were excluded using DAPI stain. Negative population was selected as reference and cells with higher expression than that were regarded as positive cells. Median fluorescent intensities of the selected populations were used to discriminate between positive and negative populations. The same filter settings were used for each marker in all brain samples.

This confirms the neuroprotective properties of caffeine reported in humans [<xref rid="pone.0170545.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0170545.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Of note, caffeine could potentially be administered trough breast feeding since prenatal continuous maternal caffeine intake reduces brain damage after neonatal HI in rats [<xref rid="pone.0170545.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Of all immune populations investigated, only activated brain CD8<sup>+</sup>CD69<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocytes 24h after HI differed significantly between caffeine and PBS. This indicates an immunomodulatory effect while caffeine is present with no apparent long term consequences. Since caffeine breakdown is slower in infants than adults, a sufficient caffeine concentration could be expected for as long as 24h but hardly for 72h or two weeks [<xref rid="pone.0170545.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Admittedly, immune effects able to influence outcome are possible earlier than 24h after brain HI. However, our primary concern in this study was long term alterations, since the fear of persistent adverse effects have hampered the proceeding of caffeine as a neuroprotective agent.</p><p>With reference to mild or no persistent adverse effects, simplicity of administration and favorable pharmacokinetics we argue that studies addressing the therapeutic use of caffeine for neuroprotection after neonatal HI in larger animals prior to controlled prospective randomized clinical trials are urgently warranted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec010"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0170545.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Magnification of MAP-2 staining of brain.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0170545.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0170545.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Flow cytometry dataset.</title><p>(CSV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0170545.s002.csv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0170545.s003"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Antibodies used.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0170545.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0170545.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Jacobs</surname><given-names>SE</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hunt</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Tarnow-Mordi</surname><given-names>WO</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Inder</surname><given-names>TE</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>PG</given-names></name>. <article-title>Cochrane Review: Cooling for newborns with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy</article-title>. <source>Evidence-Based Child Health: A Cochrane Review Journal</source>. <year>2008</year>;<volume>3</volume>(<issue>4</issue>):<fpage>1049</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>115</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0170545.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Roberts</surname><given-names>RS</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Doyle</surname><given-names>LW</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Barrington</surname><given-names>KJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ohlsson</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
