Early-onset nausea incidence was 46% after xenon and 35% after sevoflurane anesthesia (p = 0.138).

Depending on the type of anesthesia its incidence can attain 20&#x02013;30% in an average population [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Higher PONV rates have been found in sensitive subjects [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. PONV can be distinguished between an early phase in the first 2h after anesthesia, and a late phase between 2 and 24h following anesthesia [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. PONV affects individual comfort [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and might even influence the surgical outcome [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Despite individually predisposing factors, the use of volatile and gaseous anesthetics has been identified as one of the main causes for PONV in sensitive subjects [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Several strategies graded according to individual risk have been evaluated for PONV prevention and treatment [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The noble gas xenon is an anesthetic with many advantageous effects [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], e.g. its hemodynamic stability [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and its experimental neuroprotection [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Xenon is an antagonist at the 5- HT3-receptor and thus might exert antiemetic properties [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A recent observational study found a lower rate of PONV than predicted by individual Apfel score following xenon anesthesia in a mixed patient population [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, randomized clinical studies have shown a higher PONV incidence after xenon anesthesia compared to propofol [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>The primary aim of this study was to investigate the development of nausea following xenon anesthesia in PONV sensitive subjects and compare it to the volatile anesthetic sevoflurane. The secondary aim was to further estimate the efficacy of dexamethasone as a preventive prophylactic to reduce xenon-induced nausea.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Study Design and Ethics</title><p>The study was designed and performed as a mono-center, factorial, randomized controlled clinical trial according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The factorial design consisted of several distinct study arms [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], of which the occurrence and prophylaxis of nausea following xenon anesthesia is subjected here. The study subjects were blinded to the randomized anesthetic, and the prophylactic antiemetic treatment was administered in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled manner.</p><p>This study was designed to test nausea incidence following volatile anesthesia in PONV-sensitive subjects (Apfel score &#x02265; 2). Thus, the design inherited a possibly higher risk for participants to develop nausea and/or vomiting. All subjects were explicitly informed about this possibly elevated risk of nausea and/or vomiting during their study participation before obtaining written informed consent. Furthermore, it was determined in the study protocol that randomized study subjects who dropped out of the study procedure were not replaced to avoid any possible risk of repeating cases with severe nausea. Ethical approval for this study was provided by the ethics committee of the Medical Faculty of the University Hospital RWTH Aachen in Germany on 24 October 2008 (Chairperson: Professor G. Schmalzing, MD; reference number: EK 110/08). This design was furthermore approved by the German official authority for supervision and approval of pharmaceuticals (Bundesinstitut fuer Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte). The trial was registered at the EMA (EudraCT No.: 2008-004132-20) and at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT No.: 00793663) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">http://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Subjects</title><p>Enrolment was performed between November 2008 and March 2011. Study physicians screened all patients scheduled for elective abdominal surgery (i.e. gynecological, urological or abdominal surgery, with either open or laparoscopic approach) with a planned duration &#x02265; 60 min and a planned admission to the ward after post anesthesia care unit (PACU) stay. This procedure led to a screening rate of approx. 5 patients per day and an approx. total of 3000 patients over the recruitment period. A screening log was not implemented. After written informed consent, 220 patients aged 18&#x02013;75 years, ASA status I-II and Apfel&#x02019;s simplified PONV predicting score of 2&#x02013;4 (i.e. a PONV likelihood of about 40&#x02013;80%) [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] were enrolled in the trial. Enrolment was performed by the study physicians. Among exclusion criteria were severe cardiac, respiratory, liver or kidney function disorders, known or suspected allergic reaction to one of the study medications, suspicion of malignant hyperthermia, pregnancy/lactation period, legal incapacity to give informed consent and refusal to participate.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Randomization</title><p>Two independent permuted-block randomizations were performed; the first for type of anesthesia (Xenon vs. Sevoflurane; block size 10; allocation ratio 1:1), and the second for type of prophylactic (dexamethasone vs. placebo; block size 10; allocation ratio 1:1). The randomization lists were generated by computer allocation using a randomization-software (RandList version 1.2, DatInf) by a member of the clinic staff independent from the study team and sealed in an opaque envelope and locked in an office cupboard only accessible for the head investigator in case of emergency unblinding due to a serious adverse event. Randomization codes for the type of anesthesia were sealed in opaque envelopes parameterized with the corresponding study number on the outside, and were opened by the study physician on the day of surgery shortly before the start of intervention. Anesthesia technique was blinded to the participants throughout their trial participation. Randomization codes for the type of prophylactic treatment were consigned to the hospital pharmacy, who received an email with the according study number on the eve of surgery for each individual participant. The hospital pharmacy then provided a blinded syringe containing the randomized prophylactic treatment in equal amount of liquid, marked with the individual study number. Participants, study physicians, and outcome assessors were blinded to the type of prophylactic treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Trial Procedure</title><p>A sketch of the study procedure is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153807.g001">Fig 1</xref>. Following premedication with oral midazolam 7.5 mg 45 min before induction, general anesthesia was induced by a bolus of propofol (2.0 mg<sup>1</sup>kg<sup>-1</sup> initially, repeating dose if considered necessary 0.5&#x02013;1.0 mg<sup>1</sup>kg<sup>-1</sup>) and 0.5 &#x003bc;g<sup>1</sup>kg<sup>-1</sup>min<sup>-1</sup> remifentanil infusion for 60s. Endotracheal intubation was facilitated by 0.6 mg<sup>1</sup>kg<sup>-1</sup> rocuronium. Xenon or sevoflurane wash-in was started with a target end-tidal concentration of 60&#x000b1;5 vol.% xenon or 2&#x000b1;0.2 vol.% sevoflurane in min. 30% oxygen. Within the first hour patients received a single injection of randomized prophylactic treatment (dexamethasone 4 mg or placebo NaCl 0.9%, provided by the hospital pharmacy in a blinded syringe, same liquid volume with the concordant study number). General anesthesia was maintained through inhalation of xenon or sevoflurane and supported by remifentanil infusion titrated to clinical needs. Standard monitoring included pulse oximetry, three channel ECG, non-invasive arterial blood pressure measurement, control of the tube cuff pressure, neuromuscular monitoring, core temperature, assessment of end-tidal oxygen, end-tidal carbon dioxide and end-tidal anesthetic gas concentration. Vital parameters (i.e. heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (AS/3 monitor, GE Datex-Ohmeda, Helsinki, Finland), end-tidal O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>) were automatically recorded throughout anesthesia at 10s intervals and logged every five min. End-tidal concentrations of anesthetics and infusion rate of remifentanil were logged at the same intervals. Depth of anesthesia was assessed by standard physiological criteria [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Normoxia, a physiological carbon dioxide concentration and normal body temperature were maintained. Medical quality xenon in steel cylinders was provided by Air Liquide Sant&#x000e9; International (Paris, France). Sevoflurane was provided by Abbott (Wiesbaden, Germany). Both anesthetic agents were administered using a closed circuit respirator (Felix Dual<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Taema, France) with concordant software allowing the use of xenon only under closed circuit conditions [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0153807.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0153807.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Study procedure.</title><p>A simplified sketch of the study procedure is shown in Fig 1. After obtaining written informed consent and baseline examination, patients were first randomized to receive xenon or sevoflurane anesthesia for their individually scheduled surgery, then randomized to receive dexamethasone or placebo for prophylaxis of post-operative nausea.

Patients were monitored for 24h following anesthesia in fixed intervals (during PACU stay at 0, 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 105, 120 min until discharge as well as 2h, 6h, and 24h post anesthesia).

Twenty minutes ahead of the estimated end of surgery piritramide 0.05 mg<sup>1</sup>kg<sup>-1</sup>, and either paracetamol 10 mg<sup>1</sup>kg<sup>-1</sup> or metamizole 15 mg<sup>1</sup>kg<sup>-1</sup> were administered for post-anesthetic pain management. Remifentanil was stopped when all painful interventions were terminated. Anesthesia was discontinued by washing out of the inhalational anesthetic via high-flow 100% oxygen when all surgical interventions including bandaging were terminated and complete recovery from neuromuscular block was assured. Extubation was accomplished when patients&#x02019; upper airway reflexes were recovered, breathing was regular and sufficient (breathing frequency &#x0003e;8 min<sup>-1</sup>; breathing volume &#x0003e;6 ml<sup>1</sup>kg<sup>-1</sup>), and patients were able to react on demand (eye opening, swallowing, breathing). Patients were observed in the operation room until full recovery, and then transported to the post anesthetic care unit (PACU) for further observation. Pain medication (piritramide 0.02&#x02013;0.05 mg<sup>1</sup>kg<sup>-1</sup>) was titrated to clinical needs.</p><p>Nausea was assessed asking subjects about their individual nausea levels rated with an eleven-point numeric rating scale (NRS) with &#x02018;0&#x02019; indicating no nausea and &#x02018;10&#x02019; indicating worst nausea ever experienced. Patients were measured at fixed time-points upon admission to the PACU, after five and fifteen minutes and thereafter in fifteen-minute intervals.

Occurrence of vomiting and number of vomiting episodes were assessed in the same intervals. At the end of their study participation (24h post anesthesia) patients were asked to rate the individual quality of their anesthesia with a six-point rating scale according to the German school grade system, with 1 as best and 6 as worst.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Statistics</title><p>The primary outcome parameter was the development of early-onset nausea defined as NRS &#x02265; 2 at any time-point in the 0-2h PACU interval. The parameter nausea was selected as the most sensitive (in general nausea as a symptom of PONV appears first) and most reliable (subjects do not vomit without nausea) determinant characterizing PONV. Secondary outcome parameters were the occurrence and intensity of early-onset nausea, and the influence of dexamethasone on early onset nausea. The incidence of vomiting during the first two hours following anesthesia and the occurrence of late-onset nausea and vomiting during the 24h post-anesthesia survey were evaluated as well.</p><p>The <italic>a priory</italic> calculation of the quantity of subjects and subsequent power of the trial was performed for the total of several independent study arms as described in the study design section [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], using nQuery Advisor<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Version 7.0 (Statistical Solutions, Saugus, Massachusetts, USA). Based on an expected mean Apfel score of 3, a PONV -and thereby nausea- incidence of about 60% in the sevoflurane group and a similar incidence in the xenon group were hypothesized. A reduction of nausea by dexamethasone of about a third (i.e. from 60% to 40%) was assumed to be relevant. The <italic>a priory</italic> power was calculated for the H0 hypothesis that dexamethasone prophylaxis did not cause a different level of reduction of nausea with xenon anesthesia compared to sevoflurane anesthesia. With an alpha error of 0.05 (i.e.) and a beta error of 0.2 (i.e. 80% power), we calculated a need of 107 patients per group. A total of 110 patients per group was planned for inclusion to account for drop-outs.</p><p>When planning for the trial and <italic>a priory</italic> calculation were implemented, we didn&#x02019;t take into account that there might be a difference in nausea incidence between xenon and sevoflurane anesthesia, which was noted when the statistical analysis was performed. Due to this important observation, a high drop-out rate entailing a lower participant number for analysis than <italic>a priory</italic> expected plus the fact that the trial protocol was lacking a total statistical analysis plan, we decided to change the analysis parameters and conduct a <italic>post-hoc</italic> analysis with the primary outcome parameter incidence of post-operative nausea defined as above and the H0 hypothesis that xenon anesthesia had no different incidence of nausea than sevoflurane anesthesia. We performed an intention to treat-analysis, including those patients who had completed the randomized anesthesia and had withdrawn preterm because of severe nausea, but did not account for the dropped-out participants due to other reasons (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153807.g001">Fig 1</xref>) that had not completed the randomized anesthesia (i.e. no implementation of missing values to obtain the full analysis set). The primary outcome parameter was evaluated with a risk analysis via binary logistic regression (influence of xenon, dexamethasone, and the combination of dexamethasone and xenon on the risk to develop significant nausea), followed by a direct comparison via one-way ANOVA. The secondary outcome parameters, including the isolated incidences of significant nausea following xenon and sevoflurane anesthesia, were directly compared with bivariate analyses. Logistic regression was performed as the primary efficacy analysis; all further p-values were understood merely descriptive. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS statistics software version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). Figures were generated with GraphPad PRISM<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, California, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec013"><title>Results</title><p>A detailed flow chart of patient inclusion, randomization and study flow including reasons for drop-out is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153807.g002">Fig 2</xref>. 93 patients in the xenon group and 94 patients in the sevoflurane group received the allocated anesthesia and interventions plus admission for data analysis. 88 subjects following xenon anesthesia and 92 subjects following sevoflurane anesthesia completed the 24h follow-up.

However, the overall incidences of nausea following xenon or sevoflurane anesthesia were not significantly different in this study. Nausea developed earlier and was rated worse in the xenon group. Late-onset nausea was not markedly different in both groups.</p><p>Xenon anesthesia reveals a higher incidence of PONV compared to propofol anesthesia [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Of note, so far PONV rates after xenon anesthesia compared to other anesthesia techniques have only been extrapolated from secondary data or risk analyses in observational studies [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The findings of aforementioned studies range from a higher expectancy [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] to a lower probability to develop PONV [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] when exposed to xenon. Our study is the first that directly compares nausea rates after xenon to a volatile anesthetic. While all results have to be interpreted with care, we do draw the conclusion that xenon anesthesia is associated with a higher likelihood to develop nausea than volatile anesthesia. Regression analyses showed an elevated risk to develop early-onset nausea. Nausea was significantly more frequent in the xenon group shortly after emergence of anesthesia. The lack of significance in overall nausea incidences in our study is difficult to interpret. One possible explanation might be a partly similarity of action of the two compared anesthetics. Like xenon, the reference anesthetic sevoflurane is an antagonist at the 5-HT3-receptor and might act more like xenon than like other volatile anesthetics when examining nausea [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Another possibility might be a different action of dexamethasone in the study groups. In bivariate analysis, nausea incidences in the xenon and sevoflurane group were calculated including both dexamethasone and placebo cases. In logistic regression analysis the influence of xenon anesthesia on nausea rates was calculated independent of dexamethasone. When looking at the subgroup analyses nausea rates differed in numbers between xenon/dexamethasone and xenon/placebo, while rates in the sevoflurane subgroups hardly differed. This observation is unusual, since dexamethasone has been shown to be effective in the prevention of PONV following sevoflurane anesthesia [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]; but it probably accounts for the differences observed here. Results would assumedly have been more distinct with a higher number of study participants. Due to a high drop-out rate and other factors listed in the limitations section, we did not achieve the initially planned number of participants. However, the <italic>a priory</italic> power calculation that was base to the planned subject number is not applicable to the results of this study as the originally expected Apfel score and estimated PONV incidence of the calculation were not attained, and the statistical analysis was performed <italic>post-hoc</italic>.</p><p>In total, nausea occurred earlier, and the initial nausea ratings were higher following xenon anesthesia. One plausible explanation may be the fact that patients after xenon anesthesia emerged faster and independent of anesthesia duration [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and thus may experience an uncomfortable physical state earlier and more vividly. In addition, the fast washout of xenon might also account for a faster termination of 5-HT3-antagonism, leaving space for various counteracting, pro-emetic stimuli. A bias through a misdistribution of well-established PONV enhancing risk factors&#x02014;like female gender, history of PONV, age, amount of post-operative opioids, duration of anesthesia [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] is minimized since these factors were evaluated and are equally distributed between the groups and subgroups. However further possible influencing circumstances, like fasting, surgery type, hormonal status, or further factors were not or only partially logged and evaluated in our study. Yet, due to scant evidence aforementioned risk factors have lately been discouraged from their use for PONV risk assessment [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Of note, the incidence of nausea in the xenon group in our study met the expected PONV rate according to the median Apfel score of 2 (46% vs. approximately 40% expected) [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. We did not find a lower PONV rate than expected in the xenon group as described in a recently published work that analyzed risk factors predicting PONV in a large unselected population [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, there were several significant differences between the named study and our work which might have accounted for the different findings: Schaefer and colleagues did not limit their inclusion criteria to an Apfel score &#x02265; 2. Thus they included quite a large number of participants being Apfel score 0 or 1. Moreover, this study identified female sex and long duration of anesthesia as two of the most important risk factors inducing PONV. We randomized more than 60% females and the average duration of anesthesia was more than 140 min in both groups. This might have contributed to the higher nausea rate in our study.</p><p>Volatile anesthetics have mainly been held responsible to develop early PONV within the first two hours after the end of anesthesia. However, volatile anesthetics seem not responsible for late PONV occurring in the first 24 h post anesthesia [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This seems to be the same for xenon. Nausea rates and episodes of vomiting following xenon anesthesia showed a similar decline towards 24h as compared to the sevoflurane group. However, these results may be biased by the less frequent examinations during the later postoperative period. Subjects might simply have superseded further episodes of nausea and/or vomiting.</p><p>The evaluation of anesthesia was worse when xenon had been administered. This result seems congruent with the higher risk to develop nausea following xenon anesthesia, and should entail future strategies to reduce this risk and improve individual well-being. The faster emergence and high alertness following xenon anesthesia [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] enables patients to remember their PACU stay and their post-operative body state in detail. In consequence this might also contribute to the subjective evaluations. Fast recovery from anesthesia is a highly favorable attribute vis &#x000e0; vis anesthetists, surgeons, and hospital economists. However, it might not prove to be optimal for the individual patient.</p><p>Effective prophylactic strategies have been evaluated for the prevention of PONV to abate this annoying side effect after general anesthesia. Dexamethasone is known to be preventive for PONV in volatile anesthetics [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Our results do not seem to confirm these data for xenon anesthesia. The reduction of nausea was not significantly different to the placebo group. Of note, in the sevoflurane group prophylactic dexamethasone did not lead to a reduction in nausea rates compared to placebo. Moreover, the rates of early-onset nausea following sevoflurane/dexamethasone and sevoflurane/placebo were almost identical. This finding is contradictory to previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Two possible reasons for the failure of dexamethasone might be a different dosage and time of application. In former studies dexamethasone was most effective when administered in doses of 8&#x02013;10 mg and before induction of anesthesia [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], two conditions that were not accomplished during our trial. However, a recent meta-analysis showed that a 4 mg dose of dexamethasone seems to have a similar antiemetic efficacy to the 8&#x02013;10 mg dose [<xref rid="pone.0153807.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Another factor for the lack of effectiveness of dexamethasone prophylaxis in this trial may have been a decreased number of examined patients due to one of the various reasons, see limitations. Further studies examining therapeutic options of PONV following xenon anesthesia would thus be desirable.</p><sec id="sec015"><title>Limitations</title><p>Several factors in the design and realization of this study might limit our findings. We designed this study as a multifactorial study with several study arms which assessed independent questions within one setting. Even if independency of the study arms were ensured, there might have been hidden interactions or influences that have biased our study observations. Additionally, due to the non-replacement of subjects in case of drop-out (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec007">methods</xref>&#x02018; section, study design) and a high study drop-out rate due to other reasons (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153807.g001">Fig 1</xref>) we did not achieve the initially estimated patient number. This might have further influenced our obtained results, especially in the case of the secondary analysis performed for dexamethasone prophylaxis. However, the median Apfel score achieved in this study was 2 and thereby lower than presupposed for the calculated number of participants. In consequence this fact subsequently led to a lower nausea rate in the study population than would have been eligible especially for secondary analyses.</p><p>The statistical planning of the study also holds several limitations: The <italic>a priory</italic> calculation didn&#x02019;t take into account the observed difference in nausea incidence between xenon and sevoflurane anesthesia. Since this difference entailed an impact on the primary endpoint definition and thus had a direct influence on all further estimations, a change in statistical analysis from the primarily planned calculation towards a post-hoc evaluation was necessary. The post hoc analysis within this existing sample might have led to a bigger type one error than expected just by looking at the p-value. Post-hoc power calculations are only marginally able to prevent this bias. Moreover, the study is likely to be underpowered with respect to at least one of the study arms in this linked design. A further lack of total statistical analysis plan in the design and the exclusion of missing values handling in the protocol and thereby loss of the full analysis set for statistical calculation have further weakening influences on the conclusions form our results. An interim analysis of the primary outcome parameter would have been very helpful to detect the tendencies concerning different incidences of nausea in both study groups, but was unfortunately neither planned nor performed for the primary endpoint initially planned for this study arm.</p><p>Within our study set we had a trend towards failure to receive allocated interventions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153807.g001">Fig 1</xref>), with a maximum in the xenon group. Since reasons for this failure were seemingly manifold and incoherent (withdrawn consent, safety reasons), a missing at random assumption and treatment of missing values might have helped to identify further factors that might have strengthened the outcome of the statistical analysis. However, the handling of missing values was neither planned a priory nor implemented into the post-hoc analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In our post-hoc analysis xenon anesthesia is associated with an overall elevated risk to induce nausea in sensitive subjects. However early and late nausea and vomiting incidences did not statistically differ after xenon or sevoflurane in our study. Nausea was more frequent and appeared earlier and was rated worse in the xenon group. Change of statistical analysis parameters in the post-hoc evaluation might have contributed to a limitation of our results. Additional studies will be needed to address the question of prophylaxis and treatment of PONV following xenon anesthesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0153807.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>The trial protocol is available within the supplementary material.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0153807.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0153807.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>The Consort checklist is available within the supplementary material.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0153807.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Silke Lange for her expert statistical input.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0153807.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Koivuranta</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Laara</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Snare</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Alahuhta</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>. <article-title>A survey of postoperative nausea and vomiting</article-title>. <source>Anaesthesia</source>.<year>1997</year>; <volume>52</volume>: <fpage>443</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>449</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9165963</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0153807.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Apfel</surname><given-names>CC</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Roewer</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Korttila</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name>. <article-title>How to study postoperative nausea and vomiting</article-title>. <source>Acta Anaesthesiol Scand</source>.<year>2002</year>; <volume>46</volume>: <fpage>921</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>928</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12190791</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0153807.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Apfel</surname><given-names>CC</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Laara</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Koivuranta</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Greim</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Roewer</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name>. <article-title>A simplified risk score for predicting postoperative nausea and vomiting: conclusions from cross-validations between two centers</article-title>. <source>Anesthesiology</source>.<year>1999</year>; <volume>91</volume>: <fpage>693</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>700</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10485781</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0153807.ref004"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Andrews</surname><given-names>PL</given-names></name>. <article-title>Physiology of nausea and vomiting</article-title>. <source>Br J Anaesth</source>.<year>1992</year>; <volume>69</volume>: <fpage>2S</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>19S</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1486009</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0153807.ref005"><label>5</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Sweis</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Yegiyants</surname><given-names>SS</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>MN</given-names></name>. <article-title>The management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: current thoughts and protocols</article-title>. <source>Aesthetic Plast Surg</source>.<year>2013</year>; <volume>37</volume>: <fpage>625</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>633</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00266-013-0067-7">10.1007/s00266-013-0067-7</ext-link></comment>
