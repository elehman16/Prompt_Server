Typically, CWIs involve (i) interventions delivered across multiple community sectors; (ii) highly visible, broad-based, multi-component strategies; and (iii) may address other non-communicable disease risk factors.<xref rid="dyx248-B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyx248-B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> However, evidence on their effectiveness in achieving population-level improvements is limited. A Cochrane review published in 2015 identified 33 studies on this topic and only four high-quality studies (cluster randomized trials with a low risk of bias) among them.<xref rid="dyx248-B10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Overall, the review did not find evidence of beneficial changes in PA resulting from CWIs.<xref rid="dyx248-B10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref></p><p>What remains unclear is whether the absence of benefit stems from the nature of the CWI itself (e.g. the dose, duration, components or complexity of the interventions) or just a lack of sufficient high-quality studies able to detect the anticipated small to moderate effect size. Of note, the most frequent (modal) duration of the intervention in the reviewed studies was 1 year (median 3 years).<xref rid="dyx248-B10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> In contrast to individual-level interventions, it may take considerably longer to influence population levels of PA via large-scale interventions. To date, no randomized controlled trial (RCT) has examined a CWI lasting for 4 years or more.</p><p>RCTs of social interventions are increasingly popular in public health and other disciplines such as education and economics; however, these broad-reach trials typically face methodological challenges due to their complex nature and real-world research environments that are difficult to control.<xref rid="dyx248-B11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Accumulation of empirical evidence and advancement in epidemiologic methods in this field may benefit a broad range of scientific knowledge.</p><p>The COMMUNICATE (COMMUNIty-wide CAmpaign To promote Exercise) study was originally developed as a 1-year cluster RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-strategic CWI for promoting PA in middle-aged and older adults.<xref rid="dyx248-B12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Then the intervention was continued for a further 4 years when no significant effect on population-level change in PA was seen after the first and third years.<xref rid="dyx248-B12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyx248-B13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> We therefore evaluated the effectiveness of a 5-year CWI for promoting PA in middle-aged and older adults using a cluster RCT design. Our aim was to promote PA through a CWI delivered at the community level. To minimize contamination, the unit of randomization was the community. The hypothesis was that a 5-year CWI delivered at the community level would promote engagement in recommended levels of aerobic, flexibility and/or muscle-strengthening activities in middle-aged and older adults evaluated at the individual level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study reports on findings after 5 years of intervention in the COMMUNICATE study. This is a cluster randomized controlled, superiority trial, stratified by population density, with unbalanced randomization (three intervention communities and one control community).

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyx248-F1">Figure 1</xref> is the flow diagram of the trial. There are 32 communities within Unnan, with a median population and area of 1292 and 10.8 km<sup>2</sup>, respectively. The eligibility criterion for clusters was all communities in Unnan. Twelve communities (clusters) were randomly sampled, with stratification by blocking within population density category strata, and random allocation to three intervention clusters per control cluster (i.e. nine interventions; three controls). Additionally, each cluster in the intervention group was randomly allocated to aerobic activity promotion (Group A), flexibility and muscle-strengthening activities promotion (Group FM) or aerobic, flexibility and muscle-strengthening activities promotion (Group AFM, &#x02018;all-in-one&#x02019; or bundled approach), each consisting of three clusters. This factorial design was for the purpose of subgroup analyses. We chose these three types of activities because, in addition to aerobic activity, muscle-strengthening activity is recommended for adults in general,<xref rid="dyx248-B2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyx248-B3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> whereas flexibility activity is especially recommended for older adults and people with musculoskeletal disorders.<xref rid="dyx248-B14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14&#x02013;18</sup></xref> However, most previous CWI studies focused on only aerobic activity (e.g. walking).<xref rid="dyx248-B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyx248-B19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19&#x02013;27</sup></xref> As arthritis is a potential barrier to PA, mainly aerobic activity,<xref rid="dyx248-B28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> identifying effective population strategies to promote flexibility and musculoskeletal activities and prevent musculoskeletal disorders is important.</p><fig id="dyx248-F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flowchart of the study.

Those excluded from the survey were individuals in assisted living facilities and those who required long-term care. Those who could not complete the questionnaires themselves due to disability and those unable to walk unaided were also excluded from the analyses; 1-, 3- and 5-year follow-up questionnaires were mailed to the baseline respondents in October 2010, 2012 and 2014.

All three dimensions of the CWI were clearly implemented, and mostly delivered as intended, in all intervention communities. The <italic>RE-AIM</italic> flowchart shows high degrees of adoption, implementation, reach and organizational-level maintenance.</p><p>For effectiveness evaluation, data from a total of 4414 respondents (73.6% response rate at baseline) were analysed in the intention-to-treat manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyx248-F1">Figure 1</xref>). Follow-up surveys also had high response rates (78.0&#x02013;82.8%). Baseline characteristics of the eligible respondents are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="dyx248-T1">Table 1</xref>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="dyx248-T2">Table 2</xref> shows the unadjusted distributions of PA and pain outcomes at baseline and the 5-year follow-up. During the 5-year period, the proportion of adults achieving the recommended levels of PAs decreased from 64.5% (573/889) to 59.2% (432/730) in the control communities, whereas levels were maintained in the intervention communities [63.0% (1745/2769) in 2009 to 63.7% (1446/2270) in 2014]. The adjusted change in PA within group and the adjusted change difference between groups (effect estimate) are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyx248-F2">Figure 2</xref>. For the primary analysis, the adjusted change difference (%) of residents who met the PA recommendations indicated a positive intervention effect in the treatment compared with the control communities {4.6 percentage points [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.4, 8.8], <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.030}. For specific PA outcomes, in the control communities, adults who walked &#x02265;150 minutes/week decreased after adjustment of covariables [&#x02013;6.0 percentage points (95% CI: &#x02013;9.6, &#x02013;2.4)], whereas overall and other types of PA showed similarly negative trends. Compared with the control communities, adults walking &#x02265;150 minutes/week increased in Group A [6.4% (1.4, 11.4), <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.012] and adults doing flexibility activity daily [6.1% (1.6, 10.6), <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.008] and 2 days/week or more of muscle-strengthening activity [5.7% (0.8, 10.6), <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.023] increased in Group FM, corresponding to the PA types promoted in the relevant communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyx248-F2">Figure 2</xref>). The proportion of active walkers did not change within Group A [0.4% (&#x02013;3.2, 4.0)]. Thus, the observed change differences in walking were due to the decrease in the control communities aforementioned (i.e. effectively maintained in Group A). In Group AFM (all-in-one approach), there was little change compared with the control (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;0.138).

Our focused promotion strategy was effective in increasing each type of recommended physical activities (for walking, effective in maintaining the level). The intervention effect gradually shifted towards indicating population-level improvement (1.6% change difference at 3-year<xref rid="dyx248-B13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> and 4.6% at 5-year follow-ups) for the primary outcome. Our causal interpretation is also supported with (i) improvements in the specific types of PA as targeted by the CWI in the relevant communities (i.e. promotion-outcome match; walking in Group A and flexibility and muscle-strengthening activities in Group FM, respectively) as well as (ii) the linear dose&#x02013;response relationship between the CWI awareness and the change in PA in line with the hypothesized logic model.<xref rid="dyx248-B12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p><p>To our knowledge, this study is the first RCT to examine the effectiveness of a CWI for promoting PA over an intervention period of &#x02265;5 years.<xref rid="dyx248-B10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> In addition to the effectiveness of CWIs itself, it is also not known how long a CWI should be conducted to increase PA at the population level. As mentioned above, the most frequent duration of CWIs in the 33 studies in the recent Cochrane review was 1 year (median 3 years), of which high-quality studies failed to achieve population-level PA improvement.<xref rid="dyx248-B10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> The current study yielded 4.6% change difference from a 5-year CWI. Another previous systematic review reported a similar finding; the median net increase in the percentage of people who reported being physically active as a result of a community-wide campaign was 4.2% (range, &#x02013;2.9% to 9.4%) with a median intervention duration of 5 years, although this review was based solely on non-randomized studies and it did not investigate the durations.<xref rid="dyx248-B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> The CWIs should be sustained over several years to expect modest population-level improvements in PA.</p><p>An observational study of community-wide programmes targeting risk factors of cardiovascular disease including PA in Franklin County, Maine, USA, suggested these decades-long programmes were associated with reductions in hospitalization and mortality rates over 40 years.<xref rid="dyx248-B44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> The previous successful long-term community-wide cardiovascular prevention programmes, including this Franklin project and the North Karelia project in Finland,<xref rid="dyx248-B45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref> have not provided confirmatory evidence of population-level improvement of PA. Further investigation is needed to clarify how long-term CWI could increase and maintain population-level PA and eventually result in the prevention of non-communicable diseases and premature mortality.</p><p>In addition to the question of duration, the content and the dose of intervention need to be considered. The current intervention deployed all six social marketing benchmark criteria,<xref rid="dyx248-B12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyx248-B46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref> which is rare in PA interventions in older populations.<xref rid="dyx248-B47" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref> The standardized protocol, training of core team staff members<xref rid="dyx248-B12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> and the dose monitoring contributed to the quality control and dose levelling of the CWI between communities. In Group AFM, where all three types of PA were promoted, the amount of information delivered was greater than that for the other groups, thus the burden on the residents might also be greater. If the CWI could succeed in motivating adults to perform all types of PA, then the achieved health benefit would be the greatest.<xref rid="dyx248-B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyx248-B14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> For the successful dissemination of the current PA recommendations, which include multiple types of PA, a phased strategy (e.g. aerobic activity in the first phase and muscle-strengthening activity later) is worth considering especially when resources are limited. Finally, although the present CWI included multi-dimensional approaches, a more comprehensive approach involving policy and built environmental change strategies might increase the observed intervention effects.<xref rid="dyx248-B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyx248-B34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref></p><p>This study has several strengths. First, a cluster RCT can be considered as the optimal design to develop practice-based evidence.<xref rid="dyx248-B48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref> The original 1-year investigation was rated in the Cochrane review to have the lowest risk of bias among the selected 33 studies.<xref rid="dyx248-B10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Second, the prospective cohort design with repeated measurements enabled individual-level analysis and had more statistical power compared with multiple cross-sectional sampling. A potential disadvantage of this design is the risk of attrition bias. However, the high response rate with the adoption of established methods to increase the response rate<xref rid="dyx248-B12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyx248-B49" ref-type="bibr"><sup>49</sup></xref> provided less risk for biased results, and no clear differential attrition was observed. Third, confirmation of no harm of the CWI by using a pain questionnaire, which is not often considered in broad-reaching PA interventions, is also a strength of this study. As the logic model hypothesized, if the CWI could improve pain symptoms, this would occur after PA increased,<xref rid="dyx248-B12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> and thus more follow-up time would be needed to capture it. Finally, this study examined all aspects of the <italic>RE-AIM</italic> framework<xref rid="dyx248-B33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> to assess the public health impact of the intervention (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary eFigure 5</xref>, available as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Data</xref> at <italic>IJE</italic> online). Collaborations with community organizations and utilization of existing resources realized a high (100%) adoption and implementation rate of the CWI components and long-term maintenance of the self-organized activities. The high implementation adherence of this CWI project, along with the other examples of long-term implementation of CWIs in different countries and settings from urban to rural,<xref rid="dyx248-B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyx248-B20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> suggests good applicability of the CWI to other locations. Key strategic components shared by such successful cases yielding long-term implementation of quality CWIs should be further investigated to translate this practice-based evidence into policy and dissemination;<xref rid="dyx248-B48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref> e.g. those keys may be high community engagement, a financially stable headquarters, an interdisciplinary team and/or state-of-the-art social marketing.</p><p>However, there are also limitations. First, a self-administered questionnaire might be subject to recall bias. In broad-reaching trials, objective measures (e.g. accelerometers) are often prohibitively expensive, burdensome to participants and logistically difficult, thus resulting in a low response rate<xref rid="dyx248-B50" ref-type="bibr"><sup>50</sup></xref> with potential risk of selection bias. Therefore, self-report measures must be relied on and have been suggested as useful for their comparability of population PA estimates and low respondent burden.<xref rid="dyx248-B51" ref-type="bibr"><sup>51</sup></xref> Additionally, there is no standard method to objectively assess flexibility and muscle-strengthening activities in population-wide studies.<xref rid="dyx248-B52" ref-type="bibr"><sup>52</sup></xref> Using questionnaires with acceptable reliability is a strength of this study and differential measurement error is unlikely to have occurred. Second, potential contamination of the intervention via social networks possibly occurred. Although we assumed older adults mostly interacted within their communities, contamination could have occurred in the later phases, leading to underestimated (not overestimated) effect sizes. Finally, the number of clusters allocated to each study arm was relatively small, although the cluster size was based on the sample size calculation and the majority (28/33) of the previous studies has fewer than 12 clusters.<xref rid="dyx248-B10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> To obtain a more stable estimate especially in an earlier phase, future study with more clusters would be ideal. Even if these limitations are considered, our causal interpretation was supported by the results of a series of analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This cluster RCT showed the effectiveness of a 5-year CWI using social marketing to improve population-level PA. The focused promotion strategy was effective in promoting each type of recommended PA. The findings from the current randomized study in combination with the evidence from previous shorter trials suggest that population-level change in PA develops gradually over a period of several years and that several years or more may be necessary to observe a modest effect of CWIs. The effect of such modest improvement in population-level behaviour on population-wide morbidity and mortality needs to be further investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Data</title><p>
