The most rational methodology toward the prevention of periodontal diseases would be regular, effective removal of plaque by the personal oral hygiene protocol. Procedures for plaque control include mechanical and chemical means. Mechanical means include brushing, flossing, use of interdental cleansing aids, and oral prophylaxis. These methods have proved to be very time consuming and their effectiveness would depend on skills and technique of the individual carrying out these procedures. Thus, chemical plaque control can be used as an adjunct to mechanical plaque control procedures.</p><p>Recently, a number of chemical agents have been advocated which are either available in a toothpaste/dentifrices or in the form of a mouthwash. Among them, chlorhexidine is regarded as gold standard in dentistry for the prevention of dental plaque. The various mouthwashes available today are having certain side effects and are also expensive. Chlorhexidine mouthwash though very effective also has certain side effects like brown discoloration of the teeth, oral mucosal erosion, and bitter taste.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Hence, there is a need of an alternative medicine that could provide a product already enmeshed within the traditional Indian set-up and is also safe and economical.</p><p>&#x0201c;AYURVEDA&#x0201d; (Ayu-life and Veda-science) system of Indian medicine has been used successfully for treating various systemic ailments. Turmeric, more commonly known as &#x0201c;HALDI&#x0201d;, in its various forms is a very auspicious element in many religious ceremonies in Hindu families. It is widely used as a household spice for various cuisines of the country. Turmeric possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-microbial properties, along with its hepatoprotective, immunostimulant, antiseptic, antimutagenic, and many more properties.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] It is for this concern that promotion of turmeric in dental terrain would prove beneficial.</p><p>Considering all above claims and facts, this study was carried out using the purest and soluble form of turmeric to test its anti-plaque and anti-inflammatory properties in the form of a mouthwash. Microbiological evaluation was carried out to prove the efficacy of experimental mouthwash.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study population</title><p>A total of 100 subjects of both the sexes visiting the Department of Periodontology, Bharati Vidyapeeth University Dental College and Hospital, Pune, were considered for the study. The patients who were invited to participate met the following inclusion criteria: (1) subjects of age 15 years and above; (2) subjects with mild to moderate gingivitis; (3) subjects having at least 20 erupted teeth. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) history of systemic diseases; (2)pregnant, lactating females; (3) history of any antibiotic therapy in past 3 months; (4) history of oral prophylaxis within 6 months previous to the study; (5) subjects with mouth breathing habit; (6) subjects using orthodontic and prosthodontic appliances; (7) subjects with deleterious habit like smoking.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study design and clinical measurements</title><p>The clinical data was recorded in a case history proforma. The subjects were assessed for plaque and gingival inflammation by recording plaque index (Turesky-Gilmore-Glickman modification of the Quigley Hein 1970) and gingival index (Loe And Silness). After recording plaque index and gingival index thorough scaling and polishing was carried out to get subjects at the baseline. Instructions for maintenance of oral hygiene were given. No mouthwash was prescribed at this stage. Subjects were recalled after 1 month and they were assessed again for plaque and gingivitis.</p><p>Out of 100 subjects, 60 subjects with mild to moderate gingivitis were included in the study. Study population was divided into two groups. Group-A &#x02014; 30 subjects were advised chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash.

Large reductions were found in plaque formation using chlorhexidine gluconate, applied topically or as a mouth rinse.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] The results indicated that two daily mouth rinses with 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate effectively prevented plaque formation. In our study, chlorhexidine mouthwash showed significant reduction in mean plaque score at 0,14<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> day from baseline similar to study by Loe.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Our results related to turmeric are consistent with a study carried out by Bhandari[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] where an experimental mouthwash i.e., combination of four ayurvedic drugs (Beriberi Aristata, curcuma longa, Curcuma Amda, and Glycerrhiza ) was prescribed along with routine oral hygiene measures. Reduction in mean plaque index was observed from 0 to 21<sup>st</sup> day. In our study, similar results were obtained with subjects using experimental mouthwash i.e., turmeric mouthwash along with routine oral hygiene measures. This may be because of the anti-plaque effect of turmeric. A comparable anti-plaque effect was found with turmeric and chlorhexidine mouthwash in our study. This may be because of turmeric, which was in pure and completely water-soluble form, so the available concentration was more and it may also be because of its anti-plaque property. Significant plaque reduction from the baseline to day 14<sup>th</sup> and to day 21<sup>st</sup> was observed with both the mouthwashes.</p><p>Considering the anti- inflammatory effect of turmeric mouthwash, our results for the Gingival Index are consistent with the results of Bhandari Van der Weijden <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Grundemann <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] , Leyes, <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] A statistically significant reduction of gingival inflammation was observed in subjects using experimental mouthwash. In our study, the reduction in mean gingival score in subjects using turmeric mouthwash may be because of its anti-inflammatory property.</p><p>Arora[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] evaluated anti-inflammatory property of turmeric i.e., total petroleum ether extract of the rhizomes of turmeric and two of its constituents (fraction A and B) in rats and compared it with hydrocortisone acetate and phenylbutazone. The results showed significant reduction of inflammation (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) in all the groups. In our study, anti-inflammatory action of turmeric was evaluated on clinical parameters using the gingival index, which showed significant reduction. This suggests that turmeric has an anti-inflammatory property.</p><p>In studies carried out by Van der Weijden <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Grundemann <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] , Leyes, <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] significant reduction of gingival inflammation was observed in chlorhexidine mouthwash which is similar to the findings in our study. Taking into consideration all the findings of our study, it is clear that both the mouthwashes are equally effective in reducing the gingival inflammation.</p><p>The turmeric mouthwash was acceptable in taste and was biocompatible. It has been observed in the present study from subjective and objective criteria [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T8">8</xref>] that bitter taste was experienced by four subjects using chlorhexidine mouthwash.

The biochemical evaluation was done with the BAPNA test. The results showed a decrease from 51.44&#x000b1;20.78 to 38.64&#x000b1;12.34 (<italic>P</italic>=0.04). Similar reduction in BAPNA values were found in our study.</p><p>Drake <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] studied the antibacterial effect of curcumin (turmeric). Bacterial colonies were inoculated into tryptic soya broth enriched cultures. The results of this study showed the curcumin inhibits the growth of C. gingivalis and P. melanogenica. In our study subjects using turmeric mouthwash showed similar significant reduction. This was comparable with the chlorhexidine group.</p><p>The findings of our study suggest that turmeric has got definite antimicrobial property. When studied microbiologically it was observed that reduction in mean BAPNA values (that permits the detection of microorganisms possessing trypsin-like enzymes such as <italic>T. forsythensis, Treponema</italic> denticola and <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>) was found to be similar in both the groups (Group-A and B) after 21 days. Thus it was found microbiologically that both the mouthwashes were equally effective.</p><p>From the overall results it can be concluded that turmeric mouthwash shows anti-plaque property comparable to chlorhexidine mouthwash. When effect on gingival inflammation was observed both the mouthwashes were found to be equally effective. When the subjective and objective criteria were evaluated it was observed that turmeric mouthwash shows better biocompatibility and acceptability by the subject. Microbiologically, both the mouthwashes were equally effective.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Based on the observations of our study, it can be concluded that chlorhexidine gluconate as well as turmeric mouthwash can be effectively used as an adjunct to mechanical plaque control in prevention of plaque and gingivitis. Both the mouthwashes have comparable anti-plaque, anti-inflammatory, and anti-microbial properties. Turmeric mouthwash was biocompatible and well accepted by all the subjects without side effects. Substantivity of turmeric mouthwash is required to be studied in the future.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn
