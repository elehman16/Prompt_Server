Children with unilateral CP show signs of upper limb asymmetry by 8 months corrected age (ca) but are frequently not referred to therapy until after 12&#x02009;months ca. This study compares the efficacy of infant-friendly modified constraint-induced movement therapy (Baby mCIMT) to infant friendly bimanual therapy (Baby BIM) on upper limb, cognitive and neuroplasticity outcomes in a multisite randomised comparison trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>150 infants (75 in each group), aged between 3 and 6&#x02009;months ca, with asymmetric brain injury and clinical signs of upper extremity asymmetry will be recruited. Children will be randomised centrally to receive equal doses of either Baby mCIMT or Baby BIM. Baby mCIMT comprises restraint of the unimpaired hand using a simple restraint (eg, glove, sock), combined with intensive parent implemented practice focusing on active use of the impaired hand in a play-based context. In contrast, Baby BIM promotes active play requiring both hands in a play-based context. Both interventions will be delivered by parents at home with monthly home visits and interim telecommunication support by study therapists. Assessments will be conducted at study entry; at 6, 12&#x02009;months ca immediately postintervention (primary outcome) and 24&#x02009;months ca (retention). The primary outcome will be the Mini-Assisting Hand Assessment. Secondary outcomes include the Bayley Scale for Infant and Toddler Development (cognitive and motor domains) and the Hand Assessment of Infants. A subset of children will undertake MRI scans at 24&#x02009;months ca to evaluate brain lesion severity and brain (re)organisation after intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Full ethical approvals for this study have been obtained from the relevant sites.

Cerebral palsy is the fifth most costly health condition.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Therefore, early interventions that mitigate the brain injury and improve early hand function and later vocational and life outcomes are urgently needed. Children with congenital unilateral or asymmetric brain lesions frequently develop hemiplegia with major limitations in the use of their impaired hand, which results in poor bimanual coordination and impacts on the performance of daily activities in home, school and community life.</p><p>Currently, two very different intensive therapy approaches are used each with good evidence of improving outcomes for school-aged children with CP.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Traditional upper limb therapy adopts a bimanual approach (BIM) which aims to improve the use of the impaired hand as an assisting hand in play and functional daily activities.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> More recently, modified constraint-induced movement therapy (mCIMT) has been introduced, which employs a unimanual approach whereby the unimpaired hand is constrained in a glove to encourage intensive unimanual training of the hemiplegic arm.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> There is speculation that BIM may benefit later bimanual coordination, whereas mCIMT may achieve earlier capability in the hemiplegic hand due to specificity of training. Other conclusions have been drawn from animal studies hypothesising that early mCIMT may have a deleterious effect on brain reorganisation (overlateralisation of corticospinal pathways), whereas equal training of both hands may reduce such an effect.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> To date, however, neither of these approaches have been tested or compared in a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT) in very young infants with asymmetric brain lesions. This RCT, the Rehabilitation EArly for Congenital Hemiplegia (REACH) study, will directly compare an intensive infant friendly one-handed approach using mCIMT, called &#x02018;Baby mCIMT&#x02019;, to an equally intensive two-handed (bimanual) approach, called &#x02018;Baby BIM,&#x02019; in very young infants with unilateral or asymmetric brain lesions and clinical signs of unilateral CP.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Aims and hypotheses</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Broad aim</title><p>To conduct a multisite RCT in four states, in Queensland, New South Wales, Western Australia and Victoria (Australia) with 150 infants (75 in each group) with asymmetric brain lesions (congenital or acquired prior to 6&#x02009;months ca) and clinical signs of UCP. This study will determine whether Baby mCIMT is more effective than Baby BIM in improving infants&#x02019; ability to use their impaired hand in bimanual play activities (Mini-Assisting Hand Assessment (Mini-AHA)) at 12&#x02009;months corrected age (ca). The secondary outcomes will test the differential effect of each approach on fine motor (Hand Assessment of Infants (HAI)) and Bayley Scale for Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley-III; motor and cognitive domains) at 12 and 24&#x02009;months ca. in addition to symmetry of the corticospinal pathway development and its relationship to bimanual activities at 24&#x02009;months ca.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Major hypothesis to be tested</title><p>H<sup>1</sup> Baby mCIMT improves the symmetrical development of reach and grasp (unimanual capacity, HAI) to a greater extent than Baby BIM leading to better bimanual coordination (Mini-AHA) at 12&#x02009;months ca.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Secondary hypotheses</title><p>H<sup>2</sup> Baby mCIMT is more effective than Baby BIM in enhancing fine motor and cognitive development at 12 and 24&#x02009;months ca (Bayley-III) and better participation in play, self-care activities and social functioning (Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adapted Test (PEDI-CAT)).</p><p>H<sup>3</sup>neuroplasticity of the key motor networks, as measured by structural connectivity, is enhanced and associated with improved bimanual function at 24&#x02009;months ca in infants undertaking Baby mCIMT compared with those receiving Baby BIM therapy.</p><p>The primary aim of our study is to test the major hypotheses in an RCT conducted according to Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> where we aim to determine if Baby mCIMT confers superior and lasting benefits on use of the impaired hand in bimanual activities over Baby BIM therapy.</p><p>Our secondary aim is to determine if there is a differential impact of Baby mCIMT and Baby BIM on early cognitive and fine motor development (Bayley-III) and better participation in play, self-care activities and social functioning (PEDI-CAT) in association with early brain reorganisation (diffusion MRI (dMRI) at 24&#x02009;months ca). Enhancing our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying early development of upper limb function and bimanual coordination according to the type of intervention will provide important evidence as to the mechanisms underlying children&#x02019;s responses to the type of intervention and the impact on early brain development. To achieve this, we will use dMRI and structural connectivity analyses to evaluate white matter development in motor networks controlling movement in infants receiving Baby mCIMT or Baby BIM therapy at 24 months.</p><p>This clinical trial will be conducted across four states of Australia where there is access to populations of infants with hemiplegia through respective state-wide rehabilitation services and the Australian Cerebral Palsy Register (ACPR).<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Children with hemiplegia usually attend regular schools; however, severity of their hemiplegic arm impairment reduces independence in activities of daily living, compromises participation in education and leisure and can influence their later vocational aspirations. Very early rehabilitation with the most effective therapy that leads to sustained improvements in function and neurological structure could have profound effects on later participation offering a cost-effective and timely model of care. Improving our understanding of the mechanisms of response to therapy is essential to providing effective and timely treatment to achieve sustained outcomes.</p><sec id="s2c1"><title>Evidence for mCIMT and bimanual upper limb rehabilitation in congenital hemiplegia</title><p>Our meta-analysis reported the efficacy of interventions on improving upper limb dysfunction for school-aged children with hemiplegia.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> There was moderate to strong evidence that the original approach to CIMT (with a long cast on the unimpaired arm combined with intensive shaping) or modified CIMT (using a glove on the unimpaired hand with activity-based training) was more effective than usual care to improve the quality and efficiency of arm movement. When mCIMT was compared with an equal dose of bimanual therapy at school age, there were differential effects related to the specificity of training.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> It remains unclear, however, whether one approach is superior in infants as the majority of studies did not include children under 1&#x02009;year of age. Despite the philosophical preference for very early intervention to optimise brain neuroplasticity, there is limited research on early upper limb rehabilitation for infants less than 12&#x02009;months ca.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> It is important to test the efficacy of these two approaches to upper limb therapy in young infants where there is greater potential to harness neuroplasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Cortical reorganisation after an early brain lesion: a critical window</title><p>For infants with early brain lesions, there are important phases of sensorimotor reorganisation in the first year<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> with two main types of brain reorganisation.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Ipsilesional reorganisation (ie, reorganisation within spared cortical tissue of the damaged hemisphere) allows the damaged motor cortex to become reconnected to the spinal cord, as observed in adults following stroke.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Contralesional reorganisation (ie, reorganisation in the undamaged cortex) occurs when existing ipsilateral motor projections remain intact instead of becoming retracted within the first months of life. This alternate type of reorganisation occurs in very early brain lesions<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and can lead to severe motor impairment due to dissociation of the primary sensory and motor pathways<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>. It is proposed that the first 3&#x02013;6 months following an asymmetric brain lesion provides a critical opportunity for interventions to influence lateralisation of the corticospinal (CS) pathways.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> When sparing of the CS tract is present, early intervention may shape cortical reorganisation and improve outcomes.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flowchart.

Animal studies provide strong evidence that the type of training (mCIMT or BIM) may differentially impact early brain (re)organisation in infants with asymmetric brain lesions.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> A review of feline model studies supports the initiation of prehensile training in infants before 6&#x02009;months.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> This review indicated a strong correlation between activation of the CS tracts and strength of synaptic connections with spinal motor circuits supporting the hypothesis that early brain damage might initiate a vicious cycle where damaged CS tracts are competitively disadvantaged from maintaining spinal synapses, resulting in secondary reductions in these connections.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> More recently, the same research group examined whether targeted activation of spared CS tracts led to functional improvement by exploring the effects of early intervention in cats with M1 inactivation.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Three groups were studied: (1) early restraint alone with no training of the impaired limb which equals infant age forced use; (2) early restraint plus training which equals infant CIMT and (3) late restraint plus training, which equals restraint and training at feline adolescence. Outcomes measured were: (1) CS tract connections, (2) M1 motor maps and (3) motor performance. Restraint alone was able to restore CS tract connectivity yet failed to impact M1 motor maps or motor function. Late training impacted both CS tract connectivity and motor maps but failed to induce significant functional recovery. The only intervention resulting in major improvements in all three measures of outcome was early restraint combined with training.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> These animal data support infant mCIMT for rehabilitation of children with asymmetric brain lesions.</p></sec><sec id="s2c3"><title>Evidence from advanced brain imaging in children with congenital hemiplegia</title><p>The importance of a multilevel network in the reorganisation of the CS system has been suggested by our work in children with congenital hemiplegia.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The developing connectivity and symmetry of the thalamocortical pathways connecting M1 with the motor thalamus is as important as the symmetry of the CS tracts for unimanual capacity and bimanual coordination.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> High Angular Diffusion Imaging was performed to evaluate symmetry in the CS (motor) and thalamocortical (sensorimotor) tracts. Surprisingly, microstructural measures of the sensorimotor thalamic tracts were more significantly correlated with paretic hand function than those of the CS tracts. These data suggest functional outcome is not only related to the integrity of the CS tract but also requires feedback from sensory systems to shape the motor cortex and underlying pathways.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 18</xref>
</p><p>To date, upper limb rehabilitation studies have focused on interventions to promote activation of the motor tracts alone with little regard to a balance of input to and from the sensory tracts.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 18</xref> These data on rehabilitation and (re)organisation in UCP support a two-handed or bimanual approach to early rehabilitation. As evidence supports alternative approaches, mCIMT from animal studies and BIM from advanced MRI, in addition to the marked lack of evidence for an effective treatment for infants at risk of hemiplegia,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> there is an urgent need for further randomised clinical trials.

The proposed optimal dosage varies according to age, as follows:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Infants aged 3&#x02013;6&#x02009;months ca: 20&#x02009;min per day, 5 days per week;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Infants aged 6&#x02013;9&#x02009;months ca: 30&#x02009;min per day, 5 days per week;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Infants aged 9&#x02013;12&#x02009;months ca: 40&#x02009;min per day, 5 days per week.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>The dosage does not need to be completed in one session. Play sessions may be spread over the day. For example, a child of 10 months may have four sessions of 10&#x02009;min to achieve 40&#x02009;min of intervention per day. To date, there are no evidence to support the optimal dose for intervention according to the child&#x02019;s age. The session times proposed in the REACH trials are shorter than those used with older children because: (1) babies&#x02019; attention spans are short and (2) small doses allow time for families to attend to the multiple demands on their time and to fit intervention between other needs such as feeding, physical care and sleeping. The total overall dose will be 70 to 89.2&#x02009;hours by 12&#x02009;months ca depending on infant&#x02019;s age at the time of recruitment (between 3 and 6&#x02009;months ca).</p></sec><sec id="s3b13"><title>Procedures for both interventions</title><p>Baby mCIMT and Baby BIM will be implemented by parents in the home environment, supported by an occupational therapist or physiotherapist trained in the delivery of each intervention. Home visits will be conducted once per month from the time of recruitment until 12&#x02009;months ca. At the initial home visit baseline assessments will be completed following which infants will be randomised to one of the two interventions. A further aim of the initial home visit is to understand the family environment and determine the learning and support needs of the family, provide education about the intervention to which the infant has been allocated and establish a home programme. Subsequent home visits will occur once per month and are expected to range between 1 to 1.5&#x02009;hours duration. During the home visit, therapists will collect information since the previous visit or remote contact with the family, review the home practice diary and home programme, complete a play session in collaboration with the family and plan and document the next focus areas for intervention. Two weeks after each home visit, the therapist will contact the family via Skype or telephone, depending on the preferences of the family. The aim of this contact is to support the family in the delivery of the home programme, review the infant&#x02019;s progress and update the home programme as required.</p><p>Both programmes have: (1) the same dosage, (2) varied construct and (3) are delivered by parents in the home environment with the support of an occupational therapist or physiotherapist. To ensure the same treatment dose is delivered within and between each treatment arm, a range of strategies will be implemented. The intervention manuals developed for Baby mCIMT and Baby BIM clearly describe the treatment dose and scheduling. Computerised scheduling will be established in a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database, which will provide therapists with a prompt for intervention contacts. At the completion of each home visit and remote contact, the therapist will complete an online questionnaire (Qualtrics) which will record any deviations from the dose protocol and reasons and the amount of contact time provided. The questionnaire will further prompt therapists about the scheduling for the next contact with the participant. In planning for any potential setbacks, more than one therapist at each site will be trained to deliver each intervention. In the case of a missed home visit or remote contact, therapists will reschedule the appointment within a 2-week time frame. Each family will complete a home practice diary, which will be reviewed by the therapist at each home visit and uploaded on a central database (REDCap). The home practice diary will record the amount of daily home practice (in minutes), the activities practised and any questions for the therapist at the subsequent contact.</p></sec><sec id="s3b14"><title>Role of the study therapist</title><p>Consistent with the principles of shared decision-making,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> the therapist will work in partnership with the family to determine how and when intervention will be undertaken so as to accommodate daily family routines while adhering to intervention protocol. Ensuring that the parent feels emotionally supported, the therapist will provide the rationale for the specific intervention being undertaken. Drawing on the parent&#x02019;s knowledge of the child together they will tailor the activities relevant to either Baby mCIMT or Baby BIM. Through information exchange, the therapist will situate the solutions for how to progress the intervention with the family thereby reinforcing a sense of self efficacy in the delivery of the intervention.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Along with adopting a solution-focused coaching approach<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> during home visits, the therapist will remain in regular telecommunications contact to help resolve any implementation challenges as these may arise.</p></sec><sec id="s3b15"><title>Positioning the infant for the therapy programme</title><p>During study intervention, the infant should be in as upright and stable a position as possible. This allows the infant to more easily use goal-directed arm movements with their attention focused on the play situation.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> At times, in the HAI first ability level, play in semisupine nestled in the parent&#x02019;s lap and facing the parent may be used to orient infants towards toys and other play objects. The prone position should be avoided as this is a difficult position in which to encourage unimanual or bimanual skills. A baby chair/high chair is preferable for the programme once an infant has head control in supported sitting and when the baby only needs to be held around the trunk when sitting on a lap. The infant should be stable when using an infant seat, and appropriate supports may be required to improve stability. The child should not be practising sitting balance when the focus is on use of upper limbs and hands as the quality of postural control is known to influence exploration and the quality of object manipulation.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39 40</xref> A table at the appropriate height and close to the body is also encouraged as it is useful for eliciting grasp of toys placed in various positions.</p></sec><sec id="s3b16"><title>Supporting the parent&#x02013;infant relationship and parent mental health</title><p>Both interventions will be conducted in a manner consistent with supporting parental mental health and sensitive, responsive parenting. Dr Koa Whittingham, a registered clinical and developmental psychologist and investigator on this project, is responsible for developing the parental mental health and parenting support component of the intervention manuals, for training all of the therapists in parental mental health and parenting support and for providing ongoing mentorship and advice to therapists as needed throughout the trial. The parental mental health and parenting support components will be developed grounded in three key theoretical frames: the emotional availability literature,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> the grief and loss literature including chronic sorrow theory<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> and Acceptance and Commitment.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Training will focus on enabling therapists to better support parental grief and to recognise and support responsive parenting. If parental mental health or the parent&#x02013;infant relationship is found to be a significant concern, either arising directly from therapist&#x02013;parent contact or from parental scores on the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS) or Emotional Availability Self-Report Scale (EA-SR), then appropriate referral options will be discussed with the parent.</p><sec id="s3b16a"><title>Delivery and fidelity</title><p>The United States National Institute of Health Behaviour Change Consortium has recommended a model of fidelity comprising five areas for consideration.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> The five areas encompass study design, training of intervention providers, treatment delivery, treatment receipt and enactment. While this model was developed for psychological interventions, it has been adopted in rehabilitation focused research.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45 46</xref> The model provides an overarching framework for addressing fidelity in the current study. All therapists implementing Baby mCIMT and Baby BIM will participate in standardised training. Training will include certification in conduct of the HAI (2&#x02009;days), Mini-AHA if not already certified (3 days) and intervention delivery and study procedures (2 days). The standardised training for intervention delivery and study procedures will be video recorded to be used if new study therapists require training over the 4-year study period. Standardised training manuals will be provided for each study therapist. The standardised training will include both didactic and interactive elements encompassing the rationale underpinning each intervention, engaging and working effectively with families, principles of family-centred practice and coaching, infant ability levels determined through the HAI, intervention planning, toy selection, implementation of Baby mCIMT and Baby BIM including video case vignettes. In addition, therapists will be familiarised with the intervention manuals and a series of nine worksheets that will be used in the implementation of each intervention protocol to further enhance standardisation of intervention delivery. Four of these worksheets are for the study therapists to prompt the delivery of essential elements of the intervention. These include a mind map to guide therapists in provision of necessary information about each intervention to the parent, a guide and checklist for structuring home visit sessions, a standardised home programme template and questionnaire completed by the study therapist at the conclusion of each home visit to reflect on their performance and engagement with the family.</p><p>A questionnaire using a five-point Likert scale developed for the study will evaluate the therapists&#x02019; self-perceived knowledge, skills, beliefs and confidence in delivering each intervention. This will be administered prior to and at the completion of the standardised training, and then at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post to monitor any potential drift and implement booster sessions if indicated. Monthly Skype/web-based meetings among study therapists will occur to provide ongoing mentorship and support to implement the interventions. Each study therapist will have a chief investigator at their local site to provide support, supervision and mentorship.</p><p>A provider delivery observational checklist will be developed to evaluate treatment adherence, treatment differentiation and therapist competence in delivery of core intervention components. Essential and proscribed elements of each intervention will be defined based on the intervention manuals and training resources. Core elements will be worded into observable actions and behaviours to reflect both adherence to the protocol and the quality by which the interventions have been delivered (competence items). A coding manual will be developed for each item on the checklist. Content validity of the checklist will be determined by an expert panel comprising REACH study investigators and developers of the intervention manuals and standardised training. To determine if the items measure what they intend (ie, adherence, competence, treatment differentiation), an expert panel comprising REACH study investigators will review each item in the checklist. Inter-rater and intrarater reliability will be established.</p><p>Study therapists will videotape all home visit sessions. Videotaped sessions will be uploaded centrally (Queensland site). The first two home visits for each therapist delivering each intervention will be reviewed independently by two study investigators at the Queensland site against the Provider Delivery Observational Checklist. A random sample of videos will then be selected over the course of the study so that approximately 10% of each therapists&#x02019; intervention sessions will be evaluated using the Provider Delivery Observational Checklist. A threshold of 80% compliance to checklist items will be applied and deviations in excess of this will result in feedback to the study therapist&#x02019;s local site supervisor. The supervisor and study therapist will then review and determine strategies to mitigate further deviations from protocol.</p><p>A range of strategies will be employed by the study therapists for monitoring and improving the receipt of treatment. Worksheets developed to enhance the parents&#x02019; delivery of the intervention include a guide to preparing for a play session, choice of restraint (for Baby mCIMT group only), a mind map (Are you ready to play?) to prompt parents around the optimal time and environment to play with their child and a mind map (How did the session go?) to encourage parents to reflect on their play session with their child. As part of the structured home visit, study therapists will ask the parents to demonstrate the intervention activities they have been practising with their child and the toys they have selected. Therapists will provide feedback on parent performance and highlight the child&#x02019;s progress. As the child progresses in development of their hand skills, therapists will provide demonstration of the next stage/goals of therapy and discuss features of objects/toys that may elicit the behaviours that are being targeted. Therapists will employ coaching strategies with the families to help them consider toys/objects they could use in their own environment. Collaborative discussions will enable therapists to determine if the parents understand the next therapy goals. Families may videotape their child during the session as a prompt to assist them in the delivery of the treatment in between therapist contacts.</p><p>Parents will be independently interviewed when their infant at baseline, midway through each infant&#x02019;s intervention period and at 12&#x02009;months ca to determine how they are reacting to the intervention requirements, the extent to which delivery is feasible in their family context and their reaction to changes they may have observed in their child. This interview will follow parent&#x02019;s completion of the Pediatric Rehabilitation Intervention Measure of Engagement (General Research Version) (PRIME-G).

Each hemispheric score (HS) is the sum of the lobar scores (maximum score of 12). The basal ganglia and brainstem score (BGBS) is the sum of left and right subcortical structures (basal ganglia, thalamus, brainstem and posterior limb of the internal capsule) (maximum score of 10).

Our team has commenced the first implementation studies of intensive upper limb therapy in school-aged children with hemiplegia,<xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref> and thus findings of this proposed study in young infants are able to be translated rapidly into clinical practice.</p><p>Full ethical approvals for this study have been obtained from the Children&#x02019;s Health Queensland Hospital and Health Service Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC/14/QRCH/376: ethical review provided for 20 sites: Lady Cilento Children&#x02019;s Hospital, Royal Brisbane and Women&#x02019;s Hospital, Mater Mothers&#x02019; Hospital, Gold Coast University Hospital, Sunshine Coast University Hospital, Nambour General Hospital, The Children&#x02019;s Hospital at Westmead, Children&#x02019;s Hospital Randwick, Westmead Hospital, Royal North Shore Hospital, Liverpool Hospital, Nepean Hospital, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Royal Women&#x02019;s Hospital, St George Hospital, Blacktown Hospital, Campbelltown Hospital, John Hunter Children&#x02019;s Hospital, Royal Children&#x02019;s Hospital and Monash Medical Centre), Medical Ethics Committee of The University of Queensland (2015000013), Cerebral Palsy Alliance Ethics Committee (2015-01-02) and the Princess Margaret Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee (2015023EP: ethical review provided for two sites: Princess Margaret Hospital for Children and King Edward Memorial Hospital for Women).</p><p>To our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate and compare the effects of two approaches to very early upper limb rehabilitation for infants at high risk of congenital hemiplegia implemented by parents coached by therapists. Furthermore, we will be evaluating outcomes of the Baby CIMT versus Baby BIM training programmes across all relevant domains of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health using the most valid and reliable assessment tools available for use. We anticipate that the results of this study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and national and international academic conferences as well as our established clinical and consumer networks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e455" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-017204.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e456" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-017204.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><p>The authors would like to thank A/Professor Lena Krumlinde-Sundholm from the Karolinska Institute who has advised on the Baby CIMT and Baby BIM content.
