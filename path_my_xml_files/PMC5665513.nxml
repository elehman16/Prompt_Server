Inhibitory cognitive control may play an important role in pleasure perception while exercising, especially at high intensities. In addition, separate work suggests that autonomic regulation and cerebral hemodynamics influence the affective and cognitive responses during exercise.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Purpose</title><p>We investigated the effects of exercise intensity on affect, inhibitory control, cardiac autonomic function, and prefrontal cortex (PFC) oxygenation.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Methods</title><p>Thirty-seven sedentary young adults performed two experimental conditions (exercise and control) in separate sessions in a repeated-measures design. In the exercise condition, participants performed a maximum graded exercise test on a cycle ergometer as we continuously measured oxygen consumption, heart rate variability (HRV), and PFC oxygenation. At each of 8 intensity levels we also measured inhibitory control (Stroop test), associative and dissociative thoughts (ADT), and affective/pleasure ratings. In the control condition, participants sat motionless on a cycle ergometer without active pedaling, and we collected the same measures at the same points in time as the exercise condition. We evaluated the main effects and interactions of exercise condition and intensity level for each measure using two-way repeated measures ANOVAs. Additionally, we evaluated the relationship between affect and inhibitory control, ADT, HRV, and PFC oxygenation using Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficients.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Results</title><p>For exercise intensities below and at the ventilatory threshold (VT), participants reported feeling neutral, with preservation of inhibitory control, while intensities above the VT were associated with displeasure (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001), decreased inhibitory control and HRV (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001), and increased PFC oxygenation (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). At the highest exercise intensity, pleasure was correlated with the low-frequency index of HRV (r = -0.34; p&#x0003c;0.05) and the low-frequency/high-frequency HRV ratio (r = -0.33; p&#x0003c;0.05).

Exercising regularly minimizes risk for cardiovascular and musculoskeletal health problems and improve mental health and autoimmune functioning. Even in the face of these health benefits, the lack of adherence by a large part of the population may be due to the displeasure that accompanies exercise, especially at high intensities and especially for individuals who are sedentary [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. One possible cognitive explanation for high reports of exercise-related displeasure is that attentional focus is directed towards the physiological sensations that accompany metabolic changes induced by exercise [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. For instance, at exercise intensities above the ventilatory threshold (VT) (i.e., a marker of the transition from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism), individuals often report increases in associative thoughts about the physiological sensations they are experiencing, as well as negative affect/displeasure [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. At exercise intensities below the VT, positive affect is usually reported, because the same physiological sensations are minimized during &#x0201c;steady-states&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Interestingly, a number of studies suggest that inhibitory control, defined by the ability to regulate attention and ignore irrelevant information, may mediate one&#x02019;s ability to emotionally regulate sensations about his/her physiological status [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. As a result, inhibitory control may be an important neurobiological mechanism that contributes to physical activity adherence [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186926.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In other words, inhibitory control may help to regulate an exerciser&#x02019;s attention to physiological changes (i.e., his/her interoception) at different intensities [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], thus regulating the degree to which pleasure or displeasure is perceived, which ultimately has an impact on future exercise behavior [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186926.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Increases in exercise intensity influence the amount of interoceptive stimuli coming from the heart due to autonomic changes such as vagal withdrawal and sympathetic activation [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. One theoretical model of visceral and neural integration suggests that visceral feedback (e.g., heart rate variability, HRV) interacts with networks of brain regions that support emotion processing [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Specifically, increased exercise intensity leads to hyperactivity of the amygdala, an area that has <italic>bottom-up</italic> projections to the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which supports inhibitory control [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186926.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Exercise intensity also affects <italic>top-down</italic> processing, such that inhibitory control feeds back to modulate emotion. Thus, HRV may be used as a cue to generate changes in interoceptive processing during exercise, with inhibitory control tightly regulating when these interoceptive cues are ignored [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186926.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186926.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This interactive system has been explained by a neural model where the PFC actively inhibits visceral interoceptive responses (from HRV) that activate the amygdala [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Separate work indicates that PFC oxygenation also changes with exercise intensity: it increases when exercising at low and moderate intensities and decreases at elevated intensities [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This exercise-related hypofrontality impacts inhibitory control and emotional regulation and thus may have effects on perceived pleasure and exercise tolerance [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186926.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, the precise nature of this brain-heart-body interaction remains unclear, especially with respect to changes in exercise intensity.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the effects of exercise intensity on inhibitory control, perceived pleasure, interoception (associative and dissociative thoughts), cardiac autonomic control, and oxygenation of the PFC. Based on the extant literature, we maintained two predictions: (I) intensities above the VT will have a deleterious effect on inhibitory control and oxygenation in the PFC, accompanied by feelings of displeasure and increases in sympathetic activity; and (II) decreases in pleasure will be related to declines in inhibitory control and oxygenation of the PFC, as well as autonomic activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Method</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Subjects</title><p>Of the forty participants that enrolled in the study, three were not available to attend all sessions.

Inhibitory control is required to ignore the automatic response to read a word (e.g., <italic>blue</italic>), and instead respond to its font color (red). The current study used a Stroop test with three blocked conditions: the first two blocks were control conditions (i.e., indicate the ink color of a rectangle; indicate the color word that appears in white ink), and the last block contained incongruent trials (i.e., indicate the ink color of color words).</p><p>The index fingers of each hand remained on two buttons throughout the test, which was situated on the handlebar of the cycle ergometer.

sec-type="conclusions" id="sec027"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study revealed several interesting findings. (I) Intensities below and at the VT led to neutral feelings of pleasure and preservation of inhibitory control, while intensities above the VT resuled in displeasure and declined inhibitory control. (II) Increased intensity led to a decrease of the feeling of pleasure, with increases in associative attention. (III) The feeling of displeasure, PFC oxygenation, and sympathetic heart rate activity (LF HRV) all increased with exercise intensity.</p><p>Exercising has widely been shown to provoke systemic physiological adjustments to maintain required workload [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This integrated homeostatic regulation has been widely demonstrated through elevated heart rate, oxygen consumption, breathing rate, muscle recruitment, and lactate production [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], as well as altered perceptual responses of associative thoughts and affect [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In addition, recent studies have shown that brain function and cognitive performance are also influenced by increased exercise intensity [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186926.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0186926.t001">Table 1</xref>, we showed that the effects of incremental graded exercise promoted substantial physiological, emotional, and cognitive changes, including increases in cardiovascular responses, PFC oxygenation, and associative thoughts, and decreases in pleasure and inhibitory control. Thus, our findings suggest that exercise intensity modulates physiological, perceptual, and cognitive functions. Changing exercise intensity offers an interesting approach to study the system in an integrative manner and to better understand the mechanisms contributing to physical activity adherence.</p><p>Consistent with prior work, the current findings suggest that the brain acts as an integrator of interoceptive stimuli via feedback pathways from peripheral organs that respond to the physiological demand imposed by exercise [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186926.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. It has been suggested that inhibitory control, serviced by the PFC, plays a key role in interpreting this visceral information (i.e., bottom-up) by regulating (or inhibiting) negative emotional experiences [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which are usually signaled in subcortical structures such as the amygdala [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Our data show that below and at the VT, participants reported neutral feelings and preserved inhibitory control (i.e., number of errors and reaction time on the Stroop task did not differ between the exercise and control conditions). This cognitive regulation of pleasure may have occurred due to a regulatory mechanism supported by the PFC in a <italic>top-down</italic> fashion; by exerting control on the subcortical areas during the exposure of visceral stimuli (i.e., heart rate), this mechanism inhibits negative affective responses at lower exercise intensities [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, above the VT, where the physiological demand is elevated, our data show that pleasure and performance on the inhibitory control task decreased significantly for the exercise condition compared to the control condition. Hence, it is possible that a physiological demand at these high intensities may have prevented the inhibitory control from overcoming any bottom-up signals. This claim is strengthened by the fact that participants&#x02019; lower affective ratings were associated with increases in associative attentional focus at most of the exercise intensities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0186926.t002">Table 2</xref>). Furthermore, the relationship between affect and associative thoughts might reflect the fact that negative affect is one way that the body alerts awareness to important homeostatic disorders [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This attentional shift to internal physical states might act as a key factor for monitoring the system consciously and thus, preserving organic integrity under strenuous physical activity [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, although the error rate increased especially after VT, the Stroop interference in RT did not (difference between incongruent and congruent phases of the Stroop test). The results presented in the literature regarding the acute effect of different exercise intensities on RT and error rates are contradictory The decrease in accuracy found in the present study is in line with a number of studies [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186926.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. On the other hand, Stroop interference in terms of RT did not change throughout the session, which also corroborates previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186926.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Nonetheless, meta-analyses have shown a small increase in Stroop RT at high exercise intensities [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186926.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. One possible explanation for the discrepancy across studies could be related to the level of physical activity, fitness, type of exercise test, cognitive test type, and duration used in each study. Moreover, in cognitive tests that involve a choice between two or more response options, there is usually a trade-off between accuracy and RT. Therefore, it is likely that in the present study, participants chose to answer quicker despite the risk of committing mistakes. This trade-off would explain why error rates increased while RT did not.</p><p>A certain amount of evidence shows that the intensity of the exercise provokes an inverted "U" pattern on the PFC hemodynamics [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Notwithstanding, in the present study PFC oxygenation (i.e. oxyhemoglobin and total hemoglobin) increased consistently until exhaustion. Although this result seems to be surprising, recent studies have reported similar results [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186926.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In a systematic review, Rooks et al.[<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] showed that sedentary untrained and trained individuals exhibit different patterns of PFC oxygenation at different exercise intensities: trained individuals displayed an increase in oxyhemoglobin and total hemoglobin as exercise intensity increased from low to very hard, while untrained individuals showed an initial increase followed by a decrease at hard intensities. Astonishingly, the sedentary individuals of the present study displayed a similar oxygenation pattern to trained individuals in that review [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The reason for these differences is not clear and further research on this issue is warranted. Possible reasons that might influence the hemodynamic responses during incremental exercise could be related to differences in age, fitness level, optode placement, NIRS device used, and data processing decisions. It is important to highlight, however, that a recent theoretical model proposes that PFC may regulate the ability to tolerate high levels of physical exertion and influence the termination of exercise [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Additionally, Damasio [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] suggests that homeostatic disturbances, such as those caused by exercise, might induce a conflict between the interoceptive responses and cognitive states, which are both reliant on prefrontal regulatory functioning and are supported by <italic>bottom-up</italic> and <italic>top-down</italic> processing. Both propositions seem to fit well with our results, which showed that PFC oxygenation increased throughout the incremental exercise. Likely, this hemodynamic PFC pattern during exercise may have stifled the cognitive resources needed to manage the homeostatic imbalance (e.g., high heat accumulation, heart rate, blood pressure, blood lactate, decreased energy stores, etc.), resulting in displeasure/discomfort which may discourage an individual to continue exercising.</p><p>A recent theoretical model proposes that PFC may regulate the ability to endure high levels of physical exertion and influence when exercise fatigue occurs [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Additionally, Damasio suggests that homeostatic disturbances, such as those caused by exercise, might induce a conflict between the interoceptive responses and cognitive states, which are both reliant on prefrontal regulatory functioning and are supported by <italic>bottom-up</italic> and <italic>top-down</italic> processing [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186926.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In such cases, the feeling of displeasure could be an important factor for exercise intensity tolerance. This claim fits well with our results, which show that PFC oxygenation increased throughout the incremental exercise. We believe that this hemodynamic PFC pattern during exercise may have stifled cognitive resources needed to manage the homeostatic imbalance (e.g., displeasure).</p><p>Additionally, the autonomic nervous system has been shown to regulate the exercising body, since adjusting heart rate and blood pressure is critical to providing oxygenated blood to active body tissue (e.g., muscles). It is important to highlight that this regulation is performed unconsciously by the brain stem and subcortical areas [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In this way, heart rate variability has become a widely-used tool to assess the changes in autonomic regulation. For example, the increased parasympathetic modulation at rest and during exercise is indexed by elevated HRV, making HRV an important marker of endurance capacity and cardiovascular health [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. On the other hand, an increased sympathetic activity that is usually measured by decreased HRV has been associated with fatigue and exercise intolerance [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In this study, the HF/LF ratio and LF components of HRV were related to displeasure at the highest exercising intensity, just before exhaustion. Interestingly, these two markers are typically related to an increased sympathetic activity. Hence, the patterns we observed across these parameters suggests how the system might integrate unconscious (e.g., autonomic regulation) and conscious regulators of metabolic demand (e.g., perceived pleasure) to avoid organic damage to the system. In which, negative affect (e.g. displeasure and/or discomfort) may be the main body&#x02019; symptom bringing to awareness the homeostatic disorders [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186926.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186926.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] whereas persistent exercise at elevated perceived negative affect (i.e. fatigued) may deteriorate cognitive and motor functioning, being both extremely dangerous for the individuals' integrity [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186926.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186926.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] Moreover, PFC, which is mainly known as a cognitive brain region, has also been shown to play an important role in autonomic control, as it often processes endogenous and exogenous cues [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Furthermore, some work suggests that HR is linked to PFC functioning via feedback of the cardiac conditions [<xref rid="pone.0186926.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We believe that the changes in PFC oxygenation, alongside increased sympathetic activity and increased displeasure, are critical modulators of exercise tolerance and behavior during high-intensity exercise.</p><p>We conclude that exercising at low and moderate intensities may be used to encourage future exercise adherence in sedentary individuals since feelings of pleasure remain positive and inhibitory control is preserved at these lower intensities. On the other hand, exercising at high intensities leads to displeasure and induces a temporary decline in inhibitory control, which may be less likely to promote maintenance in exercise programs. In addition, displeasure at high-intensity exercise is related to cardiac autonomic regulation, brain hemodynamics, and body consciousness, which suggests an integrative system based on affective perception to regulate the side effects that come with changes in exercise intensity. This perspective may be important when proposing practical physical interventions, since enhancing positive affect and regulatory processing while exercising may increase the likelihood of exercise-related behavior in sedentary individuals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec028"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0186926.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Measures of inhibitory control and emotion perception at rest and at different exercise intensities.</title><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0186926.s001.tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0186926.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Measures of heart rate variability at rest and at different exercise intensities.</title><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0186926.s002.tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0186926.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Measures of the prefrontal cortex hemodynamics at rest and at different exercise intensities relative to baseline.</title><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0186926.s003.tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0186926.s004"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Comparison between maximum exercise intensity and rest on inhibitory control, physiological, and psychological responses in young sedentary adults (n = 37).</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0186926.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0186926.s005"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Correlations between affective responses and oxygen uptake, inhibitory control, associative/dissociative thoughts, heart rate variability, and prefrontal cortex oxygenation during each stage of the incremental exercise (n = 37).</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0186926.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0186926.s006"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>Characteristics of the sample and individual responses to VO<sub>2</sub>; Stroop test: RT and Error; ADT; Affective; HRV: LF, HF and LF/HF; Brain oxygenation: O<sub>2</sub>HB, HHb and HbT.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0186926.s006.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) for providing a scholarship.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0186926.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Blair</surname><given-names>S.
