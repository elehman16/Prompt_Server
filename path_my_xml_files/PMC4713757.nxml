rehabilitation program for children with developmental disabilities. [Subjects] Subjects
included 29 children with developmental disabilities. [Methods] The subjects were randomly
allocated to either the experimental group or control group. Experimental group subjects
received computer-based cognitive rehabilitation using the CoTras-C while control group
subjects received conventional cognitive rehabilitation. All subjects received 20 sessions
(2 days a week for 10 weeks) of the experimental or control intervention for 30 minutes.
To compare the two groups, the Korean-Developmental Test of Visual Perception-2 and
Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children were performed before and after the intervention.
[Results] Both groups showed statistically significant improvement in their scores after
intervention. Additionally, there were significant differences in the scores between the
two groups. [Conclusion] The computer-based cognitive rehabilitation with CoTras-C may be
helpful in improving the recovery of cognitive function and visual perception in children
with developmental disabilities.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Computer-based cognitive rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Cognitive function</kwd><kwd>Developmental disabilities</kwd><kwd>Visual perception</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Developmental disabilities (DD) are a chronic delay in development, including conditions
such as cerebral palsy, intellectual development disorder, autism, and mixed type DD. It is
thus used as a comprehensive term for a variety of diagnoses<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Children with DD have problems with physical, cognitive, social,
sensory, and communication skills<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. These
unique problems have a negative impact on the lives of their family as well as of the
children with DD<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Among the problems faced by children with DD, impairment in cognitive function and visual
perception causes problems in processing environmental stimuli, which makes it difficult for
them to adapt to their environment and live in independently<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. After entering elementary school, due to an increase in demanding
activities of daily living, problems caused by impairments of cognitive function and visual
perception become more evident<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. As
compared to prior to school entry, school-aged children are required to complete tasks
within a limited time at school or home and are expected to exhibit sophistication and
organization in their activities<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The literature indicates that there are intervention methods to improve cognitive function
and visual perception in children with DD, such as attention training programs, sensory
integration, and tabletop activities<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. These methods are remedial approaches to
restore and facilitate the improvement of cognitive function and visual perception caused by
DD<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although various conventional treatment methods for children with DD have been applied in
clinical settings, the controversies over the most effective protocol continues<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In order to compensate for these problems,
recently computer-based cognitive rehabilitation (CBCR) has been used in clinical
settings<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several studies concluded
that CBCR was an effective treatment for recovery of cognitive function and visual
perception<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, most such studies
recruited adults or the elderly with stroke, traumatic brain injury, or dementia<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Few studies have investigated the effects
of CBCR on cognitive function and visual perception in children with DD. Additionally, the
existing CBCR programs have predominantly targeted adults, and there is a lack of CBCR
programs for children<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In 2011, Kim developed a CBCR program for children called CoTras-C<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there is still insufficient evidence for the
clinical effectiveness of this program. Therefore, there is a need to investigate the
effectiveness of the CoTras-C using objective methods.</p><p>Accordingly, in this study, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to investigate the
effectiveness of the CBCR program for children with reference to their cognitive function
and visual perception.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Children with DD were recruited from a local rehabilitation hospital. We screened the
participants based on the inclusion criteria used in previous studies on CBCR for
children<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The inclusion criteria for participation were as follows: (i) DD
diagnosed by a pediatrician or rehabilitation physician; (ii) children with DD, exhibiting
similar symptoms (children with limited cognitive function and visual perception); (iii)
presence of DD diagnosed by performance on the Korean-Developmental Test of Visual
Perception-2 (K-DTVP-2); (iv) a below normal score on the Kaufman Assessment Battery for
Children (K-ABC); (v) ability to use the controller with the upper extremity without
spasticity; and (vi) ability to understand instructions within three repeated explanations.
Parents signed the informed consent form before commencement of the study, according to the
code of ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki, version 2004).</p><p>Two clinical measurements were administered on participants. The first was the K-DTVP-2,
which comprises 8 sub-tests (eye-hand coordination, position in space, copying,
figure-ground, spatial relations, visual closure, visual-motor speed, and form constancy).
This test can be used to measure visual perception in children aged 4 to 8&#x02005;years, and helps
to confirm the extent of visual perception disability according to developmental stages<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. It provides an index of motor-reduced
visual perception (MRP) and visual motor integration (VMI) and combines the two indices to
interpret the overall level of visual perception (General Visual Perception; GVP)<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The second measure was the K-ABC,
designed for use with children aged 2.5 to 12.5&#x02005;years. It assesses the intelligence quotient
and achievement, and entails 2 subscales, the achievement scale (ACH) and mental processing
composite (MPC), and 16 sub-tests. The expected mean raw score is 100, with a standard
deviation of 15<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The number of
sub-tests implemented changes depending on the age of the children tested. Therefore, in
this study, we used the sub-tests, depending on the age of the subjects. All clinical
measurements were administered before and after the intervention by a blinded occupational
therapist with 4&#x02005;years&#x02019; experience. After the baseline session, eligible participants were
randomly allocated to either the control group (CG) or experimental group (EG) by a research
assistant who was not involved in the intervention.</p><p>During the intervention sessions, the EG participants received 20 sessions (2 days a week
for 10 weeks) of CBCR with the CoTras-C program (Netblue Co., Ltd, Korea). The CoTras-C
consists of about 4,000 game-based training task on skills including attention, memory,
visuo-motor organization, coordination, and others. The CoTras-C with a character design and
voice suitable for children, makes the training easy by using the touch monitor and CoTras-C
controller. The difficulty level of all the tasks can be modified to suit the individual
participants&#x02019; abilities. Training data are automatically stored for accuracy analysis, which
helps develop an appropriate treatment plan<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, the EG participants
received the visual perception training that comprised spatial relations, spatial memory,
concentration, eye-hand coordination, eye movement, and figure-ground perception. The
duration of intervention for the CG participants was matched to that of the EG participants.
The CG participants received a conventional cognitive rehabilitation that focused on visual
perception, using pencil and paper activities. All participants received either the EG or CG
intervention for 30 minutes per a session.</p><p>Data analyses were performed using the SPSS program version 20.0. The &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test
and independent t-test were used to compare the differences in the general characteristics
of the two groups. The independent t-test was used to compare the between group means and
changes in values, while the paired t-test was used to test the differences in the
continuous variables within the groups. Statistical significance was accepted for values
with p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The 29 participants who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were randomly allocated to the two

it is increasingly used in clinical settings because of its advantages<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the present study investigated the
effectiveness of the CBCR program with reference to cognitive function and visual perception
in children with DD. The results of this study indicated that the CBCR program for children
may improve cognitive function and visual perception in children with DD. The clinical
improvement in the K-DTVP-2 and K-ABC scores was greater in the EG after intervention, as
compared to that in CG participants, confirming that CBCR is a more effective intervention
for children with DD as compared to conventional intervention.</p><p>Most CBCR programs used in Korea were developed for adults and these effectiveness has been
confirmed by several studies. However, in some parts of CBCR program for adults, the stimuli
presented on the screen are not suitable for children and do not sustain interest in them.
Therefore, it is difficult to use such programs with children<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. To resolve these problems, Kim developed a CBCR program for
children called CoTras-C<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The effectiveness of CBCR with the CoTras-C on cognitive function and visual perception
have been proved in several studies<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The use of a computer program helps in
the cognitive development of children by facilitating their intellectual ability,
stimulating curiosity, and allowing for creative thinking<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In 2014, Park indicated that children with DD who received CBCR
with the CoTras-C showed increased K-DTVP-2 and K-ABC scores, which is consistent with the
results of the present study<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Visual
perception is the ability to interpret and understand the environment by processing
information that is contained in visible light. Visual perception is closely related to
cognitive function, and therefore, an improvement in visual perception has been found to
have a positive impact on cognitive function<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, which was also confirmed in the results of the present study.</p><p>This study conclude that CBCR with the CoTras-C can be used as a rehabilitation approach to
improve cognitive function and visual perception in children with DD, which suggests that
the CoTras-C may be used as an alternative to other existing CBCR programs.</p><p>Although the sample size employed in the present study was small, the findings of this
study are significant because CBCR is a novel approach that broadens the scope of clinic
based intervention to home-based ones. Additionally, children living in a modern society
have several opportunities to receive this treatment<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The present study did not examine the effectiveness of CBCR with the CoTras-C on the
activities of daily living of children with DD. Therefore, in future, studies with a large
sample size are needed to investigate the clinical effectiveness of the CoTras-C as a
rehabilitation program for activities of daily living as well as cognitive function and
visual perception.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>HJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>A study on the concepts of developmental
