A gradient distribution of N dopants along the vertical direction of ZnO nanorods was realized. N doped ZnO NRAs displayed a markedly enhanced visible-light-driven PEC photocurrent density of ~160&#x02009;&#x003bc;A/cm<sup>2</sup> at 1.1&#x02009;V <italic>vs.</italic> saturated calomel electrode (SCE), which was about 2 orders of magnitude higher than pristine ZnO NRAs. The gradiently distributed N dopants not only extended the optical absorption edges to visible light region, but also introduced terraced band structure. As a consequence, N gradient-doped ZnO NRAs can not only utilize the visible light irradiation but also efficiently drive photo-induced electron and hole transfer <italic>via</italic> the terraced band structure. The superior potential of ion implantation technique for creating gradient dopants distribution in host semiconductors will provide novel insights into doped photoelectrode materials for solar water splitting.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>ZnO has been extensively investigated as an excellent photocatalyst and photoanode candidate for solar energy conversion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, due to its superior inherent properties, including non-toxicity, low cost and high electronic conductivity, <italic>etc.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. However, because of the wide band gap of ~3.37&#x02009;eV, ZnO can only response to ultraviolet (UV) light (4% in the solar spectrum). Therefore, in order to obtain high photoelectrochemical (PEC) performances for solar water splitting over ZnO photoanodes, a critical concept in designing ZnO-based PEC cells is to sensitize ZnO photoanodes to visible light.</p><p>Effective and controlled doping with metal/non-metal elements is a common method to modifying the optoelectronic properties of wide-band-gap semiconductors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. One general doping technique is to introduce dopants during crystal growth via sol-gel or hydrothermal process<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. However, the doped impurities tend to aggregate on the surface of the host materials during crystal growth, when the dopant concentration exceeds its solubility in the host crystal lattice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Moreover, heavy doping would to some extent destroy the crystal lattice, and subsequently the functional nanostructures of host materials<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. As a well known post-growth doping strategy, NH<sub>3</sub> treatment is effective to incorporate N dopants into wide-band gap materials (<italic>e.g.</italic>, ZnO nanorods) with original morphology maintained<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. However, the N dopant concentration and distribution within host materials cannot be effectively controlled and facilely tuned. Advanced ion implantation was regarded as an alternative strategy of post-growth doping to sensitize wide-band-gap semiconductors in visible light region, by effectively controlling the dopant concentration and distribution. Anpo and co-workers prepared various (<italic>e.g.</italic>, Cr, Fe, V, Ni, Mn) doped TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalysts by ion implantation method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, in which the functional nanostructures of the host TiO<sub>2</sub> can be preserved after even heavy doping process. Under visible light irradiation (&#x003bb;&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;450&#x02009;nm), Cr ion implanted TiO<sub>2</sub> demonstrated excellent photocatalytic activity for decomposing NO into N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O, whereas the original TiO<sub>2</sub> did not demonstrate any photocatalytic ability.</p><p>Fast recombination rate of photo-induced electron-hole pairs is another main reason that severely restricts the PEC performances of semiconductor photoelectrodes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Creating nanostructured heterojunction with a type-II terraced band alignment was widely utilized to favor charge separation, and hence benefiting photocatalytic performance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. However, the crystal lattice mismatch between two components of the heterojunction may introduce numerous interfacial defects, which would act as charge recombination centers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. To address this problem, Mao and coworkers demonstrated an impurity engineered nanostructure of ZnO:Al-ZnO:Ni with shallow Al donor levels doped ZnO core and intragap Ni impurities doped ZnO ultrathin overlayer. The overlayer was utilized to absorb visible light and the core transported visible light induced electrons, by which the optical absorption and charge migration processes were successfully decoupled<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. In the following study, they designed a ZnO/ZnO:Cr nanorods/nanosheets isostructural nanojunction for PEC water splitting. In this engineered structure, the presence of intra-band gap states associated with Cr impurities increased optical absorption, and the nanorod morphology provided a direct pathway for transporting photo-induced electrons to the back contact<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Using a NH<sub>3</sub> heat treatment method, Yang <italic>et al.</italic> successfully synthesized N doped ZnO NRAs, which showed optical absorption extended to ~550&#x02009;nm while PEC activity under visible light of wavelength&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;440&#x02009;nm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Such disparity between optical absorption and PEC activity in visible light region may be due to the poor separation ability of visible light excited electrons and holes in the N-doped ZnO NRAs prepared <italic>via</italic> a nitridation process in NH<sub>3</sub> atmosphere. Recently, van de Krol and coworkers presented a W gradient-doped BiVO<sub>4</sub> photoelectrodes with terraced band structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. It was revealed that the inherent electric field introduced by the engineered band structure would provide additional driving force for the charge separation and migration, resulting in reduced recombination rate and hence greatly promoted photocurrent density. A photocurrent up to 1.1&#x02009;mA/cm<sup>2</sup> at 1.23&#x02009;V <italic>vs.</italic> RHE was obtained for the W gradient-doped BiVO<sub>4</sub> photoanode<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. By introducing co-catalyst and double-junction Si solar cell, a further increased photocurrent density of ~4&#x02009;mA/cm<sup>2</sup> was obtained.</p><p>Motivated by these works, herein we presented an ion implantation strategy to fabricate a gradient homojunction structure in ZnO NRAs by spatially engineering the functional impurity distribution of N dopants. It was expected that N doping would introduce additional impurity levels within the forbidden band gap of ZnO and effectively extend its optical absorption edges. Meanwhile, the gradiently distributed N dopants along the vertical [001] direction of ZnO nanorods created a terraced band structure, which provided internal driving force for effective charge separation. As a result, significantly enhanced visible-light-driven PEC water splitting performance for N doped ZnO NRAs was achieved. Although this PEC performance is still low for practical application, we believe that such a post-growth doping strategy could open new avenues in search of high efficiency semiconducting materials for solar water splitting under visible light.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Fabrication of N gradient-doped ZnO NRAs</title><p>N gradient-doped ZnO NRAs were synthesized by a facile two-step method as schemed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>. ZnO NRAs were firstly grown on the fluorine-doped tin oxide substrate (FTO, TEC-15, 15&#x02009;&#x003a9;/sp) by a hydrothermal method and then doped with N element by an ion implantation process<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. By tuning the implantation doses of N ions, the concentration of N dopants can be simply controlled. In this study, N doped ZnO NRAs with different implantation doses (1.25&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>14</sup>, 2.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>14</sup>, 5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>14</sup>, 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>15</sup> and 5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>15</sup>&#x02009;ions/cm<sup>2</sup>) were named as N/ZnO&#x02013;1, N/ZnO&#x02013;2, N/ZnO&#x02013;3, N/ZnO&#x02013;4, and N/ZnO&#x02013;5, respectively.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2a</xref> shows the XRD patterns of N doped ZnO NRAs with different implantation doses as well as the pristine ZnO NRAs. The presence of sharp, narrow and well distinct peaks for all the samples provided the direct evidence for the crystallinity nature of as-prepared ZnO NRAs. The peak at 34.43&#x000b0;, corresponding to the (002) plane, is the most intensive peak in XRD patterns, which suggested that ZnO nanorods grew along [001] direction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Additional peaks at 31.8&#x000b0;, 36.3&#x000b0;, 47.6&#x000b0;, 62.9&#x000b0; and 68.0&#x000b0;, which could be assigned to (100), (101), (102), (103) and (112) planes of wurtzite ZnO (reference code: 01-089-0510), respectively, were also observed, and no peaks related to any other impurity were detected for pristine or N doped ZnO NRAs. However, after the implantation of N ions, the diffraction peak intensity decreased distinctly. This may be due to the fact that the incorporation of N into ZnO reduced its crystallinity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2b</xref> displays the detailed view of (002) patterns of the pristine and N doped ZnO NRAs. This peak position shifted towards lower angle, suggesting N ions were successfully doped into ZnO crystal lattice. As N atom has radius larger than O atom but smaller than Zn atom, the substitution of N at O sites or the insertion of N at interstitial sites in ZnO crystal lattice will increase the lattice distance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>.</p><p>The crystal structure of N doped ZnO NRAs was further investigated by Raman scattering spectra, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>. Two inherent Raman bands at about 436&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 980&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, assigned to E2 (high) and 2TO (transverse-optical) vibration modes of wurtzite ZnO were observed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Nevertheless, N doped ZnO NRAs displayed four distinctive Raman vibration modes centered at 273&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, 436&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, 580&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, and 980&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively. Raman bands at 436&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 980&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> are the characteristic modes (E2 (high) and 2TO) for hexagonal ZnO, suggesting wurtzite ZnO structure was not destroyed by ion implantation. The other two bands at 273&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 580&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, could be attributed to electric field induced silent B1 (low) and B1 (high) modes, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. It was believed that ion implantation process introduced disorder-activated Raman scattering (DARS) contributing to the emergence of silent B1 (low) and B1 (high) modes. Ion implantation process would create some defects and impurities in ZnO crystal, which destroyed the translational symmetry of ZnO and further induced the DARS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Kaschner <italic>et al.</italic> assigned the Raman mode around 273&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> to N related local vibrational mode (LVM), and used it to evaluate the relative dopant concentrations in N doped ZnO<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. In the present study, no N related LVM was observed for pristine ZnO NRAs, while the N related LVM intensity increased gradually for the N doped samples with the increasing N implantation doses. This means N ions were successfully doped into ZnO crystal lattice, and the dopant concentrations could be effectively controlled by tuning ion implantation doses.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref> shows the SEM images of pristine ZnO and N doped ZnO NRAs (N/ZnO-1, N/ZnO-3, N/ZnO-5 as representative samples). One can see that vertical ZnO nanorods were hydrothermally grown and well dispersed on FTO substrate with diameter ranging from 60&#x02009;nm to 120&#x02009;nm and length of <italic>ca.</italic> 3&#x02009;&#x003bc;m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>, inset). In addition, pristine ZnO NRAs showed smooth top and side surfaces. After N ion implantation, nanorod structure of ZnO was still maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b&#x02013;d</xref>), suggesting ion implantation method would not destroy one-dimensional structure of ZnO NRAs after N doping. However, at high implantation dose (5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>15</sup>&#x02009;ions/cm<sup>2</sup> for N/ZnO-5), the top and side surfaces of ZnO nanorod became more rough, and some small pits could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>, inset). During high ion dose implantation process, the surfaces of substrate materials could be to some extent etched, and some damages/vacancies could be introduced into ZnO. After post annealing treatment, these damages and vacancies were recovered and then aggregated into small pits.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref> shows the TEM images of pristine ZnO and N doped ZnO NRAs (N/ZnO-5 as the representative sample). The fringe spacing of pristine ZnO was <italic>ca.</italic> 0.26&#x02009;nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>, inset), corresponding to the (002) planes of hexagonal ZnO (reference code: 01-089-0510). The nanorod structure was not destroyed by ion implantation. While compared to pristine ZnO nanorod, N doped ZnO nanorods have rough surfaces, as etched by accelerated N ions during ion implantation. Any lattice fringe belong to zinc nitride was not found for N doped ZnO, maybe due to the high dispersion of N dopants in ZnO phase. Furthermore, the crystal lattice turned to be less-ordered for N doped ZnO nanorods, as previously evidenced by DARS in Raman spectra.</p><p>To study the chemical states of O, Zn, and N in N doped ZnO NRAs, systematic XPS analysis was performed, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S2 in Supplementary Information</xref>. From the survey scan in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>, XPS peaks belonging to O, Zn, N and adventitious C were observed, confirming the existence of N in ZnO after ion implantation. XPS Zn <italic>2p</italic> spectrum in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2a</xref>, displays the binding energies of Zn <italic>2p</italic><sub>3/2</sub> and Zn <italic>2p</italic><sub>1/2</sub> at 1021.3&#x02009;eV and 1044.6&#x02009;eV, confirming the formation of ZnO. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2b</xref>, the high resolution O <italic>1s</italic> spectra were deconvoluted into three binding energies: 531.5&#x02009;eV, 529.6&#x02009;eV and 529.1&#x02009;eV, which could be assigned to the oxygen in water molecules absorbed on the ZnO surface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, the oxygen absorbed on the surface as &#x02013;OH or O<sub>2</sub>, and the O atoms coordinated with Zn atoms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, respectively. It is well known that, depending on different synthesis methods, doped N ions in ZnO crystals always exist at two chemical states, <italic>i.e.</italic>, N<sub>2</sub> molecules and N atoms occupying O sites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, with binding energies centered at about 404&#x02009;eV and 396&#x02009;~&#x02009;397&#x02009;eV, respectively. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>, only one peak centered at about 399.8&#x02009;eV was observed. The absence of XPS peak (404&#x02009;eV) assigned to N<sub>2</sub> molecule suggested that N<sub>2</sub> molecule was not incorporated in ZnO by ion implantation. Given the typical binding energy of N in zinc nitride (396&#x02009;~&#x02009;397&#x02009;eV), the greater binding energy at 399.8&#x02009;eV should be related to the formation of N-Zn-O bond<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. As previously reported, when O atoms in O-Zn-O structure were partially replaced by N atoms, the electron density around N atoms decreased. Hence, it is reasonable that the N <italic>1s</italic> binding energy (399.8&#x02009;eV, as here observed) in O-Zn-N bond is higher than that (396&#x02009;~&#x02009;397&#x02009;eV, as previously reported) in N-Zn-N bond<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.</p><p>The N atomic concentrations at the surface of N doped ZnO NRAs versus different implantation doses are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>. With the increase of implantation doses, N dopant concentrations increased gradually and then reached a plateau value of ~3.5%. This means that the impurity concentration could be effectively controlled by varying the implantation doses. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6c</xref> displays the distribution of N dopants as a function of depth along the [001] direction for N doped ZnO NRAs by serial XPS etching measurements<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. For N/ZnO-5, the atomic concentration of N dopants at top surface was about 3.5%, and then decreased to about 0.1% with the film etched for about 80&#x02009;nm. According to the nature of ion implantation technique<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, it is reasonable that the N atomic concentration decreased gradually with the increased depth. Thus, N doped ZnO NRAs with gradient impurity distribution along the vertical [001] direction of nanorods can be acquired from the ion implantation process.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6d</xref> displays the UV-Vis spectra of pristine ZnO and N doped ZnO NRAs.

For pristine ZnO NRAs, negligible photocurrent density was observed, whereas, all N doped ZnO NRAs showed considerable PEC performances under visible light.

A long-term stability measurement further showed that the photocurrent density of N/ZnO-4 decreased slightly at the beginning and then stabilized in a 2600s I-t run (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>, inset). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a,b</xref>, the photocurrent curves demonstrated sharp anodic spikes after the light was switched on and then decayed to a steady photocurrent. It has been suggested that the spikes were the evidence of accumulated photoexcited holes at photoanode/electrolyte interfaces or the interfaces within electrodes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, and the accumulation of photoexcited holes could be mainly attributed to the existence of surface trap states<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. As the gradient N doping could introduce structural defects (as shown in TEM images and Raman spectra) corresponding to surface trap states, the existence of anodic spikes were reasonable in this study. Further investigations to solve this problem of accumulation of photoexcited holes in the N gradient-doped ZnO NRAs are undergoing. For example, atomic layer deposition (ALD) process was considered to coat an overlayer (such as TiO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, <italic>et al.</italic>) to passivate the surface states of N gradient-doped ZnO<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>.</p><p>The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) and absorbed photon to current efficiency (APCE) measurements were conducted in the range of 350&#x02009;nm to 600&#x02009;nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c,d</xref>), and displayed similar tendency. In the wavelength range of 390&#x02009;nm to 550&#x02009;nm, N gradient-doped ZnO NRAs (taking N/ZnO-4 as the representative sample) exhibited much higher IPCE and APCE values than the pristine ZnO NRAs. At 400&#x02009;nm, the increased IPCE and APCE values of N gradient-doped ZnO NRAs (N/ZnO-4) were determined to be ~17.5% and ~22.5% for N/ZnO-4, respectively, suggesting N-doping induced visible-light response for ZnO. Moreover, when compared to the N doped ZnO NRAs prepared <italic>via</italic> a nitridation process in NH<sub>3</sub> atmosphere, which only showed IPCE in the visible light of wavelength&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;440&#x02009;nm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, N gradient-doped ZnO NRAs encouragingly exhibited PEC activity (IPCE and APCE values) in visible light of up to 550&#x02009;nm.

Owing to the dipole-transition selection rule, the features A-B of O <italic>K</italic>-edge spectra in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref> are related to the electron excitations from O <italic>1s</italic>-derived states to O <italic>2p</italic>-derived states; and given the fully occupied Zn <italic>3d</italic> states, the features A-C of Zn <italic>L</italic>-edge spectra in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref> are related to the electron excitations from <italic>2p</italic> electrons to unoccupied <italic>4s</italic> and <italic>4d</italic> states. Because the feature intensities are approximately proportional to the density of unoccupied states (UDOS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, the obvious spectral intensity changes in both O <italic>K</italic>-edge and Zn <italic>L</italic>-edge spectra indicated the evident effects of N doping on the electronic structure of ZnO. The increased O peak intensity (<italic>i.e.</italic>, higher UDOS at O <italic>2p</italic> states) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref> and decreased Zn peak intensity (<italic>i.e.</italic>, lower UDOS at Zn <italic>4d</italic> states) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref> are attributed to higher Zn-O and Zn-N covalence, indicating that more electrons transfer from O <italic>2p</italic> states and N doping levels to Zn <italic>4d</italic> states, respectively. Moreover, it has been proved that both O <italic>K</italic>-edge and Zn <italic>L</italic>-edge XANES of ZnO are angle-dependent due to the existence of bilayer &#x003c3; bond and <italic>c</italic>-axis oriented &#x003c0; bond<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Hence, the peak ratio change (B/A in O <italic>K</italic>-edge and B/C in Zn <italic>L</italic>-edge), regardless of the change of Zn-O bond angle or orientation, should be related to N substitution at O sites and/or doping into the interstitial sites, when the same measurement geometry is applied to ZnO and N doped ZnO.

Recently, this concept was successfully adopted to design photoelectrode systems for solar water splitting. For example, Lin <italic>et al.</italic> created an n-p homojunction that could drive charge separation and produce an additional photovoltage by depositing a thin p-type layer of Mg-doped &#x003b1;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> over undoped n-type &#x003b1;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Abdi <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that the poor carrier-separation efficiency in BiVO<sub>4</sub> photoanode can be overcome by introducing a gradient dopant concentration to develop a distributed n<sup>+</sup>&#x02013;n homojunction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Thus, in the present study, the enhanced charge separation in the N gradient-doped ZnO NRAs could be expected, given the gradient distribution of N dopants forming a homojunction with terraced band structure. The band structures of pristine ZnO, N doped ZnO and N gradient-doped ZnO were depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9a</xref> shows the relative positions of conduction band (CB), valence band (VB) and Fermi level (E<sub>F</sub>) of the pristine ZnO. Generally, ZnO is an n-type semiconductor, and N doping will introduce acceptor levels above its VB, lowering the E<sub>F</sub> of ZnO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9b</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Because of the difference of E<sub>F</sub> between pristine ZnO and N doped ZnO, electrons will flow from pristine ZnO to N doped ZnO when they are brought into contact. Therefore, band bending would be induced by the alignment of E<sub>F</sub> in the homojunction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9c</xref>). For N gradient-doped ZnO, N dopant concentration at the top surface of ZnO nanorods was the highest (3.5%) and then decreased gradually with the increasing depth along ZnO nanorods. Terraced band structure was obtained accordingly in N gradient-doped ZnO homojunction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9d</xref>), which was supposed to induce built-in electric field for promoted charge transfer. As schemed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9e</xref>, when N gradient-doped ZnO NRAs were illuminated by visible light, the top surface region of ZnO NRAs will be excited by photons to produce electron-hole pairs. As driven by the terraced CB levels, the electrons at the CB of N doped ZnO NRAs can be efficiently transferred to the external circuit through the one dimensional pathway of ZnO NRAs for the reduction of H<sup>+</sup> to H<sub>2</sub>. Meanwhile, the terraced VB levels induce internal driving force to facilitate the transfer of photo-induced holes to the top surface of ZnO NRAs. As a result, visible light induced charge carriers with poor mobility were efficiently separated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. In contrast to the heterojunction structure such as CdSe/TiO<sub>2</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, CdTe/ZnO<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>, <italic>et al.</italic>, this N gradient-doped ZnO homojunction without obvious junction interface could yield lower concentrations of interfacial defects, and give rise to a considerable reduction in the recombination of electrons and holes excited by visible light<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p><p>According to the systematic analysis on the relationship between physicochemical properties and PEC performances of N gradient-doped ZnO NRAs, it could be proposed that the PEC performance improvement in visible light should be attributed to the synergetic effect of narrowed band gap for visible light absorption and terraced band structure for promoted charge separation. After N doping, ZnO NRAs showed optical absorption edges extended to <italic>ca.</italic> 550&#x02009;nm. Moreover, N doping did not change the rod-like nanostructure of ZnO NRAs, thus photogenerated electrons can be fluently transferred to the external circuit through the one-dimensional structure. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9</xref>, the impurity distribution induced alignment of the E<sub>F</sub> in N gradient-doped ZnO NRAs led to the formation of terraced band structure and hence a built-in electric field, which effectively promoted the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. As a result of the positive effects of gradiently distributed N dopants on the optical and electronic properties of ZnO NRAs, better visible-light-driven PEC water splitting performances over N gradient-doped ZnO NRAs were achieved. It was previously reported that N doped ZnO NRAs prepared by a NH<sub>3</sub>-nitridation process demonstrated optical absorption up to 700&#x02009;nm, but only the visible light of wavelength&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;440&#x02009;nm could be utilized for PEC water splitting, indicating the visible light excited electron and hole pairs cannot be effectively separated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. For N gradient-doped ZnO in present study, visible light with wavelength up to 550&#x02009;nm can be utilized for PEC water splitting (IPCE and APCE profiles), matching well with its optical absorption profile, which in turn experiment-evidently supported the charge carriers photoexicited by visible light could be efficiently separated, as driven by the N gradient-doping induced terraced band structure.</p><p>In summary, N ions were successfully doped into the hydrothermally grown ZnO NRAs by an ion implantation method. N doping did not change the rod-like morphology of ZnO NRAs, but extended the optical absorption edges to visible light region. Moreover, the gradient N dopant distribution led to a terraced band structure and hence a built-in electric field, contributing to the enhanced separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in ZnO. As a result, the visible light PEC performances for water splitting over N gradient-doped ZnO NRAs were improved significantly. When the implantation dose was 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>15</sup>&#x02009;ions/cm<sup>2</sup>, N doped ZnO NRAs achieved a maximum photocurrent density of ~160&#x02009;&#x003bc;A/cm<sup>2</sup> at 1.1&#x02009;V <italic>vs.</italic> SCE, which was about 2 orders of magnitudes higher than the pristine ZnO NRAs. Although the PEC performance is still not high enough for the practical solar fuel conversion, the post doping approach for gradient distribution of foreign elements, which not only sensitized wide-band-gap semiconductor materials in visible light region but also created terraced band structure for promoted charge separation, provided the new insight for the development of novel semiconducting material for highly efficient solar water splitting, especially under visible light.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Fabrication of N doped ZnO NRAs</title><p><list id="l1" list-type="order"><list-item><p>Firstly, the FTO glasses were ultrasonically cleaned in acetone, de-ionized water and ethanol for 30&#x02009;min, successively, and then dried under N<sub>2</sub> stream.
