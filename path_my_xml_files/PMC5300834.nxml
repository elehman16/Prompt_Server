apparatus to facilitate motor paralysis recovery, named the &#x0201c;Reaching Robot&#x0201d;, as well as
Repetitive Facilitation Exercise were applied to a patient with severe impairment of the
shoulder and elbow due to incomplete spinal cord injury and the effects were examined.
[Subjects and Methods] A 66-year-old man with incomplete spinal cord injury participated
in an upper extremity rehabilitation program involving a Reaching Robot. The program was
comprised of active motor suspension, continuous low amplitude neuromuscular electrical
stimulation and functional vibratory stimulation, as well as Repetitive Facilitation
Exercise combined with continuous low amplitude neuromuscular electrical stimulation. This
protocol used a crossover design following an
A<sub>1</sub>-B<sub>1</sub>-A<sub>2</sub>-B<sub>2</sub>. &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; consisted of 2 weeks of
Repetitive Facilitation Exercise, and &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; consisted of 2 weeks of Reaching Robot training.
[Results] Improvements were observed after all sessions. Active range of motion for
shoulder flexion improved after 2 weeks of Reaching Robot sessions only. There were no
adverse events. [Conclusion] Reaching Robot training for severe paretic upper-extremity
after incomplete spinal cord injury was a safe and effective treatment. Reaching Robot
training may be useful for rehabilitation of paretic upper-extremity after incomplete
spinal cord injury.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Incomplete spinal cord injury</kwd><kwd>Reaching Robot training</kwd><kwd>Repetitive Facilitation Exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>As individuals with tetraplegia caused by incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) are often
unable to use their arm and hands, quality of life decreases<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although various upper extremity rehabilitation methods have been
applied to date, the functional effects have been limited.</p><p>Recent evidence has shown that intensive repetition of movement could make a useful
contribution to clinical practice<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>,
constituting a promising approach for patients affected by SCI<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, independent movement practice is particularly difficult
for individuals who are unable to lift the arm against gravity or have minimal hand movement
ability.</p><p>It is expected that Robot-assisted training will contribute to promoting motor recovery due
to its ability to deliver highly reproducible controlled movement sequences<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>,
but these benefits in the upper extremity currently remain insufficient<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although a Robot with assisted-as-needed control (Robot)
can aid paretic limb movement<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, such
Robots cannot directly facilitate realization of the intended limb movement. Neuromuscular
electrical stimulation and vibratory stimulation have shown facilitation effects when these
stimulations are applied to effective points on paretic limbs and synchronized with
initiation of the patient&#x02019;s intentional movement<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Continuous low amplitude neuromuscular electrical stimulation
(CNMES) maintains the lower motor tracts in a state that reacts to motor commands from upper
motor tracts, similar to synchronized initiation of intended movements by the patient. CNMES
during training might be useful if it is applied continuously to the targeted musculature
rather than in an on/off mode using either electromyography- or position-triggering<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Functional vibratory stimulation (FVS)<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, which provides vibratory stimulation synchronized with initiation of
the patient&#x02019;s intentional movement, could also be an encouraging add-on approach to Robot
for paretic upper limb.</p><p>This simultaneous application of CNMES and FVS during Robot training has not been reported
previously, and it is considered that a skilled technique is necessary to carry it out.</p><p>An active arm weight-bearing system that has intellectual sensing and driving functions
that control motion and force and can be used in training to improve movement of the
hemiplegic arm<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The system reduces the
gravity on the arm by partially supporting the weight of the subject&#x02019;s arm during hemiplegic
arm rehabilitation training, can enable the subject to handle objects more easily. The study
used an arm weight-bearing device combined with an upper-limb reaching apparatus to
facilitate motor paralysis recovery, named the &#x0201c;Reaching Robot&#x0201d; (Yasukawa Electric Co., Ltd.
Fukuoka) which was developed by the Department of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine,
Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences and the Department of Mechanical Engineering,
Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Kagoshima University and Yasukawa Electric
Corporation.</p><p>Training using the Reaching Robot with CNMES and FVS to facilitate realization of intended
movement is expected to provide more effective therapy for severe impairment of the shoulder
and elbow in a patient with incomplete SCI or brain injury. In this case report,
improvements of shoulder and elbow function after Reaching Robot training were compared to
those after Repetitive Facilitation Exercise (RFE)<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> combined with CNMES<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> in a patient with incomplete SCI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The patient was a 66-year-old right-handed man with tetraplegia subsequent to a fall. The
patient had undergone C3-C4 fusion and C5-C6 laminoplasty and was admitted to this hospital
59 days after the onset of SCI. On admission, the patient showed minimal voluntary movements
of the upper limbs (American Spinal Injury Association Motor Score: left arm 12/25, right
arm 20/25). Immediately after admission to this hospital, the patient began receiving daily
rehabilitation with RFE; this study was started 4 weeks after admission.</p><p>The rehabilitation protocol followed an
A<sub>1</sub>-B<sub>1</sub>-A<sub>2</sub>-B<sub>2</sub> schedule. The &#x0201c;A&#x0201d;-period consisted
of 2 weeks of RFE combined with CNMES to the proximal and distal upper extremity for
20-minutes each. The &#x0201c;B&#x0201d;-period consisted of 2 weeks of Reaching Robot training and RFE
combined with CNMES to the distal upper extremity for 20-minutes each. All sessions lasted
for 40 minutes and were performed 7-days/week. This study was approved by the ethics
committees of Kohshinkai Ogura Hospital (No 2015-A3) and written informed consent was
obtained from the patient.</p><p>The Reaching Robot constructed in a motor-load-relieving apparatus combined with upper-limb

Two aspects of the Reaching Robot can be adjusted to alter the degree of
difficulty: (1) the amount of motor-load-relief; and (2) the height and distance of the
target-button and start-button. In addition to these functions to enable repetitive
reaching-task, the Reaching Robot can facilitate the patient&#x02019;s ability to reach while FVS
and CNMES are applied to the anterior part of the deltoid and superior part of the
trapezius. The FVS device is attached vertically to the target muscle belly and FVS (100&#x02005;Hz)
begins when the start-button is pushed, then halted when the target-button is pushed. CNMES
(symmetrical biphasic waveform, pulse width 250&#x02005;&#x000b5;s, 50&#x02005;Hz) was delivered using a portable
surface neuromuscular stimulator (ITO ESPURGE, Ito Co., Ltd. Tokyo). The intensity of the
electrical current was adjusted to produce a slight contraction of the target muscle without
inducing obvious limb/joint movement at rest before training.</p><p>Reaching Robot training was performed under the supervision of an occupational therapist,
who determined the difficulty adjustments appropriate for the patient. At the start of
training, the patient was instructed on smooth reaching. After each session, the patient
received feedback on the number of repetitions.</p><p>The RFE program, a combination of high repetition rate and neurofacilitation, is a recently
developed approach to paresis or dysfunctions due to neurological diseases<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> and a randomized controlled trial (RCT)
study<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> showed its effectiveness for
patients with hemiplegia following stroke. This technique involved the use of rapid passive
stretching of the muscles in conjunction with tapping and rubbing the skin to facilitate
realization of the patient&#x02019;s intended movement. Patients were directed to concentrate on
generating movement of the targeted joint<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As with the Reaching Robot training protocol, RCT study<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> has shown that RFE with CNMES is effective for patients with severe
hemiplegia following stroke.</p><p>Outcome measures were the knee-mouth test and the finger test of the Stroke Impairment

approximately three months after the onset and the patient could not expect spontaneous
recovery<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This single case study demonstrates preliminary results of Reaching Robot training and RFE
combined with CNMES for rehabilitation of upper extremity movements following incomplete
SCI. The results showed that both Reaching Robot training and RFE combined with CNMES could
achieve similar magnitudes of motor improvement on knee-mouth test of SIAS and Active ROMs
of elbow flexion. However, Active ROMs of shoulder flexion were improved following Reaching
Robot training only (sessionB<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>). These findings suggest that
Reaching Robot training can be safely implemented for treatment of upper extremity motor
function in a subject with incomplete SCI.</p><p>Although both training programs facilitated a high number of repetitions of active movement
of the proximal upper extremity, there were 400&#x02013;450 repetitions during a 20-minute Reaching
Robot training session compared to 200&#x02013;250 repetitions during RFE combined with CNMES. This
difference in the number of repetitions might have produced the difference in improvement in
Active ROMs of shoulder flexion.</p><p>A recent systematic review showed that exercise therapy and functional electrical
stimulation improved arm and hand function in patients with SCI<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. When CNMES, which can elicit network response is combined
with FVS, which enhances somatosensory processing in the lower motor system<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, these two stimulations could potentiate a
facilitating effect and become useful tools for neuromodulation. Thus, simultaneous
combination of CNMES and FVS in this case study is a novel treatment and is expected to
contribute to future developments in rehabilitation.</p><p>According to the so-called Hebbian theory<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>, in order to promoting functional recovery of paretic limbs or
motor learning, in other words, strengthening a target neural circuit relating to intended
movement of the patient, it is necessary to apply excitation repeatedly in order to realize
the patient&#x02019;s targeted intentional movement. As methods to facilitate realization of these
targeted intentional movements, RFE using CNMES and Reaching Robot using both CNMES and FVS
may provide many advantages.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest with respect to the
