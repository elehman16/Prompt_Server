We tested a human-anti-human IL-17A-antibody in two doses (3 and 30&#x000a0;mg/kg) against placebo (PBS). The treatment was started 1&#x000a0;day before EAE induction and continued throughout the experiment. Although all monkeys developed clinically evident EAE, the onset of neurological signs was delayed in some monkeys from both treatment groups. Total CNS lesion volumes, demyelination, or inflammation did not differ between the different groups. Immune profiling revealed an altered distribution of IL-17A producing cells in the lymphoid organs of antibody-treated monkeys. Comparable numbers of IL-17A producing cells were observed in the brain. RhMOG-induced T cell proliferation in the lymph nodes was slightly reduced after anti-IL-17A antibody treatment. To summarize, we found that anti-IL-17A antibody as a single treatment from disease induction effects a trend towards delayed neurological disease progression in the marmoset EAE model, although the effect did not reach statistical significance. This suggests a role of IL-17A in late stage disease in the marmoset EAE model, but IL-17A may not be the dominant pathogenic cytokine.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Th17</kwd><kwd>IL-23</kwd><kwd>Antibody therapy</kwd><kwd>Non-human primate</kwd><kwd>Neuroimmunology</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive neurological disease of unknown origin characterized by the progressive accumulation of inflammation and degeneration in the grey and white matter of the central nervous system (CNS). The accumulation of injury involves a combined cellular and humoral autoimmune attack on the protective myelin sheaths around axons leading to disturbed saltatory pulse conduction (Compston and Coles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2008</xref>; Sospedra and Martin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2005</xref>). This immunopathogenic process is modeled in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, an experimental disease induced in genetically susceptible laboratory animals including mice, rats, guinea pigs, and monkeys. The EAE model in common marmosets, a small-sized neotropical primate, combines a remarkable clinical and neuropathological similarity with MS and a high genetic and immunological proximity to humans ('t Hart and Massacesi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2009</xref>). The model is therefore exquisitely suitable for translational research into immunopathogenic mechanisms and the efficacy evaluation of therapeutic antibodies, which because of their high target specificity do not cross-react with lower species. The marmoset EAE model thus forms a bridge narrowing the gap between EAE models and MS ('t Hart et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2004</xref>; Kap et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2010</xref>).</p><p>Research conducted in the past years has shown that the 100% disease incidence and variable progression rate of neurological deficit is associated with the mobilization of highly reactive T cells present in the normal repertoire with variable specificities for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) (Jagessar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref>; Kap et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2008</xref>). Whereas disease induction could be mapped to the Caja-DRB1*W1201 restricted activation of T helper (Th)1 cells specific for MOG<sub>24&#x02013;36</sub> (Brok et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2000</xref>), the rate of disease progression appeared to be regulated by natural killer-like T cells specific for MOG<sub>34&#x02013;56</sub> (Jagessar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref>; Kap et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2008</xref>). Further research confirmed that this T cell subset is capable to induce clinical signs and pathology in the CNS white and grey matter without the support of innate antigen receptor ligands in the inoculum or autoantibodies against rhMOG or the inducing peptides (Jagessar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref>). These data led to the hypothesis that MOG<sub>34&#x02013;56</sub>-specific T cells have a central pathogenic role in the regulation of disease progression in the marmoset EAE model.</p><p>The most obvious immunological characteristics of MOG<sub>34-56</sub>-specific T cell lines generated from EAE-affected monkeys were specific cytolytic activity towards MOG<sub>34&#x02013;56</sub>-pulsed target cells and production of IL-17A (Jagessar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref>; Kap et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2008</xref>). However, typical Th1 cell-derived cytokines, such as interferon (IFN)-&#x003b3; or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;), that are abundantly produced by the MOG<sub>24&#x02013;36</sub>-specific Th1 cells involved in EAE initiation (Brok et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2000</xref>) were not produced by MOG<sub>34&#x02013;56</sub>-specific T cells (Jagessar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref>). This may well be due to the fact that for the activation of encephalitogenic Th1 cells in mice as well as in marmosets strong bacterial adjuvants are needed, i.e. complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) (Billiau and Matthys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2001</xref>). By contrast, our data in the marmoset EAE model demonstrates that encephalitogenic T cells specific for MOG<sub>34&#x02013;56</sub> can also be activated by immunization with MOG<sub>34&#x02013;56</sub> in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) (Jagessar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref>).</p><p>These observations prompted us to test whether antibody-mediated neutralization of IL-17A modulates disease progression in the EAE model in marmosets, elicited by a single immunization with recombinant protein of the extracellular domain of human MOG (MOG<sub>1&#x02013;125</sub>) in CFA. The most prevalent disease course in this model is clinically characterized by the sudden appearance of progressively accumulating motor defects after an episode of variable length, during which MRI-detectable lesions do not lead to evident neurological symptoms (Brok et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2000</xref>; Kap et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2008</xref>). A typical relapsing-remitting disease course is only occasionally observed. Our previous studies have revealed that intervention with an antibody against the shared p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23 has a clear beneficial effect in the rhMOG-induced EAE model ('t Hart et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2005b</xref>; Brok et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2002</xref>). This supports an important pathogenic role of IL-12 and IL-23, which may be exerted via the inhibition of IL-17A production, as IL-23 promotes IL-17A production (Langrish et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2005</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report that prophylactic treatment with anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody (mAb) at doses achieving plasma through levels above 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml induced a moderate delay of EAE onset. These data indicate that IL-17A is only one of several cytokines driving progression of the marmoset EAE model to clinically evident neuroinflammatory disease; absence of IL-17A being possibly compensated by Th1 cytokines that are abundantly produced in the rhMOG/CFA model</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals</title><p>The common marmoset monkeys used in this study were randomly selected from the outbred colony kept at the Biomedical Primate Research Centre (Rijswijk, The Netherlands) under conventional and not SPF conditions.

The antibody has been extensively characterized in vitro in terms of bioassay, affinity for IL-17A, and cross-reactivity against marmoset IL-17A. The affinity of the antibody with marmoset IL-17A is twofold lower than with human IL-17A when assessed by Biacore and fourfold less potent in a bioassay compared with humans.</p><p>The animals were subcutaneously injected once a week starting 1&#x000a0;day before immunization until the pre-determined end of the study at day&#x000a0;113.

All animals received the same volume per kg body weight. One monkey (M04063) in the 30&#x000a0;mg/kg antibody dose group succumbed at psd 69 unexpectedly without prior signs of EAE and was therefore excluded from further analyses.

In two animals (M04099 and M03144) of the 3&#x000a0;mg/kg antibody dose group plasma antibody trough levels, measured 1&#x000a0;week after administration, were remarkably low, i.e., below 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml at psd 34, while these were above 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml in all the other monkeys of this group.

We have shown that an antibody against the shared p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23 caused profound suppression of disease symptoms when dosed from disease induction. One possible mechanism of action could have been a reduction in IL-17A that is one of the downstream cytokines from IL-23. However, the modest effect of an anti-IL-17A antibody in the current study indicates that a reduction in IL-17A does not account for the activity of IL-12 p40 antibody and that other cytokines, perhaps IL-12 directly or other cytokines downstream of IL-12 and/or IL-23, are more important in the induction phase of this non-relapsing model.</p><p>The results of the current study demonstrate that prophylactic treatment with an anti-IL-17A mAb induced only a moderate extension of the disease-free time interval after EAE induction. Furthermore, immune parameters of the disease, such as T cell proliferation against rhMOG or MOG peptides was only somewhat reduced, whereas also a marginal aggravation of CNS pathology was observed. However, the variations were all within the normal range of variation in this outbred model and may also be attributable to the longer survival. Using immunohistochemistry only a few IL-17A-positive cells could be detected in the brains of placebo and treated monkeys, but no significant differences between groups were observed. The data show a trend towards increased numbers of IL-17A-positive cells in the spleen in the 3&#x000a0;mg/kg group and a decreased number in the axillary and inguinal lymph nodes of both groups compared with placebo animals (not significant). The higher number of Th17 cells in the spleen of monkeys that have been treated with anti-IL-17A antibody compared with placebo monkeys may be explained by feedback regulation. The observation that IL-17A receptor deficient mice produce more IL-17A (Smith et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2008</xref>) indicates that IL-17A production may be regulated by a negative feedback loop. In conclusion, the current results fail to show a robust effect of the anti-IL-17A mAb treatment on the EAE course in rhMOG/CFA-immunized marmosets.</p><p>The moderate protection against EAE induction is in agreement with data reported by some groups in mouse EAE models. Also in IL-17A<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (Komiyama et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2006</xref>), in mice treated with anti-IL-17A mAb (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2006</xref>; Hofstetter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2005</xref>; Langrish et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2005</xref>), and in mice vaccinated against IL-17A (Rohn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2006</xref>) only moderately delayed onset of clinical signs has been observed. However, other groups have demonstrated more robust effects of IL-17A on the EAE course in mice. Examples are by vaccination with IL-17A-OVA complexes that induce IL-17A blocking antibodies (Uyttenhove and Van Snick <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2006</xref>) or adoptive transfer of IL-17<sup>+</sup> and IL-17<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T cells (Jager et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2009</xref>; Komiyama et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2006</xref>; Langrish et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2005</xref>). Furthermore, in the chronic-relapsing EAE model in Biozzi ABH mice, prophylactic dosing with an anti-IL-17A antibody produced a small delay in onset of the acute phase of disease, whereas treatment with the antibody started after the acute phase or during the secondary-progressive phase was very efficacious, and could even reverse the chronic motor disability (Smith, unpublished observations). Other groups suggested that Th17 are not pathogenic at all (Haak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009</xref>) or that besides Th17 cells, Th1 cells are also essential in EAE (Kroenke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2008</xref>; Lees et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2008</xref>; O'Connor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2008</xref>).</p><p>How can it be explained that IL-17A neutralization does not fully protect against EAE in the rhMOG-induced marmoset model? One possible explanation is the high complexity of the model. Unraveling of the pathogenic mechanism showed that the disease is initiated by MOG<sub>24&#x02013;36</sub>-specific Th1 cells, which induce small inflammatory lesions (Brok et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2000</xref>). The moderate inflammatory injury caused by Th1 cells can be dramatically amplified by antibodies against conformational epitopes of MOG (Genain et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1995</xref>), which are clearly produced in the rhMOG model. Another subset of highly reactive T cells with natural killer-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte characteristics and specific for MOG<sub>34&#x02013;56</sub> becomes involved at a later stage in the disease (Kap et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2008</xref>). Our previously reported studies in marmoset EAE models induced with MOG<sub>34&#x02013;56</sub> in CFA (Kap et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2008</xref>) or IFA (Jagessar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref>) demonstrated that the same clinical and pathological end-points can be reached via different immunopathogenic routes. It can thus be envisaged that after neutralization of IL-17A in the complex rhMOG/CFA-induced model other pathogenic mechanisms, such as Th1 cells, may come into play. It could also be possible that Th1 and Th17 cells act in different phases of the disease. In the previously reported study in the rhMOG marmoset model it was observed that Th1 cells specific for MOG<sub>24&#x02013;36</sub> are engaged in EAE induction, whereas MOG<sub>34&#x02013;56</sub>-specific T cells, which produce mainly IL-17A, mediate disease progression (Jagessar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref>; Kap et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2008</xref>). This suggests that, consistent with the results in the Biozzi ABH mouse model, neutralizing IL-17A in a later phase of the disease is more effective.</p><p>Yet, another possible explanation is that IL-17A, although being the signature cytokine of Th17 cells, is not the dominant pathogenic factor produced by Th17 cells. This explanation is supported by data in mice. IL-12/IL-23p40<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are completely resistant to EAE, whereas only clinical scores and not the disease incidence is reduced in IL-17<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (Becher et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2002</xref>; Cua et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2003</xref>; Gran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2002</xref>; Komiyama et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2006</xref>). Moreover, treatment of mice with anti-IL-23 antibody prevented either EAE induction or relapse, in contrast to the anti-IL-17A antibody treatment that blocked relapse, but had a smaller effect on the induction phase (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2006</xref>). This may suggest that other Th17 cytokines induced by IL-23 may be pathogenetically more relevant than IL-17A in the induction phase, such as IL-21 or IL-22 (reviewed in (Fouser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2008</xref>)). In addition, Chen et al. suggested that IL-23 may also directly activate macrophages to produce inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1, and TNF-&#x003b1;, which may cause inflammation and demyelination even when IL-17A is neutralized (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2006</xref>).</p><p>Is there a place for an IL-17A neutralizing antibody in the treatment of MS? Axtell et al. reported that on the basis of clinical response to IFN-&#x003b2; two groups may be distinguished in the MS patient population. Responsiveness to IFN-&#x003b2; treatment requires a Th1 cytokine profile, whereas cases with a Th17 dominated cytokine profile are non-responders to IFN-&#x003b2; treatment (Axtell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2010</xref>). It is tempting to speculate on the basis of these and our data that non-responder cases to IFN-&#x003b2; treatment in the MS population may benefit from treatment with IL-17A antibody. The ideal study design to obtain proof-of-principle may be a parallel effectivity analysis in the marmoset EAE model, where in one sibling of a chimeric twin EAE is induced with MOG<sub>34&#x02013;56</sub> in CFA, which is a Th1 prone model (Jagessar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref>; Kap et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2008</xref>) and in the other twin sibling with MOG<sub>34&#x02013;56</sub> in IFA, which is a more Th17 prone disease (Jagessar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref>; Kap et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2008</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we found that treatment with anti-IL-17A antibody induces a moderate delay of clinical EAE in marmosets, but that EAE is not completely abrogated. This suggests a pathogenic role for IL-17A in the marmoset EAE model and maybe in MS, but IL-17A may not be the only key pathogenic cytokine.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors like to thank Fred Batenburg for excellent biotechnical assistance and daily care of the monkeys, Jaco Bakker DVM, Gerco Braskamp DVM and Merei Keehnen DVM for expert veterinary care, Tom Haaksma and Dr. Ivanela Kondova for autopsy of the monkeys.
