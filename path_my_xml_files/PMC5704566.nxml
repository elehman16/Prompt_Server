This article presents results of a quasi-experiment studying the effect of LifeCourse, a whole-person, longitudinal approach to care in late life, on patient experience versus usual care. Our contributions include length of follow-up, a dedicated experience measure, and a focus on patients&#x02019; needs upstream starting with long-term chronic care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section2-1049909117690710"><title>Methods</title><p>This quasi-experimental study assesses a model of whole-person care for patients with serious chronic illness. The study was approved by Quorum institutional review board. Supplemental material (deidentified data and participant questionnaires) are available from the authors on reasonable request.</p><sec id="section3-1049909117690710"><title>Intervention</title><p>LifeCourse is a team-based intervention designed to improve the lives and care of patients and caregivers. Its design was informed by national expert and local patient advisory panels, patient stories, and input by local experts in team-based care, aging, and chronic condition management. Designers also used key pieces from National Consensus Project (NCP) <italic>Clinical Practice Guidelines for Quality Palliative Care</italic>,<sup><xref rid="bibr34-1049909117690710" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> which organize practices around domains of palliative care. Specifically, LifeCourse domains include physical, psychological, social, family/caregiver, cultural, spiritual, legacy/bereavement, end of life, ethical, and financial/legal.</p><p>A key piece of the whole-person approach is the involvement of care guides, who are lay health-care workers acting in support, relationship, and navigation roles. Care teams consist of these care guides, with support from clinicians, including a registered nurse, social worker, marriage and family therapist, chaplain, and pharmacist. LifeCourse extends care by using care guides as patients&#x02019; and caregivers&#x02019; primary contact on the care team. LifeCourse designers, therefore, adapted select practices from the NCP guidelines for palliative care as appropriate for delivery by lay health-care workers. The manual and training sessions for new LifeCourse care guides include training modules on these adapted domains and practices to orient care guides to the LifeCourse model of whole-person care.</p><p>In practice, care guides have monthly, hour-long visits with patients and friends/family. Visits can be telephonic but are typically in-person at patients&#x02019; homes. Care guides aim to identify patients&#x02019; whole-person needs and then provide practical and emotional support. This whole-person focus arises via structured conversations designed to help patients identify and articulate medical and nonmedical concerns. In these conversations, care guides follow a discussion guide that includes question sets and assessments align with the whole-person domains in the NCP guidelines<sup><xref rid="bibr34-1049909117690710" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> noted above. This helps surface medical and nonmedical concerns to support the whole person. Care guides then either support patients in contacting their medical provider team or linking to community resources that meet needs such as food scarcity or transportation. Care guides also help navigate visits to hospitals and clinics and help empower patients by articulating or updating their preferences and goals. Finally, care guides also document the patient&#x02019;s story in the medical record, including notes on whole-person domains. The overall goal is to orient care toward the patient as a whole person, provide patients with key competencies (eg, advanced care planning), and engage patients in decision-making. An example of transformation to a whole-person model of care is as follows:<disp-quote><p>A LifeCourse patient awaiting a kidney transplant received notification that she was no longer a transplant candidate. Prior to this, the patient&#x02019;s care guide had accompanied her to the kidney transplant clinic for a social evaluation. After removal from the transplant list, the care guide supported the patient as she grieved the loss of a life without dialysis, discussed her concerns with a LifeCourse clinical manager, assisted with making lifestyle changes, and reviewed the patient&#x02019;s support system to identify needs.</p></disp-quote>

Eligible patients had at least one of the following: advanced cancer, dementia or Parkinson disease, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney or end-stage renal disease, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, and diabetes. Patients were identified using a medical record&#x02013;based algorithm, with a further eligibility check by an experienced registered nurse. Nondementia patients had to have a combined Charlson-Elixhauser score<sup><xref rid="bibr35-1049909117690710" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> greater than 3. We used 2 further inclusion criteria. First, patients had to have 6 possible months of observation (some patients were not yet 6 months postbaseline). Second, individuals had to have received the final outcome survey tool. Initial patients (who received a noncompatible pilot survey) and those requiring proxies (no proxy tool was available) were not eligible for this analysis (despite receiving the intervention).</p><p>Recruitment occurred between October 2012 and June 2015; all eligible patients were approached in person and offered participation in the study (convenience sample).

This tool was developed specifically for evaluating the LifeCourse intervention. Other experience tools were deemed not suitable for tracking patients with serious chronic illness over time. As such, based on the input from professional expert and patient panels, we adapted or created items based on other experience tools geared toward patient experience in late life or serious illness.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-1049909117690710" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><xref rid="bibr38-1049909117690710" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr39-1049909117690710" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> We revised the tool during prepilot and pilot testing, including cognitive debriefing and exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses.</p><p>The LifeCourse experience tool consisted of 21 items asking about aspects of care regarding interpersonal issues, access, and personal goals and biography.

Most items used 4-point, frequency-based responses (&#x0201c;never&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;always&#x0201d;), but Goals used agreement-based responses (&#x0201c;strongly disagree&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;strongly agree&#x0201d;). Individuals had to have answered at least 80% of items to have a valid response recorded (missing values were prorated based on nonmissing items). Items were summed for total and domain scores.</p><p>Other measures, collected from patient records, included age (&#x0003c;65, 65-74, 75-84, 85+), sex, race/ethnicity (white vs other), primary diagnosis (heart failure and other chronic conditions, cancer, dementia), being married (vs not), education (high school or less, some college/bachelor&#x02019;s, graduate/professional school), and comorbidity index.<sup><xref rid="bibr35-1049909117690710" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>

Various statistical adjustments and sensitivity analyses did not remove this overall association, suggesting a robust, if modest, treatment effect.</p><p>Although not a primary concern, testing domains separately was informative. Findings suggest that the overall treatment effect represents a sum of effects across domains of patient experience. Individual domains had positive, but nonsignificant, effects. Further work on individual domains, with larger samples or qualitative assessment, may help further understand the strengths and limitations of the intervention. Teasing out such domains may be particularly important for patients with complex chronic illness, whose treatment burden often goes unaddressed in usual care.<sup><xref rid="bibr40-1049909117690710" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Moreover, discussions and communication tools (generally and in late life) do not guarantee patient&#x02013;clinician concordance or decisions oriented to the whole-person.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-1049909117690710" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bibr41-1049909117690710" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="bibr42-1049909117690710" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>
</p><p>Patients with complex illness face high treatment volume, sense-making, and other demands that threaten to overwhelm personal capacity and disrupt everyday life.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1049909117690710" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-1049909117690710" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr43-1049909117690710" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="bibr44-1049909117690710" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> For these patients especially, it is vital that care models include teams who know and communicate with patients around their goals. It is important to avoid late response to treatment intensification and overmedicalization and improve person-focused care. To do so, moving care models upstream from end-of-life care may be useful, provided transitions and relationships can be supported. We plan to assess care transitions and new services needed (items not part of the main experience tool analyzed here) in future work.</p><p>Limitations of this study primarily relate to the use of a nonequivalent comparison group. Although we adjusted for confounding and preexisting differences, residual selection bias and residual differences between sites may remain. In future studies, large cluster randomized studies would greatly help establish effectiveness. Of course, given the realities of practice, such a design might be unfeasible for providers and come with a potential loss in external validity. Our use of a new measure may be another source of concern. In addition, attrition bias is likely; while sensitivity analyses suggested only limited attrition bias in the treatment effect, unobserved correlates of attrition may still shape results. Although improving patient experience is a key goal of LifeCourse, studying this outcome does mean that we cannot afford space to address the costs or sustainability. Another issue for further research is generalizability to other disease sets. We did examine patients with cancer, heart failure or other chronic conditions, and dementia or Parkinson disease. However, these conditions have unique challenges, and individuals can have additional conditions beyond their primary diagnoses. Most in this study had heart failure or other chronic conditions. Therefore, examining LifeCourse among specific condition sets may help detail its differential impacts. However, we hope to address those in future analyses. Finally, this 6-month follow-up study period, while reasonable, does not examine patient experience in long term.</p><p>Despite limitations, this study addressed selection and attrition while quasi-experimentally evaluating a novel intervention for late-life care. It found benefits for overall patient experience and also found that this overall experience effect is likely a sum of modest effects across care team, communication, and care goals domains. These findings suggest that LifeCourse, as a team-based, whole-person, longitudinal approach to care, deserves further attention as a way of improving patients&#x02019; experience with care at the later stages of serious chronic illness.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="fn1-1049909117690710"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn2-1049909117690710"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the Robina Foundation.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-1049909117690710"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
