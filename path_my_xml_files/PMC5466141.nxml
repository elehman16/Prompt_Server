They were presented with a hypothetical decision scenario where they were asked to consider adding etanercept to their current regimen. Each patient was randomized to review 1 of 3 forms of an etanercept-specific decision support: a long PtDA (LONG DA), a short PtDA (SHORT DA), or the manufacturer&#x02019;s Enbrel decision guide (Pharm Booklet). <bold>Results.</bold> We had 402 RA patients participate in the study (response rate, 52%). Of the patients randomized to the Pharm Booklet, 30.6% elected to initiate etanercept. Only 14.6% and 14.0% of patients who reviewed the LONG DA or SHORT DA choose to take etanercept (&#x003c7;2 = 15.7; P &#x0003c; 0.001). Patients who reviewed the LONG DA or SHORT DA had a greater increase in knowledge about etanercept than those who reviewed the Pharm Booklet. There was no difference in decisional conflict among the groups. A logistic regression model explained 44.2% (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.442) of patient choice to intensify therapy by initiating etanercept. The strongest predictor of choice to intensify therapy were beliefs about etanercept&#x02019;s ability to improve symptoms (OR = 2.56, 96%CI [1.71, 3.80]), and its use by others like the respondent (OR = 2.24, 95%CI [1.49, 3.35]). Mediation analysis confirmed the presence of a partial mediating effect of decision support on patients&#x02019; intent to take etanercept (OR = 0.59, 95%CI [0.39, 0.89]). <bold>Conclusions.</bold> Patients supported by the Pharm Booklet were twice as likely to choose to intensify therapy. The Pharm Booklet&#x02019;s effects are partially mediated through persuasive communication techniques that influence patients&#x02019; beliefs that symptoms will improve, and increase social normative beliefs, rather than by increasing the relevant knowledge, clarifying patient values about positive or negative treatment outcomes, or increasing their self-efficacy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>decision making</kwd><kwd>patient decision aid</kwd><kwd>evaluative conditioning</kwd><kwd>beliefs about medications</kwd><kwd>etanercept</kwd><kwd>disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs</kwd><kwd>rheumatoid arthritis</kwd><kwd>causal mediation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Physicians are morally and legally obligated to obtain informed consent when initiating medical therapies.

In addition, there is a testimonial from the popular &#x0201c;Hall of Fame&#x0201d; golfer Phil Mickelson, who takes etanercept for psoriatic arthritis.</p><p>Overall, it is unknown how strong the effects of any of these methods of evaluative conditioning are on the formation of beliefs about medications and patients&#x02019; responses to a physician&#x02019;s recommendation to intensify therapy.<sup><xref rid="bibr38-0272989X17696995" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> An ethical conflict arises if the Pharm Booklet produces positive beliefs about drug safety and efficacy that are not fully accurate, yet shape the patient&#x02019;s choice toward adopting the new therapy. In this case, the persuasive materials undermine patient autonomy, as the medication decision might be based on an emotional response rather than an appraisal of the facts about efficacy and safety.<sup><xref rid="bibr38-0272989X17696995" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p><p>Our study attempts to begin to unravel the question of what effects evaluative conditioning could have by comparing the Pharm Booklet to decision aids. PtDA are purposefully designed without using persuasive strategies, presenting benefits and harms neutrally, often supporting numerical information with visual aids to reduce the cognitive load and aid in the accurate understanding of the probabilities.<sup><xref rid="bibr41-0272989X17696995" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="bibr42-0272989X17696995" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup></p><p>Exposure to the Pharm Booklet doubled the rate of patient choice to intensify therapy (increased absolute rate of adoption by 17%) as compared with the SHORT DA and the LONG DA. We demonstrated that both DAs produced a greater increase in relevant knowledge but that the greater knowledge and feeling of being informed did not have an impact on the patient&#x02019;s beliefs about medication, decisional conflict, or their choice to intensify therapy.</p><p>The Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction proposes that intention and ultimate adoption of a new therapy can be predicted by 3 types of beliefs: 1) expected outcomes of therapy, 2) social norms, and 3) self-efficacy to act on the intention.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-0272989X17696995" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0272989X17696995">Figure 4</xref>, we conceptualize how patient characteristics, decisional support, and potential mediating medication beliefs could influence decisional outcomes. In the current study, predictive models demonstrate a stronger relationship between beliefs about outcomes of therapy and social norms on decisional outcomes than patient characteristics. In addition, it appears the mechanisms of the Pharm Booklet&#x02019;s effects are partially mediated through persuasive communication techniques that influence patients&#x02019; belief symptoms: This will improve and increase social normative beliefs rather than by increase relevant knowledge, clarifying patient values about positive or negative treatment outcomes, or increasing their self-efficacy.</p><fig id="fig4-0272989X17696995" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Simplified model of the effects of decisional support on the choice to intensify therapy.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0272989X17696995-fig4"/></fig><p>Our study has several limitations. First, it was a simulated decision rather than a high-stakes, real-time clinical decision. In addition, it was conducted as a mail survey; thus, we cannot be sure how much time or effort patients expended in reviewing the decisional support materials. We expected some variation amongst patients, as the incomplete utilization of decision aids by patients has been previously reported and may relate to the salience of materials to the individual patient.<sup><xref rid="bibr43-0272989X17696995" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="bibr44-0272989X17696995" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> Another uncertainty is the effect of the design of the decision/choice set in the PtDAs. The choice architecture of the LONG and SHORT DA directed the patient to consider 5 choices: take no treatment, continue current treatment, begin Enbrel now, ask doctor about other options, and defer choice for now. This reflects real-world conditions, where PtDA are often used as an adjunct to the medical office visit. It frames the decision as more than, &#x0201c;should I take or reject the proposed therapy now&#x0201d; to a broader starting point of &#x0201c;do I want to take any treatment for RA&#x0201d; and removes limits to the time of deliberation while considering &#x0201c;do I need other information or to consider additional options&#x0201d;. Because our simulated decision was an experiment, we forced subjects to make a choice &#x0201c;to call to request a prescription to start Enbrel now&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;choose not to start Enbrel now&#x0201d;. For this reason, our results may not fully reveal how decision support performs in the field. However, in some ways this may mimic real ambulatory practice where a physician introduces treatment options and send the patient home with support materials to reflect on their preferences and choose. Alternatively, by choice bracketing&#x02014;i.e., reducing from a 5-choice set to 2 choices: 1. start Enbrel now v. 2. choose not to start Enbrel now (no treatment, continue current treatment, ask about other options, defer choice for now)&#x02014;it is possible that we could have introduced a broad bracketing effect.<sup><xref rid="bibr45-0272989X17696995" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> This could potentially result in different patient choices than in a clinical setting, where all 5 choice options are available. The direction and magnitude of this effect is context specific and could not be predicted with the current study design.</p><p>Given the respondent burden to read educational materials and complete a pre- and post-survey, we felt the response rate was excellent at 52%. We compared the demographics of the original sample frame with the completed sample and found them to be similar. When compared to a random sample of patients seen in Michigan community rheumatology practices, our completed sample contained a lower proportion of low-education patients (6.2% v. 14.2%) but a similar minority representation (6.3% v. 7.3%).<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0272989X17696995" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Together, these suggest that the results can be reasonably generalized to other community rheumatology practice populations, though additional study is needed in low education populations.</p><p>In conclusion, this study has several implications for practice and policy. Schwartz and Woloshin of the Dartmouth Center for Health Policy and Practice have lobbied the FDA and legislators to revise their policies to mandate providing medication efficacy data and create new standards for presenting side effect data in non-biased formats to patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-0272989X17696995" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bibr9-0272989X17696995" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Unfortunately, the FDA deferred action for an undisclosed 3- to 5-y study period.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-0272989X17696995" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The results of our study provide further evidence that the choice architecture in the Pharm Booklet contained powerful, persuasive content that may lead patients to develop inaccurate beliefs about the efficacy or safety of the treatment, and it undermines their decision making autonomy. From a societal viewpoint, these Pharm Booklets could lead to the overutilization of recommended medications by nudging patients toward adopting proposed commercial products without a critical consideration of the drug attributes. PtDA offer a balanced alternative that clinicians could use to structure complex medication discussions and support more informed patient choices. We believe patients would benefit from their use.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx" xlink:href="Martin_MDM-15-455.R3_Supplement_Consort_Flow_Chart.docx" orientation="portrait" id="d35e1183" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Michael Frisby of the Michigan State University Center for Statistical Training and Consulting for assistance with developing and interpreting the logistic regression models as well as Blake Riek, PhD of Calvin College Department of Psychology who conducted the mediation analysis.
