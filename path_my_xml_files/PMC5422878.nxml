The overall mean global figure for the incidence of gestational anemia is 25% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. WHO (World Health Organisation) has estimated that prevalence of anemia in developed and developing countries in pregnant women is 14% in developed and 51% in developing countries and 65 to 75% in India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It is a direct cause of 20% of maternal mortality in India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and indirect cause in 20 to 40% of maternal deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Anemia interferes with the normal intrauterine growth leading to fetal loss and perinatal deaths. It is associated with increased preterm labor (28%), preeclampsia (31%) and maternal sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Over the past years, various oral, intramuscular and intravenous preparations of iron have been used for correction of IDA (Iron Deficiency Anemia) in pregnant patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The first choice in the treatment of iron deficiency anemia for almost all patients is oral iron replacement because of its effectiveness, safety, and lower cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>The major problem with oral iron therapy in its classic ferrous form is poor tolerability and up to 40% adverse reaction rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The most common complaints are nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea and constipation.</p><p>Severe systemic adverse effects associated with iron dextran and iron gluconate limited the use of intravenous iron. Iron sucrose complex (ISC) is a relatively new drug, which is used intravenously for the correction of IDA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Iron sucrose complex is a widely used and safe molecule, which has become major interest to prevent iron deficiency anemia. The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of intravenous iron sucrose with that of oral ferrous fumarate in iron deficiency anemia during 14 to 34&#x000a0;weeks of pregnancy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>In this study, written informed consent for participation in the study was obtained from all participants.</p><p>A prospective randomized controlled study was done from October 2011 to August 2012 in the department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shri B M Patil Medical college of B.L.D.E University, Bijapur. 112 pregnant women between 14 to 34&#x000a0;weeks of pregnancy were studied. The inclusion criteria were haemoglobin level between 70 to 110&#x000a0;g/L, serum ferritin of less than 15&#x000a0;ng/ml, age 18 to 45&#x000a0;years, singleton pregnancy. The exclusion criteria were patients with history of bleeding tendency, history of blood transfusion within the prior 120&#x000a0;days, hemoglobinopathy or other red cell disorders, allergic conditions or asthma, acute inflammatory state.<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="12884_2017_1313_Figa_HTML" id="MO1"/>
</p><p>Alternatively patients were assigned to 2 groups (Group A - Oral group, Group B - Intravenous group) by simple randomization method, and 56 patients in each group were studied.</p><p>In the oral group, the patients received two tablets of ferrous fumarate, each containing 100&#x000a0;mg of elemental iron daily for 4&#x000a0;weeks.5&#x000a0;mg of folic acid per day was supplemented with this treatment. Patients were told to note treatment compliances carefully on a calendar provided for that purpose. Women were asked to bring back empty packs and were asked about intake of tablets and the color of the stools to ensure that they consumed the tablets.</p><p>In the intravenous group, the dose of total iron sucrose to be administered was calculated from the following formula &#x02013;</p><p>Total dose required&#x02009;=&#x02009;weight in kg&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;(target Hb in g/L &#x02013; Actual Hb in g/L)&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;0.24&#x02009;+&#x02009;500&#x000a0;mg. rounded up to the nearest multiple of 100&#x000a0;mg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>This dose of iron sucrose complex was administered as 200&#x000a0;mg (elemental iron) in 100&#x000a0;ml 0.9% sodium chloride intravenously over 20 to 30&#x000a0;min daily up to the total dose. No test dose was given [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This treatment was supplemented with 5&#x000a0;mg of oral folic acid daily for 4&#x000a0;weeks to prevent an eventual folic acid deficiency and to eliminate the influence of such a deficiency on the results. Additional oral administration of iron was excluded during the 4&#x000a0;weeks of study.</p><p>The two groups were monitored both clinically, biologically and adverse reaction linked with it. In addition to the data required at the start of the study biologic monitoring was carried out on inclusion (day 0).</p><p>The measurements recorded were: &#x02212; haemoglobin %, complete blood count, serum ferritin, urine analysis, peripheral smear for type of anemia.</p><p>After 4&#x000a0;weeks on day 30, haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels were repeated in both groups.</p><p>The study results were expressed as mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;standard deviation.

</p><p>In the Group B, those treated with I.V iron sucrose 6 patients had minor side effects like burning, pain and swelling at the injection site. In the Group A, those treated with oral ferrous fumarate, 14 patients had side effects out of which 8 had nausea and vomiting, 4 patients had gastritis and 2 patients had loose motion. Out of these 14 patients 8 patients took their tablets irregularly otherwise, the compliance was excellent.</p><p>In this study it was observed that parenterally administered iron sucrose elevates hemoglobin and restores iron stores better than oral ferrous fumarate during the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy. The mean changes in hemoglobin and ferritin levels throughout the treatment were significantly higher in the intravenously administered iron group than in the orally administered iron group.</p><p>Oral iron is effective, safe, low cost, but there may be failure in the effectiveness due to non compliance, achlorhydria, inflammatory bowel diseases, or unrecognized bleeding. Non compliance is largely related to side effects. 10 to 40% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] suffer adverse gastrointestinal effects - constipation, diarrhoea, epigastric discomfort, nausea, severe abdominal pain and vomiting. They can be decreased by food, but food decreases absorption by 10 to 40%.</p><p>Iron dextran compounds are stable, strong complexes of relatively high molecular weight, long half life and relatively slow release. Life threatening anaphylactic reactions (sudden cardiovascular collapse, respiratory failure) occurred in 0.1 to 2% of patients treated with this product. 30% of patients suffered from adverse effects which include fever, arthritis, urticaria. It is associated with arthritis flare up hence contraindicated in rheumatoid arthritis. Iron sucrose complex seems to be safe with fewer and milder side effects even in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Intramuscular iron, iron-sorbitol citric acid complex causes metallic taste on tongue, nausea, vomiting and pain at the injection site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Other parenteral iron preparations available are ferric gluconate, ferric citrate but are found to cause severe and extended liver necrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Iron sucrose belongs to the iron complexes of medium strong type (molecular mass between 30,000 and 100,000&#x000a0;Da). In the regulation of marrow proliferation iron delivery rate to the marrow is a major factor. The pharmacokinetic properties of iron dextran and iron sucrose are different. Iron dextran has a half-life of 3 to 4&#x000a0;days whereas iron sucrose has a terminal half-life of approximately 5 to 6&#x000a0;h and is quickly cleared from serum and thus rapidly available for erythropoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It is shown in studies that in renal patients with severe IDA, 70-97% of the iron is used for erythropoiesis with only 4-6% elimination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Hemoglobin concentration with intravenous iron sucrose is more rapidly increased than oral iron and intramuscular iron dextran [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>ISC has small molecular weight hence anaphylaxis is very rare. Until now, only one case of possible anaphylactic reaction has been described. ISC is taken up mainly by the reticuloendothelial system and it is unlikely that it would be taken up by the parenchymal cells of liver, kidney, adrenal gland or other organs, hence, organic toxicity like pancreatic, myocardial or hepatic hemosiderosis is less likely even with iron sucrose complex overload.</p><p>In a random, prospective, open study done by Bayoumeu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] in 2002, 24 women were given intravenous iron sucrose in 6 slow I.V injections on days 1, 4, 8, 12, 15 and 21 with a maximum of 200&#x000a0;mg of iron each time and 23 women were given 240&#x000a0;mg oral ferrous sulfate. An increase in hemoglobin was observed on day 30 in both oral and I.V group (Not significant) but serum ferritin was higher in the IV group (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). Similarly in our study also there was highly significant difference in the serum ferritin levels after 4&#x000a0;weeks of treatment (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) in comparison with oral group whereas there was no significant difference in terms of Hb rise after 4&#x000a0;weeks of treatment between oral and I.V group.</p><p>Al Momen et al.

They compared 52 women treated with intravenous iron sucrose 200&#x000a0;mg in 100&#x000a0;ml Normal saline daily till total dose was met and 59 women treated with 300&#x000a0;mg of oral iron sulfate and found that intravenous treatment resulted in higher hemoglobin levels in shorter periods compared with the oral treatment group (mean 6.9 versus 14.9&#x000a0;weeks). However, in their study 30% of the patients had poor compliance with oral treatment whereas only 14% in the oral group in our study took tablets irregularly, otherwise the compliance was excellent with ferrous fumarate.</p><p>I.V iron sucrose was well tolerated and not associated with any serious adverse effects in our study and was only associated with burning, pain and swelling at the injection site in 6 patients. It was reduced by thrombophobe ointment, ice pack and by injecting 5&#x000a0;cc of normal saline or distilled water at the end of I.V sucrose infusion. Previous larger studies that have investigated the safety profile of intravenous iron sucrose both during pregnancy and in the postpartum period support this finding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Perewunsnyk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] studied 500 women who received iron sucrose. Minor general adverse effect including a metallic taste, flushing of the face and burning at the injection site occurred in 0.5%, with doses up to 200&#x000a0;mg. The high tolerance of the drug has been partly attributed to slow release of iron from the complex and also due to low allergenicity of sucrose.</p><p>The compliance with oral treatment in our study was surprisingly good and was reinforced by verbal contact which is in contrast with compliance findings described in other studies. Gastrointestinal adverse effects are thought to be dose related [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and occur more frequently at higher doses and are also related to type of iron formulation used.</p><p>In a study by Dede et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] in 2004, 50 patients were included in the I.V iron sucrose group (200&#x000a0;mg in 100&#x000a0;ml normal saline daily till total dose was met) and 25 patients were included in oral ferrous sulfate group (300&#x000a0;mg tablet containing 60&#x000a0;mg elemental iron thrice daily). Blood samples were taken to evaluate levels of Hb, serum ferritin, serum iron, CRP (C-Reactive Protein), MCV (Mean corpuscular volume), TIBC (Total iron binding capacity) before the start of therapy and at days 7 and 28. It was shown in the study that intravenous iron therapy with an iron sucrose complex significantly increased serum ferritin levels within a short time with fewer adverse effects than oral iron therapy in women with post partum iron deficiency anemia. The results of this study were similar to our study.</p><p>The total dose of iron sucrose can be administered over a short period. This treatment will certainly help in reducing the risk of homologous blood transfusion during the peripartum period if used in time. Overall iron sucrose appears to be a treatment of choice with no serious side effects indicated in the rapid correction of anemia in pregnancy or restoring maternal iron stores.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Intravenous iron Sucrose Complex (ISC) is safe and effective in the treatment of iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy.
