It is unknown what the metabolic consequence is of consumption of a formula where lactose has been replaced with corn syrup solids (CSS). Here, a randomized double-blinded intervention study was conducted where exclusively formula-fed infants were fed formula containing either lactose or CSS-based infant formula and compared with an equal number of exclusively breast-fed infants. Plasma metabolites and insulin were measured at baseline, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120&#x02009;min after feeding. Differences in plasma metabolite profiles for formula-fed infants included a rapid increase in circulating amino acids, creatinine and urea compared with breast-fed infants. At 120&#x02009;min post-feeding, insulin was significantly elevated in formula-fed compared with breast-fed infants. Infants fed lactose-based formula had the highest levels of glucose at 120&#x02009;min, and leucine, isoleucine, valine and proline at 90 and 120&#x02009;min, whereas infants fed CSS-based formula had the lowest levels of non-esterified fatty acids at all time points, and glucose at 120&#x02009;min. Overall, these differences highlight that changes in infant formula composition impact infant metabolism, and show that metabolomics is a powerful tool to help with development of improved infant formulas.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lactose is the major carbohydrate in human milk, followed by oligosaccharides and glucose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Compared with other mammals, human milk has the highest lactose concentration, 50% higher than cow&#x02019;s milk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, contributing to over 60% of the total osmolarity in human milk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. We have previously reported that although the concentration of lactose increases gradually over time, individual variability is low compared with other milk sugars<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In order to match the composition of human milk, milk-based infant formulas usually use lactose as the only, or main carbohydrate source. However, in recent years, lactose-free formulas containing maltodextrin (MDX) or corn syrup solids (CSS) have become increasingly used. Indeed, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) reported approximately 5% of infants received lactose-reduced formulas in the U.S alone between 2003 and 2010<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, and this trend is increasing. A common rationale for the use of lactose-free infant formulas is that infants are presumed to be lactose intolerant; although there is little or no evidence that lactose reduced formulas are beneficial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p>We, and others, have previously shown that early diet is important in shaping the immune function, gut microbiota and metabolism of neonates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, none of these studies have examined the metabolic postprandial response of full-term healthy infants who were breast-fed or formula-fed, and the metabolic consequences of replacing lactose with another carbohydrate. Here, we present a randomized double-blind intervention study comparing the pre- and post-prandial response of serum insulin and plasma metabolites in 3-months-old infants upon consumption of human milk, lactose- or CSS-based formula.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Postprandial venous blood from 30 term infants (males:females, 50:50, with equal numbers of each sex in each group) with a mean age of 85.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.8 days was obtained. No significant differences among the groups concerning mother&#x02019;s age at delivery, parent&#x02019;s education level, parity, gestational age as well as birth and test day length, weight and head circumference were observed (one-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc Tukey HSD test).

However, using cluster-based analysis, differences in the overall plasma metabolic profile at baseline were observed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>), reflecting a pre-existing metabolic difference between breast-fed and formula-fed infants prior to the start of the experiment. The average effect size (Cohen d) of all measured metabolites (35 total) at baseline (in the semi-fasted state) was moderate (0.79 and 0.77) between breastfed and infants fed CSS- or lactose-based formula respectively. Breast-fed infants had significantly higher acetate, acetone, formate, glutamine, methanol, proline and myo-inositol. In contrast, formula-fed infants had higher urea, creatine, essential amino acids (threonine and valine) and their amino acid catabolism by-products (2-hydroxybutyrate and 3-hydroxyisobutyrate), choline, and the host-microbial co-metabolite dimethyl sulfone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). There were no significant differences in the overall composition or individual metabolite concentrations between formula-fed infants assigned to the lactose- or CSS-based formula at baseline (one-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc Tukey HSD test, data not shown), although a weak average effect size of 0.45 for all measured metabolites at baseline (semi-fasted state) between infants fed CSS and infants fed lactose-based formula was observed.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Principal components analysis (PCA) reveals differences between breastfed and formula-fed infants at baseline and after feeding.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Acute response to diet indicates a postprandial metabolic modification by feeding</title><p>Analysis of the postprandial plasma metabolome revealed a clear difference between breast-fed and formula-fed infants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>), with some separation between the infants fed lactose-based formula, and those fed CSS-based formula. The average post-prandial effect size for all metabolites was strong (1.57 and 1.65) between breastfed and infants fed CSS- or lactose-based formula respectively, and moderate (0.71) between infants fed CSS and infants fed lactose-based formula. The average effect size was strongest between the formula groups at 90 and 120&#x02009;min (0.83 at each time point). Applications of ANCOVA, with post-meal measurements as outcome, and baseline measurements as covariate to eliminate baseline bias, suggest that except for proline (which was higher in breast-fed infants at baseline and increased significantly postprandially for formula-fed infants), all metabolites that were significantly different at baseline followed the same trend in the postprandial period (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Compared with breast-fed infants, formula-fed infants had higher concentrations of circulating amino acids including alanine, the branched chain amino acids (BCAA: isoleucine, leucine, valine), lysine, methionine, proline, and tyrosine (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Post-prandial concentration of plasma metabolites and serum insulin.

</p><p>In the postprandial state, both plasma glucose and serum insulin levels were elevated compared with baseline, peaking at 15 or 30&#x02009;min post-meal, as were BCAA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Insulin and glucose were positively correlated, as was insulin with each of the BCAA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). Although no overall difference in insulin and glucose concentrations based on AUC analysis (with or without adjustment of baseline; one-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc Tukey HSD test) was observed, at 120&#x02009;min post-meal, both formula-fed groups showed elevated insulin compared with breast-fed infants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1A</xref>). Strikingly, those infants fed lactose-based infant formula had the highest average insulin compared to breast-fed infants, and significantly higher glucose compared with CSS-based formula-fed infants, whereas CSS-based formula-fed infants had the highest lactate at 15&#x02009;min and lowest glucose at 120&#x02009;min (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1A</xref>).

</p><p>Ketone bodies (3-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate) were significantly higher in the lactose-based, compared with the CSS-based formula-fed infants (rmANCOVA, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), and were similar to breast-fed infants. Concomitant with this, NEFA was elevated at 15 and 30&#x02009;min post-meal in the lactose-based formula-fed infants compared to the CSS-based formula-fed infants (one-way ANOVA followed by posthoc Tukey HSD test, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.06 and p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03 respectively, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1B</xref>), and was positively correlated with concentrations of plasma 3-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Several studies have assessed metabolic differences between breast-fed and formula-fed infants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> (reviewed in refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>). However, none of these looked at the post-prandial metabolome in response to feeding. Moreover, no studies to date detailing the effect of consumption of a carbohydrate other than lactose on infant metabolism have been reported.</p><p>A profound metabolic discrepancy between breast-fed and formula-fed infants at baseline (semi-fasting state) suggests that overall infant metabolism is shaped by diet. Compared to formula-fed infants, breast-fed infants showed increased &#x003b2;-oxidation reflected as higher acetone. Formula-fed infants showed elevated protein degradation pathways with elevated nitrogen waste products (urea), creatine, essential amino acids (threonine and valine), and amino acid catabolism by-products (2-hydroxybutyrate, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate) consistent with their higher overall protein intake. Interestingly, the plasma concentration of 2-hydroxybutyrate, a product of threonine metabolism, was double in the formula-fed compared with breast-fed infants at baseline, and nearly triple 1&#x02009;h into the post-prandial period. It was recently shown that 2-hydroxybutyrate may be an early marker for insulin resistance and impaired glucose regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>; however, whether this holds true in infants remains to be shown.</p><p>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x003b1; (PPAR&#x003b1;) has been identified as the master regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism (including fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation and ketogenesis), and additionally plays a role in glucose, amino acid, and lipoprotein metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. For example, PPAR&#x003b1;-null mice show increased circulating amino acids and urea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In the semi-fasted state, we observed higher circulating threonine and valine (and their catabolic products 2-hydroxybutyrate and 3-hydroxyisobutyrate respectively) and urea in both formula groups compared with breast-fed infants, and lower acetone. Reduced PPAR&#x003b1; activity in formula-fed infants compared with breast-fed infants could be one mechanism supporting these observations.</p><p>After feeding, a rapid elevation of circulating amino acids was observed in all infants as early as 15&#x02009;min post-feeding (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). It has previously been shown that there is a linear correlation between dietary amino acid intake and plasma amino acid levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Infant formula contains higher protein levels than human milk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and in this study contained approximately twice that of human milk. Interestingly, the rise in plasma amino acid levels of the formula-fed infants was twice that of breast-fed infants at 30&#x02009;min. Moreover, for breast-fed infants, circulating amino acids started to decrease after 30&#x02009;min, whereas for infants fed CSS-based formula, this did not occur until after 60&#x02009;min. However, for infants fed lactose-based formula, circulating amino acids continued to increase until 60&#x02009;min, and remained high until 120&#x02009;min (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This post-prandial difference may be due to differences in gastric emptying times. Breast milk has been shown to empty faster than lactose-containing formula, with the mean half-emptying times measured as 48 versus 78&#x02009;min respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Moreover, in premature infants, use of a glucose polymer (polycose) instead of lactose resulted in significantly less volume of gastric contents at 60 and 80 min<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. It is therefore plausible that gastric emptying time is responsible for the differences in plasma amino acid concentration at the later time points in the post-prandial period between infants fed CSS- or lactose-based formula.</p><p>There is mounting evidence that suggests that leucine (as well as the other BCAAs) regulate mTORC1-S6K1 signaling, which may lead to insulin resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Furthermore, mTORC1 controls adipogenesis through activation of PPAR&#x003b3;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. We observed an average 108% increase in plasma leucine over the first 30&#x02009;min in both formula groups whereas leucine in breast-fed infants only increased by an average of 42%. Throughout the postprandial period, leucine remained high for the formula-fed infants (on average 87% higher and 148% higher than baseline in CSS- and lactose-based formula-fed infants respectively), whereas its concentration returned to near baseline values for breast-fed infants by 120&#x02009;min. Exaggerated mTORC1 signaling during postnatal growth may promote mTORC1/SREBP-1/ PPAR&#x003b3;-mediated adiposity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Indeed, formula-feeding has been shown to result in higher fat mass than breast-feeding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>; however, no evidence of an increased risk of type 2 diabetes has been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p>Other postprandial differences in the plasma metabolome included increased urea concentrations, as well as lower <italic>myo</italic>-inositol, formate, methanol, and acetone in formula-fed relative to breast-fed infants. A similar finding was reported in our previous work investigating the effect of feeding practice on infant rhesus monkeys from birth to 3 months of age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. These results may be interpreted as formula-fed infants tending to favor the use of protein (higher protein:energy ratio), and breast-fed infants favoring use of fat for energy.</p><p>Lactose is a disaccharide composed of glucose and galactose. After digestion in the small intestine by lactase, more than 90% of the absorbed galactose is consumed by the liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, where it is converted to glucose 1-phosphate that can subsequently be used for glycogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. It was previously shown that the perfused neonatal rhesus liver is able to rapidly take up galactose when a combination of galactose, insulin and glucose are available, increasing glycogen synthase activity and inactivating phosphorylase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Interestingly, no net glycogen synthesis was observed in response to glucose perfusion alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The increase in glycogen synthase activity achieved by consumption of lactose-based formula (as opposed to formula containing glucose polymers) suggests that more of the energy from the carbohydrate is converted to glycogen rather than directly to fat.</p><p>Little difference between infants consuming CSS-based and lactose-based formula was observed at baseline, likely due to the short lead-in period of 1&#x02013;3 feedings prior to the experiment. However, while lower levels of post-prandial plasma amino acids could be explained by a difference in gastric emptying time, infants consuming the CSS-based formula had higher lactate at 15 and 30&#x02009;min, and the lowest NEFA at all time points. Additionally, at 120&#x02009;min, CSS-based formula-fed infants had significantly higher insulin than breast-fed infants, but the lowest average glucose compared with infants fed the lactose-based formula or breast-fed infants. It is known that high circulating NEFA activates ketogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Indeed, a strong correlation between circulating NEFA and 3-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate concentrations was observed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). Low ketones and NEFA in the CSS-based formula-fed infants may have a negative impact on infant development, as although glucose is the main carbohydrate fuel for brain growth and metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, it is known that ketones are used to maintain normoglycemia in the infant, protecting the brain in case of hypoglycemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The mechanism behind the difference in circulating NEFA and ketones between infants fed CSS-based versus lactose-based formula is unknown at this time. Possibly, galactose increases lipolysis, as has been previously shown in obese women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p>In conclusion, this is the first study to show semi-fasted and postprandial differences in the plasma metabolome between breast-fed and formula-fed infants, and the effects of replacing lactose with CSS. Study limitations include a small sample size and lack of a longer follow-up period. Nonetheless, this study illustrates the power of metabolomics to uncover the effects of feeding on metabolism and shows how this technique is invaluable for development of improved infant formulas.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study Design</title><p>Between June 2013 and December 2014, study staff screened charts from the delivery ward at Ume&#x000e5; University hospital, Ume&#x000e5;, Sweden.

Experimental formulas consisted of carbohydrate-free infant formula (SHS Carbohydrate-Free Mixture, Nutricia Nordica AB, Solna, Sweden) as base and either a sachet of 6.54&#x02009;g/100&#x02009;g of lactose (Leprino Foods, Lemoore West, CA) or 6.54&#x02009;g/100&#x02009;g of CSS (DE24) (Roquette Freres, Lestrem, France). Sachets containing carbohydrate (lactose or CSS) were identical in appearance and marked with a letter. Study staff and parents were blinded to the intervention. Experimental formulas were prepared by dissolving 14&#x02009;g of lactose or CSS in 200&#x02009;mL of water, followed by mixing with the same amount (weight) of carbohydrate free mixture. The macronutrient composition of human milk, CSS- and lactose-based formulas are presented in Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>.</p><p>On the experimental day, subjects were admitted to the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit at Ume&#x000e5; University hospital in a semi-fasting state. Parents were instructed to fast their infants for at least 2&#x02009;h, and numbing cream (Tapin&#x000ae;, Orifarm Generics AB, Odense, DK) was applied to a surface-exposed vein 1&#x02009;h prior to insertion of an in-dwelling butterfly needle to minimize pain (Becton Dickinson, Plymouth, UK). In four infants an intra-venous line was not easily established and these infants were excluded (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). Fasting blood samples (1&#x02013;1.5&#x02009;mL) were drawn into microtubes with EDTA for plasma and without additives for serum (Becton Dickinson). Parents were instructed to feed their infants (breastfeed, or feed lactose- or CSS-based formula) for ~20&#x02009;min. A research assistant prepared the formula, and a study nurse supervised the feeding. The amount consumed was calculated by subtracting the weight of the infant before from the weight after feeding for breast-fed infants, or measuring the amount left in the bottle for formula-fed infants. After feeding was finished, blood samples (1&#x02013;1.5&#x02009;mL) were drawn at 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120&#x02009;min (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). Plasma (immediately) and serum (after 50&#x02009;min at room temperature) were separated by centrifugation at 3,000&#x02009;rpm for 10&#x02009;min at room temperature. Plasma and serum were aliquoted, immediately frozen at &#x02212;20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, and stored at &#x02212;70&#x02009;&#x000b0;C until further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Ethical Considerations</title><p>Approval of the trial was obtained from the local ethical review board in Ume&#x000e5; (2013-152-31&#x02009;M) and registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrails.gov">www.clinicaltrails.gov</ext-link> (identifier NCT02441296) April 8, 2015.

Absorbance at 370&#x02009;nm was measured on a SpectraMax 340 Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and concentration was calculated as the mean value of duplicate analyses against a standard with SoftMax Pro 2.6.1 software using a 4-parameter logistic equation. Samples with % coefficient of variation (%CV) &#x0003e;10 were re-analysed. Two kit controls were analysed for intra assay variation to 3.4%. Using a serum control, the inter- and intra-assay variation was 9.5% and 3.0%, respectively, calculated as the mean of duplicate determinations in five separate assays.
