These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment. Minimizing impairment and risk is the goal of therapy for all levels of asthma severity. The attainment of asthma control correlates with improved quality of life (QoL) and reduced health care use.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Pharmaceutical care is the responsible provision of drug therapy for the purpose of achieving definite outcomes that improve a patient's QoL.

A questionnaire for the assessment of patient's perception about the asthma, medications, and inhalation therapy was prepared according to the Indian Council of Medical Research asthma questionnaire. This questionnaire was tested for face validity and reliability using current and standard methods.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>The Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ)[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] was used both in English as well as Tamil version for India. The Standardized AQLQ[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] was selected for the work and it consists of 32 questions with a 7-point scale of responses for each (e.g., 1 = totally limited to 7 = not at all limited). The questions were grouped into four domains which was based on the symptoms (all generic), activity limitations, emotional function, and environmental stimuli. Domain consisted of 12, 11, 5, and 4 questions, respectively. A quick test which provided a numerical score to assess asthma control was prepared and the questions were made according to the NIH 2007 asthma guidelines. Asthma Control Test (ACT)[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] is a 5-point scale questionnaire consisting of five questions. A patient education leaflet was designed and printed both in English and Tamil for educating the patient on the proper usage of inhalers and was given to the patients in the baseline study.</p><p>An asthma care diary was designed and printed both in English and Tamil to educate the patient about their asthma and its management. Only the intervention group patients were provided with asthma care diary which consists of mainly pictorial representation of asthma, an information leaflet for patients, small briefing on asthma, pictorial representation of the five steps in asthma management, how to use peak flow meter, inhalation techniques for selected inhalation devices, asthma management plan, and asthma symptoms log sheet.</p><p>The baseline study using the prepared questionnaire was carried out for 3 months from May 2009 to August 2009. Clinical pharmacist recruited 22 medically diagnosed asthma patients according to the selection criteria for the study. 66 patients were enrolled for the complete study. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: intervention group and control group. Personal interviews were conducted with all the patients. Outcome measures included peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) value, QoL scores, and asthma control scores. Intervention group received pharmaceutical care (asthma care diary, education, and counseling) till the end of the study, while the control group patients were not offered any intervention. The interviews for the measurement of QoL were conducted at three different timings i.e., first was at the baseline, second was at the 15<sup>th</sup> day from baseline, and third was at 29<sup>th</sup> day from the baseline. Two interviews were conducted for the measurement of asthma control, one at the baseline and other at the 29<sup>th</sup> day from the baseline. The patients were asked to complete asthma control test questionnaire and the responses are on a 5-point scale. At the time of interviews, the QoL questions and asthma control test were administered to the patients of both groups. The control group did not receive any input. Clinical pharmacist followed the patient's progress with follow-up visits and phone calls and patient's progress was noted.</p><p>For AQLQ questionnaire, the mean score per question for each of the four domains was calculated, and the overall score was derived from the mean score of all questions. For all ACT questions, mean score per question was also calculated.

The result of the study demonstrated that the intervention group which was provided with pharmaceutical care had an improvement in mean score values of the domains of asthma QoL measurement. A study conducted by Abdelhamid <italic>et al</italic>[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] on pharmaceutical care services for patients with asthma showed that the intervention group showed a significant greater improvement in the score for assessing the inhalation technique (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), patient's knowledge about asthma (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), and its drug therapy (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01) compared with control.</p><p>There was also a significant increase in the PEFR values at the final visits, in the intervention group, whereas only a slight increase was seen in the control group.</p><p>Their asthma control improvement is also supported by the mean values of ACT, which was found to be higher in the intervention group compared with that of the control group. Pereira <italic>et al</italic> in a study on QoL in asthma[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] showed that the ACT scores were statistically correlated with the QoL (<italic>r</italic> = &#x02212;0.72; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), symptoms improvement (<italic>r</italic> = &#x02212;0.78; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) and better physical activity (<italic>r</italic> = &#x02212;0.67; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01); which may means that better asthma control scores may translates to better QoL. Another study by Ko <italic>et al</italic>[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] demonstrated that the measurement of ACT is useful for assessing asthma control, prediction of exacerbation, and changes in treatment decisions.</p><p>In this study the lung function of the intervention group were also improved when they are compared with the control group. The four domains of AQLQ indicated significant improvement in the intervention group than the control group. Two studies on self-management of asthma by Mancuso <italic>et al</italic>[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] revealed that the intervention patients had more improvement in AQLQ scores after 5 months, and the AQLQ scores improved significantly from 4.1 to a mean of 5.1 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). In their patients the clinical asthma status measured with the AQLQ showed more knowledge (<italic>P</italic> = 0.005), more positive attitude (<italic>P</italic> = 0.02), and more self-efficacy (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01) were associated with better AQLQ scores.</p><p>Similar study by Mehuys <italic>et al</italic>[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] demonstrated the effectiveness of pharmacist intervention for asthma control improvement. They found that pragmatic community pharmacy-based programs can significantly improve therapeutic outcomes in adult asthma patients. Santos <italic>et al</italic>[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] in their study on pharmaceutical care for patients with persistent asthma have reported that counseling provided by the pharmacist to the patient was important to assist in the implementation of the appropriate inhalation technique.</p><p>It seems that providing pharmaceutical care has an important role in the management of asthma and such studies taken up by the clinical pharmacists can help the healthcare professionals to improve patient's QoL and in turn the patient health care.</p><p>The aim of the asthma management is to gain and maintain control of the disease. Clinical pharmacists are recommended to get involved in developing clinical management plans and Asthma Action Plans for asthma patients, reviewing and educating on inhaler technique and undertaking regular reviews. The pharmaceutical care program provided in this study showed a positive impact in improving patient's asthma-related QoL, lung function, and asthma control. The interventions by the clinical pharmacists resulted in improvements in asthma control, adherence to preventer medication, QoL, and asthma knowledge. This study has demonstrated a better outcome on QoL and lung function for the control of asthma by the intervention of clinical pharmacists and it seems that by providing well-structured patient-oriented pharmaceutical care, pharmacists can help asthma patients in achieving desired health outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>AUTHORS&#x02019; CONTRIBUTION</title><p>All authors contributed the idea of research, design of study, data analysis and manuscript preparation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to thank Professor Elizabeth F.
