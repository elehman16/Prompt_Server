Eligible participants were healthy women aged 40&#x02013;62 years, having seven or more hot flushes in every 24 h of which some were reported as being severe or bothersome, who had not had a menstrual period for at least 12 months, and who had not been taking any medication shown to improve menopausal flushes in the preceding 8 weeks. Participants received 4 weeks of MLE4901 (40 mg, orally, twice daily) and placebo (orally, twice daily) in random order separated by a 2 week washout period. Randomisation was completed by a central computer, and participants were allocated to treatment number in numerical order. The primary outcome was the total number of hot flushes during the final week of both treatment periods. Analyses were by intention to treat and per protocol using generalised linear mixed models and standard crossover analysis. All analyses were prespecified in the study protocol.

Hormone replacement therapy is an effective treatment but is contraindicated in some women, and is not without risk in all due to long-term safety concerns, particularly an increased risk of breast cancer (though perhaps less so if it is oestrogen-only hormone replacement therapy), thromboembolism, and stroke. Alternative treatments&#x02014;eg, some antidepressants and herbal remedies, have been shown to have some efficacy but not always greater than the effect of a placebo depending on the study and treatment class, and are not without side-effects too. For the past 20 years a growing body of evidence has accumulated that implicates neurokinin B (NKB) signalling (a hypothalamic neuropeptide) together with its receptor (NK3R) in the aetiology of menopausal hot flushes. We searched PubMed on Jan 6, 2017, using the keywords &#x0201c;neurokinin 3 receptor&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;hot flushes&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;hot flashes&#x0201d; with no date or language restrictions. Of the four publications identified, one was a comprehensive review summarising all previous evidence in rodents, primates, and human post-mortem studies that shows that NKB neurons adapt in response to sex steroid deficiency, that this can be reversed by sex steroid replacement, and that NKB signalling is propagated via the hypothalamic median pre-optic nucleus (MnPO), which expresses NK3R, and receives input from, and projects to, the autonomic thermoregulatory pathway. This review included one of the other original articles identified. Of the other two, one was an original article that further supports the role of NKB signalling in the MnPO, and the other was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial that showed that peripheral infusion of NKB intravenously induces hot flushes in healthy premenopausal women that are typical of the location, duration, and observed physiological change of those described by postmenopausal women. An original article (not identified from the search) of a genome-wide association study found that genetic variation in <italic>TAC3R</italic>, which is the gene that encodes NK3R, might account for the variability in experience of hot flushes reported among women.</p><p><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p>We provide evidence from a phase 2, randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover trial that treatment with an oral, neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist taken twice daily significantly reduces the frequency of menopausal hot flushes. Residual flushes are also significantly less severe, less bothersome, and less interfering than when taking placebo. Treatment was well tolerated and safe. The only safety caution was a mild transient rise in transaminase concentrations in a small subgroup of participants.</p><p><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p>The finding that pharmacological blockade of NKB signalling with an oral NK3R antagonist can significantly improve hot flush symptoms independently of any hormonal effect fits entirely with the pre-existing data, and suggests great promise for such agents as a novel therapy. Larger scale studies of longer duration will determine whether such a therapeutic approach will change future clinical practice so that the lives of those women so deeply affected by hot flushes can be transformed without the need for increased oestrogen exposure.</p></boxed-text></p><p>A hot flush is characterised by an intense feeling of heat, which often rises through the body, and intermittent activation of heat dissipation effectors, including peripheral cutaneous vasodilatation, sweating, and behavioural change, to reduce temperature.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> In rodents this is seen as a change in tail skin temperature secondary to vasodilatation of tail vessels, and behaviour change to increase heat loss such as grooming and hyperventilation.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> In human beings, a symptom diary and skin conductance monitor can reflect similar changes.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>It has been known for many years that the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis regulates circulating sex steroid concentrations throughout life but it is only more recently that the role of the hypothalamic neurons containing colocalised kisspeptin, neurokinin B (NKB), and dynorphin receptors (so called KNDy neurons) has become clear.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Furthermore, over the past 20 years, Rance and colleagues have contributed to a growing body of evidence in rodents,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> primates,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> and post-mortem studies in human beings<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> that the KNDy neurons, and in particular NKB and its receptor (NK3R), are implicated in the aetiology of the menopausal hot flush (summarised in a comprehensive review by Rance and colleagues<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref>). Two recent publications further implicate NKB and NK3R in menopausal flushing: in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, peripheral infusion of NKB intravenously to healthy premenopausal women induced hot flushes that were typical in location and duration to those described by postmenopausal women,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> and Crandall and colleagues<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> found that genetic variation in <italic>TACR3</italic>, which is the gene that encodes NK3R, might account for the variability in experience of hot flushes reported among menopausal women.

Hot flush severity and bother were reported twice daily (on waking to capture previous overnight symptoms and before bed to capture daytime symptoms) using a scale that ranged from nil to severe, and from not at all to a lot, respectively.

Furthermore, to analyse luteinising hormone pulsatility a subgroup of participants based on their willingness to participate (n=13) attended our clinical research facility for three, 8 h studies. One was during the baseline period, and one during the second week of both treatment periods. During each study a 3 mL blood sample was taken every 10 min from a peripheral venous cannula that had been sited before the study start (time &#x02212;30 min). All samples were left to clot for at least 30 min and then centrifuged so that the serum could be frozen for subsequent analysis. Analysis was completed in a batch when participants had finished the entire study protocol to eliminate any intra-assay variation. An automated chemiluminescent immunoassay method (Abbott Diagnostics, Maidenhead, UK) was used for analysis; for reference ranges, coefficients of variation, and analytical sensitivities see the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (p 5)</xref>.

For all models used, a standard crossover analysis was implemented, with period, administration sequence, and treatment as fixed effects and subject as a random effect. Tests for sequence (order) and period effects across all our models were done. All possible covariates were initially included in exploratory analyses but the only ones that were significant in each case were the baseline values of the endpoint being analysed, and so the final results reported are taken from models that included the baseline value as the only covariate. All of these models, although not assuming normally distributed errors, are entirely analogous to conventional analyses using ANCOVA and can be interpreted in the same way.</p><p>From each model, adjusted (least squares) means and differences between treatment means were estimated, together with associated 95% CIs, and a p value from a comparison of the mean values of the two treatments. For each endpoint, the percentage change from baseline was also estimated using a generalised linear mixed model (with gamma error structure) with fold-change from baseline as the analysed response, with percentage change (and 95% CI) derived by calculation from the fold-change results. This ensures that the percentage change results take into account the crossover design.</p><p>All of these analyses were prespecified as per the study protocol. The primary and all secondary endpoints were analysed using both the per-protocol and intention-to-treat analysis sets, and all p values and adjusted means for all endpoints were very similar. Accordingly, results have been presented for the intention-to-treat and per-protocol sets for the primary endpoint and for the per-protocol set only for the secondary endpoints as originally planned (though intention-to-treat analyses for the secondary outcomes as well as the per-protocol analysis for the primary outcome are reported in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). To facilitate the intention-to-treat analysis of the primary endpoint, weekly total flush counts were imputed where missing by setting the count totals to be equal on both active and placebo treatment groups. However, we also did a sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint intention-to-treat analysis using multiple imputation techniques, and this gave similar results to those reported below, with a slightly larger estimate of treatment effect. The multiple imputation method was used for all intention-to-treat analyses of secondary endpoints. All significant p values reported remained significant after adjustment for multiple testing (using the false discovery rate) procedure.

AstraZeneca agreed to provide their NK3R antagonist (AZD4901) and exact-matched placebo in a collaboration led by the principal investigator (WSD). The study was sponsored by the principal investigator's host institution (Imperial College London). One employee of AstraZeneca (LCW) contributed to the study design and continued to be involved in the trial management group while the study was ongoing. AstraZeneca held the background intellectual property regarding the compound. AstraZeneca subsequently exclusively licensed the compound to Millendo Therapeutics after the research protocol had been approved, and so one representative from their company (PM) also became involved in the trial management group while the study was ongoing. At this time the compound name was changed from AZD4901 to MLE4901. WSD and JKP (Imperial College London) had full access to all the data from the study and had final responsibility for the content of the report and decision to submit for publication.

After discussion, eight did not meet the inclusion criteria, and 11 met an exclusion criterion, and so all 19 were withdrawn (see <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 1&#x02013;3</xref>). Four further participants withdrew before the study began due to time commitments. Therefore, 45 participants started the trial, of which seven were identified to have not met the inclusion criteria regarding frequency or severity of flushes at the end of week 2 (as per protocol) and so were not randomly assigned and withdrawn. One participant was randomly assigned but withdrew before receiving the allocated intervention due to new employment and so was not included in any analysis. Of the remaining 37 participants who were randomly assigned and received study medication (the intention-to-treat analysis set), 28 completed the protocol (the per-protocol analysis set; age range 49&#x02013;62 years and had been experiencing hot flushes for 1&#x02013;16 years).

Two participants unintentionally missed more than three doses of the intervention, one of which was due to bereavement, and so were both withdrawn from the study as per protocol. The dropout rate was 24% (nine of 37), which was higher than anticipated, and was mostly due to participants choosing to book a holiday outside the UK for more than 7 days during the study period.</p></sec><sec id="cesec100"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this randomised, double-blind, crossover study we have shown that an NK3R antagonist (MLE4901) significantly reduced the mean weekly number, severity, bother, and interference of hot flushes, which otherwise negatively impact a menopausal woman in her daily life. This result was achieved with a well tolerated, twice daily, oral preparation. Associated psychosocial and physical symptoms also improved with treatment (particularly those related to improved sleep such as fatigue and irritability) as otherwise disruptive night-time flushes were significantly reduced. The only safety caution was an asymptomatic rise in transaminase concentrations in a small subgroup of participants that was not associated with a rise in bilirubin. The results of ongoing and future clinical trials of MLE4901 will further explore this effect and characterise any appropriate follow-up studies required.</p><p>This study was designed as a 4 week crossover trial because it was a proof-of-concept study enabling the inclusion of fewer participants to achieve our sample calculation, a shorter trial duration,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> and more importantly ensured each participant acted as their own control for treatment comparisons. Baseline data generated before randomisation allowed further treatment comparisons to be made and baseline covariates to be used to reduce error variance. We allowed for a 25% reduction in hot flush frequency with placebo at 4 weeks based on previously published studies in menopausal flushing with a similar methodology to ours:<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> our observed rate was a 28% reduction with placebo, which therefore fits closely with the existing literature.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> However, we acknowledge that there are risks of bias in crossover studies and so we avoided these by ensuring those recruited had chronic and stable flushes in the months preceding enrolment, randomisation, and blinding procedures, and the duration of the treatment and washout periods to eliminate a carryover effect. To ensure adverse events were appropriately assigned, counting rules were used to assess for treatment-emergent events. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were compared to ensure loss of participants or missing imputation methods did not distort our findings. All reported analyses conformed to the requirements of a crossover trial, and followed common practice for this study design. The objective reduction in hot flushes seen at 4 weeks using the skin conductance monitor with hot flush detection algorithm suggests that the duration of the treatment was sufficient to prove the concept. Furthermore, concordance was seen between subjective reporting and objective measurement of symptoms (45 percentage point decrease <italic>vs</italic> 43 percentage point decrease in hot flushes, respectively, with MLE4901 compared with placebo).</p><p>The findings from this ambulatory study should be generalisable as we placed no restriction on lifestyle, our cohort had a range of symptom duration, a quarter were not white, and some were smokers. Furthermore, no participants had received any treatment that could have improved their hot flushes for at least 8 weeks before study start, and therefore any treatment effect seen is likely to have been caused by the NK3R antagonist. Interestingly, a substantial proportion of our cohort had previously tried herbal remedies with far fewer having tried hormone replacement therapy either due to a contraindication or more commonly due to concerns regarding its use.</p><p>However, the trial is also not without limitations. The number of participants was small, the treatment duration was short, and the dropout rate was higher than anticipated. A larger and longer trial is needed to establish whether the treatment effect is long lasting in a greater number of individuals. The study was done in a single centre, and so this could be a potential source of bias. However, as a result all participants were seen and directed by the same trial doctor (JKP) during almost all of the study visits minimising variability in instructions given between participants and maximising compliance. Weekly questionnaire data regarding the primary and secondary outcomes were entered into the electronic clinical record forms by CD, RER, or ZN to reduce the likelihood of JKP observing the original data, or patterns of results that could influence opinion regarding treatment intervention when seeing the participants before the end of the study. For the same reason, data were not collated and blood samples for hormone concentrations were not analysed until participants had finished the study. Alcohol intake has previously been found to exacerbate menopausal flushes but as alcohol dependence was in our exclusion criteria all participants consumed equal to, or less than, 14 units per week. Increased body-mass index has also previously been associated with increased flushing but was not found to be an independent covariate in our analysis; this might be due to the small study size. As many of the participants were widowed, separated, or not currently sexually active any improvement in the sexual MENQOL domain by treatment with MLE4901 could have been missed as these contributory factors remained unchanged throughout the study.</p><p>Over the past 20 years a growing body of evidence has implicated NKB&#x02013;NK3R signalling in the aetiology of menopausal hot flushes. By studying brain specimens at post mortem, Rance and Young<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> initially showed that in postmenopausal women, hypothalamic neurons are hypertrophied and have increased NKB gene expression and neuronal activity compared with premenopausal women. In keeping with this, the same was found to be true in ovariectomised monkeys but, moreover, this change could be reversed by treatment with sex steroid replacement, thus suggesting this was a dynamic change in response to circulating concentrations of oestradiol as occurs in the menopause.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Subsequent work in rats highlighted the importance of the hypothalamic pre-optic nucleus (MnPO) in the propagation of the NKB-mediated signal that results in hot flushes. The MnPO is a neural area that receives input from, and projects to, the autonomic thermoregulatory pathway and expresses NK3R,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and hence results in activation of heat dissipation effectors that characterise hot flushes. Furthermore, in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in healthy premenopausal women, peripheral infusion of NKB intravenously induced hot flushes that were typical in location, duration, and observed physiological change to those described by postmenopausal women.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Additionally, Crandall and colleagues<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> recently found that genetic variation in <italic>TACR3</italic>, which is the gene that encodes NK3R, might account for the variability in experience of hot flushes reported among women. Therefore, the finding that pharmacological blockade of NKB signalling with an oral NK3R antagonist can significantly improve hot flush symptoms independent of any hormonal effect fits entirely with this pre-existing data. This finding suggests great promise for such agents as a novel therapeutic target to change future clinical practice so that the lives of those women so deeply affected by hot flushes could be transformed without the need for increased oestrogen exposure. Larger scale studies of longer duration are the required next step in assessing the feasibility and likelihood of this.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref
