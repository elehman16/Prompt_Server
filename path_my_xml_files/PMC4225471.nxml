Patients were randomized to receive TCZ-SC 162 mg every 2 weeks or TCZ-IV 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks; no DMARDs were allowed during the study. The primary end point was to evaluate the noninferiority of TCZ-SC to TCZ-IV regarding the American College of Rheumatology criteria for 20% improvement in disease activity (ACR20) response rates at week 24 using an 18% noninferiority margin.

Remission rates of the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the Clinical Disease Activity Index at week 24 were 49.7% and 16.4% in the TCZ-SC group and 62.2% and 23.1% in the TCZ-IV group, respectively. Serum trough TCZ concentrations were similar between the groups over time. Incidences of all adverse events and serious adverse events were 89.0% and 7.5% in the TCZ-SC group and 90.8% and 5.8% in the TCZ-IV group, respectively. Anti-TCZ antibodies were detected in 3.5% of the TCZ-SC group; no serious hypersensitivity was reported in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>TCZ-SC monotherapy demonstrated comparable efficacy and safety to TCZ-IV monotherapy.

Multiple phase III trials of TCZ, in combination with synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or as monotherapy, demonstrated an improvement of clinical symptoms and prevention of joint destruction (<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Previously, patients with RA who did not respond to treatment, such as the 19th century French impressionist painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir, had limited alternatives available (<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Many treatment choices are now available that have proven clinical efficacy, including anti&#x02013;tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents and TCZ. Most anti-TNF agents require concomitant methotrexate (MTX) for maximum efficacy, whereas TCZ has similar efficacy with and without MTX (<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>To optimize a patient's treatment, the efficacy, safety, and route of administration for each therapy should be considered along with a patient's disease status in order to achieve clinical, functional, and structural remission or the lowest disease activity state possible (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Some patients prefer therapies with a biologic agent that can be administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection rather than IV formulations, and prefer to receive treatments at home (<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). An SC formulation of TCZ (TCZ-SC) would provide an additional treatment option for patients with RA.</p><p>The efficacy and pharmacokinetics of TCZ-SC monotherapy were evaluated in an open-label, phase I/II study conducted in Japan at 3 doses (81 mg every 2 weeks, 162 mg every 2 weeks, and 162 mg weekly) over 6 months (<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). To further expand on these results, the noninferiority, multicenter phase II study MUSASHI (Multi-Center Double-Blind Study of Tocilizumab Subcutaneous Injection in Patients Having Rheumatoid Arthritis to Verify Noninferiority Against Intravenous Infusion) was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of TCZ-SC monotherapy 162 mg every 2 weeks and TCZ-IV monotherapy 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks in Japanese patients with RA with an inadequate response to synthetic and/or biologic DMARDs.</p><boxed-text position="float"><sec><title>Significance &#x00026; Innovations</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A subcutaneous formulation of tocilizumab (TCZ) would greatly contribute to improving the quality of life in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) because it would allow for a shorter administration time compared with an intravenous formulation and for home administration.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Subcutaneous TCZ monotherapy demonstrated comparable efficacy and safety to intravenous TCZ monotherapy in patients with RA who have had an inadequate response to synthetic and/or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></boxed-text></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Patient population</title><p>Eligible patients were ages 20&#x02013;75 years and had RA for &#x02265;6 months, as diagnosed using the 1987 criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) for the classification of RA (<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Additional inclusion criteria were as follows: an inadequate response of &#x02265;12 weeks to any synthetic DMARD (MTX, sulfasalazine, bucillamine, and leflunomide), biologic DMARD (infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab), or immunosuppressant (e.g., tacrolimus); &#x02265;8 tender joints (of 68 joints); &#x02265;6 swollen joints (of 66 joints); and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) &#x02265;30 mm/hour or a C-reactive protein level &#x02265;1.0 mg/dl.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included active tuberculosis, a history of serious allergies, and active hepatitis B or C. All candidates underwent tuberculin reaction or QuantiFERON testing. Patients testing positive for latent tuberculosis were enrolled if treatment with isoniazid was initiated 3 weeks prior to initial administration of TCZ and continued for 9 months. Patients with class IV Steinbrocker functional activity were excluded. Patients were also excluded if they had received previous treatment with TCZ; had received plasmapheresis, surgical procedures (except with locally and low invasive operations), or dose changes or added-in DMARDs or immunosuppressants within 4 weeks of TCZ treatment; had received oral glucocorticoids at a dosage of &#x0003e;10 mg/day of prednisolone or equivalent; or had a dose increase, new administration, or IV or intramuscular injections of glucocorticoids within 2 weeks of TCZ treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>MUSASHI was a 24-week, phase III, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study in Japanese patients with RA. The study protocol was approved by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan and by the local ethical committees. All patients gave their written informed consent.</p><p>Patients were randomized 1:1 into 2 groups: 162 mg of TCZ-SC monotherapy every 2 weeks plus placebo TCZ-IV every 4 weeks or 8 mg/kg of TCZ-IV monotherapy every 4 weeks plus placebo TCZ-SC every 2 weeks. Throughout the study, DMARDs or immunosuppressants were not permitted. There was no washout period for synthetic DMARDs as long as treatment and dose were stable a minimum of 4 weeks prior to initial TCZ treatment. Concomitant use of low-dosage oral glucocorticoids (&#x02264;10 mg/day of prednisolone or equivalent without escalation from the baseline dosage) and 1 oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug was permitted during the 24 weeks. Intraarticular injections of corticosteroids and hyaluronate preparations were avoided as much as possible.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy assessments</title><p>Efficacy assessments were conducted every 4 weeks. The primary end point was to demonstrate the noninferiority of TCZ-SC monotherapy to TCZ-IV monotherapy regarding the proportion of patients with 20% improvement in disease activity for ACR criteria (ACR20) responses at week 24 (<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Additional end points included ACR50 and ACR70 response rates, ACR/European League Against Rheumatism Boolean Index remission rates, Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) remission rates, Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using the ESR (DAS28-ESR) remission rates, and a low disease activity rate at week 24. Mean changes in DAS28-ESR, CDAI score, and the proportion of patients who improved in the Japanese version of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) by &#x02265;0.3 units from baseline were assessed over time (<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). For efficacy assessments, the per-protocol set (PPS) was used, excluding patients with protocol violations, early withdrawal, violations concerning concomitant medication use, or violations concerning the dose and administration. The last observation carried forward was used for any missing values. For patients receiving glucocorticoids or hyaluronic acid via intraarticular administration, any treated joints were treated as positive tender and swollen joints for that defined period.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetics</title><p>Samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24. TCZ, which is not bound with the IL-6 receptor (free TCZ) in the serum, was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The lower limit of detection for free TCZ in serum was 0.1 &#x003bc;g/ml.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety and immunogenicity assessments</title><p>Safety and immunogenicity data were analyzed using the safety population, defined as all patients who received at least 1 dose of TCZ. Adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs were classified using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, version 13.0. The number of patients with AEs and the total number of AEs were tabulated. Infusion and/or injection reactions were prespecified and classified as SC injection site reactions (ISRs; AEs at the site of SC injection), systemic reactions to SC injection (SIRs; AEs not at the site of SC injection within 24 hours of treatment), or IV infusion&#x02013;related reactions (IRRs; AEs occurring within 24 hours of treatment). All AEs were graded as severe, moderate, or mild by physicians. Laboratory investigations were graded by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.</p><p>Blood samples for the anti-TCZ antibody screening assay were collected every 4 weeks. The anti-TCZ antibody screening assay was performed as previously described using a bridging enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with an additional competitive displacement step as the confirmation assay (<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary end point was analyzed using the PPS for the primary analysis and the modified intent-to-treat (ITT) population for the sensitivity analysis. The modified ITT population included all patients who received at least 1 dose of treatment. The noninferiority margin was set at 18%, as determined using the difference between the ACR20 results of SATORI (Study of Active Controlled Tocilizumab Monotherapy for Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients with an Inadequate Response to Methotrexate) (<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>); 18% was the more conservative criterion because it was less than one-third of the difference of the ACR20 response rate between the TCZ-IV monotherapy group and the control group in the SATORI study. Furthermore, it is less than half of the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the difference between the groups. The adjusted 95% CI for the difference between the ACR20 response rate in the TCZ-SC monotherapy and TCZ-IV monotherapy groups was calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method, with patients stratified according to weight at enrollment (&#x0003c;60 or &#x02265;60 kg) and previous use of anti-TNF agents. Noninferiority was demonstrated if the lower limit was not below the confidence limit for noninferiority (&#x02212;18%). A sample size of 330 was calculated to provide 90% power to demonstrate the noninferiority of TCZ-SC monotherapy to TCZ-IV monotherapy. To determine the sample size, the ACR20 response rate was set to 70% because of the following assumptions: the ACR20 response rate at 24 weeks was 79.7% in the SATORI trial and the overall response rate potentially could be lower in the MUSASHI trial than in the SATORI trial because the patient population of inadequate anti-TNF responders was larger.</p><p>Simple logistic analysis was used to screen for potential predictive variables, including sex, age, weight (in kg, the fourth quartile versus the first to third quartiles), body mass index (BMI; in kg/m<sup>2</sup>, the fourth quartile versus the first to third quartiles), disease duration, Steinbrocker class/stage, history of anti-TNF agents, rheumatoid factor, anti&#x02013;cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, glucocorticoid dose, number of previous DMARDs, DAS28-ESR, ACR core components, and IL-6 levels at baseline. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify the contributing baseline parameters to ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 response rates in the TCZ-SC monotherapy group at week 24. The initial model contained the potential predictive variables and the predicting factor (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05) was identified in the final model by using a stepwise procedure.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Patient disposition</title><p>A total of 348 patients were randomized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>).

No patients who developed anti-TCZ antibodies experienced ISRs, SIRs, or lack of efficacy after developing anti-TCZ antibodies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This noninferiority study was conducted to compare the efficacy of TCZ-SC monotherapy and TCZ-IV monotherapy in Japanese patients with RA who had inadequate responses to synthetic and/or biologic DMARDs. For the primary efficacy end point of ACR20 response rate at week 24, TCZ-SC monotherapy demonstrated noninferiority to TCZ-IV monotherapy in the PPS. The primary noninferiority analysis was made in the PPS, as recommended by the International Conference on Harmonisation E9 (<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). To test the robustness of the noninferiority result, the results were validated by demonstrating the noninferiority of TCZ-SC monotherapy to TCZ-IV monotherapy in the modified ITT population. From the results of secondary end points, the difference between TCZ-SC monotherapy and TCZ-IV monotherapy of ACR50 and ACR70 was smaller than ACR20. Furthermore, the mean change of the DAS28-ESR and CDAI score of TCZ-SC monotherapy was comparable to TCZ-IV monotherapy. These results support the noninferiority of TCZ-SC monotherapy to TCZ-IV monotherapy.</p><p>Two additional randomized, double-blind, phase III global studies (SUMMACTA and BREVACTA) evaluated TCZ-SC in combination with DMARDs in patients with RA from North America, Europe, South America, and Asia (other than Japan) (<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In the SUMMACTA study, TCZ-SC 162 mg every week was demonstrated to be noninferior to TCZ-IV 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks in combination with DMARDs using an ACR20 responder end point (noninferiority margin of 10%). The BREVACTA study demonstrated the superiority of TCZ-SC 162 mg every 2 weeks compared to placebo regarding the percentage of patients who achieved an ACR20 response at week 24. In both studies, the patients' mean body weight was 70&#x02013;80 kg. In the MUSASHI study, TCZ-SC monotherapy dosing of every 2 weeks would be the most appropriate for Japanese patients with RA who have a lower body weight than patients in Western countries.</p><p>In Japan, the dose of TCZ-SC monotherapy of 162 mg every 2 weeks was selected from the previous phase I/II study with a mean body weight of 56 kg because it had a pharmacodynamic profile and TCZ trough concentration similar to those of the approved TCZ-IV dose of 8 mg/kg (<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In the current study, TCZ-SC monotherapy actually demonstrated TCZ trough concentrations comparable with those of TCZ-IV monotherapy despite a decrease in the given dose of TCZ in the TCZ-SC monotherapy group compared with the TCZ-IV monotherapy group if the weight is the same.</p><p>A previous TCZ-IV study reported that &#x02265;1 &#x003bc;g/ml of serum TCZ was considered enough to suppress IL-6 signal transduction in the sera (<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In the current study, serum trough TCZ concentrations in the TCZ-SC monotherapy group were approximately equal to those in the TCZ-IV monotherapy group from week 4 onward, and most patients in both groups had TCZ concentrations &#x02265;1 &#x003bc;g/ml. Prompt inhibition of IL-6 signaling by TCZ-SC monotherapy was also reflected in the time to improvement of disease activity, whereby the effectiveness of TCZ-SC monotherapy was approximately equal to that of TCZ-IV monotherapy from week 4 onward.</p><p>TCZ-SC monotherapy was administered as a fixed dose (162 mg), whereas the TCZ-IV monotherapy formulation was administered by body weight (8 mg/kg). In fact, trough TCZ concentrations tend to be lower in Japanese patients with a high body weight treated with TCZ-SC monotherapy (data not shown).</p><p>From the stepwise regression analyses, BMI in the fourth quartile at baseline was identified as a factor that contributed to low ACR response rates. However, more than half of patients in the fourth quartile of BMI achieved an ACR50 response. Therefore, it is unlikely that patients with high BMIs (23.4&#x02013;29.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) at baseline will have less response to therapy. With regard to the association between BMI and efficacy, further investigations are needed because the number of patients in the high BMI category was limited in this study. Previous use of anti-TNF agents was not identified as a factor that affected ACR response rates in the TCZ-SC monotherapy group. This suggests that the effect of TCZ-SC monotherapy on disease activity may be similar to that of TCZ-IV monotherapy in patients who have previously received anti-TNF agents.</p><p>Several studies have reported that TCZ as both monotherapy and in combination with DMARDs prevents joint destruction (<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The MMP-3 level in the TCZ-SC monotherapy group decreased at week 24 compared with baseline and was comparable with that in the TCZ-IV monotherapy group. Furthermore, the efficacy and serum TCZ trough concentrations were comparable between the TCZ-SC monotherapy and TCZ-IV monotherapy groups. These facts suggest that TCZ-SC monotherapy may also inhibit the progression of joint damage.</p><p>No new or unexpected safety issues were observed in this study. The safety profile of the TCZ-SC monotherapy group was similar to that of the TCZ-IV monotherapy group, except for ISRs. The incidence rate of ISRs was higher in the TCZ-SC monotherapy group than in the TCZ-IV monotherapy group. However, all events were mild and manageable. Although a direct comparison was difficult, the incidence of ISRs was not higher than that observed with other biologic agents that are administered by SC injection (10.4% with golimumab plus MTX and &#x0003e;30% with adalimumab monotherapy) (<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). While the incidence rate of serious infection with TCZ-SC monotherapy was lower than with TCZ-IV monotherapy, there are not enough data to determine if this is a true difference. Additional data are being collected in the extension period. The serum levels of KL-6 and SP-D were reported to be elevated in patients with interstitial lung disease. The observed increase in serum KL-6 and SP-D levels was consistent with that in previous reports (<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>The number of patients who developed anti-TCZ antibodies was higher in the TCZ-SC monotherapy group than in the TCZ-IV monotherapy group. However, neither of these rates was numerically higher than the antidrug antibody rates reported for other biologic agents used to treat RA (<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). None of the patients who tested positive for anti-TCZ antibodies experienced serious ISRs or hypersensitivity events, including anaphylaxis. The impact of anti-TCZ antibodies on efficacy was unclear because of the low number of patients who developed anti-TCZ antibodies. However, no patients who developed anti-TCZ antibodies experienced a lack of efficacy after developing anti-TCZ antibodies in this study.</p><p>The current study assessed the efficacy and safety of TCZ monotherapy without concomitant DMARDs. However, TCZ in combination with MTX was more commonly associated with elevated transaminases (<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and although the data on combination therapy with TCZ-SC are not yet available, the same effect is likely to be seen. Studies are currently ongoing to evaluate TCZ-SC in combination with DMARDs (<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>An SC formulation of TCZ would greatly shorten the administration time compared with the IV formulation and would allow for home administration. Moreover, it would shorten the time and effort involved in the preparation of TCZ prior to administration and therefore would be more convenient for both patients with RA and health care professionals.</p><p>In summary, the noninferiority of TCZ-SC monotherapy to TCZ-IV monotherapy was confirmed. TCZ-SC monotherapy provided efficacy, safety, and serum trough concentrations of TCZ that were comparable with those of TCZ-IV monotherapy. The use of TCZ-SC monotherapy would provide an additional administration option for patients with RA.</p></sec><sec><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>All authors were involved in drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content, and all authors approved the final version to be published.
