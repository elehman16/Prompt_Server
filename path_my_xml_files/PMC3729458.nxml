Executive function appears to be associated with both modulation of active networks and inhibition of activity in the default mode network. In the present study, we examined the role of the endocannabinoid system in executive function, focusing on both the associated brain network and the default mode network. A pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was conducted with a placebo-controlled, cross-over design, investigating effects of the endocannabinoid agonist &#x00394;9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on executive function in 20 healthy volunteers, using a continuous performance task with identical pairs. Task performance was impaired after THC administration, reflected in both an increase in false alarms and a reduction in detected targets. This was associated with reduced deactivation in a set of brain regions linked to the default mode network, including posterior cingulate cortex and angular gyrus. Less deactivation was significantly correlated with lower performance after THC. Regions that were activated by the continuous performance task, notably bilateral prefrontal and parietal cortex, did not show effects of THC. These findings suggest an important role for the endocannabinoid system in both default mode modulation and executive function. This may be relevant for psychiatric disorders associated with executive function deficits, such as schizophrenia and ADHD.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study is performed within the framework of Top Institute Pharma (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tipharma.com">www.tipharma.com</ext-link>), project number T5-107.

Recently, the eCB system has emerged as a potential candidate for pharmacological targeting of psychiatric syndromes including addiction <xref rid="pone.0070074-Maldonado1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and schizophrenia <xref rid="pone.0070074-Leweke1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Importantly, the eCB system has been associated with executive functions which are also affected in various psychiatric disorders. Modulation of the eCB system by administration of cannabis or &#x00394;9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component in cannabis and partial agonist of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor, impairs performance on various executive function paradigms that target high-level cognitive functions essential for goal-directed behavior <xref rid="pone.0070074-Klonoff1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0070074-Zuurman1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Goal-oriented behavior has recently been associated with reduced neural activity in the default mode network (DMN), which mainly consists of the posterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and bilateral inferior parietal lobules (including the angular gyrus) <xref rid="pone.0070074-Raichle1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0070074-WhitfieldGabrieli1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.

Moreover, psychiatric patients such as patients with schizophrenia or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), who exhibit a strong decline in cognitive function, display an inability to deactivate the DMN during performance of executive function paradigms <xref rid="pone.0070074-WhitfieldGabrieli1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070074-PomarolClotet1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0070074-Sutherland1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Collectively, this suggests a role for the DMN in cognitive function deficits.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to elucidate the role of the eCB system in executive function, in terms of performance and brain activity in both the DMN and the task-related network. To this end, a pharmacological functional MRI (fMRI) study was performed with acute THC administration, using a placebo-controlled cross-over design and a continuous performance task paradigm with identical pairs (CPT-IP) in healthy subjects <xref rid="pone.0070074-Adler1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070074-Strakowski1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. This version of the CPT is characterized by a heavy reliance on executive function, as it requires fast and continuous updating of information while short-term memory load is relatively small <xref rid="pone.0070074-Baddeley1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Previous imaging studies using CPT-IP paradigms have shown activation of an executive system predominantly consisting of frontal and parietal regions <xref rid="pone.0070074-Adler1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070074-Strakowski1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. We compared performance on the CPT-IP task after placebo and after THC administration, and assessed the role of the DMN and the executive system in the effect of THC. On the basis of neuropsychological findings <xref rid="pone.0070074-Klonoff1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0070074-Morrison1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, it was expected that THC administration would reduce performance on the CPT-IP task. This was hypothesized to be associated with reduced deactivation of the DMN, as this has been shown to impair cognitive performance <xref rid="pone.0070074-Daselaar1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0070074-Hahn1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.

After THC administration, subjects showed impaired task performance, reflected in both an increase in false alarms and a reduction in detected targets. Brain regions that were deactivated during the task showed less deactivation after THC than after placebo. In addition, after THC, task performance was negatively correlated with activity in the deactivated regions. In contrast, regions that were positively activated by the task did not show THC-induced changes in activity. Together, these results indicate that the DMN plays a role in the effects of THC on executive function. Effects of THC on DMN activity were predominantly found in the posterior cingulate cortex and angular gyrus, both considered pivotal DMN nodes <xref rid="pone.0070074-Raichle1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0070074-WhitfieldGabrieli1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>A possible role of DMN in executive function is addressed by the default mode interference hypothesis which states that functions performed by the DMN interfere with successful goal-oriented performance <xref rid="pone.0070074-SonugaBarke1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. In the context of a normally functioning brain, the DMN component is attenuated during goal-directed action, and the level of attenuation is independent of task content. Neuroimaging studies support this notion, as several studies have linked reduced DMN activity with successful task execution <xref rid="pone.0070074-Daselaar1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0070074-Hahn1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In addition, the level of reduction in DMN activity appears to reflect the relative resources that need to be allocated to task execution <xref rid="pone.0070074-McKiernan1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070074-Jansma1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. How exactly interference occurs is largely unknown, but a possibility is that DMN functions use similar resources as those needed for goal-oriented behavior. Possible functions of the DMN include conscious processes that occur in the absence of goal-oriented behavior, such as self-referential mental processing <xref rid="pone.0070074-Gusnard1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, mind-wandering <xref rid="pone.0070074-Mason1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, and mental explorations and simulations <xref rid="pone.0070074-Buckner1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>To our best knowledge, this is the first study that shows effects of THC administration on task-induced deactivations. In line with our finding of a lower degree of deactivation in the posterior cingulate cortex after THC administration, a recent resting state fMRI study showed that THC decreased functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and a network of brain regions collectively referred to as the left dorsal visual stream, which is thought to be involved in attentional processes <xref rid="pone.0070074-Klumpers1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, subjective ratings of &#x02018;feeling high&#x02019; and &#x02018;external perception&#x02019; were increased, whereas those of &#x02018;alertness&#x02019;, &#x02018;contentedness&#x02019; and &#x02018;calmness&#x02019; were reduced after THC administration. Similar behavioral effects of THC on feeling high, external perception and alertness have previously been described <xref rid="pone.0070074-Zuurman2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Decreases in contentedness and calmness may be related to THC administration in an MRI environment, as they were not shown in a previous study using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) <xref rid="pone.0070074-Bossong3" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>THC-induced effects on DMN activity suggest eCB involvement in regulation of default mode activity. A potential neurobiological explanation may be found in the &#x02018;on-demand&#x02019; modulating role of the eCB system in neurotransmitter release. This eCB-mediated regulation of synaptic transmission is a widespread phenomenon in the brain, and is thought to play an important role in higher cognitive functions <xref rid="pone.0070074-Heifets1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. THC administration may disrupt this function of the eCB system <xref rid="pone.0070074-Mato1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Recently, it has been shown that negative BOLD responses are tightly coupled to reductions in neuronal activity <xref rid="pone.0070074-Shmuel1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, most likely mediated by increased GABA transmission in the DMN <xref rid="pone.0070074-Northoff1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Importantly, increasing cognitive load was associated with more DMN deactivation and higher GABA concentrations <xref rid="pone.0070074-Northoff1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. This suggests that THC administration may affect DMN activity through disruption of eCB-mediated GABA neurotransmission.</p><p>Our results may have implications for understanding impairments in executive function related to psychiatric and neurological disorders. For example, several studies have shown that schizophrenia patients exhibit an inability to deactivate the DMN during various cognitive tasks <xref rid="pone.0070074-PomarolClotet1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070074-WhitfieldGabrieli2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Impairment in capacity to reduce DMN activity has also been identified in other patient groups <xref rid="pone.0070074-Broyd1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0070074-Sutherland1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, such as youth with ADHD <xref rid="pone.0070074-Fassbender1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070074-Peterson1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and patients with Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease <xref rid="pone.0070074-Lustig1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Our results suggest that the eCB system may be a factor in the abnormal DMN activity associated with aforementioned disorders, and, as such, could be involved in cognitive deficits in these disorders.</p><p>The current study demonstrated an extensive set of regions that was positively activated by the task. Previous imaging studies using executive function paradigms have shown activation of a similar network <xref rid="pone.0070074-Adler1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070074-Strakowski1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, also referred to as the Central Executive System (CES) <xref rid="pone.0070074-DEsposito1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, which has been associated with several functions necessary for successful executive function, such as the detection and selection of sensory stimuli <xref rid="pone.0070074-Corbetta1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, the subsequent linking of stimuli to appropriate motor responses <xref rid="pone.0070074-Rushworth1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, and the ability to detect erroneous responses <xref rid="pone.0070074-Klein1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070074-Ridderinkhof1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Consistent with this latter CES function, THC-induced impairment of task performance as shown in the present study is expected to result in increased effort to maintain good performance levels, most likely reflected as elevated CES activity. However, THC did not affect CES activity during performance of the task. This suggests that under influence of THC, subjects may have been unaware of their impaired performance, thereby dismissing the need for elevated CES activity. Consistently, chronic cannabis users, who showed good task performance, demonstrated diminished capacity for error monitoring which was associated with reduced CES activity <xref rid="pone.0070074-Hester1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>.</p><p>Previous studies have reported reduced activity in the CES in psychiatric disorders such as ADHD <xref rid="pone.0070074-Stevens1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070074-Tamm1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref> and schizophrenia <xref rid="pone.0070074-SalgadoPineda1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070074-Gur1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, an effect that is likely related to impaired task performance <xref rid="pone.0070074-Gur1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. One explanation for the apparent discrepancy with the current findings could be that performance deficits as shown in our study after THC are moderate compared to those of psychiatric patients. For example, decreased CES activity in schizophrenia patients in the study of Salgado-Pineda et al. <xref rid="pone.0070074-SalgadoPineda1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref> was associated with a 33% reduction in the mean percentage of correctly identified targets. This view is further supported by studies in which CES activity of schizophrenia patients was not reduced during adequate performance of moderately difficult central executive tasks <xref rid="pone.0070074-Ramsey1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070074-Jansma2" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>.</p><p>DMN-related brain activity has been shown to be affected by human genetic variation, such as functional polymorphisms in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene. Higher COMT activity, resulting in reduced prefrontal dopamine neurotransmission, has been associated with significantly greater deactivation of the posterior cingulate cortex of healthy volunteers <xref rid="pone.0070074-Stokes1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref> and reduced deactivation in the medial prefrontal cortex of both healthy subjects and schizophrenia patients <xref rid="pone.0070074-PomarolClotet2" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref> during performance of executive function tasks. A recent multimodal neuroimaging study demonstrated that genetic variation in the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) gene modulates connectivity strength within the DMN during a working memory task, which was associated with striatal dopamine transporter availability as measured with Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) <xref rid="pone.0070074-Sambataro1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. Interestingly, individuals with increased COMT activity appear to have stronger responses to THC administration in terms of acute psychotic effects and cognitive impairments <xref rid="pone.0070074-Henquet1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. Altogether, these findings suggest the possibility that the effect of THC on DMN activity as shown in the present study may depend on individual genetic profiles, particularly of genes involved in dopamine neurotransmission.</p><p>An increasing number of imaging studies use a pharmacological challenge to study effects on cognition. For instance, the norepinephrine/dopamine transporter inhibitor modafinil reduced DMN activity during a simple visuomotor task. The modafinil effect in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex was significantly correlated with reaction time <xref rid="pone.0070074-Minzenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. Treatment with methylphenidate normalized DMN activity in off-methylphenidate ADHD patients who showed attenuated DMN activity during low incentive conditions <xref rid="pone.0070074-Liddle1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. In addition, nicotine administration decreased DMN activity at rest in non-smokers <xref rid="pone.0070074-Tanabe1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>, improved cognitive withdrawal symptoms of abstinent smokers through modulation of functional connectivity within the DMN and of inverse coupling between default mode and central executive brain networks <xref rid="pone.0070074-Cole1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>, and enhanced visuospatial attention by deactivating DMN nodes including posterior cingulate cortex and angular gyrus in minimally deprived smokers <xref rid="pone.0070074-Hahn1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. These studies provide converging evidence for an important role of DMN in cognitive performance.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, our experimental paradigm focused on one aspect of executive function, namely processing of continuously updated information. Current results cannot be generalized over other aspects of executive function, such as dual task execution, inhibition, and selective attention. Second, although subjects were instructed to watch all stimuli that were presented in the control task of our experimental paradigm, this cannot be ensured as this task did not require a button press. As a result, not only regions involved in executive function, but also areas subserving motor and visual responses may be included in the network of regions that were positively activated by the task. It is unlikely, however, that this has affected our results as individual regions included in this network did not show significant effects of THC administration. Third, inclusion of incidental cannabis users, as opposed to non-users, may affect interpretation of results as previous cannabis use may influence the eCB system. However, this seems less plausible as neither brain activity nor behavioral effects were significantly correlated with reported cannabis use (data not shown). Fourth, inclusion of both tobacco users and non-users may affect interpretation of results as tobacco use may influence DMN activity <xref rid="pone.0070074-Hahn1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. However, this is unlikely as there was no significant difference in the effect of THC on DMN activity between tobacco users and non-users, with both groups showing a similar direction of the effect. In addition, tobacco users did not show a significant correlation between the number of cigarettes used per week and the effect of THC on DMN activity (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0070074.s004">Results S1</xref>). Fifth, the performance of ROI analyses implies that we could have missed effects of THC administration in non-task-specific areas or THC-induced shifts in activity within ROIs. Finally, non-specific THC-induced changes on cerebral blood flow may have confounded our results <xref rid="pone.0070074-Iannetti1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. However, the correlation between DMN activity and performance after THC administration indicates that effects are specifically related to task execution.</p><p>In conclusion, this study shows that THC administration results in less deactivation in the DMN during an executive function task, an effect that is correlated with task performance. These results suggest an important role for the eCB system in both DMN modulation and executive function. The association of the eCB system with DMN modulation may be relevant for psychiatric disorders associated with executive function deficits, such as schizophrenia and ADHD, as well as for neurological disorders such as Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0070074.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
