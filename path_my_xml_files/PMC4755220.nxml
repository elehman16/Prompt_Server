Since nasal continuous PAP (n-CPAP) established its roots as an interventional approach to treat RDS, there have always been concerns related to the increased work of breathing in newborns treated with this intervention. Therefore, respiratory support systems such as nasal bi-level PAP (N-BiPAP) and sigh-PAP (SiPAP) have been developed during the last decade. In this study, two respiratory support systems which, unlike n-CPAP, are categorized as cycled noninvasive ventilation, are studied.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>This study was a randomized clinical trial done on 74 newborns weighing 1500 g or less affiliated with RDS hospitalized in NICU at Al-Zahra Hospital from October 2012 to March 2014. Patients were randomly assigned to two respiratory support groups of N-BiPAP and SiPAP. Each group contained 37 newborns who were compared, according to their demographic characteristics, duration of noninvasive ventilation, the need to administer surfactant, apnea incidence, the need for mechanical ventilation, pneumothorax, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), the duration of oxygen supplement administration, and chronic lung disease (CLD).</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The average duration of noninvasive respiratory support, and the average duration of the need for oxygen supplement had no significant difference between the groups.

In 2008, 12.3% of live birth had the gestational age of &#x0003c;37 weeks.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Prematurity caused 6.27 deaths in each 1000 live births in the United States in 2007.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] In 2003, diseases related to prematurity were considered as responsible for 17% of all newborn deaths; it is estimated that half of these deaths (49%) happened among newborns weighing &#x0003c;1000 g. Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and broncho-pulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are categorized as the most prevalent challenges leading to death in this group. Despite the increasing application of corticoid-steroids before birth and surfactant replacement aiming at managing the RDS, BPD prevalence in very low birth weight (VLBW) newborns showed no significant change. According to BPD pathogenesis, although genetic issues are concerning half of the patients, other various factors such as chorioamnionitis, hyperoxia stress, pulmonary edema, nosocomial infections, and injuries induced by respiratory management are considered as influential factors.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>It was Gregory <italic>et al</italic>. (1971) who emphasized and implicated CPAP as an intervention for the newborns with RDS. Similarly, subsequent studies revealed that CPAP can effectively assist RDS management with mechanisms such as functional residual capacity (FRC) increase accompanied by PaO<sub>2</sub> level improvement, pulmonary compliance improvement, better establishment of respiratory airways, diaphragm function reinforcement, alveolar collapse prevention, and decrease of gradient oxygen pressure in the level of alveolar arterial gradient oxygen.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>At the moment, administering nasal continuous PAP (nCPAP) and surfactant administration are considered as the ground stones and the first level of clinical intervention in treatment of the newborns affiliated with RDS, especially in extremely low birth weight newborns; however, this intervention necessitates INSURE method (Intubation Surfactant Extubation) for surfactant administration.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Although nCPAP is regarded as the standard care for respiratory management in newborns affiliated with RDS, there are quite a few concerns about the side effects and the shortcomings of this system in treatment of the newborns such as an increase in development of air leak syndrome, lung over distension, decrease in compliance which results in increased work of breathing (WOB), excessive increase in intrathoracic pressure followed by a decrease in venous return, which leads to a decrease in cardiac output.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>In order to minimize the side effects of nCPAP, which is considered as a noncycled respiratory support in noninvasive ventilation, noninvasive cycled respiratory support systems have been developed during the last decade, which aim at noninvasive respiratory support with the minimum complications.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>According to terminology, as the technological characteristics of cycled noninvasive respiratory support systems differ based on their functioning basics, they include a range of interventions including:</p><p>

</p><p>In N-BiPAP and SiPAP noninvasive respiratory supports, the injector is definitely of IFD type, and the system produces two levels of PAP with flow control. The inspiratory PAP, which is referred to as IPAP, as opposed to the expiratory PAP (EPAP), which is called EPAP, can recruit alveoli, improve establishment of FRC, prevent possible alveolar atelectasis, and eventually decrease the WOB with sigh mechanism, which gives the system potential advantages over noncycled-noninvasive ventilation (cycled-NIV). In SiPAP, the pressure level change from EPAP to IPAP is controlled by a capsule trigger (Graseby capsule) placed over the abdomen; whereas in N-BiPAP, the pressure level change is based on the time-cycled system.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Considering the potential capabilities of N-BiPAP and SiPAP in administering noninvasive respiratory support in treatment of newborns RDS as compared to noncycled-NIV, we decided to include the comparison of SiPAP and N-BiPAP in the framework of a clinical trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This study is a prospective randomized clinical trial done on VLBW newborns affiliated with RDS, hospitalized at the NICU division of Al-Zahra Hospital, an affiliation of Isfahan Medical University, from September 2011 to January 2013.</p><p>Inclusion criteria included newborns with &#x0003c;1500 g birth weight with clinical signs of RDS (tachypnea, intercostal retraction, nasal flaring, granting, and the need for inspiratory oxygen fraction more than 21%).

Among the highlighted researches done based on the comparison of the subcategories of cycled-NIV, that is, SNIPPV when compared with nCPAP, we can refer to the study done by Bhandari <italic>et al</italic>. in two hospitals of the universities of Yale and San Diego, on 469 preterm infants weighing 1250 g or less who were treated with mechanical ventilation due to RDS. During the treatment, whenever the ventilator management of these newborns resulted in defined indications (FiO<sub>2</sub> &#x02264;35%, rate = 15&#x02013;25, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) &#x02264;5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, PIP &#x02264;16 cmH<sub>2</sub>O in order to maintain pH = 7.25&#x02013;7.45, PaCO<sub>2</sub> = 40&#x02013;55 mmHg, PaO<sub>2</sub> = 50&#x02013;80 mmHg), the newborns were extubated and placed randomly into two groups of SNIPPV and nCPAP noninvasive respiratory support. The ventilator management (invasive and noninvasive) was done by infant star, whose synchronize mechanism was based on Graseby capsule placement over the abdomen. In this study, which was done during 2002&#x02013;2004, after the extubation, for the newborns who were placed in the SNIPPV group (242 newborns), Inca (Infant Nasal CPAP Assembly) was placed, and respiratory support continued with the same rate as the invasive ventilation's; however, PIP was increased 2&#x02013;4 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, and PEEP was considered as equal or &#x0003c;6 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, and FiO<sub>2</sub> was adjusted in a way to maintain the oxygen saturation in the range of 85&#x02013;95%.

Compared to the nCPAP group, the incidence of the need for recurrent intubation, intraventricular hemorrhage (grades 3 and 4), and mortality showed a decrease in SiPAP group; however, the decrease was not significant.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>It seems that this study is among a few current studies which aim at comparing two noninvasive ventilation systems for the newborns affiliated with RDS. The two systems in this study are categorized as cycled-NIV. This study could not find any significant difference for any of the outcomes between the groups; although the sample size for this study was low and more studies are needed in this field, due to the complicacy of working with SiPAP system, such as using Grasby capsule, and recurrent adjustment of flow by the operator to maintain the desired pressure for EPAP and IPAP, there seems to be no advantage in establishing SiPAP system over BiPAP, at least at the present time.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn
