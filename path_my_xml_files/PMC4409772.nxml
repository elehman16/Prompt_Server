This disease is characterized by poor and worsening lung function, and is associated with immense patient and societal burdens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In recognition of this enormous negative impact, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) identified the prevention and treatment of exacerbations as leading priorities for the management of COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The GOLD 2014 treatment guidelines support the initiation of controller medications for patients with COPD symptoms and exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist combinations (ICS/LABA) are endorsed by the GOLD guidelines as a first-line maintenance therapy for COPD patients with a history of exacerbations. Currently, both budesonide/formoterol combination (BFC, 160/4.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and fluticasone/salmeterol combination (FSC, 250/50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] are indicated for maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in COPD patients in the United States (US).</p><p>As of now, no randomized clinical studies have compared the treatment effectiveness of FSC versus BFC in COPD. Limited indirect comparison from RCT is available; however, given the various definitions of outcomes as well as variability in disease severities included, comparative effectiveness remains inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. With limited comparative data available in the US, at least one structured literature review delineated the distinctive challenges associated with conducting comparative research into BFC and FSC therapies for COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. One US-based retrospective study, which evaluated sizeable matched cohorts of COPD patients for 3&#x02013;6 months, showed that BFC and FSC treatments had comparable effectiveness with respect to exacerbation rates and pneumonia events; however, BFC patients required less rescue medication during the observation period, which could be an indication that their symptoms were controlled better [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A 12-month, population based retrospective study in Canada with matched COPD cohorts reported that BFC-treated patients were associated with lower likelihood of emergency department (ED) visits, inpatient hospitalizations and anticholinergic medication use versus FSC-treated patients during the follow up period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Similarly, a study that evaluated matched cohorts queried from primary care records linked with Swedish hospital, pharmaceutical and cause of death registries, reported that long-term BFC treatment was associated with fewer exacerbations, based on healthcare utilization measures, compared with FSC therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The same Swedish study also found lower rates of pneumonia and pneumonia related death in patients treated with BFC compared to those treated with FSC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The primary objective of this study was to compare the real-world effectiveness of BFC and FSC treatments among COPD patients new to ICS/LABA combination therapy in a population of US managed care enrollees. One important goal was to help address the evidence gap of specific relevance to the US, given previous studies were mostly carried out outside of the US where ICS/LABA formulation and delivery device variations are different than in the US. This study also compared pneumonia rates for patients initiating either BFC or FSC as pneumonia is an important safety endpoint among patients receiving ICS/LABA combination therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and population</title><p>Patients initiating BFC (160/4.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) or FSC (250/50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) between 03/01/2009 and 03/31/2012 were identified in the HealthCore Integrated Research Environment (HIRE) and followed for 12&#x000a0;months in this retrospective cohort study.

No difference was observed between the two groups on the primary outcome measure, COPD exacerbation rates, which was defined by inpatient hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and antibiotic/OCS medication use paired with a COPD outpatient visit. Furthermore, the comparability of the two treatments remained consistent for all the sensitivity analyses and secondary measures as well.</p><p>Pneumonia, which is an important safety endpoint for COPD patients initiating ICS/LABA treatment, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] was observed for a similar proportion of patients in the BFC and FSC cohorts during the follow up period. A Cochrane systematic review reported that budesonide and fluticasone, by themselves or with LABA combination treatment, were associated with increased pneumonia events but were not significantly associated with mortality. The review noted that comparisons of the treatments showed no significant difference in serious pneumonia, deaths or adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, prior research has suggested a lower rate of pneumonia outcomes in those treated with BFC rather than FSC, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and a study of ICS therapies showed decreased rates of pneumonia in budesonide patients indirectly compared with those treated with fluticasone, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and similar results were reported in a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The lack of difference in our study may be due to low adherence rates when compared with the series of clinical trials, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] which showed relatively low rates of discontinuation, and the Swedish observational study by Janson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] which analyzed only patients who were currently treated with drug. There may have also been differences in disease severity between the study populations, but we did not have access to clinical measurements to appropriately categorize COPD severity. However, the method of selecting eligible patients for the current study was similar to that in the Janson study, in that the only requirement was a diagnosis code for COPD prior to initiation of therapy and there was no requirement of having a prior exacerbation or any other clinical event. Although the baseline periods are different between our study (1&#x000a0;year) and the Swedish study (2&#x000a0;years), comparable proportions of patents with a prior COPD exacerbation (77% in Janson et al. vs. 62% in our study) and a prior pneumonia diagnosis (25% vs. 23%) were observed.</p><p>While the findings of this study indicate similar effectiveness of BFC and FSC with respect to COPD measures, this is in contrast to findings from a number of earlier studies that examined these two drugs. A Canadian study that followed a smaller matched sample (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;2262) for a similar duration as our study, reported that COPD patients receiving BFC were less likely to be hospitalized or use ED services and required less anticholinergic medications than patients on FSC. The authors cautioned, however, that the observational nature of their study precluded any conclusions that medication alone was responsible for the observed effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>A study conducted with data from the Swedish national registry system (21,361 medical records) over a much longer follow-up period (11&#x000a0;years) reported lower rates across all exacerbation outcomes among patients receiving BFC relative to FSC for moderate-to-severe COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In contrast to our study, the Swedish registry study had a longer treatment duration (3.5&#x000a0;years on average) and only assessed outcomes for patients while they were on treatment. The present analysis was performed using an intent-to-treat design where outcomes may be influenced by poor adherence to treatment. Patients who remain on treatment for longer periods of time might experience different outcomes from what was observed in the present study. This could also indicate that one year of observation following treatment initiation may not be enough time to assess effectiveness between these two medications, and that relative effects between BFC and FSC manifest much later in treatment.</p><p>A study conducted by Roberts et al. in the US found that BFC and FSC had comparable effectiveness in terms of COPD exacerbation rates and pneumonia events, although the BFC patients required less rescue medication during the observation period. Similar to the current study, this study had a relatively short follow-up period, with only up to 6&#x000a0;months post treatment initiation which may not have been long enough to observe differences in COPD exacerbations and pneumonia events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>In general, the exacerbation rates found in the present study are smaller than some other studies, likely due to the fact that COPD severity is milder in this population that did not require prior exacerbations for inclusion, and did not have spirometry data to confirm diagnoses. It should also be noted that there are device differences for BFC in various countries (e.g., Turbuhaler in Sweden versus pressurized metered-dose inhaler in the US); however we do not believe that device type would be a primary reason for observed differences between the studies.</p><p>Despite differences between the findings of our study and those from earlier research, the findings of this study will be a valuable addition to this area because it drew from treatment data linked to a sizeable, commercially-insured population across the entire country facilitating access to a large number of patients with geographic diversity. The retrospective nature of the study enabled both looking backwards and forwards from a given point in time (the index date) without having to actively follow patients over time as is required in a prospective study.</p><p>More than 30% of patients in each group had a diagnosis of asthma during the pre-index period. Such patients are traditionally excluded from COPD studies, including clinical trials. By including potential asthma-COPD overlap patients in this study the findings have much greater generalizability to the COPD population.</p><p>The study used a robust study design in which patients were propensity-score matched (resulting in well balanced treatment groups across pre-index characteristics) and followed for an entire year. The Random Forest method utilized in the propensity score algorithm has been shown to be more effective in balancing treatment cohorts with less bias compared with traditional logistic regression techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Another important strength was that pneumonia diagnoses were validated via medical record abstraction, which found an 80% positive predictive value of pneumonia diagnoses in the claims data when compared with medical records.</p><sec id="Sec27"><title>Limitations</title><p>The results of this study must be viewed against several limitations, although none are expected to have differentially affected the treatment groups. The results are only generalizable to a commercially insured US population, and are based on data which are primarily collected for billing and reimbursement purpose, and may be subject to potential coding errors and inconsistencies. This study was conducted within a real-world setting and patients were not required to continuously take the index medication during follow-up. Individuals filled their index medication an average of approximately 4 times, which resulted in them having medication for 33%-34% of the follow-up period on average, thus this study compares patients initiating BFC therapy versus FSC therapy, but not necessarily patients who were actively taking medication. In fact, 34% of BFC patients and 33% of FSC patients only had a single fill of the index medication. Because of this, and because patients were taking other respiratory medications during the follow-up period (for example more than 30% of patients were also taking LAMA therapy), we cannot attribute outcomes solely to the initiated ICS/LABA therapy.</p><p>There was a lack of detailed clinical information, including smoking status and pulmonary function assessment, to adjust for COPD disease severity and activity because such information is absent from the primary data source, administrative claims. However, the study matched on prior COPD exacerbations which are the best predictor of future exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The follow-up time in this study might have been insufficient to evaluate a less frequent event (i.e., pneumonia). Exacerbation rates could be underestimated as we did not capture events through OCS or antibiotic prescription dispensing via telephone (in the absence of an office visit) and most inpatient administered medications are not present in the claims data. Off-label use of the study medications (e.g., FSC 500/50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) was not captured, and there might be an ICS dose relationship to the increased risk of pneumonia which could not be examined here. Lastly, this was a non-randomized study, which may detect associations but causation cannot be inferred.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>No differences were found between patients initiating BFC or FSC in a real-world setting, in terms of rates of exacerbations, measured by COPD-related inpatient hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and outpatient visits with antibiotic/OCS medication use.

Pneumonia rates during the first year of initiating the therapy were also similar between the two groups, with similar rates of healthcare resource utilization and respiratory medication use.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BFC</term><def><p>Budesonide/formoterol combination</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COPD</term><def><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ED</term><def><p>Emergency department</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FSC</term><def><p>Fluticasone/salmeterol combination</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GOLD</term><def><p>Global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIPAA</term><def><p>Health insurance portability and accountability act</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIRE</term><def><p>HealthCore integrated research environment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IRB</term><def><p>Investigational review board</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICD-9-CM</term><def><p>International classification of diseases, clinical modification, 9th revision</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICS</term><def><p>Inhaled corticosteroid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LABA</term><def><p>Long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LAMA</term><def><p>Long-acting muscarinic antagonist</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LTRA</term><def><p>Leukotriene receptor antagonist</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OCS</term><def><p>Oral corticosteroid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PDC</term><def><p>Proportion of days covered</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SABA</term><def><p>Short acting &#x003b2;2-agonist</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAMA</term><def><p>Short-acting muscarinic antagonist</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>DMK, OT, and BW are employees of HealthCore Inc., which received funding from AstraZeneca for their work.
