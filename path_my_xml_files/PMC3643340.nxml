The medicines currently used in the management of chronic stable angina pectoris (CSAP) are mainly &#x003b2; blockers, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and nitrates.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] However, these have some side-effects like negative inotropic effect with &#x003b2; blockers and hypotensive effect with CCBs, which could have serious consequences and jeopardize the management of IHD.</p><p>New medicines in the management of coronary artery disease (CAD) include metabolic modulator ranolazine (RAN) and sinus node inhibitor ivabradine (IVA). The antianginal action of RAN is due to blockade of the &#x003b2; oxidation of fatty acids and shifting the heart's metabolism to produce more energy as ATP from glucose. Because glucose needs less oxygen to generate the same amount of energy as fatty acids, this can be advantageous in the presence of IHD.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] IVA is a specific heart rate (HR) decreasing agent acting on the sino-atrial node by selectively inhibiting the pacemaker I<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> current in a dose-dependent manner and reducing HR at rest as well as during exercise with minimal effect on myocardial contractility, blood pressure (BP) and intra-cardiac conduction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Our literature search did not reveal any trials comparing the tolerability and clinical efficacy of RAN and IVA. Hence, this trial was planned to compare the efficacy and tolerability of the two agents in CSAP patients. Additionally, cost-effectiveness of the two medicines was also studied.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This was a follow-on, open-label, non crossover trial conducted from May 2010 to July 2010 in a tertiary care hospital of Uttarakhand, with permission from the institutional ethics committee, as a project under short-term studentship (STS) from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Patients of either gender, &#x0003e;18 years and &#x0003c; 60 years of age, diagnosed to be suffering from CSAP, attending the cardiology outpatient department of the hospital, taking IVA or RAN for at least 1 month prior to the enrolment in the trial, were approached and requested to participate in the trial. Those who showed interest in joining and fulfilled the inclusion criteria were supplied with a detailed information sheet and briefed about the possible ADRs with the trial medicines in vernacular language and all their questions concerning the trial were answered. Patients with BP &#x0003e; 170/100 mm, systolic BP &#x0003c; 100 mm, history of chronic diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, renal or hepatic impairment, pregnancy, lactation, past history of myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular event, severe bradycardia, moderate to severe heart failure, severe hypotension, second- to third-degree heart block, arrhythmias or anemia (Hb &#x0003c; 7 g/dL) were excluded. From those who agreed to participate, informed, witnessed and written consent was taken. One hundred and twelve patients were assessed for eligibility, 45 were excluded, six refused to participate and one was lost to follow-up in the IVA group [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. After seeking review and permission from the attending cardiologist, the 30 patients who were started on IVA 5 mg twice daily (M/s Lupin Laboratories Ltd., Mumbai, India) and an equal number taking RAN 500 mg (M/s Cipla Ltd., Mumbai, India) twice daily were included. Trial medicines of the same batch and date of manufacture from the same manufacturer were procured from the local market and supplied free of cost to the participants during the trial period. Patients were monitored on a weekly basis along with ECG recordings.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Consort flow chart of the efficacy and tolerability of Ivabradine and Ranolazine in patients of chronic stable angina pectoris</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPP-4-33-g001"/></fig><p>Dosage of the trial medicines was based on previous studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Along with the trial medicines, patients were allowed to continue with other antiplatelet, statin, antihypertensive and antianginal therapy on which they were already stabilized. Patients taking CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors, diltiazem, verapamil, medicines that prolong QT interval (quinidine, disopyramide, sotalol, amiodarone), rifampicin, barbiturates, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants, antipsycotics, mefloquine, &#x003b2; blockers, digoxin, simvastatin, paroxetine and cyclosporine were excluded due to known drug interactions with the trial medicines. The antianginal efficacy of the trial medicines (primary outcome) and their ADR profile (secondary outcome) was assessed through a pretested questionnaire in both the groups at baseline and after 2, 4 and 8 weeks of intervention. Patient data was collected by a student investigator who was trained by the supervisor. The questions were related to the frequency of anginal attacks, frequency and duration of ADRs after taking the medicine and treatment taken for the ADRs. Medicine expenditure per month was also calculated. BP, HR, routine hematological (Hb%, serum electrolytes) and biochemical evaluations (LFTs, RFTs, RBS) were done pre- and post intervention. Chi-square test was used to analyze the difference in the frequency of ADRs. Comparison of the frequency of anginal attacks was analyzed using the unpaired &#x0201c;<italic>t</italic>&#x0201d; test. The pre&#x02013;post comparison of the trial medicines was tested for significance by the paired &#x0201c;<italic>t</italic>&#x0201d; test, with level of significance being &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Demographic profile and clinical characteristics</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> compares the demographic profile and clinical characteristics of the patients in the two groups.

In the IVA group, the most common ADR was dizziness in 30% of the patients at 2, 4 and 8 weeks of trial [other ADRs have been listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. There were occasional reports of hypersensitivity rash (6.6%), fever (3.3%) and nausea (3.3%) throughout the trial period in the IVA group [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>].

Our results show that both IVA and RAN are effective antianginal agents and have a statistically significant effect on reduction of the frequency of anginal attacks (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). However, RAN was better tolerated than IVA. Both the drugs were equifficacious at 2 months of trial period as there was no statistically significant difference in the decrease in the frequency of anginal attacks. Two of 30 patients from the IVA group complained of one anginal attack per week, but there was no such complaint in the RAN group. Statistically, there was no significant difference in the laboratory investigations performed at baseline and after 8 weeks of intervention, indicating the safety of both medicines. Contradictory to our findings, there is a report of raised uric acid levels, serum creatinine and eosinophils with IVA.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Hemodynamic parameters were stable with RAN treatment. There was no significant change in systolic and diastolic BP and HR in the RAN group, indicating that 500 mg of RAN twice daily does not alter the hemodynamic parameters. Our results are in agreement with the findings of others, where use of RAN as an anti- ischemic did not affect HR, BP or inotropic state.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] IVA significantly reduced the HR, which is in agreement with the report that HR at rest and during peak exercise, during the exercise tolerance test, was significantly decreased when compared with placebo (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in patients randomly assigned to receive 2.5, 5 or 10 mg twice-daily doses of IVA for 2 weeks in a placebo-controlled double-blind trial.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>We found RAN to be superior to IVA in its ADR profile. The number of patients who reported ADRs was significantly higher (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in the IVA (21/30) group as compared with the RAN (10/30) group. The most frequent ADRs reported by the patients of the RAN group was nausea, whereas dizziness was the most frequent ADR reported by the patients of the IVA group. Although more patients from the IVA group complained of dizziness, it had no statistical significance when the two groups were compared or when the baseline values were compared with post-intervention [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>], indicating that patients may be having dizziness at the start of treatment as dizziness and imbalance are common problems in elderly patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Nausea (26.6%) was the only ADR that was significantly higher in the RAN group as compared with the IVA group. Whether nausea by RAN was due to CTZ stimulation, vestibular disturbance or GIT dysfunction needs investigation. Others have reported dizziness, nausea, asthenia and constipation as being the frequent ADRs with RAN.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Yet another trial has reported that there was no significant safety concern with RAN, which reiterates our understanding that RAN is safer for use.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] 16.6% of the patients in the IVA group and none from the RAN group reported headache after 8 weeks. Headache may have been due to blurred vision, phosphenes, inflammatory mediators, dizziness, bradycardia and postural hypotension. As IVA does not cross the blood&#x02013;brain barrier, headache could not have occurred due to direct action of IVA on the brain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] The reasoning is hypothetical and needs further investigation. Phosphenes are luminous phenomena, described as a transient enhanced brightness in a limited area of the visual field. It has been hypothesized that IVA interacts with the visual system by inhibiting hyperpolarization-activated current in retinal cells (I<sub>h</sub>).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Thirteen percent of the patients from our trial complained of blurred vision. Others have reported that IVA can interact with the retinal current I<sub>h</sub> , which participates in the temporal resolution of the visual system, by curtailing the retinal response to bright light. However, these ADRs do not affect the patient's ability to carry out normal activities.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Patients reported a constellation of symptoms like arthralgias (16.6%), muscle cramps (10%), rash (6.6%) and fever (3.3%), which could be due to a serum sickness-like reaction (SSLR), which otherwise are specific drug reactions usually reported with cefaclor, amoxicillin, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, ciprofloxacin, NSAIDs, barbiturates, carbamazepine, propranolol, thiouracil and allopurinol, not associated with circulating immune complexes. Laboratory abnormalities include normal or mild decreases in serum C3, C4 and CH50 levels and mild proteinuria. In contrast to true serum sickness, renal and hepatic involvement is rare.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] In our trial, whether these symptoms were due to SSLR or due to other reasons needs investigation.</p><p>Drug detail summary of IVA (<italic>PROCORALAN</italic>; Servier Laboratories Ltd., Suresens, France) mentions that vertigo and muscle cramps are its uncommon side-effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Contrary to SSLR, fever was not commonly reported in our trial, and most patients were normothermic in both the groups, with one patient in the IVA group complaining of fever at 4 and 8 weeks of trial. A case report on amoxicillin indicated absence of fever in SSLR; therefore, IVA could have caused SSLR without hyperthermia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] The adverse event of SSLR with IVA needs causality establishment as the genetic makeup of Indians is different from that of the other continents, with most studies being from other countries. It could be possible that IVA may not be suited for the Indian population. As the number of patients in our trial was less, extrapolation of our data needs a larger sample size to confirm and validate our findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Both antianginal agents appeared equiactive. RAN had a better safety and tolerability profile than IVA. RAN was more cost-effective than IVA. Nausea was the main ADR associated with RAN.
