It is converted into lipid mediators that exert various physiological actions. ARA is synthesized in the body from dietary linoleic acid (LA) and additionally most adults consume 50-250 mg/day of ARA from foodstuffs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The consumption of ARA in breast milk is very important for infant development since the activity from LA conversion to ARA is low in infant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The conversion of LA to ARA declines with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and the importance of ARA supplementation among the elderly has recently gained increased attention. It has been reported that supplementation with ARA among the elderly improves cognitive response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and coronary flow velocity reserve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and some animal studies support these findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>However, many studies show that lipid mediators derived from ARA are associated with various diseases. For example, thromboxane A<sub>2 </sub>(TXA<sub>2</sub>) is associated with cardiovascular diseases via its activation of thrombogenicity and vasoconstriction, whereas prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>(PGE<sub>2</sub>) leads to inflammation and might enhance tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Levels of the urinary TXA<sub>2 </sub>metabolite, 11-dehydro TXB<sub>2</sub>, have been shown to be higher in patients with heart failure (3.4-fold), ischemic heart disease (1.4-fold) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and essential hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Plasma PGE<sub>2 </sub>levels are also high in patients with ulcerative colitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and advanced periodontitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and levels of its urinary metabolite, tetranor-PGEM, are epidemiologically higher in colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The relationship between lipids mediators and diseases is speculated based on the fact that cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors are effective against these conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Many clinical trials of ARA supplementation have been done on infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], but there are a few reports describe the administration of ARA or ARA-containing oil to adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Among healthy males who consumed 1.5 g/day of ARA (as free ARA) for 50 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] or 838 mg/day of ARA for 4 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] in randomized controlled studies, platelet aggregation did not change and adverse effects did not occur. Both urinary 11-dehydro TXB<sub>2 </sub>and 2,3-dinor-6-keto PGF<sub>1&#x003b1; </sub>slightly increased in the former study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, it remains unclear whether ARA intake evokes the clinical parameters in the speculated diseases in the elderly. It is also unclear whether ARA intake increases lipid mediators derived from ARA in the elderly.</p><p>The present study investigates the effects of 240 or 720 mg/day of ARA, which is much more than that derived from food, on Japanese healthy elderly individuals. We determined clinical parameters of cardiovascular, inflammatory, and allergic diseases in blood as well as ARA content in plasma phospholipids and urinary and plasma lipid mediators. Correlations between ARA content in plasma phospholipids and lipid mediator concentrations were also determined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled parallel group intervention trial evaluated the effects of daily ARA supplementation on cardiovascular disease and/or inflammation. The Ethics Committee on Human Experimentation of Suntory Holdings Ltd. approved the study, which conformed to the principles set forth in the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from the participants of this study. Physiological parameters and blood and urine were sampled at the time of recruitment starting in August 2010. One hundred and eighteen participants were screened and randomly assigned to placebo, low-ARA or high-ARA groups. Participants received 10 gelatin-capsules containing either ARA or a placebo every morning for 4 weeks followed by a 4-week washout period. Blood and urine were sampled, a study diary was distributed and collected and dietary intake was assessed at baseline (week 0, within 4 weeks of recruitment) and again at 2, 4 and 8 weeks later. The fatty acid composition of the oils used in this study is shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. The placebo group consumed 1700 mg/day of commercially available olive oil. The high-ARA group consumed 1700 mg/day of an ARA-enriched edible oil derived from <italic>Mortierella alpina </italic>(SUNTGA40S; 720 mg/day of ARA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The low-ARA group received 570 mg/day of ARA-enriched oil and 1130 mg/day of olive oil (240 mg/day of ARA). Blood and urine samples were obtained after an overnight fast for &#x0003e; 10 hours on the morning of each assessment. Cardiovascular risk parameters included prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), antithrombin III (ATIII), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and adiponectin. Allergic parameters included nonspecific immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels and eosinophils (EO). Inflammatory parameters comprised C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) levels. Urinalysis was conducted for quantitative analysis of creatinine (Cre) and qualitative analyses of protein, glucose and urobilinogen.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Fatty acid composition of test capsules</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td colspan="4"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Fatty acids<sup>1</sup></bold></td><td align="center" colspan="3"><bold>Group</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>(%)</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Placebo</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Low-ARA</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>High-ARA</bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">14:0</td><td align="left">0.0</td><td align="left">0.2</td><td align="left">0.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left">15:0</td><td align="left">0.0</td><td align="left">0.0</td><td align="left">0.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left">16:0</td><td align="left">12.2</td><td align="left">11.9</td><td align="left">11.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left">16:1</td><td align="left">1.2</td><td align="left">0.8</td><td align="left">0.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left">17:0</td><td align="left">0.0</td><td align="left">0.1</td><td align="left">0.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left">18:0</td><td align="left">2.8</td><td align="left">4.5</td><td align="left">8.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">18:1</td><td align="left">72.3</td><td align="left">50.3</td><td align="left">6.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left">18:2n-6</td><td align="left">9.6</td><td align="left">9.4</td><td align="left">8.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left">18:3n-6</td><td align="left">0.0</td><td align="left">0.9</td><td align="left">2.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left">18:3n-3</td><td align="left">0.7</td><td align="left">0.6</td><td align="left">0.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left">20:0</td><td align="left">0.4</td><td align="left">0.6</td><td align="left">0.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left">20:1</td><td align="left">0.3</td><td align="left">0.3</td><td align="left">0.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left">20:2n-6</td><td align="left">0.0</td><td align="left">0.2</td><td align="left">0.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left">20:3n-6</td><td align="left">0.0</td><td align="left">1.4</td><td align="left">4.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left">20:4n-6</td><td align="left">0.0</td><td align="left">14.2</td><td align="left">42.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left">22:0</td><td align="left">0.1</td><td align="left">1.2</td><td align="left">3.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left">22:4n-6</td><td align="left">0.0</td><td align="left">0.2</td><td align="left">0.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left">24:0</td><td align="left">0.0</td><td align="left">2.6</td><td align="left">7.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Others</td><td align="left">0.4</td><td align="left">0.6</td><td align="left">1.2</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>1</sup>14:0, myristic acid; 15:0, pentadecanoic acid; 16:0; palmitic acid; 16:1, palmitoleic acid; 17:0, heptadecanoic acid; 18:0, stearic acid; 18:1, oleic acid; 18:2n-6, linoleic acid; 18:3n-6, &#x003b3;-linolenic acid; 18:3n-3, &#x003b1;-linolenic acid; 20:0, eicosanoic acid; 20:1, eicosenic acid; 20:2n-6, eicosadienoic acid; 20:3n-6, dihomo-&#x003b3;-linolenic acid; 20:4n-6, arachidonic acid; 22:0, behenic acid; 22:4n-6, docosatetraenoic acid; and 24:0, lignoceric acid.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Healthy men and women aged 55-70 years living in Tokyo and its environs were recruited.

Participants were randomly assigned to the three groups matched by gender, age, hs-CRP, PT and estimated ARA content (%) in plasma phospholipids. To quickly estimate the ARA content in plasma phospholipids at the recruitment, the estimated ARA content was calculated from triglycerides (TG, mg/dL), phospholipids (PL, mg/dL) and the ARA content in total plasma fatty acids as: (ARA content in total plasma fatty acids)&#x000d7;(TG + PL)/PL. This rough estimation is based on the fact that the ARA content is much smaller in plasma TG than in plasma PL (the ARA in plasma TG is negligibly-small for the rough estimation), and used only for quick assignment to the three groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Chemicals and apparatus</title><p>We purchased 11-dehydro TXB<sub>2</sub>, 9,15-dioxo-11&#x003b1;-hydroxy-13,14-dihydro-2,3,4,5-tetranor-prostan-1,20-dioic acid (tetranor-PGEM), lipoxin A<sub>4 </sub>(LXA<sub>4</sub>), 11-dehydro TXB<sub>2</sub>-d4, 9,15-dioxo-11&#x003b1;-hydroxy-2,3,4,5-tetranor-prostan-1,20-dioic-13,13,14,14,15,15-d6 acid (tetranor-PGEM-d6), and LXA<sub>4</sub>-d5 from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA).

In the present study, supplementation with 240 and 720 mg/day of ARA increased ARA content by 2.54% and 5.56%, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), which was consistent with these findings. These results suggest that age or gender of participants has little effect of ARA supplementation on the increase in plasma ARA content. The results also suggest that the plasma ARA content increases dose-dependently with ARA up to at least around 800 mg/day. The ARA content in plasma phospholipids increased at 2 weeks and was almost the same between at 2 weeks and 4 weeks. The elevated ARA content decreased to almost the initial level during the 4-week washout period regardless of an intake of 240 mg/day or 720 mg/day of ARA. These results were similar to findings seen during intake of 838 mg/day of ARA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The intake of ARA caused a rapid increase in plasma ARA levels but more than 2 weeks of supplementation did not result in any further increases. This is different from DHA, because the velocity of both increases and decreases in plasma DHA content seems slower when fish oil is administered and discontinued during a washout period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The changes in the other fatty acids were also characteristic since plasma DHA and EPA contents remained unchanged throughout the period. The relatively high intake of DHA+EPA (approximately 1 g/day) in the present study (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>) might also have contributed to maintaining plasma DHA and EPA levels. The plasma LA content changed in parallel with the plasma ARA content (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). A previous study also noted this phenomenon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Although ARA and DHA are considered to compete against each other, ARA intake does not reduce plasma DHA content, whereas intake of DHA and EPA reduces both plasma ARA and LA contents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The specificity of incorporation into plasma phospholipids from dietary fatty acids seems to be in the order of DHA, EPA &#x0003e; ARA &#x0003e; LA. The reason for the difference between ARA and DHA incorporation is unclear, but the specificity of some enzymes associated with acylation and/or deacylation of each fatty acid might be involved.</p><p>Platelet aggregation remains unaffected by an ARA intake of 1.5 g/day or 838 mg/day in randomized controlled studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The present study found that parameters of the coagulation system (PT, APTT and ATIII) remained unaltered and within the normal range. Parameters of chronic inflammation such as plasma hs-CRP, TNF&#x003b1; and IL-6, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease, remained unchanged, as did plasma adiponectin, which is thought to reduce the risk for cardiovascular diseases. These results suggest that ARA intake does not affect the risk for cardiovascular disease. The parameters for inflammatory diseases (CRP, TNF&#x003b1; and IL-6) and allergic diseases (IgE and eosinophil) were similarly unchanged, suggesting that ARA intake does not evoke inflammatory or allergic diseases. Furthermore, general blood biochemical and hematological parameters remained within normal ranges (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, Table S1). Thus, ARA intake appears to be safe under the conditions described here.</p><p>In this study, we measured TXA<sub>2</sub>, PGI<sub>2</sub>, PGE<sub>2 </sub>and LXA<sub>4</sub>. TXA<sub>2 </sub>causes platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction, which are considered to lead to cardiovascular disease, PGI<sub>2 </sub>competes against TXA<sub>2 </sub>and suppresses cardiovascular disease and PGE<sub>2 </sub>has various physiological roles, one of which is an inflammatory trigger in addition to possible involvement in cancer growth. LXA<sub>4 </sub>has effects opposite to PGE<sub>2</sub>, and reduces inflammation and cancer growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Considering their association with diseases, we estimated TXA<sub>2 </sub>and PGI<sub>2 </sub>production as urinary 11-dehydro TXB<sub>2 </sub>and 2,3-dinor-6-keto PGF<sub>1&#x003b1;</sub>, respectively. The reported urinary concentration of 11-dehydro TXB<sub>2 </sub>is 1.489 ng/mg Cre in patients with heart failure, 0.632 ng/mg Cre in those with ischemic heart disease, 0.44 ng/mg Cre in healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and around 0.6 ng/mg Cre in patients with essential hypertension and retinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The mean concentration of 11-dehydro TXB<sub>2 </sub>throughout the present study was &#x0003c; 0.4 ng/mg Cre, which was lower than the levels in these patients and did not significantly differ among the groups. Urinary 2,3-dinor-6-keto PGF<sub>1&#x003b1; </sub>was similarly unchanged and did not differ significantly among the groups. These results show that an increase in the ARA content of plasma phospholipids from 8% to 14% did not affect TXA<sub>2 </sub>and PGI<sub>2 </sub>contents. This is consistent with the finding that parameters for cardiovascular disease did not change. However, these findings seem to differ from those of a previous study in which both urinary 11-dehydro TXB<sub>2 </sub>and 2,3-dinor-6-keto PGF<sub>1&#x003b1; </sub>were slightly increased by intake of 1.5 g ARA/day for 50 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The larger dose and longer study duration might explain the discrepancies between that study and ours, but the actual reason for the difference remains unclear.</p><p>Several reports have described that plasma PGE<sub>2 </sub>increases in inflammatory diseases. For instance, the plasma PGE<sub>2 </sub>concentration increases to &#x0003e; 40 pg/mL in patients with ulcerative colitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and to 54.5 pg/mL in patients with advanced periodontitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] compared with about 10 pg/mL in controls. The plasma PGE<sub>2 </sub>concentration in the present study was about 10 pg/mL, which was below the values associated with inflammatory diseases. This value did not change or significantly differ throughout the study. Urinary concentrations of tetranor-PGEM, another marker of PGE<sub>2 </sub>production, are higher in patients with cancer. The reported level is 11.6 ng/mg Cre in patients with colorectal cancer and 7.0 ng/mg Cre in matched controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Another study indicated a urinary tetranor-PGEM concentration of 15.0 ng/mg Cre in patients with colorectal cancer and 7.17 ng/mg Cre in polyp-free controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The mean concentration of tetranor-PGEM in the present study was 8 ng/mg Cre in the placebo and the low-ARA group, and 14 ng/mg Cre in the high-ARA group which seems relatively higher compared with normal levels reported previously. The high level of tetranor-PGEM in the high-ARA group was due to the three participants with levels &#x0003e; 30 ng/mg Cre. The higher levels in these participants were not changed by ARA supplementation or during the washout period. Thus, tetranor-PGEM concentration was not significantly changed by ARA supplementation, indicating that ARA intake does not affect a candidate marker of colorectal cancer. Plasma LXA<sub>4 </sub>in the high-ARA groups was significantly increased after the washout period (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). It was considered to be unrelated to ARA supplementation because the increase was also observed in the placebo group. Plasma LXA<sub>4 </sub>level may be more variable compared to the other metabolites, but the details are unclear. The increase was slight and considered not to affect the state of the participants.</p><p>Next, we analyzed correlations between plasma ARA content and ARA metabolites concentrations after 4 weeks of ARA administration (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Concentrations of each ARA metabolite were distributed across a wide range, although all participants were healthy volunteers. None of the values correlated with plasma ARA content or ARA dose. Several individual values were high, but these values seemed normal for these patients, because the high levels in those participants were not changed at baseline and at 2 and 8 weeks. These results indicate that the increase in plasma ARA content from 8% to 14% does not increase the production of TXA<sub>2</sub>, PGI<sub>2</sub>, PGE<sub>2 </sub>and LXA<sub>4</sub>. The production of lipid mediators is not determined primarily by ARA content and seems to be controlled by other factors.</p><p>Diet was assessed to ensure that dietary intake of ARA and related fatty acids did not differ among the groups or as a result of the intervention. Participants consumed 170-200 mg/day of ARA from daily meals (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>), which is within the normal reported range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and values did not differ among the groups or with time. The intakes of DHA and EPA were 300-500 mg/day and 500-800 mg/day, respectively, and also did not differ among the groups. Although these values are within the common range in Japan, they are much more than those in Western countries ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]). Energy and macronutrient intake did not differ among the groups (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>), and did not seem to affect the present data.</p><p>The effects of ARA supplementation on healthy elderly were clarified here, but studies of patients with specific diseases are needed. In summary, blood parameters of cardiovascular, inflammatory and allergic diseases, as well as urinary and plasma ARA metabolites did not change in Japanese healthy elderly participants who consumed ARA-enriched oil (240 or 720 mg/day of ARA) for 4 weeks although plasma ARA levels significantly increased.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>SK, YI, NT, CH, HT, MK, HK, YS, YK and HS are employees of Suntory Wellness Ltd. or Suntory Business Expert Ltd., which is a manufacturer of foods including ARA-enriched edible oil.
