The optimum management strategies and their timing remain elusive despite extensive research. Surgery provides good short-term outcomes but has concomitant risks and costs. Physiotherapy is commonly practised for patients with LRS but its effects remain equivocal and there is a lack of consensus on the type, duration and timing of physiotherapy intervention. There is a lack of high-quality evidence into new and innovative management strategies and the timings of those strategies for LRS. This pilot trial is an essential preliminary to a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT) assessing the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of early physiotherapy intervention for patients with LRS. The study will test the protocol, the intervention, the use of outcome measures and the ability to set-up and run the trial to enable refinement of a future definitive RCT.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This is a mixed-methods study encompassing an external pilot RCT with integrated qualitative interviews with patients, clinicians and other key stakeholders. 80 patients will be recruited from primary care and randomised, after consent into 1 of 2 groups. Both groups will receive individually tailored, goal orientated physiotherapy. The usual care group will begin their physiotherapy 6&#x02005;weeks after randomisation and the intervention group at 2&#x02005;weeks after randomisation. Outcome measures will primarily be feasibility parameters including the ability to recruit and retain patients and to deliver the intervention. Data will be collected at baseline, and 6, 12 and 26&#x02005;weeks following randomisation.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study has received favourable ethical review from the East of Scotland Research Ethics Service (EoSRES) on the 20 August 2015 (15/ES/0130). Recruitment began on the 1 March 2016 and is expected to close in January 2017. Data collection is anticipated to be complete in July 2017. The study results will be made available to participants, clinicians involved in the study and the wider clinical community through publication in a peer reviewed journal and at conference presentations.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ISRCTN: 25018352, Pre-results; Clinical Trials.Gov: NCT02618278 Document version V1.1 23.9.2016.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>QUALITATIVE RESEARCH</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Research Trainees Coordinating Centre</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000659</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CDRF-2014-05-046</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This feasibility study will inform the design and conduct of a definitive randomised controlled trial of an early physiotherapy intervention for the treatment of lumbar radicular syndrome (LRS).</p></list-item><list-item><p>The intervention is a safer, cheaper alternative to surgery for patients with LRS and should be easy to adopt and deliver within current treatment pathways.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The qualitative component of the study will enable patient and stakeholder views to be taken into consideration and they will be used to inform modifications to the intervention and design of the definitive trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Recruitment in the feasibility study will be from 14 General Practitioner (G.P) practices in the north of England with diverse demographic populations.

It can be self-limiting and may last a short time with no significant sequelae or, in some individuals it can be severely painful and disabling in the long term. The reasons for the wide variations in presentation, outcome and duration in patients are not fully understood.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>LRS is perhaps better known as sciatica, although sciatica does not encompass neural dysfunction from the upper lumbar nerve roots and thus, the term LRS is preferred. LRS is defined as leg pain in an area served by one or more spinal nerve roots and can be accompanied by neurological deficit such as paraesthesia, anaesthesia and myotomal weakness.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> There are many and varied estimates of prevalence of LRS ranging from 1% to 43%.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>LRS is a major cause of disability, work loss and presentation to healthcare.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The Health Council of the Netherlands estimated a cost of 2.9 billion Guilders to the Dutch economy in 1999 (around &#x020ac;1.5 billion at September 2015 exchange rate). The costs of surgery for LRS (microdiscectomy and laminectomy) were found to add $5 billion to the overall cost of back pain and LRS in the USA in 2004.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The cost of physiotherapy for a group of patients who went on to have surgery for LRS accounted for 11% of the total preoperative costs or on average $379 per patient. The mean cost of imaging alone accounted for 31% of costs or $1067 for each patient,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> illustrating the relatively small costs of physiotherapy compared with other, non-therapeutic costs.</p><p>The management of LRS is a much debated and contentious area. Surgery for patients with LRS has been advocated, with good reported outcome.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, significant number of patients never have any substantial relief from surgery,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> with unsatisfactory outcomes in over 20% of patients at 5&#x02005;years, irrespective of the type of treatment they receive, including surgery.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Although, it is not known with any certainty how long to wait to allow spontaneous resorption of the inter vertebral disc (IVD) prolapse, it has been suggested that by 12&#x02005;weeks 75% of LRS sufferers will have symptomatically resolved.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The favourable effects of conservative treatment for LRS have been demonstrated with 90% of patients improving within 12&#x02005;weeks after onset.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> A &#x02018;wait and see&#x02019; approach is often advocated but a significant number of people suffering with LRS do not recover in the short or medium term and the optimal window for surgery can then be missed. Lewis <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> note the importance of early treatment in order to prevent chronic symptom development and the ensuing resistance to treatment and costs.</p><p>While physiotherapy for LRS has been advocated, there is a lack of consensus on the type, duration or timing of intervention.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> There are numerous physiotherapy approaches to low back pain (LBP) and LRS, none of which have significant degree of scientific rigour surrounding them.</p><p>It is known that patients prefer and have improved outcomes with early intervention physiotherapy for LBP.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;17</xref> Delayed initiation of physiotherapy for patients with LBP in primary care is associated with increased cost and increased healthcare consumption.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> These findings were echoed by Gellhorn<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> who found that patients who received physiotherapy &#x0003c;4&#x02005;weeks after onset of their LBP had lower healthcare usage (and associated costs) than those who received physiotherapy more than 3&#x02005;months after onset. Although such evidence does not directly exist for the provision of physiotherapy for patients with LRS, it may be suggested that early intervention is preferable.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>The overall aim for the study is to investigate the feasibility of undertaking a fully powered, multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of early intervention physiotherapy for patients with LRS.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Objectives</title><p>The objectives of the pilot trial fall into two categories.

Ritchie<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> outlines several factors that can influence decision making regarding the size of samples in qualitative research. Two key factors are the heterogeneity of the study population and the available resources. It is expected that in this study population there should be a degree of homogeneity, in that all of the participants are suffering with LRS. Individual characteristics such as sex, age and duration of onset will be considered in order to achieve diversity in the sample.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Recruitment and consent</title><p>Potential participants will be given a patient information sheet when they see their G.P for help with their LRS. A brief screening process will take place when the potential participant contacts the research team and consent will obtained during a face-to-face meeting, before baseline measures are collected.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Information from the baseline data set will be used to randomise the participant. Randomisation will be achieved by a web-based randomisation system with one stratification factor (Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)) with three levels based on ODI severity; &#x02018;mild &#x00026; moderate&#x02019; (&#x02264;22&#x02013;40%), &#x02018;severe&#x02019; (&#x0003e;40&#x02013;60%) and &#x02018;crippled&#x02019; (&#x0003e;60&#x02013;80%). A blinded block size will be used to minimise predictability. The participants will be informed, within one working day of their consent and randomisation of their group allocation. With a study of a complex intervention such as the one described, it is very difficult to blind either patients or clinicians to the treatment allocation, as it is obvious to clinician and patient that they are receiving an intervention at either 2&#x02005;weeks or 6&#x02005;weeks. In an effort to minimise bias, both groups of patients will receive treatment based on the same assessment and treatment framework.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>The intervention</title><p>The goal-orientated physiotherapy regimen for both groups will be tailored to the individuals' requirements.

As a feasibility study, the main analysis will be mainly descriptive and will focus on CI estimation and not formal hypothesis testing. We will report rates of consent, recruitment and follow-up by centre and by randomised group. Outcome measures will be summarised overall and by randomised group. We will use the data from this feasibility study to estimate the consent rate, attrition rate, and the variability of the continuous outcomes (eg, leg and back pain VAS, ODI, EQ-5D) in the trial population and use this information to inform the sample size calculation for the definitive RCT. Since the intervention is therapist led we shall also use the data to estimate the intra-cluster correlation (ICC). We will also include, as part of the feasibility analysis, estimation of the effect size for the 12-week VAS-pain outcome (the probable primary end point for the definitive study) with CI estimates to check that the likely effect is within a clinically relevant range (as confirmation that it is worth progressing with the full trial). This information along with the acceptability of the study design and protocol to patients, therapists and G.Ps; the safety of the intervention; patient recruitment and consent/retention rates will enable us to determine whether or not the definitive RCT is feasible, within a satisfactory timescale and cost envelope using the UK centres alone.

Changes will be made in discussion with the trial management group (TMG) and protocol amendments requiring ethical approval will be sought as appropriate. Subsequent interviews will be analysed by the researcher on an iterative basis, whereby, the ongoing analysis, along with the reflexive diary, will be used to identify new issues to explore with successive interviewees.

In doing so it is hoped that more than a sum of the parts of the quantitative and qualitative components of the research alone will be realised.</p><p>Integration of the findings of the quantitative and qualitative components, gathered throughout the study will occur at the analysis stage. A mixed-methods matrix<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> will be used for analysis of data from individual cases in terms of quantitative and qualitative findings.</p></sec><sec id="s2s"><title>Health economic analysis</title><p>An exploratory health economic analysis will be undertaken to inform a full-economic analysis for the future, full-scale trial. Patients will be asked to complete a short, self-report survey on costs that they have incurred as a direct consequence of their LRS. The factors on the analysis include time absent from work, analgesic requirements and cost, cost of any adjuncts used and costs incurred as a result of paying for care.</p></sec><sec id="s2t"><title>Trial organisation and management</title><p>The study is sponsored by STHFT in collaboration with the School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR), the UoS. The lead researcher (MR) will act as chief investigator with responsibility for project management in accordance with STHFT and UoS SOPs and will be overseen by the TMG.</p><p>A Trial Steering Committee (TSC) will be appointed and comprise of an independent chair, two patient representatives, a general practice (GP) representative, and clinicians with experience and expertise in the field of spinal disorders, including LRS. The TSC will review safety and progress of the trial and make recommendations to the TMG about study continuation.</p><p>A Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) is not required as physiotherapy is routine treatment for this patient group, the intervention changes the timing only and as such was considered low risk.</p></sec><sec id="s2u"><title>Dissemination</title><p>The results of the study will be presented initially to the patients who have taken part in the study and the participating clinicians. A report will be submitted to the funder of the study outlining the process and results. The results will be available via the study website at the host institute: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/scharr/sections/dts/ctru/polar">http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/scharr/sections/dts/ctru/polar</ext-link>. The results will be presented nationally/ internationally at conferences and through peer review, open access journals, subject to acceptance. Furthermore, the findings will be presented locally at musculoskeletal training events for physiotherapists and G.Ps. A key facts summary will be provided for the local musculoskeletal service commissioners.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>There is a lack of high-quality evidence about the optimal way to treat patients with LRS. This study is a preliminary step towards establishing if a novel physiotherapy intervention, delivered within 2&#x02005;weeks of referral from the G.P is an effective treatment for these patients. This study has been designed to assess the feasibility of a future, full-scale trial and will not investigate effectiveness of the intervention. The definitive RCT will be informed by the results of the study and will investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the intervention, with the potential for patients to have better outcomes with avoidance of surgery and long-term problems.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> MR instigated the idea for the study, developed the funding proposal and applied for funding.
