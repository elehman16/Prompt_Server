of changes in industrial and economic activities and the utilization of information and
knowledge tools, such as computers. It has been reported that excessive biomechanical
burdens due to sedentary lifestyles cause chronic muscle weakening phenomena, such as
abdominal muscle atrophy, muscle weakness, and spinal joint instability, which lead to
lumbar pain, reduction in endurance, and restrictions of flexibility and the range of motion
of joints<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lumbar stability is a
preceding element that allows people to maintain the spine properly during postural changes
and varying load conditions so that extremity movements can be performed<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Abdominal muscles that contribute to lumbar
stability include the external obliquus abdominis (Eo), the internal obliquus abdominis
(Io), and the transversus abdominis (Tra)<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, the Tra is activated earlier than other muscles when
the human body moves to control trunk balance, and the Ios on both sides are important for
lateral spinal stability and spinal flexion<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the present study is intended to implement dynamic
exercises utilizing PNF patterns for the development of the Eo, the Io, and the Tra that
play important roles in lumbar stability. Similar exercises include circuit training, Swiss
ball exercises, core stabilizing exercises, and sling exercises. Circuit training, the most
frequently used method of enhancing muscle strength, consists of arranging (circuit)
multiple exercise items or motions to continuously train many muscle groups in turn,
following the circuit in order without any rest between the items<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Swiss ball exercises have been used as a rehabilitation
tool for postural correction, deep lumbar muscle treatment, and prevention of problems. They
are reported to be capable of enhancing muscle strength, stabilizing the trunk, and
developing spinal flexibility as a core strengthening exercise tool<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Core stabilizing exercises can maximize the coordination
both between and within segments to promote the ability to have loads cross the lumbar
vertebrae and the sacral vertebrae of the human body<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, sling exercises enable sensory-motor training and have
been reported to offer proprioceptive stimulating effects due to the nature of suspension
devices so that larger effects are evident compared to general lumbar stabilizing exercises
performed on stable bearing surfaces. These exercises have been commonly reported to promote
enhanced trunk stability<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, because circuit training, Swiss ball, core stabilizing, and sling exercises
require the systematic guidance of experts and must be performed in specific places with
specialized equipment, most adults are greatly restricted in performing these exercises. On
the other hand, dynamic exercises utilizing PNF patterns can be easily repeated by patients
after they have received education by experts, and they can be performed anywhere at any
time. They can increase thickness of the abdominal muscles, which is a basic requirement for
enhancing trunk stability, and they can improve physical functions by stimulating the
proprioceptors of muscles and tendons. In addition, the exercise patterns consist of spiral
patterns: diagonal patterns that are known to be more appropriate for improving the
performance capabilities of muscles than single-plane, single-direction training
programs<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, in the present
study, the effects of dynamic exercises utilizing PNF patterns on abdominal muscle
thicknesses that are a basic requirement for the enhancement of trunk stability will be
examined in healthy adults using ultrasonic imaging.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty students from N University in South Korea participated in the present study.
Inclusion criteria were normal, healthy adults. Exclusion criteria were as follows: those
who had any structural abnormality in the spine before participating in the experiment;
those who had spinal pain, such as lumbar pain; those who were taking prescription or
illegal drugs; those who had any neurologic disease; those who drank before the experiment;
those who were overweight; and those who regularly exercised. The subjects were randomly
assigned to either a training group (TG, M=1, F=15) that would participate in dynamic
exercises or a control group (CG, M=1, F=15) that would not participate. The TG&#x02019;s mean age
was 22.4&#x000b1;1.0 (mean &#x000b1; SD) years, while the average height was 163.1&#x000b1;7.0&#x02005;cm and the mean
weight was 59.5&#x000b1;8.7&#x02005;kg. The CG&#x02019;s average age was 21.7&#x000b1;0.8&#x02005;years; the mean height was
161.5&#x000b1;5.4&#x02005;cm, and the average weight was 55.7&#x000b1;6.0&#x02005;kg. The &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was used for
sex analysis, and the independent t-test was employed to analyze ages, heights, and weights.
These analyses showed statistically insignificant (p&#x0003e;0.05) differences between the
groups, so the two groups could therefore be considered homogeneous. This study regarding
dynamic exercises utilizing the PNF patterns was approved by the university&#x02019;s Institutional
Review Board, and the subjects were safely protected during all of the processes of the
experiment. All subjects understood the purpose of this study and provided written informed
consent prior to their participation in accordance with the ethical standards of the
Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The subjects&#x02019; trunks were first stabilized through abdominal drawing-in exercises before
the exercises began, and then the subjects performed the dynamic exercises utilizing the PNF
patterns. First, the left foot was fixed at a point before the exercises began and was
maintained there during the exercises. The left lower extremity was placed in the state of
hip extension, knee extension, and ankle plantar flexion to bear the patient&#x02019;s entire weight
without shaking. Then, the right lower extremity was put into a state of hip flexion, hip
adduction, hip external rotation, knee flexion, and ankle dorsiflexion, while the left upper
extremity was put into a state of shoulder flexion, adduction, external rotation, and elbow
flexion. The right upper extremity was placed into a state of shoulder extension, shoulder
abduction, shoulder internal rotation, and elbow extension. Thereafter, when putting down
the right foot, which had been lifted, the left lower extremity was placed into a state of
hip flexion, knee flexion, and ankle dorsiflexion to lower the posture, while the right
lower extremity was put into a state of hip extension, hip abduction, hip internal rotation,
knee extension, and ankle plantar flexion so that the end of the foot ended up approximately
70&#x02013;80&#x02005;cm away both diagonally backward and rightward from the left, allowing the foot to
bear the full weight.</p><p>At this time, the right upper extremity was put into a state of shoulder flexion,
adduction, external rotation, and elbow flexion, and the left upper extremity was placed
into a state of shoulder extension, shoulder abduction, shoulder internal rotation, and
elbow extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Dynamic exercise utilizing the PNF patterns</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-1933-g001"/></fig>)<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Then, the right foot was fixed
at a point, and exercises were performed in postures opposite to the above postures. These
exercises were defined as one cycle of dynamic exercises utilizing PNF patterns. During the
exercises, the subjects were requested to make sure that their trunk maintained neutral
positions, their trunk and bearing foot did not shake, and the foot was placed on a point
diagonally backward and leftward or rightward from the weight-bearing foot, which was always
placed on one point.</p><p>To set exercise intensities appropriate for the subjects during the six-week program and to
apply the principle of graded exercise, 10 cycles of both left and right side exercises were
defined as one set for a total of 20 cycles, and two sets were performed during the first
and second weeks. Then 20 cycles of left and right side exercises, for a total of 40 cycles,
were defined as one set, and three sets were performed. Therefore, the subjects performed a
total of five sets in the first two weeks. From the third week until the sixth week, 10
cycles each of left and right side exercises for a total of 20 cycles were defined as one
set, and four sets were performed. Then 20 cycles of both left and right side exercises, for
a total of 40 cycles, were defined as one set, and four sets were performed. Therefore, a
total of eight sets were completed. The participants rested for 30 seconds every time a set
was completed. Warm-up exercises were performed for five minutes before the main exercises,
and cool-down exercises were carried out for five minutes following the main exercises. The
total exercise time per session was approximately 25&#x02013;30 minutes, and the exercises were
performed three times per week for six weeks. The CG performed no particular exercises, and
the subjects&#x02019; values were measured two times after daily living activities.</p><p>Ultrasonography (MysonoU5, Samsung Medison, Korea) was used to examine changes in the
thickness of the abdominal muscles both before and after the dynamic exercises utilizing PNF
patterns. To attain the measurements, one measurer assessed abdominal muscle thickness using
ultrasonography with 12-MHz linear probes. The measurer was blinded to which patients were
in which groups. First, the subject was instructed to lie comfortably in a supine position.
A triangle pillow was placed below the knees of the subject so that the subject could relax
his or her lower extremities. The probe was placed transversely on the top of the iliac
crest and moved toward the center of the abdomen. The screen was stopped when the Eo, Io,
and Tra were all visible, and the muscle thicknesses of the Eo, Io, and Tra were measured at
a point 25&#x02005;mm away outward from the point where the muscle fascia of the Io and that of the
Tra meet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Abdominal muscle thickness</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-1933-g002"/></fig>)<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. To get the abdominal muscles to contract with the same abdominal
muscle strength when abdominal muscle thicknesses were being measured, a pressure
biofeedback unit (Chattanooga Group, Australia) was placed below the lower back of the
subject and abdominal muscle thicknesses were measured when the pressure gauge was
maintained at 40 mmHg when the abdomen was tightened both before and after the
experiment.</p><p>The experimental results were statistically analyzed using SPSS 12.0 KO (SPSS, Chicago, IL,
USA). After the general characteristics of the subjects were determined, paired t-tests were
used to compare the changes in Eo, Io, and Tra for the pre-test and post-test in each group.
The differences between the two groups were tested using independent t-tests. The
statistical significance level, &#x003b1;, was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>According to the results of the comparisons both before and after the experiment between

patterns on the abdominal muscle thicknesses in normal adults. Similar exercises include
core muscle strengthening exercises using Swiss balls, mats, or slings. Ainscough-Potts et
al. had 30 healthy adult women perform core exercises using Swiss balls for five weeks to
improve their stability in sitting positions. Ultrasonography measurements demonstrated that
the muscle thicknesses of the Io and the Tra increased considerably<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, it has been reported that sling exercises
stimulate muscles around the lumbar-pelvic-hip area so that the core is stabilized to reduce
the angle of inclination of the pelvis due to any muscle imbalance<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Myer demonstrated that plyometric training and core
stabilizing exercises performed by female high school athletes three times per week for
seven weeks were effective for muscle power and neuromuscular control<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Brill stated that core stabilizing exercises could
strengthen the lumbar muscles and enhance stability by maintaining spinal balance based on
the Tra contraction<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Pilates is a form of exercise that strengthens the core of the body through repeated muscle
contraction along with deep breathing. It has been reported to stabilize the trunk by
increasing the activity of the Tra, the diaphragm, the multifidus, and the pelvic floor
muscles<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although these exercises
have similar effects to those of PNF pattern exercises in that they increase abdominal
muscle thickness, trunk stabilization, and postural alignment, they must be performed using
systematic programs under the guidance of experts and using specialized equipment in
appropriate places. However, dynamic exercises utilizing PNF patterns have the advantage of
being easy to repeat after practicing under the guidance of experts; students and office
workers can perform them anywhere and at anytime without the need for equipment. According
to the results of the comparison of the abdominal thickness of the experimental group both
before and after the experiment, the Eo, Io, and Tra all showed statistical
significance.</p><p>The results of the present study are considered attributable to the fact that the deep
abdominal muscles, or the core, were activated when abdominal drawing-in and diagonal and
spiral exercises of the pelvis, shoulder blades, and the upper extremities were performed
continuously while trunk stability was maintained. In particular, the abdominal drawing-in
exercises increased the muscle thickness of not only the Eo, which is a superficial muscle,
but also the Io and Tra, which are deep muscles. These results can be considered identical
to the effects on abdominal muscle thickness reported in previous papers. Therefore, the
dynamic exercises that utilize PNF patterns accompanied by abdominal drawing-in that were
performed in the present study are considered to be a good exercise method for developing
the abdominal muscles of those with insufficient trunk stability and also those who complain
about low back pain due to abdominal muscle weakening.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by Korea Nazarene University Research Grants in 2015.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Gill</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Krag</surname><given-names>MH</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>GB</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Repeatability of four clinical methods for assessment of
