While only few studies report improved planning performances after exercise, even less is known about their time course after exhaustive exercise.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> One hundred and nineteen healthy adults performed the Tower of London (ToL) task at baseline, followed by a graded exercise test (GXT). Participants were subsequently randomized into one of four groups (immediately, 30, 60, and 90 min after the GXT) to repeat the ToL. Main outcomes of the ToL were planning (number of tasks completed in the minimum number of moves), solutions (correct responses independent of the given number of moves) as well as thinking times (time between presentation of each problem and first action) for tasks with varying difficulty (four-, five,- and six-move problems). Blood lactate levels were analyzed as a potential mediator.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> No effect of exercise on planning could be detected. In contrast to complex problem conditions, median thinking times deteriorated significantly in the immediately after GXT tested group in less challenging problem conditions (four-move problems: <italic>p</italic> = 0.001, <italic>F</italic> = 5.933, df = 3; five-move problems: <italic>p</italic> = 0.005, <italic>F</italic> = 4.548, df = 3). Decreased lactate elimination rates were associated with impaired median thinking times across all groups &#x00394;MTT4-6 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001, <italic>r</italic> = &#x02212;0.309), &#x00394;MTT4 (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, <italic>r</italic> = &#x02212;0.367), and &#x00394;MTT5 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001, <italic>r</italic> = &#x02212;0.290).</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> These results suggest that planning does not improve within 90 min after exhaustive exercise. In line with previous research, revealing a negative impact of exhaustive exercise on memory and attention, our study extends this knowledge of exercise-induced alterations in cognitive functioning as thinking times as subcomponents of planning are negatively affected immediately after exercise. This is further associated with peripheral lactate levels.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>exercise</kwd><kwd>physical activity</kwd><kwd>cognition</kwd><kwd>executive function</kwd><kwd>planning</kwd><kwd>lactate</kwd><kwd>thinking times</kwd><kwd>Tower of London</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="48"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="8188"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>A vast body of literature reports positive effects on cognitive functions of both long-term exercise interventions and single bouts of exercise (Colcombe and Kramer, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Chang Y. K. et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Wang et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The knowledge of these effects has many implications, including preventive and rehabilitative exercise programs or exercise interventions in different settings such as school or military situations.</p><p>One of the most frequently investigated cognitive domains in the context of acute exercise is summarized by the umbrella term &#x0201c;executive functions.&#x0201d; It has become common practice to define executive functioning by enumerating subcomponents such as task flexibility, response inhibition, verbal fluency as well as planning (Burgess, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). In contrast to many studies investigating the impact of acute exercise on task flexibility and response inhibition (Barella et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Murray and Russoniello, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Hatta et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Alves et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), very few studies focused on planning as a subcomponent of executive functions (Chang et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2011a</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; Chang Y. et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Hung et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>Planning is defined as the ability to identify and select an appropriate sequence of behavior before its final execution and requires the cognitive representation of the starting position, the goal position, and the necessary steps to reach that goal condition (Goel, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Unterrainer and Owen, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). The Tower of London task (ToL) is a frequently used and well established assessment to measure planning as a cognitive ability in clinical and non-clinical populations (Keith Berg and Byrd, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Usually, following parameters are assessed in a ToL task: (i) planning, also known as total correct score (number of tasks completed in the minimum number of moves/number of tasks which are perfectly solved), (ii) solutions, also known as total move score (difference between actual moves and minimum number of moves/solved problems independent of the given number of moves), (iii) median thinking times, also known as total initial time (time between presentation of each problem and first action).</p><p>To our knowledge, only four studies have investigated planning and planning-associated parameters such as thinking times by using the ToL in the context of exercise (Chang et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2011a</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; Chang Y. et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Hung et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). It has been shown that both, acute bouts of aerobic and resistance exercise at moderate to vigorous intensities, increase planning immediately after cessation of the physical interventions (Chang et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2011a</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; Chang Y. et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Furthermore, Hung et al. (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) revealed that planning was increased immediately after aerobic exercise, whereas no effects were detected 30 and 60 min post-interventionally. However, thinking time was improved in the exercise group compared to the control group at the 30 and 60 min' post-measurements, indicating a potential sustainable effect of exercise on planning-dependent variables. The previously mentioned studies have two common major methodological limitations. First, they have used questionable sample size calculations and second, a non-computerized version of the ToL was applied, leading to a large investigator-dependent variability in results.</p><p>So far, no study was conducted using an exhaustive exercise stimulus. However, recent popular fitness programs, such as high intensity training, freeletics, and Cross-X often include exhaustive exercise stimuli. Since all mentioned studies reported an enhanced ToL performance after a single bout of exercise and have suggested changes in the time course of exercise-evoked influences on planning (Hung et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), we were interested in the effects of an exhaustive exercise intervention as well as in the sustainability of this potential effect.</p><p>In contrast to the distinct opinion that long-term exercise interventions and regular physical activity improve hippocampus-related cognitive functions, such as spatial memory (Rolls, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Wong-Goodrich et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Holzschneider et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Erickson et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), studies describing the effects of single bouts/acute exercises on cognition are inconsistent. Positive and negative acute effects of exercise with considerably varying effect sizes have been reported, depending on the exercise regimen (type, intensity, and duration), study population, measured time points, and the assessed cognitive domains (Coco et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Chang Y. K. et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Perciavalle et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>Exercise-evoked increased lactate levels have been hypothesized to be responsible for altered cognitive functions. Coco et al. (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) and Perciavalle et al. (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) reported that increased lactate levels, which were induced by an incremental cycling test of maximal exhaustion, were associated with an impaired performance in an attention- and working-memory task 5 min respectively immediately after cessation of exercise. Ten respectively 15 min after completion of the exercise the described effects were not detected anymore. The authors did not only examine the impact of acute exhaustive exercise on following cognitive tasks, but also analyzed the effects of an intravenous and exercise-independent application of a 2 mEq/ml lactate solution which resulted in significantly decreased attention skills. Thus, exhaustive exercise and lactate infusions provided similar results, suggesting that lactate may play a major role in mediating attentional performances or more precisely attentional worsening (Coco et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Moreover, Perciavalle et al. (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) have revealed that submaximal aerobic exercise showed a significant worsening in the participants' attentional performance. Interestingly those effects could only been demonstrated in lactate levels of at least 4 mmol/l. In another study, the authors demonstrate the concurrent rise in blood lactate levels and the number of errors in two specific neurocognitive tests as a marker for the participants' working memory abilities after exhaustive exercise. For both forms of working memory (i.e., non-spatial working memory and motor working memory) they present significant positive correlations between the number of errors and absolute blood lactate levels at the end of the exercise, indicating that lactate might mediate the cognitive impairment (Perciavalle et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>Lactate can cross the blood-brain barrier by using monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) to be further metabolized by neurons and glia cells as energy substrate (Bergersen, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Usually, glucose is at least partially metabolized to lactate by astroglia and then allocated to neurons and oligodendrocytes (B&#x000e9;langer et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Jakoby et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). It has been speculated that an exercise-induced increase in peripheral lactate could utilize that mechanism resulting in a more efficient substrate supply for neurons. Therefore, enhanced cognitive performances after a delay after cessation of exercise seem plausible. However, this concept has been discussed controversially and warrants further investigation.</p><p>Furthermore, the research of Coco et al. (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) and Perciavalle et al. (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) should be extended by the subcomponent planning. We expected to confirm previous findings of an improvement of cognitive performances following exercise. Considering the time course of this effect, our hypothesis was that exercise would not enhance cognitive performances immediately after the cessation of the GXT, but only at later time points. Moreover, we expected lactate to increase significantly due to the GXT and to potentially mediate the effects of exercise on cognition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>Prior to data collection, a power analysis was conducted to determine the particular sample size needed to detect an effect of defined size or larger with a certain probability (statistical test-power: 1-&#x003b2;) as far as this effect does exist in the population. In current research literature, sizes of positive effects of acute exercise on subsequent cognitive performances are reported up to <italic>f</italic> = 0.8 (Hung et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). A priori power analysis was conducted to determine the sample size needed to detect an interaction effect between time points and the intervention on cognitive performance of <italic>f</italic> = 0.2 with 1-&#x003b2; set at 0.95 and probability of false positive decision and committing a type I error (&#x003b1;), respectively, set at 0.05. Based on results of our recently performed, unpublished pilot studies, correlation of participants' testing scores at t<sub>0</sub> and at t<sub>1</sub> was estimated at <italic>r</italic> = 0.50. The power analysis revealed that 112 participants would be required to be distributed evenly on the four groups to achieve the desired 1-&#x003b2;.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>The study protocol is in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethics committee of the German Sport University Cologne. All test subjects gave their written consent before participating.</p><p>In order to safely reach the striven sample size and to compensate a possible drop out, 119 participants were included. Subjects were excluded from study participation if they were younger than 18 or older than 35 years of age, had a Body Mass Index (BMI) below 18 or above 30, affirmed any of the questions of the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PARQ) (Cardinal, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>) or reported any history of cardiopulmonary, metabolic, neurological or psychiatric diseases. Furthermore, exclusion criteria comprised pregnancy, acute infections, intake of any prescription medication other than oral contraceptives, consumption of illegal drugs during previous months, extensive physical training during the last 2 weeks, &#x0003c;12 h of sleep during the previous 48 h, experience with the applied cognitive tests or any limitation in the ability to exercise or to complete the cognitive testing procedures. Participants were instructed to refrain from exercise and to avoid the consumption of any caffeinated or alcoholic products during the days of their study participation. Participants stating non-compliance to these prerequisites on the day of testing would also be excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>Experimental procedures were performed between 8 and 12 o'clock in the morning. After the collection of anthropometric data (sex, age, BMI) and demographic variables (school years, occupational level; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), all individuals executed the baseline testing of the ToL-F (t<sub>0</sub>). Lactate samples and heart rate values were taken directly before and after t<sub>0</sub>. Subsequent to t<sub>0</sub> the graded exercise test (GXT) was performed. For the second ToL-F testing (t<sub>1</sub>) participants were randomized into one of four groups conducting the test immediately (&#x0003c;3 min), 30, 60, or 90 min after the GXT. During the time from GXT to post-testing, participants sit comfortably and quietly in a waiting room on their own. They were requested to do nothing besides relaxing and recovering. Any activity, including the use of a smartphone or reading, was prohibited. As some participants of an unpublished pilot study suffered from dehydration after exercising, every test subject could drink water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Lactate samples and heart rate values were assessed preGXT, postGXT, as well as prior to the cognitive assessment at t<sub>1</sub> (post-test).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table

Participants were instructed to constantly pedal at 70 revolutions per minute (RPM) beginning at 50 W. The workload was increased every 3 min by 30 W until volitional exhaustion. At the end of each stage heart rate (HR; FT1-Polar heart rate monitor and Wear Link soft-strap transmitter, Polar Electro, Finland) was captured. Moreover, 20 &#x003bc;l of capillary blood were withdrawn from the participants' earlobes to determine whole blood lactate concentration at the beginning as well as at the end of each stage (Biosen S-Line, EKF Diagnostics, Barleben, Germany). True maximal effort was assumed if participants met all three of the following criteria: venous lactic acid concentrations of more than 8 mmol/l, a failure of heart rate to increase with further increments in exercise intensity, and indications of maximal exhaustion (rating of perceived exertion &#x02265; 17). On the basis of these criteria true maximum effort was assumed for all participants. These and other spirometrical criteria have been recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) in a same or similar manner to confirm maximal effort and have been used in previous studies (Leckie et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Pescatello et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Tsai et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). As a measure of physical fitness watts per kilogram of bodyweight (W/kg) were calculated for each participant for the last completed stage of the GXT.</p></sec><sec><title>Tower of london&#x02013;freiburg version (ToL-F)</title><p>The ToL is a well-defined and knowledge-lean task with a definite solution that is commonly used to measure planning in clinical and non-clinical populations (Kaller et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). ToL consists of a board with three vertical rods, holding three differently colored balls in total. The rods are of different heights and, therefore, can hold different numbers of balls. Three balls can be accommodated at the tallest rod on the left, two balls at the rod in the middle, and one ball at the smallest rod on the right. In the computerized version of the ToL, every task, also called problem, consists of two pictures. On the picture in the upper half of the screen, different ball-rod goal configurations are presented, whereas the lower picture provides an identical wooden board set up in certain ball-rod start configurations. The minimum number of moves in that the task can be solved is presented on the left side next to the start configuration for each problem. Subjects are supposed to transform each start state to match the according goal state with as few moves as possible. Only one ball can be moved at a time, they cannot be dropped next to the rods, and only the uppermost ball on each peg is allowed to move. Furthermore, each problem must be solved within a time limit of 1 min (Hinz et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). This test controls the influence of the three most important structural problem parameters: goal hierarchy, search depth, and number of optimal paths (for explanations see Kaller et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Controlling these parameters ensures increasing difficulty with increasing minimum number of moves in a linear fashion (Kaller et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, the computerized German standard form of the Freiburger version of the ToL (ToL-F) (Kaller et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) was applied via the software platform Vienna Test-System (Schuhfried, Vienna, Austria). This application of the ToL-F consists of 27 problems (three 3-move problems and eight 4-, 5-, and 6-move problems each). Problems are presented in ascending order regarding the minimum number of moves. The 3-move problems represent a familiarization phase and were not included in the final analysis in order to prevent bias due to initial differences among participants regarding rule comprehension. Therefore, only 24 problems per participant (eight 4-, 5-, and 6-move problems) are included in the test evaluation and scores. The ToL-F testing software provides the number of problems solved within a minimum number of moves, which is widely accepted as an indicator of the participants' planning performance (Hinz et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Besides the number of problems solved within the minimum number of moves (i.e., planning), the number of correctly solved problems (i.e., solutions) as well as the median thinking times (MTT) of 4-, 5-, and 6-move problems are measured separately as well as accumulated and used for further evaluation. In general, longer thinking times are associated with enhanced planning performance since they reflect less impulsive actions (Culbertson and Zillmer, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Less challenging tasks might be more susceptible to impulsive actions. Therefore, breaking down thinking times could add valuable information about the effects of exhaustive exercise.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Empirical associations between participants' cognitive testing scores at t<sub>0</sub> and t<sub>1</sub> were calculated using the Pearson's correlation coefficient. Potential baseline differences between intervention groups in age, BMI, and fitness (W/kg) were investigated using separate one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). ANOVA assumption of homogenous variances for between-subjects factor levels was tested using the Levene's test. Potential baseline differences between groups regarding education levels were analyzed using Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test. Potential baseline differences regarding gender and current occupation were investigated using the separate Fisher's exact tests. To check success of the single bout of exercise, the effect of the intervention on HR and lactate was analyzed using separate 3 (time points) &#x000d7; 4 (groups) mixed ANOVAs (see Section Procedure). Interaction effects between within-subjects factor time point and between-subjects factor delay was further investigated breaking down time point effects into groups (simple effects analysis, SEA). Alpha error accumulation at SEA was controlled using the Bonferroni adjustment. A 2 (time points) &#x000d7; 4 (groups) analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted to determine a statistically significant difference between the four groups on the ToL performance controlling for age, school years, and fitness level. Again, interaction effects between within-subjects factor time point and between-subjects factor delay was further investigated by SEA. For all inferential statistical analyses mentioned above, the significance level was set at &#x003b1; = 0.05. To explore potential associations between lactate elimination (lactate levels prior to t<sub>1</sub>&#x02014;lactate levels postGXT) and changes in cognitive performance, Pearson's bivariate correlation coefficients were calculated and tested for significance. In order to avoid alpha-error accumulation, Bonferroni correction was used. Therefore, significance level was set at &#x003b1; = 0.0083 for correlation analysis. All descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 22&#x000ae; (IBM&#x000ae;, Armonk, NY, USA).

In summary, this study gives first hints that planning-associated variables (i.e., thinking times) change within the following 90 min after cessation of exhaustive exercise. The results reveal that median thinking times are significantly shorter immediately and 30 min after completion of the physical intervention. Interestingly, these shifts seem to diminish with increasing time. Negative correlations between the lactate elimination rate and &#x00394; median thinking times could be revealed for all groups accumulated, indicating that higher lactate turnover rates are associated with less impaired cognitive performances. However, the relatively small correlations should not be overestimated and warrant further investigation.</p><p>In view of planning, the presented results seem to be contradictory compared to those of Chang et al. (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2011b</xref>), who reported a significant increase in planning immediately after cessation of a moderate to vigorous bicycle ergometer intervention of 30 min. Hung et al. (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) stated a positive effect of a single bout of 30 min of moderate ergometer cycling (60&#x02013;70% heart rate reserve) on planning, namely improved total move scores immediately after exercise, whereas this effect was not detected after 30 and 60 min. However, improvements in correct responses are not limited to the intervention group, but also appear in the control group. This fact suggests that this variable might also be influenced by other factors and confounders. Our results are also inconsistent to those of Hung et al. (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), who conducted their last assessment 60 min after exercise. Within this time span and even 30 min later (i.e., 90-min group), no significant positive influence of the single bout of exercise on planning could be detected. We want to point out that the sample size calculation of both studies (Chang et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2011b</xref>; Hung et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) was based on large effect sizes, which were reported in a study using other cognitive domains as primary endpoints (response inhibition, cognitive flexibility). Furthermore, one study (Chang et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2011a</xref>) investigated the influence of three different resistance exercise intensities (40, 70, and 100% of the 10 repetition maximum; 10 RM) on the ToL performance compared to a control group. The results showed an increased number of correct responses and a reduction of the total move score immediately after exercise. All other parameters, such as the time-related scores and violation scores did not show any significant differences. In a similar study, Chang Y. et al. (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) analyzed the effects of two sets of resistance exercises (10 repetitions of 70% of 10-RM of seven exercises) on planning using the ToL. The exercise group showed significant improvements after exercising compared to the pre-tests and significant enhancements when comparing the post-exercise results to those of the control group.</p><p>With respect to the total initial time (synonymously titled as the median thinking time in the ToL-F), results of the presented study are partly in line with pre-existing literature. Hung et al. (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) showed that the total initiation time, as a parameter for response inhibition and the preparation of planning, was extended and thus enhanced 30 and 60 min after cessation of the exercise. It is worth noting that longer initiation times are considered as enhanced planning performances as they represent the establishment of more precise plans and indicate less impulsive actions (Culbertson and Zillmer, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Whereas, prolonged initial times are regularly interpreted as improved cognitive performances in terms of planning abilities (Unterrainer et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Asato et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Chang Y. et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), this circumstance is arguable when talking about different executive functions such as inhibition and is commonly interpreted in the exact opposite way. In this case, studies revealed that decreased thinking times do not necessarily lead to worsened inhibition control and that scores remained stable under reduction of thinking or response times (Benikos et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Hartmann et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Thus, a reduction in response times could also be interpreted as enhanced inhibitory control. As these studies generally use Go/NoGo tasks to evaluate one's cognitive performance and therefore evaluate inhibition processes instead of planning, a proper comparison to our and other studies using the Tower of London task remains limited. Therefore, it seems inappropriate to generalize our results to executive functions other than planning. However, more research is needed to elucidate the role of thinking times in the context of Tower of London tasks. In accordance with the results of Hung et al. (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), the study of Chang Y. et al. (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) reveals a significantly prolonged initial time for the exercise condition after the intervention as compared to the pre-test results and the control condition. However, another study of Chang et al. (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2011b</xref>) only revealed main effects for time and showed that all time-related variables such as the total initial time for both the exercise group and the control group together were significantly shorter in the post-test, indicating an acute deterioration. The latter corresponds with the results of the present study, as we could also demonstrate acute deteriorations in median thinking times of all problem conditions for the immediately after the GXT tested group. These effects are partly detectable in the 30-min group and seem to disappear with increasing time. Because the study of Chang et al. (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2011b</xref>) does not evaluate follow-up tests, it can only be speculated whether the effect of exercising on time-related scores would decrease similarly as described in the present study. Regarding the median thinking times in dependence of problem difficulty, our results suggest that only less challenging problems (4&#x02013;5 move problems) are temporally affected. Interestingly, changes in median thinking times for less challenging tasks were further negatively associated with lactate elimination rates.</p><p>When comparing the mentioned studies with the present one, some considerations should be kept in mind. First of all, previously performed studies used a different, non-computer- based version of the ToL (Tower of London&#x02014;Drexel edition; Culbertson and Zillmer, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Using a non-computerized test version involves several limitations. To begin with, time-related scores such as the total initial time are measured by the examiners using a stopwatch. Obviously, these measurements are much less precise as compared to computer-based records and therefore dependent on the experience of the examiner. In addition, time-related scores of the ToL-Drexel edition are totalized across all problem conditions, whereas the ToL-F gives more detailed information by calculating the median thinking times for each problem condition separately (e.g., 4-move problems) as well as accumulated for all problems together. Moreover, the ToL-Drexel edition consists of only ten problems, whereas the ToL-F examines 24 problems, what increases its accuracy. Another critical limitation for a proper comparison between the studies that assessed the impact of exercise on planning and the present study is the fact that strongly varying exercise regimes (type, duration, intensity) were conducted. In addition, one study used a counterbalanced design and did not evaluate pre- and post-exercise tests, what makes an adequate comparison of the results inappropriate (Chang et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2011a</xref>). Considering the evaluated control groups of the previously described studies, it is worth mentioning that they either watched a video on resistance exercise training (Chang et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2011a</xref>) or read exercise-related books or articles for a comparable period of time (Chang et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2011b</xref>; Chang Y. et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Hung et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that those control interventions may have led to cognitive fatigue and thereby pretend larger effects in the end.</p><p>Finally, all of the mentioned studies revealed positive effects of exercise on planning. None of them showed significantly improved performances of the control groups, who consistently performed worse as compared to the exercise groups post-interventionally. Partly, the control groups even deteriorated significantly (Chang Y. et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Of course, the presented study lacks an adequate control group and the circumstances mentioned above do not replace the missing control group or eliminate the chance of learning effects when repeating the ToL tasks, but they suggest that the changes of planning-associated time-related scores in the present study are due to the single bout of physical exercise and not to learning effects. Other aspects which should be taken into account are learning and motivational processes. However, it appears not plausible that these processes differ significantly between groups and thus cause the described alterations.</p><p>An empirical increase in planning can be observed in all groups with exception of the immediately after the GXT tested one. Therefore, one could hypothesize that the improvement in planning after a delay, which may be driven by a learning effect or exercise, is antagonized immediately after cessation of exercise. The significant worsening of the &#x0201c;immediately after&#x0201d; group in terms of median thinking times and the non-significant deterioration in planning of this group could either be explained through an exercise-induced reduction of blood flow in frontal cerebral structures (Gonz&#x000e1;lez-Alonso et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) or through lactate levels and their exercise-induced fluctuations. The potentially confounding influence of dehydration was controlled through the unrestricted consumption of water. Coco et al. (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) as well as Perciavalle et al. (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) showed an inverse correlation of blood lactate levels and cognitive test performances (attention, working memory) and therefore postulate that a decrease in cognitive functions after intensive exercise is mediated by lactate. While we have criticized small sample sizes in the ToL studies previously (e.g., Chang et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2011a</xref>; Chang Y. et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), we have to admit that those of the studies investigating lactate as a potential mediator were comparably small (Coco et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Perciavalle et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Due to differences in lactate production rates, its peripheral metabolism as well as the tissue-specific transporter capacity of individuals, these results should be viewed with caution. As described by Ide et al. (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) lactate uptake of the CNS is increased during exhausting exercise. In terms of frontal lobe functioning, elevated lactate levels seem to play a crucial, region-specific role. While some studies reported that increased lactate levels are associated with improved excitability in the primary motor cortex (Coco et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), other investigations stated contrary results for the frontal cortex as well as for brainstem and spinal cord excitability (Coco et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Regarding the lactate uptake of the CNS from a biochemical point of view, a strong increase might lead to metabolic irritations through a decrease in pH values, which is driven by the co-transport of protons by the monocarboxylate transporter MCT1 (blood-brain barrier) as well as MCT2 and MCT4 within the CNS (Bergersen, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Though, changes in lactate levels were not associated with changes of planning and solutions, but only with changes in median thinking times. Animal studies provide valuable hints that elevated lactate levels reversibly suppress neuronal firing of hippocampal cells (Gilbert et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). However, it can be speculated that this inhibiting effect of lactate and protons, resulting in cognitive impairments, converts to an ameliorated energy supply when lactate is metabolized after a delay. This theory is underlined by studies which revealed that glucose uptake by astrocytes is increased after activation, whereas those of neurons remain stable (B&#x000e9;langer et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Since astrocytes' energy supply contributes to only 5&#x02013;15% of total CNS energy expenditure, it has been hypothesized that an increased energy demand of neurons during activation is served by lactate, which was previously metabolized from glucose in astrocytes (B&#x000e9;langer et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Jakoby et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). It is well-established that astrocytic lactate can be allocated to neurons by astrocyte-neuron-lactate-shuttles (Pellerin and Magistretti, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Mosienko et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Therefore, increased lactate levels after exercise may use this mechanism, leading to an improved metabolic state after a certain delay and thus explain the impacts of exercise-induced increases of lactate on cognition. These considerations would further support findings from Chang's meta-analysis, reporting the largest effects of exercise on cognitive functions after a delay (Chang Y. K. et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>This study should be seen within the context of its strengths and limitations. Although, most detected correlations between cognitive performances and lactate alterations are just of weak to medium level, it should be kept in mind that cognitive functioning involves many physiological processes and thus it seems inappropriate to expect much higher correlations. Anyway, the results should not be overemphasized, since correlation coefficients are relatively small concerning the large sample size. Finally, we examined the impact of an exhaustive exercise bout on cognition by testing a demographically homogenous, young, and academic collective of subjects. The assignability to other populations (e.g., non-academic, untrained groups, or clinical populations) is restricted. Probably due to this homogeneity, fitness did not appear as a significant modulator in this study. Anyway, future research could include a more heterogenous study population in order to have a deeper look on the impact of participants' fitness levels on cognitive functioning. Although, the study design based on the assumption that exercise improves planning, the lack of a control group (e.g., one which participates in a stretching program) represents a major limitation and therefore time effects cannot be ruled out. Moreover, further studies might use spirometry testing to get more precise information about the participants' fitness levels and grades of exhaustion. The comparable large sample size and the use of the most objective version of the ToL indicate relatively robust results. In terms of the possible underlying mechanisms by which exercise impacts following cognitive performances, only peripheral lactate levels were measured.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In view of exercise-induced alterations in planning performances, our study does not confirm previous research. In contrast to that, this study supports previous findings of acute exhaustive exercise-induced deteriorations in cognitive functioning and extends this knowledge by planning-associated thinking times. Our findings suggest that peripheral lactate is associated with thinking times in less challenging tasks after exhaustive exercise. More research is needed to elucidate the effect of exercise on planning and lactate as a potential mediator.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Author contributions</title><p>PZ and SB contributed equally to that work.
