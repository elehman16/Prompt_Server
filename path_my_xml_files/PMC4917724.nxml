However, quitting smoking is challenging and relapse is likely [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Smokers may feel threatened by temptation to smoke if they perceive an inability to meet cessation challenges. Self-affirmation [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]&#x02014;or focusing on strengths and values&#x02014;can offset self-threats and promote healthier behaviors [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In prior research, self-affirmed smokers took more antismoking brochures and reported greater self-efficacy to quit and higher intentions to reduce smoking [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. When combined with other intervention strategies, self-affirmed undergraduates actually smoked less [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Smokers who self-affirm may be more successful at quitting, because temptation may be seen as less threatening to competence or self-control.</p><p>Self-affirmation interventions may be scalable and disseminable, as demonstrated elsewhere (eg, education [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]), and given that lasting effects emerge with minimal interventions [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Self-affirmation operates through recursive, self-perpetuating processes, by motivating individuals to capitalize on preexisting resources to facilitate change [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Implementing brief affirmations into at-scale cessation interventions may increase their effectiveness. This study assessed the feasibility of incorporating self-affirmations into an existing text messaging-based smoking cessation program and examined whether self-affirmation might facilitate greater engagement and higher cessation rates than a standard intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>Data were collected from smokers who subscribed to a free smoking cessation program, implemented by the US National Cancer Institute (Smokefree TXT; [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]), online or through text. Smokefree TXT (launched in 2009) was designed following a review of text-based cessation programs and input from cessation and mHealth experts. The library has been updated multiple times following user testing and analysis of user data. Taxonomic analysis indicates that the text program provides 35 different behavioral change techniques [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Upon enrollment, users of the program reported their mobile number, age, gender, state of residence, and smoking frequency, and were instructed to set a quit date between today and 14 days in the future. Users were informed that the program provided &#x0201c;24/7 encouragement, advice, and tips to help smokers quit smoking and stay quit.&#x0201d; As part of the standard program, users received daily text messages designed to improve self-efficacy to quit and to provide motivation. Texts were sent up to 14 days before users&#x02019; self-selected quit day and during the 42-day period following users&#x02019; self-selected quit day. Before the quit day, all users received 2-3 texts/day (with the exception of the baseline affirmation prior to enrollment, which consisted of 5 texts). For the first two weeks after quit day, users received 3-4 texts/day. From day 15 to 42, users received 1-3 texts/day. The first text of the day was sent at 9am, followed by 12pm, 3pm, and 6pm, for as many texts as were sent that day. All texts were unique and the order was standardized within each condition. Users could disenroll anytime. With the exception of the self-affirmations, no changes were made to the existing program to modify it for research use. Thus, these data represent an evaluation of incorporating self-affirmation into a readily available, already disseminated intervention.</p><p>Users who subscribed during a 6-week period in fall 2014 were automatically enrolled into one of three enhanced intervention conditions based on which day they enrolled. Enrollment into the three conditions was distributed across days of the week and throughout the duration of this 6-week period. Control data were drawn from users who subscribed during 2 weeks in September immediately prior to this 6-week period. The original design was a 2 (Baseline affirmation: 5-item kindness questionnaire present vs absent; adapted from Reed and Aspinwall [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]) &#x000d7; 2 (Integrated affirmation: texts present vs absent) factorial design testing two methods of affirmation (for a total of four conditions). Only 17 eligible users completed all <italic>baseline affirmation</italic> questions and these conditions did not influence any outcomes, so we collapsed across baseline affirmation conditions in analysis. Analytic comparisons were between standard intervention (consisting of the control condition and the baseline affirmation only condition) versus intervention enhanced with self-affirmation integrated throughout the 6-week program (consisting of the integrated affirmation only condition and the integrated plus baseline affirmation condition).</p><p>In the <italic>integrated affirmation</italic> conditions (hereafter referred to as &#x0201c;affirmations&#x0201d;), affirmations (which instructed users to focus on strengths or values when feeling threatened or anxious) replaced approximately 20% of texts delivering motivational content. On quit day and the 3 subsequent days, one text was randomly replaced each day. For all subsequent days, every 5th or 6th text was replaced to ensure that the remaining 11 affirmation texts were distributed equally (the last affirmation text was on day 38). The order of administration was constant for all users. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> contains sample texts, created by JMT, WMPK, and RF based on the self-affirmation literature [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and the motivational texts used in the control condition.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Sample affirmation and control texts.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" width="649" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" border="1"><col width="84" span="1"/><col width="275" span="1"/><col width="246" span="1"/><thead><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Day text was delivered</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Affirmation message content</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control (motivational) message content</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Quit day</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">When you feel like you might relapse, focus on your good experiences.

However, when using an intent-to-treat approach with all eligible users, self-affirmation did not improve outcomes.

Taken as a whole, these results suggest that the effect of self-affirmations within &#x0201c;low-touch&#x0201d; mHealth interventions may be most useful in specific short-term therapeutic windows. More research is necessary to determine appropriate dosing and timing of affirmation messages, and to understand the potential usefulness of self-affirmation messages on clinically relevant behaviors (eg, retention, engagement, and behavior change).</p><p>Although the potential generalizability of user data from a population-mHealth cessation program is a strength, these data also had limitations. Data were collected within an intervention, rather than controlled research protocol conditions, and thus were limited by the parameters of the clinical service. In addition, it is typical to incentivize participation in research settings, and the lack of incentives undoubtedly contributed to low response rates. Response rates may have increased if contact was made beyond that provided by the clinical service. Last, the cessation measures in the protocol were less optimal than smoking assessments of the last 7 days, and were not confirmed biologically.</p><p>We integrated an evidence-based approach (self-affirmation) into a real-world intervention delivered at the population level, providing a &#x0201c;proof-of-concept&#x0201d; that brief, low-touch interventions may be integrated into a text messaging program with potential benefits, minimal disruption, and little cost. However, many questions remain regarding how self-affirmation and similar approaches can promote engagement in population interventions.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>Conflicts of Interest: None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fraser</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Kobinsky</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>SS</given-names></name><name><surname>Kramer</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Theobald</surname><given-names>WE</given-names></name><name><surname>Baker</surname><given-names>TB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Five population-based interventions for smoking cessation: a MOST trial</article-title><source>Transl Behav Med</source><year>2014</year><month>12</month><volume>4</volume><issue>4</issue><fpage>382</fpage><lpage>90</lpage><comment><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/25584087"/></comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1007/s13142-014-0278-8</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="medline">25584087</pub-id><!--<pub-id pub-id-type="pii">278</pub-id>--><!--<pub-id pub-id-type="pmcid">PMC4286555</pub-id>--><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25584087</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Spohr</surname><given-names>SA</given-names></name><name><surname>Nandy</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Gandhiraj</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Vemulapalli</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Anne</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Walters</surname><given-names>ST</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Efficacy of SMS Text Message Interventions for Smoking Cessation: A Meta-Analysis</article-title><source>J Subst Abuse Treat</source><year>2015</year><month>9</month><volume>56</volume><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>10</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.jsat.2015.01.011</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="medline">25720333</pub-id><!--<pub-id pub-id-type="pii">S0740-5472(15)00026-4</pub-id>--><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25720333</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fiore</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Ja&#x000e9;n</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Baker</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><source>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</source><year>2008</year><month>5</month><date-in-citation>2016-05-11</date-in-citation><comment>Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence: 2008 Update
