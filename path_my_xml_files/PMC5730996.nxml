However, fluoride has been shown to improve remineralization of human enamel after acid attack and application of fluoride dentifrices have been effective in numerous clinical studies.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Common consensus from many reports worldwide, during the past decades, reveals that dental caries had declined significantly and was continuing to decline in populations. However, recent studies report alarming increases in caries, with increases mainly in children and adults, primary and permanent teeth, and include coronal and root surfaces. The emerging public health issues are related to disparities in the prevalence and treatment of dental caries.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Methods used for prevention of dental caries vary widely among countries where caries reduction was observed. Studies conducted worldwide have shown several factors to explain this reduction. The factors include changes in diet, hygiene procedures, clinical management of caries, and the widespread use of fluoride. In addition, changes in the diagnostic criteria for a carious lesion also is an important factor. Caries also declined in communities in which no other important preventive method was available, except for fluoride dentifrices, whereas countries where fluoride toothpastes are not widely used the decrease in dental caries observed was less.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Application of varnish on tooth surfaces promotes the uptake of firmly bound fluoride by enamel. Along with its incorporation into the crystalline lattice, fluoride varnishes and other concentrated topical fluorides interact with saliva and form calcium fluoride (CaF<sub>2</sub>) compounds on enamel. The formation of CaF<sub>2</sub> has been considered to be an unwanted side reaction as it dissolves easily from the enamel soon after application. Studies from the 1980s reveal that CaF<sub>2</sub> is stabilized by pellicle proteins and secondary phosphate at neutral pH. When the pH of plaque drops, CaF<sub>2</sub> begins to dissolve and release fluoride ions, thus acting as a prolonged source of fluoride after application. Today, this is considered the most important factor in caries prevention for concentrated topical fluorides, including fluoride varnishes.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>The regular use of fluoridated dentifrice may be a beneficial preventive measure, independent of the occurrence of caries. However, &#x000d6;gaard <italic>et al</italic>. suggested that, when the caries risk is high, this measure should be conducted with high concentration methods. The advantage of combining fluoridated dentifrice with professional applications has not been clearly understood, and further studies are necessary.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>The present study aimed to assess the preventive effect of 500 ppm F and 1100 ppm F fluoridated children's dentifrices and fluoride varnish <italic>in vitro</italic>, either applied in combination or alone, on primary teeth enamel after a caries challenge.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ETHODOLOGY</sc></title><p>This <italic>in vitro</italic> study was done on seventy human extracted sound primary canine teeth.

</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Procedure</title><p>One of the groups comprising sound enamel (S) was not subjected to pH cycling and had no treatment. Group S was kept in deionized water and hardness assessment was done. The negative control (N) group had no treatment but was submitted to pH cycling. The remaining five groups (VF, VF + D1, VF + D2, D1, and D2) received topical fluoride treatment. Groups VF, VF + D1, and VF + D2 were treated with the fluoridated varnish Duraphat<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (22,600 ppm F NaF and pH of 7.0) on the 5<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> days of the pH cycling. Duraphat<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was applied to the delimited area (4 mm &#x000d7; 4 mm). The teeth were then stored in the remineralizing solution for 5 h. The varnish was removed with acetone, and the teeth were washed with deionized water for 1 minute and again immersed in the remineralizing solution. The varnish application was conducted within the 21 h that the teeth were kept in the remineralizing solution. During the pH cycling, the VF + D1 and VF + D2 groups were treated with the varnish as well as fluoridated dentifrice, while the D1 and D2 groups were only treated with fluoridated dentifrice. The VF + D1 and D1 groups were treated with the dentifrice (1100 ppm F in NaF, pH of 7.0) and the VF + D2 and D2 groups were treated with Colgate (500 ppm Fin NaF, pH of 6.9). The dentifrices were applied twice daily on the enamel at 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., bimanually brushing the surface for 1 min before changing the solutions. After every brushing period, the teeth were briefly washed in deionized water. To standardize the minimum amount of dentifrice used in the experiment, the lids of the Colgate and Colgate Baby were used. These lids close under pressure, and both have similar compartments for dentifrice dosage. According to Chedid and Cury, the dentifrice quantity accumulating in the lids is 0.16 g on an average. The standardized technique is to press the brush on the top of the lid once. The penetration of the brush into the lid is limited by the depth of the lid.</p><p>The teeth were then immersed in resin and cut along the crown's longitudinal axis through the middle of the window area to assess the hardness [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. The cut surface was polished in a rotating machine using sand paper with grits of 320, 600, and 1200. The 320 grit papers were used for 30 s and the remaining two grit papers were used for 60 s each under running water. The polished surface was verified by visual inspection before using the next grit paper. For this procedure, the samples were held on top of the sand paper by hand, with minimum pressure. The final polish was conducted by felt discs and diamond paste at low speed. To remove debris, the samples were later washed and placed in a ultrasound bath for 12 min. The cross-sectional hardness measurements were made using a hardness tester with a Knoop indentor, static load of 25 g, and with 5 s of dwell time [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>]. Three rows of five indentations each, separated by 100 &#x003bc;m, were made at 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 &#x003bc;m from the outer dental surface of the exposed area. The mean hardness values (kg/mm&#x000b2;) of the three rows at each distance from the surface were then averaged and statistically analyzed within and between treatments.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Teeth immersed in resin</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPBS-9-112-g002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Universal testing instrument</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPBS-9-112-g003"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov test was used for sample distribution, and a two-way ANOVA with repeated measures for distance and a <italic>post hoc</italic> Tukey test were used to verify differences in hardness between distances and treatments of the surface.

The daily 3-h demineralization cycle is related to effects that result when the patient ingests cariogenic products without removal of biofilm. It was observed in this study that there was a general enhanced preventative effect from combining fluoridated varnish with dentifrices (VF + D1 and VF + D2) compared with other groups.</p><p>The present study shows that remineralization of enamel using 1100 ppm fluoride is more effective than using 500 ppm fluoride. However, the study conducted by Rirattanapong <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] showed that significant difference existed in the depth of enamel lesions among fluoridated dentifrice groups. This observation is in agreement with a study by Winter <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] which concluded that experimental toothpaste with fluoride at 550 ppm had a similar anticaries effect as toothpaste containing fluoride at 1055 ppm. However, Damato <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] concluded that there was a linear fluoride dose effect when individuals used dentifrices containing fluoride at 0, 250, and 1000 ppm. The differences in results may be due to the use of a different abrasive system and the type of fluoride used by Mellberg.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Our results show that fluoridated varnish alone was not effective in reducing mineral loss. The results are same with the <italic>in vitro</italic> study conducted by Grodzka <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] who found that the best preventative effect may be obtained when fluoridated varnish is used with other forms of fluoride supplements. Similarly, the present study demonstrated that lower mineral loss values were obtained in the VF + D2 and VF + D1 groups. However, other studies[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] have suggested that the combination of low fluoridated dentifrice and high fluoride concentration methods (fluoridated varnish) does not have additional benefits in remineralization and fluoride incorporation.</p><p>Fluoride incorporated into the enamel mineral during tooth development has little effect on the caries process. It is the fluoride that is incorporated posteruptive during the caries challenge that plays an important role in caries prevention.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The most effective caries-preventive fluoride regimen is provided by the daily application of topical fluoride in the form of dentifrices and mouth rinses.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>The critical pH range for demineralization and remineralization is between 4.3 and 5.0. Hypersaturation of calcium and phosphate ions causes re-precipitation of hydroxyapatite, forming an intact superficial layer on the enamel surface. Remineralization of enamel is enhanced by the presence of fluoride ions which leads to the formation of fluroapatite.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Thus, fluoride plays an important role in the remineralization process. It acts as a catalyst and influences reaction rates with dissolution and transformation of various calcium phosphate minerals. The released mineral ions are re-precipitated as fluoroapatite which is less soluble and provides additional protection onto the apatite crystals.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Independent of the distance from the surface, the VF group always showed the lowest values for hardness.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] For the most superficial layers of the enamel, such as within 20 &#x003bc;m, where the teeth initially suffer cariogenic action, a decrease in hardness was observed for all treatments compared with the control group, similar to results found in study conducted by Gatti.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>At this distance, the effect of the 500 ppm F dentifrice (D2) was significantly different from the 1100 ppm F (D1) dentifrice, which showed greater hardness. The combination of fluoride varnish with dentifrices of different ppm (500 and 1100 ppm) also did not show an advantage compared with the 1100 ppm F dentifrice (D1) used alone.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>The results of this study suggest that the combination of F-varnish with dentifrices containing 500 or 1100 ppm F is not more effective in reducing demineralization in primary teeth than the isolated effect of dentifrice containing 1100 ppm.</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shabanian</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Jabarifar</surname><given-names>SE</given-names></name><name><surname>Salavati</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Khosravi</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Tavakoli</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Akhavan</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Effect of fluoride dentifrices on the microhardness of deciduous enamel surfaces</article-title><source>Oral Health Prev Dent</source><year>2012</year><volume>10</volume><fpage>59</fpage><lpage>64</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22908089</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bagramian</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><name><surname>Garcia-Godoy</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Volpe</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The global increase in dental caries.
