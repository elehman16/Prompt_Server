<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Recent EULAR guidelines recommend clinical remission (mean disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28) of &#x0003c;2.6) or low disease activity (LDA; DAS28 &#x02264;3.2) to be the key targets of RA treatment.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Patients with RA who do not achieve clinical remission or LDA after 3&#x02013;6&#x02005;months are advised to switch or adjust treatment until this target is attained.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref> Despite these recommendations, many patients in Europe have moderate disease activity (&#x02265;3.2 DAS28 &#x02264;5.1) but remain on methotrexate (MTX), the most common first-line treatment, and do not switch to more aggressive treatment strategies.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;10</xref></p><p>Previous studies have investigated baseline variables that may be predictive of radiographic progression.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;16</xref> However, these studies have largely included patient populations with early and severe RA and parameters that have been of poor prognostic value. Studies investigating the risk of disease progression in patients with established and stable moderate disease activity are very limited. While it is recognised that moderate disease activity is not an adequate target for patients with RA, in real life, those with moderate RA represent a substantial proportion of patients in clinical practice.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The objective of this study was to identify factors contributing to the risk of significant radiographic progression (SRP) among patients with moderately active RA despite receiving MTX treatment, to help improve treatment to target in this heterogeneous RA population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and patient population</title><p>This study is a subanalysis of the Trial of Etanercept and Methotrexate with Radiographic Patient Outcomes (TEMPO) trial (NCT00393471), a double-blind, randomised, 3-year multicentre study. In TEMPO, 682 patients were randomly assigned to receive etanercept (ETN) 25&#x02005;mg twice weekly (n=223), MTX &#x0003c;20&#x02005;mg/week (n=228), or a combination of both (n=231). At baseline, patients in the MTX arm received MTX 7.5&#x02005;mg/week. At the week 4 visit, if the patient had an inadequate response (defined as any painful or swollen joints), the patient's oral MTX dose was increased to 15&#x02005;mg/week. At the week 8 visit, if the patients still had an inadequate response, the oral MTX dose was increased to 20&#x02005;mg/week. Treatment remained stable over the 3&#x02005;years. Further details of the TEMPO trial design and results have been reported previously.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;19</xref></p><p>For this subanalysis, patient data from the MTX arm of the TEMPO trial with sustained moderate RA (defined as &#x02265;3.2 mean DAS28 &#x02264;5.1) during the last 6&#x02005;months of the first year were used (weeks 24 and 52 assessments). With these criteria for &#x02018;sustained moderate RA&#x02019;, patients with moderate disease activity at baseline that could potentially improve in the first year of treatment were excluded. In addition, patients with moderate RA during weeks 24&#x02013;52 were assumed to have stable disease activity. The patients analysed had received &#x02265;1 dose of MTX and had &#x02265;1 post-baseline evaluation.</p><p>This study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation guideline for good clinical practice and the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

In this patient population, high CRP levels and RF positivity at baseline were strongly predictive of SRP. When observing patients all together, those who had a CRP &#x0003e;40&#x02005;mg/L and were RF positive had greater radiographic progression than those in the lowest risk groups. This confirms the heterogeneity of the moderate activity RA population and emphasises the value of biological biomarkers to identify patients with a higher risk of structural damage progression. In the original TEMPO study, patients were treated with ETN, MTX or a combination of ETN and MTX. ETN monotherapy and ETN plus MTX resulted in significantly less radiographic progression than MTX alone. Therefore, patients with higher CRP and RF positivity could achieve better results if they switched to more aggressive therapy sooner rather than continuing on MTX alone.</p><p>We selected patients with moderate disease activity because they constitute the majority of patients with RA in the clinic, despite EULAR guidelines recommending that patients switch to more aggressive treatment strategies when LDA/remission is not achieved.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> For this analysis, patients within the moderate disease activity range at baseline were excluded as they had the potential to improve in the first year of treatment, and we assumed that patients with moderate RA during weeks 24&#x02013;52 of TEMPO had stable disease activity. This assumption is further supported by the observation that at the end of the 3-year controlled phase of TEMPO, the mean DAS28 was within the moderate range (DAS28=3.9).<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>This is the first study to examine predictors of radiographic progression in patients with established moderate disease activity. A study by Visser <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> in severe early RA also found higher CRP levels to be predictive of radiographic progression, as well as autoantibodies and erosion score.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> We found no relationship between the baseline erosion score and SRP, although the sample size may not have been sufficient to show a correlation. Another study performed by Vastesaeger <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> in patients with severe early-onset RA on MTX monotherapy also found that higher CRP and ESR levels were associated with rapid radiographic progression. Conversely, a study of pooled data from a number of clinical trials showed that it was clinical measures (as measured by swollen joint counts) rather than inflammation markers (as measured by CRP levels) that were predictive of radiographic progression in patients receiving MTX monotherapy.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> It must be noted that in all of these studies discussed, rapid radiographic progression was measured as mTSS change from a baseline of &#x02265;5, whereas we used &#x0003e;3. The mean change in mTSS in TEMPO over 3&#x02005;years was &#x02212;0.14 (95% CI &#x02212;1.07 to 0.78) for combination therapy, 1.61 (95% CI 0.41 to 2.81) for ETN monotherapy, and 5.95 (95% CI 2.96 to 8.94) for MTX monotherapy, respectively.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Therefore, we found that 3&#x02005;units, rather than 5&#x02005;units, was an acceptable cut-off point with which to define SRP.</p><p>The study had a number of limitations. This was a post hoc analysis, and therefore our patient population was limited to those within the TEMPO study. The sample size of n=96 was small and the mean dose of MTX at a baseline of 7.5&#x02005;mg/week was low, which makes it difficult to generalise the results. However, by week 24, the majority of patients were receiving optimal doses (&#x02265;15&#x02005;mg) of MTX. Overall, we observed a limited level of radiographic progression which may have restricted our ability to determine SRP; however, this is representative of a standard patient population with RA in the 21st century. Our study focused only on the patients receiving MTX monotherapy, mainly because it is these patients who would potentially be most at risk. Further work should investigate the predictive factors associated with disease progression in patients on ETN monotherapy, versus ETN plus MTX combination therapy, in order to give a full picture of those susceptible to SRP. Another limitation to note is that RF autoantibody status is often measured alongside the anticitrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) autoantibody, as both are associated with poor outcomes in patients with RA, including radiographic progression.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Comparison of ACPA status with the RF status would have been informative, but unfortunately ACPA data were not available for analysis. Although we found CRP levels at baseline to be predictive of SRP, they are often dynamic and may have decreased throughout the study, even though the disease activity remained moderate. Since SRP is evaluated after 2 and 3&#x02005;years, it would have been useful to determine if the CRP levels at later time points were still predictive of radiographic progression. That CRP and RF status are predictors of poor response to MTX and not of disease progression is also impossible to rule out. However, since CRP has been shown to correlate with progression in patients with active disease,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> we provide evidence for the first time that this is also likely in patients with moderately active RA. Other established markers of progression, such as high erosion score, were not found to be predictors of SRP in our study. This is probably because the majority of patients in the TEMPO study had severe early RA and already had erosive disease.</p><p>In summary, patients with moderate activity RA receiving MTX treatment may exhibit radiographic progression. In particular, those patients having both high CRP levels and RF positivity at baseline were at higher risk of radiographic progression after 2 and 3&#x02005;years of MTX treatment.</p></sec>
