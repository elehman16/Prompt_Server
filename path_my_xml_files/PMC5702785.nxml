If licensed, this vaccine could be given to infants receiving routine childhood immunizations. We therefore evaluated responses to ChAd63 MVA ME-TRAP when co-administered with routine Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) vaccines.</p></sec><sec id="ST2"><title>Methods</title><p>We enrolled 65 Gambian infants and neonates, aged 16, 8, or 1&#x02009;week at first vaccination and randomized them to receive either ME-TRAP and EPI vaccines or EPI vaccines only.

However, achieving this goal would need new interventions to complement current control strategies. To curtail the threat posed by emerging resistance to artemisinin-based chemotherapy and insecticide-treated bed nets, efforts have intensified to develop potent vaccines as a complementary tool (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>The most clinically advanced malaria vaccine to date, RTS,S, has limited efficacy coupled with some safety concerns and practical deployment challenges for its four dose regimen in target age groups at high risk of malaria (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Novel approaches to generate immunity to malaria employing viral vector vaccines were initially limited due to the use of homologous prime-boost approaches that induced relatively poor T cell responses (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). These have been improved by the development of a novel heterologous approach, which elicits potent and durable cell-mediated immunity (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Since 2007, we have extensively evaluated heterologous prime-boost vaccination with chimpanzee adenovirus 63 (ChAd63) and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) expressing the <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> pre-erythrocytic antigen ME-TRAP, a multiple epitope string (ME) fused to thrombospondin-related adhesion protein (TRAP) among malaria-na&#x000ef;ve adults in Europe and malaria-exposed adults, children, and infants in Africa (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). High-level efficacy was observed in Kenyan adults (66%) over 8&#x02009;weeks of follow-up (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Across four de-escalating pediatric age groups in Burkina Faso and The Gambia, these vaccines had acceptable safety profiles and induced primarily CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and potent humoral immunity (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>Due to the very high malaria burden among young infants in sub-Saharan Africa, a malaria vaccine should be given in early infancy to provide effective protection. During this period, routine vaccines are administered to infants according to the WHO Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) schedule. Incorporating a new malaria vaccine within an existing EPI schedule would facilitate acceptance and uptake by parents and reduce logistical costs. However, coadministration with EPI vaccines can reduce immunogenicity of new candidate vaccines (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>); hence, it is crucial to evaluate early the immune responses of co-administered vaccines. Such evaluation could also guide the selection of optimal vaccination schedules and appropriate infant age groups for large efficacy trials (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Coadministration of RTS,S with diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP)-containing vaccines in a late phase trial may have contributed to the low immune responses observed among infants aged 6&#x02013;12&#x02009;weeks (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Similarly, coadministration of a candidate tuberculosis vaccine, MVA85A, with EPI vaccines resulted in a drop in tuberculosis-specific immunogenicity (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). These findings underscore the importance of appropriate timing of immunizations, both to inform the design of efficacy trials involving T cell-inducing vaccines and also to prioritize identification of optimal schedules for integration within the EPI program (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we investigated the safety and immunogenicity of ChAd63 MVA ME-TRAP when co-administered with EPI vaccines among Gambian infants aged 16, 8, and 1&#x02009;week at first immunization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of ChAd63 ME-TRAP and MVA ME-TRAP prime-boost immunization when co-administered with EPI vaccines in healthy Gambians at ages of 1 and 8, 8 and 16, or 16 and 24&#x02009;weeks, respectively. Secondary objectives were to evaluate both the cellular and humoral immunogenicity of ChAd63 MVA ME-TRAP and the antibody responses to EPI vaccines when given alone to unvaccinated controls or when co-administered with the candidate vaccines within the standard Gambian EPI schedule.</p></sec><sec id="S2-2"><title>Study Setting</title><p>The trial was undertaken from May 2014 to November 2015 at the Sukuta field site of Medical Research Council Unit The Gambia (MRCG). Sukuta is a peri-urban Gambian settlement located about 25&#x02009;km south of the capital, Banjul. Malaria transmission is highly seasonal in this setting, occurring almost exclusively from July to January, with a peak in November (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The predominant malaria vector is <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>.</p><p>The MRCG has a 42-bed facility for in-patient care. This is supported by laboratory and radiology diagnostic facilities.

These include comprehensive clinical evaluation to identify the source of infection. To establish the definitive diagnosis, investigations such as full blood count, blood culture and CSF analysis are done. Antibiotic management is shaped by the result of these tests. Supportive management including fluid management is provided based on the clinical needs of the neonates.</p></sec><sec id="S2-3"><title>Participants</title><p>Sensitization meetings were held with the local community to identify potential participants for the 16- and 8-week cohorts.

For the 1-week-old group, pregnant women attending antenatal care at the government health center located within the field site were sensitized from 30 to 32&#x02009;weeks of gestation. The trial team attended the delivery of consenting pregnant women and conducted an eligibility assessment and screening tests on the newborn infants.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included any evidence of acute or chronic illness or of hematological, renal or hepatic pathology, birth weight less than 2.5&#x02009;kg, significant antenatal, perinatal or early postnatal complications, weight for age <italic>z</italic>-scores below 2 SDs of normal for age, hemoglobin less than 10&#x02009;g/dl at &#x0003e;4&#x02009;weeks of age or less than 13.0&#x02009;g/dl at &#x0003c;4&#x02009;weeks of age, white cell count &#x0003c;5.0&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>/l, positive malaria antigen test, positive maternal HIV serology test, clinically significant serum biochemistry results, prior receipt of an investigational malaria vaccine, recent or planned use of any investigational drug, vaccine, immunoglobulin or any blood product, use of immunosuppressant drugs, confirmed or suspected immunodeficiency, history of surgical splenectomy, and concurrent participation in another clinical trial.

Seventy-two infants and neonates were screened for eligibility across the three age groups and 65 eligible infants were enrolled, randomized, vaccinated according to randomization list and followed up for 252&#x02009;days. Of 24 infants screened in the 16-week-old group, mothers of 3 infants withdrew consent before enrollment while 1 infant was excluded due to markedly raised alanine transaminase. Among those randomized to the vaccine arm, one infant had fatal SAE that was non-related to the study vaccines and another was lost to follow-up due to relocation of mother, while only one infant did not complete the follow-up in the control arm. Twenty-two infants were screened for the 8-week-old cohort and all were eligible. Only the first 20 were randomized into 15 vaccine group and 5 controls. Similarly, 26 mother-newborn pairs were screened for the 1-week-old group. A mother withdrew consent before enrollment and the remaining 25 neonates were randomized into 15 vaccinees and 10 controls.

This guaranteed treatment concealment until enrollment as the envelopes were opened only after the study infants were enrolled. However, the clinical investigators and mothers of study infants were not blinded to vaccination regimen but the laboratory staff who conducted the EPI antibody testing were blinded to the study arms.</p></sec><sec id="S2-6"><title>Sample Size</title><p>As this was a Phase Ib trial, the sample size was shaped by the need to balance the number required for evaluation of safety and immunogenicity of an investigational vaccine with the risk of exposing a large group of study participants to an unlicensed vaccine.

The study participants were further assessed for unsolicited symptoms for 30&#x02009;days after each study vaccination. Laboratory abnormalities and SAEs were assessed for the entire study period (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). Trained field assistants visited the infants at home daily for the following 3&#x02009;days after each vaccination to administer a standardized reactogenicity card to the mothers, which included history of fever, vomiting, diarrhea, reduced oral intake, and reduced activities. The field assistants also examined the infants for expected local AEs (swelling, tenderness, limitation of arm movement, redness and desquamation at the site of injection) and fever. Pain at the injection site was graded on a scale of 0&#x02013;3 where 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;no pain, 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;painful to touch, 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;pain when arm is touched, and 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;severe pain at rest.</p><p>Further safety assessments were subsequently performed on all study infants on days 7, 21, 63, 112, 168, 224, and 252 after enrollment. Clinical evaluations consisted of measurement of vital signs and assessment for local injection site and general solicited symptoms and signs. Local solicited symptoms and signs included pain, swelling, redness at injection site while systemic solicited symptoms and signs included fever (axillary temperature of &#x0003e;38.0&#x000b0;C), reduced oral intake, reduced activity, and vomiting. Any other symptoms or signs were considered unsolicited and were recorded during the 30&#x02009;days after each vaccination while SAEs were monitored throughout the study period. Blood samples were collected at screening visit and study days 21, 63, 112, and 168 to determine complete blood count, alanine transaminase (ALT), and serum creatinine.</p><p>Adverse events were graded by intensity and judged for relatedness to study vaccines. Mild AEs were easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with daily activities. Moderate AEs were sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities. Severe AEs prevented normal daily activities. Swelling, redness and fever had specific definitions not based on interference with daily activities. Injection site swelling and redness were graded based on their widest dimension: mild, 0&#x02013;20&#x02009;mm; moderate, 20&#x02013;50&#x02009;mm; and severe, &#x0003e;50&#x02009;mm. Fever was classified as severe if the axillary temperature was &#x02265;40.0&#x000b0;C.

Responses to the T9/96 strain of the TRAP antigen were evaluated by summing responses to individual pools. Responses to TRAP from 3D7 strain were tested using a single pool of peptides covering the entire sequence of the TRAP antigen. Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B (0.02&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/ml) and phytohemmagglutinin-L (10&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/ml) were used as positive control.

After thawing, cells were transferred in polystyrene FACS tubes and washed with FACS buffer [PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.01% sodium azide (both from Sigma)]. Samples were then prepared following a staining protocol standardized across all trial sites (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). After 20&#x02009;min of permeabilization in Cytofix/Cytoperm buffer (BD Biosciences) at RT in the dark, cells were washed once in 1&#x000d7; Perm/Wash Buffer (BD Biosciences). Cells were then stained at RT for 30&#x02009;min with a combined surface and intracellular cocktail containing CD3 AlexaFluor700 (1/50, clone UCHT1), CD4 APC (1/25, clone Leu-3), CD8 APC-eFluor780 (1/10, clone RPAT8), CD14 eFluor450 (1/50, clone 61D3), CD19 eFluor450 (1/50, clone SJ25-C1), IFN&#x003b3; FITC (1/100, clone 4S.B3), IL-2 PE (1/50, clone MQ1-17H12), and TNF&#x003b1; PECy7 (1/500, clone MAb11) monoclonal antibodies (all from eBioscience). Samples were washed in 1&#x000d7; Perm/Wash Buffer and re-suspended in 1% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) in PBS for consistency across all trial sites due to logistic issues that can arise at acquisition. Samples were then analyzed using a BD LSR Fortessa Cell Analyzer (Becton Dickinson). Compensation was calculated for each fluorochrome on each acquisition run using OneComp beads (eBioscience) for surface and intracellular antibodies and ARC beads (Life Technologies) for Aqua reactive dye. An average of 700,000 total events (IQR: 493,669&#x02013;851,834 events) was collected per sample. Figure S1 in Supplementary Material shows the hierarchical gating strategy for this analysis. A minimum of 55,000 live CD3<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes was analyzed for each sample. At least 23,000 CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were analyzed for multiple cytokine expression after exclusion of any double positive cells, respectively. Any sample with less than 23,000 events in the CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> gate was excluded. 8 out of 88 samples (corresponding to 1 sample for the CD4<sup>+</sup> and 7 for the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell cytokine response analysis) with a total cytokine response to the positive control lower than 1% cytokine positive CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were further excluded from subsequent analysis. Responses were calculated after background subtraction, corresponding to the response in the medium control for each sample. The LLD of the assay, corresponding to 1/minimum number of events in the CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> gate*100, was 0.0047% of the parent population for all three cytokines for both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. A positive response was strictly greater than one time the unstimulated control of the corresponding sample. Any response failing this criterion was considered negative and was replaced by LLD value or excluded from analysis when stated otherwise. Bar charts were created using absolute frequencies. Pie charts were generated using relative frequencies with a threshold of 0.004% of the parent population.

Nunc-Immuno 96 well plates were coated with 0.5&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/ml of TRAP antigen from 3D7 <italic>Pf</italic> strain in carbonate-bicarbonate coating buffer and left overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Plates were washed six times with phosphate-buffered saline-Tween (PBS/T), then blocked with 1% BSA in PBS/T for 1&#x02009;h at RT. Serum was diluted in PBS/T containing 0.2% BSA at concentrations of 1:100, 1:500, or 1:1,000, and added in triplicate. Serum samples from the screening visit, days 21, 56, 63, 112, and 168, were analyzed. Plates were incubated at RT for 2&#x02009;h then washed as before. A secondary antibody (goat anti-human whole IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, Sigma) was added at a dilution of 1:1,000 in PBS/T 0.2% BSA for 1&#x02009;h at RT. After a final wash, plates were developed by adding 4-nitrophenyl phosphate in diethanolamine buffer (Pierce). A positive reference standard (made from pooled TRAP-positive serum) was used on each plate to give a standard curve. It was added in duplicate at an initial dilution of 1:100 (in PBS/T 0.2% BSA) and diluted twofold 10 times, starting with an arbitrary value of 20 antibody units. Four blank wells (0 antibody units) were also designated. The optical density (OD) values were then fitted to a four-parameter standard curve using SOFTmax PRO software. An internal control was included on every plate in triplicate made up from a 1:800 dilution (in PBS/T 0.2% BSA) of the positive standard. OD was read at 405&#x02009;nm using an ELx800 microplate reader. Test sera antibody units were calculated from their OD values using the parameters estimated from the standard curve.

In all assays, a reference, controls and blanks were included on each plate. All analyses were performed with a Bio-Plex 200 in combination with Bio-Plex manager software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). For the <italic>B. pertussis</italic>, diphtheria and tetanus (DTaP) multiplex assay, samples were diluted 1:200 and 1:4,000 in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 and 3% BSA. Serum values for <italic>B. pertussis</italic> were assigned in endotoxin units per milliliter as the used in-house reference was calibrated against the U.S. Reference Pertussis Anti-serum Human lot 3 (CBER/FDA). Hib IgG antibodies were determined similar to the DTaP multiplex assay, with the exception that sera were diluted 1:100 and 1:400 in 50% antibody depleted human serum. Values were expressed in micrograms per milliliter as the used in-house reference was calibrated against lot 1983 (CBER/FDA). Pneumococcal IgG antibody concentrations of serotypes included in PCV13 were simultaneously measured by diluting the sera 1:1,000 in PBS containing 15&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/ml cell wall polysaccharide Multi (Statens Serum Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark) and 5% antibody depleted human serum to reduce non-specific reactions. Serum values were expressed in &#x000b5;g/ml as the used in-house reference was calibrated against lot 89-S serum (CBER/FDA). For Hepatitis B, antibodies to the surface antigen were measured using the Abbot Architect 2000i chemiluminescent micro-particle immunoassay, product # 7C18.

For categorical variables, data were summarized using absolute numbers and percentages and groups were compared with Fisher&#x02019;s exact test (FET). For continuous variables, the median and inter-quartile range or geometric mean with 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to summarize the data. Intent to treat analysis was used. For immunological data, statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism, Mac version 6 (GraphPad Software Inc., USA) or Spice v5.3 (Mario Roederer, Vaccine Research Centre, NIAID, NIH, USA). Geometric mean responses are shown for each group, unless stated otherwise in the figure legends. Differences in ELISpot responses over the time course of follow-up were tested for significance using the Friedman matched-pairs non-parametric test, while variations in responses between individual time points were compared for each infant within each age group using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, respectively. Infants with missing data at any time point were excluded from matched-pairs analyses. Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was used to compare responses in vaccinees to those of controls within the same age group at a specific time point. Differences across groups in peak ELISpot responses or in intracellular cytokine responses were analyzed using the Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test with Dunn&#x02019;s multiple comparison post-test. Similarly, variations between post-prime and post-boost responses measured by intracellular staining were compared for each cytokine, on CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells separately, using Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test with Dunn&#x02019;s correction for multiple comparisons. This non-paired analysis was chosen to gain some statistical power over a matched-pairs test, as several data points were missing from this dataset. Comparisons between study groups of the T cell phenotype distribution of peak CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses was achieved by a non-parametric partial permutation test using 10,000 iterations in SPICE (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).

Owing to mild intensity of these symptoms, the participants were clinically investigated to establish the definitive diagnoses and exclude possible complications. The participants with skin sepsis (impetigo) were subsequently treated with full course of antimicrobials on out-patient basis and they made remarkable clinical recovery. Low hemoglobin observed in one neonate (6.7%) in the vaccine group was investigated and found to be due to physiological decline of hemoglobin in early weeks of life. This was corrected with hematinics and the participant made sustained clinical improvement.

The substantially higher antibody immunogenicity in several young age groups in Africa compared to UK adults (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>B) cautions that some phase Ia trials in adults may importantly underestimate the potency of vectored vaccines in infant target populations.</p></sec><sec id="S3-3-4"><title>IgG Responses to EPI Vaccines</title><p>Responses to EPI vaccines, 8&#x02009;weeks post-primary series, were not significantly different between vaccinees and controls although the study was not powered to detect modest significant differences (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>C,D).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This clinical trial evaluated the responses to ChAd63 MVA ME-TRAP when given simultaneously with EPI vaccines among healthy Gambian infants and neonates. Vaccines were co-administered as early as 1&#x02009;week of age, as BCG and the first doses of hepatitis B and OPVs are administered at this time point.</p><p>Adverse events observed in the coadministration groups were similar to those reported in our previous studies of these vectored vaccines, where fever was the most frequently observed in the 10-week-old group and all vaccine-related AEs were mild and resolved within 1&#x02009;day after onset of symptoms (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Not surprisingly, a significantly higher proportion of infants who received ChAd63 MVA ME-TRAP with EPI vaccines had fever compared to those who received EPI vaccines alone. This finding may be explained by the concurrence of inflammatory processes as a result of multiple injections. Similarly, pain and discoloration at EPI injection sites were more frequently reported in participants who received EPI with study vaccines across all age groups while swelling at EPI sites were seen in participants who received EPI with MVA study vaccine. Nevertheless, these symptoms were of mild intensity and resolved within 48&#x02009;h post-vaccination.</p><p>The increased frequency of fever observed following administration of study vaccines in 1-week-old cohort was notably Grade 1 (of mild intensity) and these resolved within 24&#x02009;h without use of any medication. There were also no associated danger signs such as refusal of feeds, abnormal cry and convulsion; hence full septic work-up was not done. Given that low grade fever is not unexpected in neonates whose immune system is immature, observing Grade 1 fever over a short duration in this age group lends credence to the safety and tolerability of the study vaccines. However, given the small sample size of the neonates studied, further evaluation is required in larger sample of this cohort. Furthermore, the preponderance of unsolicited symptoms such as skin sepsis observed among study vaccine recipients in 1- and 8-week-old cohorts was clinically investigated and found to be caused by poor hygienic practices by participants&#x02019; mothers. The participants fully recovered following improved hygiene and a course of antibiotics. Overall, these observations show that coadministration of ChAd63 MVA ME-TRAP with EPI vaccines is safe and well tolerated in Gambian infants and neonates.</p><p>As in previous studies, we observed induction of substantial and durable T cell responses maintained beyond 112&#x02009;days post-MVA, which comprised both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells capable of secreting multiple cytokines, with similar phenotypes to those seen in older infants, children, and adults (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Importantly, these high levels of effector cellular immunity, as measured by ELISpot, with or without adjustment of T cells per million PMBC to T cells per milliliter of blood, are as high or higher than those observed in UK adult vaccinees protected against five bite malaria sporozoite challenge (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and those observed in Kenyan adult vaccinees showing efficacy against natural infection (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Although responses from the 1-week olds were generally lower than those seen in the older infants, probably due to age-related differences in immunity, peak responses 1&#x02009;week following boost vaccination in this age group were also significantly higher than those previously achieved in Gambian adults (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) as well as in older children in The Gambia and Burkina Faso (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) using the same vaccine approach, further demonstrating that viral vectored vaccines represent an effective mean of triggering cellular immunity in early life. Overall, these data further support previous findings of increase, and not decrease, in cellular immunogenicity in young infants, with the highest responses induced in the 8-week olds being almost identical to those of 10-week olds (12,277 and 12,074&#x02009;SFC/ml, respectively), who received the same vaccine separately from EPI vaccines (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>As previously reported, responses to TRAP were broad, indicating the recognition of several potential epitopes within the TRAP antigen (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Moreover, although TRAP from T9/96 vaccine strain differs by 6.5% AA from 3D7 TRAP sequence (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), peak homologous and heterologous antigen-specific T cell responses were comparable and positively correlated, pointing out a high degree of cross-reactivity. Altogether, these observations confirm that this vaccine should not be substantially affected neither by potentially great genetic variation in HLA types in target populations nor by antigen polymorphism.</p><p>Flow cytometry analysis further revealed vaccine-induced cytokine production by both antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Importantly, despite major differences (including differences in sensitivity or the use of PBMC vs. whole blood) between the two assays, peak total frequency of IFN&#x003b3;-producing TRAP-specific CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells, assessed 1&#x02009;week post-MVA by intracellular staining, positively correlated with peak IFN&#x003b3; responses to TRAP measured by ELISpot, suggesting that blood volumes as little as 1.05&#x02009;ml could be sufficient to measure the vaccine response in young infants.</p><p>Priming vaccination elicited predominantly CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses, and while CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses were observed, these required the MVA booster vaccination to reach similar levels. While previous studies have reported age-specific differences in neonatal adaptive immunity with a reduction in infant IFN&#x003b3; responses to hepatitis B (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) or oral polio (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) vaccines as compared to vaccinated adults, BCG, or DNA vaccinations at birth have been shown to elicit strong T helper type 1 and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses during neonatal life (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Similarly, our findings illustrate the induction of antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells producing type 1 cytokines, highlighting potent cellular immunogenicity of our vaccine candidate in young infants. This finding confirms that newborns can develop potent cellular immune responses under certain circumstances, as previously observed in infants congenitally infected with <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) or cytomegalovirus (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), who developed strong CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses.</p><p>Multiparameter flow cytometric analysis revealed multiple cytokine-secreting T cell subsets expressing IFN&#x003b3;, IL-2, and TNF&#x003b1; in all combinations, including a phenotype previously identified as an immune correlate of vaccine-induced protection against heterologous challenge in na&#x000ef;ve adults (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Although these responses were lower in this setting as compared to those seen in UK and Kenyan adults (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), this provides grounds for future studies of vaccine efficacy in pediatric populations.</p><p>This viral vector approach also induced substantial IgG antibody responses to TRAP in these infants and neonates, despite a lack of humoral immunogenicity in adults in the same population (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Peak titers were similarly significantly higher in this cohort than those seen in Gambian children aged 2- to 6-year old, confirming an overall higher immunogenicity in the youngest age groups. The addition of a humoral component of immunity elicited by this vaccine at the pre-erythrocytic stage could be useful, given that viral vectors are predominantly employed for their ability to induce cell-mediated immunity. With our recent observation that vaccine-induced TRAP antibody responses could play a role in reducing liver parasite burden (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), this raises the possibility of an improved vaccine efficacy via synergistic protection in young infants as compared to that observed in adults. The leading malaria vaccine candidate RTS,S shows reduced immunogenicity and associated efficacy in infants aged 6&#x02013;12&#x02009;weeks (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), compared with those aged 5&#x02013;17&#x02009;months. We observed the same trend in this study, although pre-vaccination titers to TRAP were less frequently observed, suggesting that pre-existing immunity to the vaccine antigen is not the cause in this case.</p><p>Given the advantages of integrating a new vaccine within the EPI schedule, including reduced clinic visits, increased immunization coverage, and possible enhanced immunogenicity of the vaccines (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), these benefits must be carefully considered against adverse immunological interference that may be caused by coadministration of T cell inducing vaccines with EPI vaccines. Although our findings support concomitant administration of ChAd63 MVA ME-TRAP with licensed EPI vaccines, these findings need further evaluation in larger non-interference trials.</p><p>This study demonstrates that coadministration of ChAd63 MVA ME-TRAP with EPI vaccines is safe and well tolerated and induces potent immune responses against <italic>P. falciparum</italic> antigens. The potency of these vectored vaccines for both T cell and antibody responses in early infancy suggests that vectors may also be useful for targeting other pathogens, such as RSV, where protection in the first months of life is required.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Ethics Statement</title><sec id="S5-1"><title>Ethical Considerations and Regulatory Study Approval</title><p>This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the ICH Good Clinical Practice guidelines with written informed consent from all subjects.
