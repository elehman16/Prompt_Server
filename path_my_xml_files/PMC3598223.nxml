To date, we have shown in an open trial that PTSD symptoms in critically injured patients can be reduced by taking omega-3 fatty acids, hypothesized to stimulate hippocampal neurogenesis. The primary aim of the present randomized controlled trial is to examine the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in the secondary prevention of PTSD following accidental injury, as compared with placebo. This paper describes the rationale and protocol of this trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The Tachikawa Project for Prevention of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder with Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid (TPOP) is a double-blinded, parallel group, randomized controlled trial to assess whether omega-3 fatty acid supplementation can prevent PTSD symptoms among accident-injured patients consecutively admitted to an intensive care unit. We plan to recruit accident-injured patients and follow them prospectively for 12 weeks. Enrolled patients will be randomized to either the omega-3 fatty acid supplement group (1,470 mg docosahexaenoic acid and 147 mg eicosapentaenoic acid daily) or placebo group. Primary outcome is score on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). We will need to randomize 140 injured patients to have 90% power to detect a 10-point difference in mean CAPS scores with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation compared with placebo. Secondary measures are diagnosis of PTSD and major depressive disorder, depressive symptoms, physiologic response in the experiment using script-driven imagery and acoustic stimulation, serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor, health-related quality of life, resilience, and aggression. Analyses will be by intent to treat. The trial was initiated on December 13 2008, with 104 subjects randomized by November 30 2012.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study promises to be the first trial to provide a novel prevention strategy for PTSD among traumatized people.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00671099">NCT00671099</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Fish oil</kwd><kwd>Omega-3 fatty acid</kwd><kwd>Docosahexaenoic acid</kwd><kwd>Eicosapentaenoic acid</kwd><kwd>Posttraumatic stress disorder</kwd><kwd>Accidental injury</kwd><kwd>Prevention</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Accidental injury occurs worldwide and accounted for approximately 16% of the world&#x02019;s burden of disease in 1998 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Advances in injury care systems have since increased the number of seriously injured people who can survive their injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and severely injured patients might be at higher risk for developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The prevalence of PTSD determined by structured clinical interviews with injured patients consecutively admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) or emergency departments is in the range of 5&#x02013;30% at 0&#x02013;3 months after accidental injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] to 2&#x02013;23% at 4&#x02013;12 months after [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Comorbidity between PTSD and depressive disorder is also highly prevalent in these injured patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Among Japanese patients admitted to the ICU at our hospital after motor vehicle accident (MVA), 8% developed full PTSD, 16% developed partial PTSD, and 23% developed depressive disorder (16% major depressive disorder, 7% minor depressive disorder) at 1 month after accidental injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This amounts to roughly one in every four patients developing some form of PTSD after MVA. The need for a selective, preventive intervention strategy is therefore clear.</p><p>A few studies have reported some positive outcomes in regard to preventing PTSD. These include a randomized controlled trial of cognitive therapy given in the initial months after MVA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], an open trial of propranolol after accidental injury in a small study population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and a randomized controlled trial of propranolol after accidental injury in a small study population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In Japan, however, psychiatric services provided in emergency hospitals are limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and currently fall short of providing adequate and effective psychiatric care.</p><p>A growing number of epidemiological studies suggest an association between depression and low dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Although several studies have pointed out discrepancies relating to the differential effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5<italic>n</italic>-3) versus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6<italic>n</italic>-3), previous meta-analyses are supportive of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in reducing depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, there have been no trials on PTSD conducted thus far. Several biological mechanisms potentially explain the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on psychiatric illness, especially mood and anxiety disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Animal studies have revealed that short-term augmentation of dietary omega-3 fatty acids relative to omega-6 fatty acids up-regulated adult neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], and that dietary omega-3 fatty acids elevated levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which promotes neuronal survival and growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In addition, DHA was shown to increase neurite extension and branching of hippocampal neurons in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] as well as the maturation of neurons and hippocampal neurogenesis in adult rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Venna at al. showed that the increase in newborn hippocampal cells by polyunsaturated fatty acids occurred in parallel with an increase in hippocampal volume and over-expression of BDNF mRNA and protein in the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>The hippocampus is crucial for converting short-term memory into long-term memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and can process and temporarily store new memory during the transition period before transferring labile memory to the cortex for permanent storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In the pathogenesis of PTSD, fear memory becomes excessively consolidated and extinction learning does not progress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Kitamura et al. recently found that the period of hippocampus-dependent fear memory is longer in mice with decreased hippocampal neurogenesis and shorter in mice with active hippocampal neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], indicating that the level of hippocampal neurogenesis is a crucial factor in determining the duration of hippocampal-dependent fear memory. The possibility arises then that the fear memory characteristic to PTSD might be controllable by aptly regulating hippocampal neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>We hypothesized that promoting adult neurogenesis early in the transition period might facilitate clearance of fear memory in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Our preliminary open trial found that post-trial PTSD symptoms were significantly alleviated in injured patients who all took the omega-3 fatty acids compared with historical controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The present study aims to examine the effectiveness of omega-3 fatty acids for preventing PTSD in physically injured patients admitted to the ICU at National Disaster Medical Center, Japan immediately following accidental injury (mostly MVA). This study is called the Tachikawa Project for Prevention of PTSD with Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid (TPOP).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>TPOP is a double-blinded, parallel group, randomized controlled trial that compares an intervention group that receives omega-3 fatty acid supplementation with a parallel control group that receives placebo supplementation.

Participation in the study is voluntary, and non-participants will not be penalized in any way. Participants can withdraw from the study at any time even after starting participation in the study.</p><p>2. The purpose of the study is to examine whether omega-3 capsules are effective in alleviating mental stress after physical trauma compared with placebo capsules in patients with physical trauma transferred to an emergency room.</p><p>3. Participants will be randomly assigned to either of the two intervention groups. Participants in both groups will be interviewed at 1 month and 3 months after providing consent.</p><p>4. Effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed through interviews as well as testing capsules related to the autonomic nervous systems and biological defense mechanism and neurotrophic factors.</p><p>5. Participants surveyed during their hospital stay will receive an incentive item for each interview. Because those who are surveyed after discharge will need to visit the hospital more frequently than usual resulting in increased transportation costs, they will receive incentive items to cover additional transportation costs.</p><p>6. Participants will be contacted via telephone, email, or confidential letters. To avoid inconveniencing the participants, their families may be contacted within the agreed conditions.</p><p>7. Collected information will be securely stored to protect personal information. Before analysis, identifying information such as name, address, telephone number, date of birth, and patient record number will be removed and new numbers will be assigned (making the data anonymous).</p><p>8. All biological samples will be locked in a refrigerator or freezer in the laboratory.

Clinical research coordinators first explain the potential public health benefits of the study results as well as the study procedures. Coordinators then explain the study plan, intervention methods, evaluation methods, and means used to obtain information. Eligible patients may take as much time as necessary to assess the information and to decide whether to participate or not. After the study is explained, written documented consent is obtained, and their participation starts (investigators make sure the consent has been filed in the medical record).</p><p>During a hospital stay, meetings are regularly held with the participants to ensure they clearly understand some study aspects that lay people may not easily understand, such as the study purpose and treatment assignment. They are asked to strictly adhere to taking the test capsules.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>Participants are asked to take 7 capsules per day after eating for 12 weeks and additionally told that they might take a full day&#x02019;s dosage at one time. Concomitant psychiatric medications are not allowed during the study period except for minimal and intermittent use of hypnotics and antidepressants.</p><sec><title>Active omega-3 capsule</title><p>We prepared new capsules for this trial, containing a higher concentration of DHA than used in our previous trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].

The fatty acid composition of this mixture is similar to the average composition of fatty acid intake in Japan. We added a small amount of not fully deodorized fish oil to the base of the control oil to make it fishy and undistinguishable from the active oil.</p></sec><sec><title>Management of intervention</title><p>During hospitalization, ward nurses administer all capsules and confirm that participants take them. In the case of discharge before completing the trial, participants take the capsules by themselves, and clinical research coordinators telephone or email them to confirm at least once a week. Our weekly e-newsletters are also sent to the participants to maintain their interest in the study and to provide general health care advice. If participants forget to take capsules, they are asked to take a double dose on the next day or later.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>An independent statistician (Dr. Akiko Kada) composed tables of block randomization with three stratification factors using a computer-generated random allocation sequence. Stratification factors included sex, age (&#x0003c;40 or &#x02265;40 years), and sense of life threat. This resulted in eight (2&#x000d7;2&#x000d7;2) different stratified tables of supplement numbers. Those tables were sent to an independent pharmacist (Professor Satoru Kobayashi); he securely kept the tables and prepared numbered supplements bottles according to the tables. Both the research team and participants will be blinded to randomization until the last participant has completed the protocol and the spreadsheets of all results are finalized. Stratification by sex, age, and sense of life threat has been justified by previous studies; the prevalence of PTSD and major depressive disorder were higher in women than in men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]; and our previous cohort study of MVA survivors showed that sense of life threat was a strong predictor of subsequent PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Moreover, according to the National Health and Nutrition Survey on food group consumption by age group, the amount of meat products consumed such as pork and beef is higher for both sexes before age 40, but after this age the amount of seafood consumption increases. Also omega 3 fatty acid contents in red blood cells increase with age in the Japan population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Baseline assessment</title><p>Baseline data are collected on enrollment on the following items: general socio-demographics, smoking and alcohol consumption habits, detailed information about the accident, Injury Severity Score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], Glasgow Coma Scale score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], mild traumatic brain injury (i.e., concussion) defined by Hoge&#x02019;s criteria [any of the following three conditions: losing consciousness (knocked out), being dazed, confused or seeing stars, or not remembering the injury] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], type of accident, vital signs first assessed at the accident site and in the emergency room, regular medication, inhalation analgesic, past medical history, family history of psychopathology as determined in a structured interview, a sense of life threat during the accident as determined in the structured interview, the extent of memory regarding the accident as evaluated by the Memory of Traumatic Event Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], bodily pain at rest and on effort as measured subjectively using a visual analogue scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], performance status as defined by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], and past history of traumatic event using the trauma checklist of the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].

We analyze all samples on the same day and under the same conditions. For the baseline blood sample, it is difficult to control for diurnal variation because the accident and admission can occur at any time; however, all blood samples at 1 month and 3 months are drawn between 10:00 and 16:00. Serum BDNF levels are measured using the BDNF Emax Immunoassay System kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.

Other biomarkers such as neuropeptide-Y, dehydroepiandrosterone, activin A, and amino acids are also measured for comparison.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><sec><title>Psychiatric evaluations</title><p>The primary efficacy variable is the total score on the CAPS-DX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Because there is potential overlap between organic and psychogenic symptoms with regard to PTSD, we will take care to ensure the symptoms are psychogenic in origin. Generally, if a symptom is better accounted for by an alternative explanation, we will categorize it as not being a psychological symptom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Because injured patients involved in accidents often experience partial or full loss of traumatic memory, it can sometimes be difficult to differentiate organic from psychogenic amnesia on item 8 (psychogenic amnesia in criterion C3) of the CAPS. In this study, we adopt the standard manner of calculating all items for assessing PTSD symptoms as the primary outcome.</p><p>The secondary efficacy variables consist of the following: PTSD diagnosis as determined by CAPS-DX with all items including item 8, CAPS-DX total scores without item 8 when assessing PTSD symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], PTSD diagnosis as determined by CAPS-DX scores without item 8, total scores on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>], and major depressive disorder (MDD) as determined by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. Other secondary outcome measures are described elsewhere. Trained psychiatrists (YM, DN) conduct all of the face-to-face structured interviews for the evaluation of PTSD and other psychiatric morbidity at 1 and 3 months.</p><p>In this trial, participants are deemed to have partial PTSD if they fulfill two of three symptom criteria [B (re-experiencing), C (avoidance), or D (hyper-arousal)], and also the criteria A-1 (stressor), E (duration), or F (impairment). The inter-rater reliability of the diagnosis of PTSD and MDD was reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Psychological and psychophysiological evaluations</title><p>1. Impact of Event Scale-Revised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]</p><p>The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) is a self-reporting questionnaire about PTSD symptoms that was developed in the U.S. It is the most widely used measure internationally in all forms of disaster-area research. The IES-R is composed of 22 items on the three largest symptoms in the diagnostic criteria of PTSD, namely re-experiencing, avoidance, and increased physiological arousal. Respondents rate symptoms experienced in the previous week. The validity and reliability of the Japanese version of the IES-R has been confirmed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>].</p><p>2. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]</p><p>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) includes a 7-item anxiety subscale and a 7-item depression subscale for assessing general psychological distress for the preceding week. Each item is rated on a scale of 0&#x02013;3, with high scores denoting greater psychological distress. The validity and reliability of the Japanese version of the HADS has been confirmed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>].</p><p>3. The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]</p><p>The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) is based on a conceptual model consisting of physical and mental health constructs, and is designed to measure perceived health status and daily functioning. It consists of 36 items scored in the following 8 domains: physical functioning, role-physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional functioning, and mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]. The validity and reliability of the Japanese version of the SF-36 has been confirmed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>].</p><p>4. Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]</p><p>The self-rating Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) comprises of 25 items, each rated on a 5-point scale (0&#x02013;4), with high scores reflecting greater resilience. The Japanese version of the CD-RISC was translated by Nakajima and Kim and they are currently conducting a validation study.</p><p>5. Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]</p><p>The Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BAQ) is a 29-item questionnaire where participants rank certain statements along a 5-point continuum from "extremely uncharacteristic of me" to "extremely characteristic of me." The scores are normalized on a scale of 0 to 1, with 1 being the highest level of aggression. It has 4 dimensions of aggression: physical aggression, verbal aggression, anger, and hostility. The validity and reliability of the Japanese version of the BAQ has been confirmed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>].</p><p>6. Physiological assessment</p><p>To avoid any confounding effect that the psychological and psychiatric assessment might have on autonomic response, we perform the physiologic assessment first [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]. The physiological data to be collected include heart rate, skin conductance, and continuous blood pressure while the patient is subjected to startling tones and idiographic trauma-related cues. The startling tones to be used in this study are essentially the same as those described in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>]. The idiographic script-driven imagery to be used is essentially the same as that described in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>].

The primary method of evaluation is set as the face-to-face interview. However, conducting an interview via phone is also acceptable when an interview proves difficult to arrange. Clinical research coordinators notify participants of the upcoming follow-up survey no later than 5 days before a psychiatric evaluation. An outcome evaluator reserves a date for the next evaluation after the survey. When notifying participants via e-mail, an email template created specifically for this study is used and sent from an email account address designated for this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Reporting of adverse events and protection of participants</title><p>An adverse event is defined as any unwanted or unintended sign, symptom, or disease seen in trial participants, regardless of the causal relationship with the study interventions. After enrollment, patients undergo a short physical examination and then complete the questionnaires and interviews. Safety issues concerning omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, including monitoring of vital signs and records of adverse events, are investigated at least twice a week during hospitalization. After discharge, safety issues are checked by telephone or email contact. When an adverse event is suspected, researchers and clinical research coordinators evaluate and record the event. Based on the following criteria, adverse events are evaluated for severity according to the following three levels.</p><p>1. Mild: Some symptoms or signs observed, but the participant can continue the trial without treatment.</p><p>2. Moderate: Some symptoms or signs observed, but the participant can continue the trial with treatment, such as reducing the dose of the test capsules or administering drugs.</p><p>3. Severe: Clinical status and daily activities are significantly affected, and discontinuation of the test capsules may be needed. Examples include headache, diarrhea, soft stool, and belching that are severe enough to reduce daily activities.</p><p>An association between the adverse event and test capsules is evaluated on four levels based on the following criteria. If it is judged there is &#x0201c;No association,&#x0201d; the reason for the judgment is also explained in the report.</p><p>1. Not related: Symptoms can be clearly explained by factors other than the test capsules.</p><p>2. Possibly related: Although the symptoms can be considered to be caused by factors other than the test capsules, a possible relationship between them cannot completely be ruled out.</p><p>3. Probably related: The symptoms are unlikely to be caused by factors other than the test capsules.</p><p>4. Related: Causal relationship with the test capsules is strongly suspected, due to a temporal relationship between test capsule administration and occurrence of the adverse event, a correlation between the dose of the test capsules and symptom severity, or when occurrence of the adverse event cannot be explained by factors other than the test capsules.</p><p>Serious adverse events include the following, regardless of the dose of the test capsules. Administration of the test capsules is discontinued upon the occurrence of any such event.</p><p>1. An event resulting in death</p><p>2. A life-threatening event (the participant is facing the possibility of death at the occurrence of the event)</p><p>3. An event requiring hospitalization or an extension of hospitalization to provide treatment</p><p>4. An event resulting in permanent or prominent disorder or functional failure</p><p>5. An event causing a subsequent congenital anomaly or congenital deficiency</p><p>6. Other events or reactions considered medically significant</p><p>Clinical research coordinators immediately contact the principal investigator (YM) and research committee when an adverse event or serious adverse event occurs. Any adverse event or serious adverse event is reported on a monitoring report and evaluated by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board regularly. A reported event gives the date of occurrence and description of the event. In addition, information is reported on the dose of the capsule, concomitant drug(s) and dosage, consumed supplements, types of food, and dates of start or discontinuation of the test capsules. The principal investigator gathers information about the occurrence of a serious event or event that may affect study continuation. The principal investigator also communicates and shares the information with the Data and Safety Monitoring Board independently from the other researchers and the provider of the test capsules. The ethics committee receives reports as needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Failure to attend a hospital visit or failure to reach the participant or family</title><p>If a participant does not visit the hospital for a follow-up appointment, the clinical research coordinator calls the participant or their family and encourages a visit soon after confirming the reason for not visiting. If visiting is judged to be difficult, a phone interview is conducted instead. When contacting the participant, the coordinator confirms that the person talking over the phone is the participant himself or herself. When mailing materials, a confidential form is used to protect personal information.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><sec><title>Primary outcome</title><p>Total score of the CAPS-DX at 3 months follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>1.

Discontinuation and dropout are estimated to be around 30% of the participants, indicating that 70 cases are needed. Thus, the desired number of participants in each group is 70, with a total of 140 cases. However, if this trial becomes difficult to continue due to finances, man-power, or physical factors, there is a possibility that the accumulation of cases will be stopped before the desired number is achieved.</p></sec><sec><title>Time periods of the study</title><p>Study period: December 2008 through December 2013</p><p>Enrollment period: December 2008 through June 2013</p><p>Follow-up period: December 2008 through December 2013</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>The present study protects the rights and welfare of participants in the spirit of ethical guidelines outlined under the Declaration of Helsinki.

Thus, hippocampal neurogenesis is emerging as a possible mediator of the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on fear memory. Modulating adult hippocampal neurogenesis by omega-3 fatty acid supplementation may well then be a good target for the prevention of PTSD. Intervention with omega-3 fatty acid appears acceptable in broad clinical practice because of its convenience, empirical results in animal studies, and much less serious side effects than any psychotherapeutic drugs.</p><p>The TPOP study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation for PTSD prevention among injured patients. The open trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] provided promising support for our hypothesis: omega-3 fatty acid supplementation significantly attenuated PTSD symptoms at 3 months as a primary outcome, as compared with the hypothetical mean. We believe the results of the TPOP will be of importance: accidental injury occurs across the globe and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, if found to be efficacious for preventing PTSD, could maintain the mental health of the injured.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BAQ: Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire; BDNF: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor; CAPS: Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale; CD-RISC: Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale; DHA: Docosahexaenoic acid; EPA: Eicosapentaenoic acid; FFQ: Food Frequency Questionnaire; HADS: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; ICU: Intensive care unit;IES-R: Impact of Event Scale-Revised; MADRS: Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale; MDD: Major depressive disorder; MINI: Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview; MVA: Motor vehicle accident;PTSD: Posttraumatic stress disorder; SF-36: The 36-item short form of the MOS Questionnaire; TPOP: Tachikawa Project for Prevention of PTSD with Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Dr. Matsuoka has received research support from the Japan Science and Technology Agency, CREST and the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare of Japan, an Intramural Research Grant for Neurological and Psychiatric Disorders from NCNP and lecture fees from Suntory Wellness Ltd, Eli Lilly Japan KK, and Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
