However, most patients with IBS seek medical care because of the abdominal pain.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> In addition, this kind of condition often significantly affect their quality of life.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup></p><p>The goal of the treatment for this condition is to relieve its symptoms. The therapies for patients with IBS in clinics mainly include the suggestions from doctor about the diet and lifestyle change, and medications. The diet and lifestyle change often consists of avoiding foods that trigger the symptoms, eating high-fiber foods, drinking plenty of fluids, exercising regularly, and getting enough sleep. Additionally, several specific medications are often used to treat such condition, such as alosetron, eluxadoline, rifaximin, lubiprostone, and linaclotide.</p><p>Current treatment for IBS include medication, stress relief, and eating habits changes for patients with IBS.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Although those therapies can relieve some symptoms of IBS, more effective and safe therapies are still looked for treating and relieving this kind of condition. Previous studies also reported to use antispasmodics to treat IBS.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> However, they often accompanied with lots of anticholenergic side effects, and restricted their use.</p><p>Drotaverine is an another kind of antispasmodic.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> It is reported that it has a good relaxing effect on intestinal smooth muscle.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> It has showed promising effect of abdominal pain relief without side effects like anticholinergics. Although several studies have explored the effect and safety of drotaverine hydrochloride (DHC) for treating IBS, no study specifically focused on Chinese patients with IBS treated by DHC only.</p><p>This study aimed to conduct a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of DHC for treating Chinese patients with IBS specifically.

A total of 144 patients were randomly allocated to the treatment group and the placebo group in a 1:1 allocation ratio.

However, patients were excluded if they were pregnancy or breast-feeding, history of fever, blood in stool, weight loss during the recent months, or other gastrointestinal tract diseases, and any other medication for the treatment of abdominal pain, and bowel disorders.</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Randomization and blinding</title><p>All eligible patients were randomly allocated to the treatment group or placebo group in a 1:1 ratio.

Of those symptoms, abdominal pain is 1 of the most common reasons for patients to visit doctors.<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup></p><p>Traditional therapies for IBS treatment include bulking agents, prokinetics, antispasmodics, alosetron, tegaserod, 5-hydroxytryptamine agonists and antagonists, smooth muscle relaxants, and antidepressants. However, most clinical trials of those drugs suffered from poor methodology and inconclusive findings.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> The lacking of randomized placebo-controlled trials for those therapies provides limited evidence for clinical practice.<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> In this study, we provide the strongest clinical evidence by utilizing the randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial on evaluating the efficacy and safety of DHC for treating Chinese population with IBS specifically. This study recommends that DHC can effectively enhance symptoms of IBS in Chinese population.</p><p>Previous studies have evaluated the efficacy of DHC for the treatment of IBS. They found that DHC plays an important role in enhancing symptoms of patients with IBS. Of them, 1 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of DHC in Indian patients with IBS.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> It included 180 patients with IBS and was allocated to DHC or placebo intervention. It found that DHC significantly improved abdominal symptoms in patients with IBS. The other study explored the efficacy of DHC in the Indian children population with recurrent abdominal pain.<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> Its results also found that DHC is an effective and safe pharmaceutical agent in the management of recurrent abdominal pain in children. However, no study specifically focused on Chinese patients with IBS treated by DHC only.</p><p>The results of this study confirmed our hypothesis that DHC has promising efficacy for the treatment of IBS in Chinese population, compared with the placebo. To our best knowledge, this study is the first randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to explore the efficacy of DHC for treating Chinese population with IBS specifically. Our findings showed the efficacy of DHC for Chinese patients with IBS.</p><p>In this study, the abdominal pain intensity, measured by the VAS scale, and stool frequency, and Bristol score reduced significantly in the treatment group, compared with those in the placebo group. However, no significant improvements in quality of life were found in the treatment group, when compared with the placebo group. Thus, DHC treatment appears to be promising for improving the symptoms of Chinese patients with IBS.</p><p>This study had several limitations. First, this study was only conducted at a single hospital with Chinese patients with IBS. Thus, it may be limited to the generalization to other hospitals and other population. Second, this study only conducted 4-week without follow-up evaluation because of its short duration. Therefore, the longer period of treatment and follow-up effect assessment of DHC on Chinese patients with IBS are still needed in the future.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study found that DHC can improve the symptoms of Chinese patients with IBS.
