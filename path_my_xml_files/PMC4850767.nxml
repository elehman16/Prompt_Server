To compare the efficacy and safety of risperidone and aripiprazole in the treatment of preschool children with disruptive behavior disorders comorbid with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Randomized clinical trial conducted in a university-affiliated child psychiatry clinic in southwest Iran. Forty 3-6-year-old children, diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder comorbid with ADHD, were randomized to an 8-week trial of treatment with risperidone or aripiprazole (20 patients in each group). Assessment was performed by Conners&#x02019; rating scale-revised and clinical global impressions scale, before treatment, and at weeks 2, 4, and 8 of treatment. The data were analyzed by SPSS version 16. Mean scores between the two groups were compared by analysis of variance and independent and paired <italic>t</italic>-test. Mean scores of Conners rating scales were not different between two groups in any steps of evaluation. Both groups had significantly reduced scores in week 2 of treatment (<italic>P</italic> = 0.00), with no significant change in subsequent measurements. Rates of improvement, mean increase in weight (<italic>P</italic> = 0.894), and mean change in fasting blood sugar (<italic>P</italic> = 0.671) were not significantly different between two groups. Mean serum prolactin showed a significant increase in risperidone group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.00). Both risperidone and aripiprazole were equally effective in reducing symptoms of ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder, and relatively safe, but high rates of side effects suggest the cautious use of these drugs in children.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Aripiprazole</kwd><kwd>attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder</kwd><kwd>oppositional defiant disorder</kwd><kwd>risperidone</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common developmental disorder in children which often continues into adulthood. It is the most common psychiatric disorder in children so that it constitutes about 50% of referrals to child psychiatry clinics.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The prevalence of ADHD in children is 5&#x02013;12% worldwide.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>ADHD has a high rate of comorbid psychiatric disorders. Half of clinical samples have disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs), consisting of oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Many longitudinal studies have followed children from early childhood to evaluate the impact of early DBDs. Such DBDs have been associated with adult smoking, alcohol and illicit drug use, physical aggression, and risky sexual behavior; repeated or serious crimes, and involvement in destructive offenses.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Therefore, evidence-based treatments to mitigate these problems in early childhood are clearly warranted.</p><p>Treatment of behavioral disorders at an early age may help to prevent long-term disability. The cornerstone of treatment for these disorders is behavioral therapy, but psychotherapy may not be enough. Furthermore, some patients do not respond to these interventions. Therefore, physicians in daily practice sometimes require pharmacological intervention in preschool children with chronic, disabling, or resistant behavioral problems.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Most psychiatric drugs are effective in ADHD.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Pharmacotherapy with atypical antipsychotics is increasing quickly in child and adolescent psychiatry, and this is especially the case for children with DBDs. For example, a study examining the prescription trend of atypical antipsychotics among 11,700 Arkansas Medicaid-covered children under age 18 who were newly treated with atypical antipsychotics from 2001 through 2005 found that the number of children receiving the medications doubled during this period. The most common condition was ADHD, followed by depression, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and adjustment reactions. Most new users were given an initial prescription for risperidone.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Risperidone is a safe and effective treatment for DBDs and ADHD in children.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Aripiprazole has a unique pharmacological profile, as a partial agonist at the dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1A receptors and an antagonist at the serotonin 5HT2A receptor; this drug has few side effects (such as extrapyramidal syndrome, hyperprolactinemia, weight gain, metabolic disorders, and sedation) which are common problems with other antipsychotic drugs. Efficacy and tolerability of aripiprazole in children and adolescents have been well-demonstrated in many clinical studies, which supported approvals granted by the US Food and Drug Administration for schizophrenia, bipolar diseases, and irritability associated with autistic disorder in children and adolescents.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] This study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of risperidone and aripiprazole in the treatment of preschool children with DBD comorbid with ADHD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was a randomized clinical trial conducted in the child psychiatry clinic affiliated with a university in Southwest Iran. Children 3&#x02013;6-year-old with oppositional defiant disorder comorbid with ADHD, according to the diagnostic criteria of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revision IV-Text Revised, were enrolled into the study. Children with mental retardation or other developmental disorders such as autism, chronic physical, or neurological illness, or those receiving other psychotropic drugs were excluded from the study. After the aims of the study were fully explained to the parents, they were asked to complete a consent form to participate in the study, whereas patient anonymity was preserved.</p><p>Treatment was initiated with 0.25 mg risperidone once daily, increased by 0.25 mg weekly, to a maximum dose of 2 mg/day,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] or 2.5 mg aripiprazole, increased by 2.5 mg weekly, to a maximum dose of 10 mg/day.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] For blinding, the patients were rated by a clinician who was blind to group assignment of the patients. At the beginning of the treatment, shortened and revised version of Conners parent rating scale, clinical global impressions (CGI) scale, body weight, fasting blood glucose (FBS), and serum prolactin were measured. Then at weeks 2, 4, and 8, CGI and Conners scale were readministered. Furthermore, weight, FBS, and prolactin were measured again at week 8. The instrument of data gathering was shortened and revised Conners parent rating scale, which contains 27 items in four subscales: Oppositional defiant, inattention, hyperactivity, and ADHD subscales. Reliability and validity of the Persian version of this questionnaire have been already confirmed.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>The data were analyzed by SPSS statistics software-IBM, and the mean score (standard deviation) of variables was calculated.

Some patients developed tolerance to the medication effects, which was more frequent in patients receiving risperidone. In a chart review study of 25 preschool-aged children treated with risperidone for DBDs, tolerance to risperidone was reported in 32% of the patients.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Severity of illness at the beginning of treatment, and at weeks 2, 4, and 8 showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups, which means that both medications were equally effective in these patients. 35% of the patients in aripiprazole group and 30% in risperidone group experienced significant clinical improvement at week 8 of treatment based on CGI-I scores. In this study, some parents refused to increase the dose of medication as prescribed, which may have affected the results. In the chart review study of 25 preschool-aged children treated with risperidone for DBDs, the majority of subjects (72%) showed &#x0201c;much&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;very much&#x0201d; improvement in target disruptive behavior symptoms, and the duration of risperidone treatment ranged from 2 to 60 weeks (18.87 &#x000b1; 15.19), which is longer than this study.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>In this study, there were no significant differences in weight gain and FBS level change between the two groups, but the increase in prolactin level in the group treated with risperidone was significantly higher than those treated with aripiprazole. No serious or life-threatening side effects were reported, and none of the patients experienced drug-induced extrapyramidal side effects.</p><p>Results of an 8-week study on bipolar children,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] 16-week study on patients with pervasive developmental disorders,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and a 6-month study along with placebo showed that risperidone at low dose effectively controls prolonged behavioral disorders in preschool-aged children.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] A retrospective study on children with aggressive behaviors associated with various diagnoses showed 36% decrease in symptoms after taking risperidone.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Results of these studies have shown obviously increased weight and increased prolactin levels in the patients taking risperidone.</p><p>In a 6-week, double-blinded study of 118 children with severely disruptive behaviors and subaverage intelligence, receiving 0.02&#x02013;0.06 mg/kg/day of risperidone or placebo, the risperidone group showed significantly greater improvement on the conduct problem scale from week 1 through the endpoint. The most common adverse effects were headache and somnolence. The extrapyramidal symptom profile of risperidone was comparable to that of placebo. Mean weight increases of 2.2 kg and 0.9 kg occurred in the risperidone and placebo groups, respectively.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>In an open-label study of eight normally developing preschool children with conduct disorder, treated with risperidone for 8 weeks, all patients were classified as &#x0201c;responders&#x0201d; (very much or much improved). Tolerability was good, and serious adverse effects were not observed. They detected statistically significant increase in prolactin level (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), but no clinical symptoms associated with prolactinemia.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>In another open-label study of risperidone monotherapy on 31 children and adolescents 4&#x02013;15 years of age with pediatric bipolar disorder and ADHD, results showed that improvement in ADHD symptoms was contingent on improvement in manic symptoms. Although both hyperactive/impulsive and inattentive ADHD symptoms were significantly improved with risperidone, improvement was modest, and only 29% of the participants showed a 30% reduction in ADHD scores and had a CGI-I of 1 or 2.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>In a study assessing risperidone introduction into stimulant for severe aggression in 168 6&#x02013;12-year-old children with ADHD, risperidone provided a moderate but variable improvement in aggressive and other seriously disruptive behaviors in children.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Results of a 6-week open study on 23 hyperactive children aged 8&#x02013;12 years old treated with aripiprazole, at a mean dose of 6.7 mg taken daily, showed significant improvement in symptoms and function. The most frequently reported adverse events were sedation (78.3%) and headache (47.8%).[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In a study on patients with Tourette's disorder and ADHD, the drug was well-tolerated, and none of the patients discontinued medication due to adverse events.
