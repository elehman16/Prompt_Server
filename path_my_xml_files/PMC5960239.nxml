In this secondary analysis, the main outcomes were time to and reasons for discontinuation of buprenorphine due to adverse events. Change in daytime activity as measured by actigraphy was a secondary outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 44 patients who received active buprenorphine 5 &#x000b5;g/hour, 52.3% (n=23) discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared to 13.3% (6 of 45) in the placebo group (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). Psychiatric and neurological adverse events were the most frequently reported causes of discontinuation (69.6%, n=16). Concomitant use of antidepressants significantly increased the risk of discontinuation (HR 23.2, 95% CI: 2.95&#x02013;182, <italic>p</italic>=0.003). Adjusted for age, sex, cognitive function, pain and depression at baseline, active buprenorphine was associated with 24.0 times increased risk of discontinuation (Cox model, 95% CI: 2.45&#x02013;235, <italic>p</italic>=0.006). Daytime activity dropped significantly during the second day of active treatment (&#x02212;21.4%, <italic>p</italic>=0.005) and decreased by 12.9% during the first week (<italic>p</italic>=0.053).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Active buprenorphine had significantly higher risk of discontinuation compared with placebo in people with advanced dementia and depression, mainly due to psychiatric and neurological adverse events. Daytime activity dropped significantly during the first week of treatment. Concomitant use of antidepressants further reduced the tolerability of buprenorphine.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>opioids</kwd><kwd>analgesics</kwd><kwd>dementia</kwd><kwd>drug safety</kwd><kwd>adverse drug reactions</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>More than 80% of elderly people in long-term residential care have dementia.<xref rid="b1-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Approximately 50% of these individuals suffer from pain of clinically significant intensity.<xref rid="b2-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Cognitive impairment leads to difficulty in verbally expressing painful symptoms and complicates the assessment and treatment of pain.<xref rid="b3-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> This may increase the risk of untreated chronic pain in people with dementia compared with cognitively intact patients.<xref rid="b4-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In the past few decades, systematic reviews have expressed concern that nursing home patients with dementia receive less analgesic treatment than those without dementia, despite comparable diagnoses of pain.<xref rid="b5-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Data from the entire population of Denmark in 2010 showed that 41% of the country&#x02019;s 42,291 nursing home patients used opioids, and that patients without dementia received significantly more opioid analgesics compared with those with dementia (43% and 38%, respectively).<xref rid="b7-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> A study including 425 patients from 12 nursing homes in Austria in 2011&#x02013;2012 found that despite having more pain, fewer cognitively impaired patients received scheduled analgesic prescriptions compared with patients without cognitive impairment (36% and 58%, respectively).<xref rid="b8-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Several studies have reported similar rates of analgesic use in nursing home patients with and without dementia,<xref rid="b9-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> with an overall increase in total analgesic use irrespective of cognitive state and a shift toward increased use of opioid analgesics.<xref rid="b9-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In Norway, the use of opioid analgesics in nursing home patients increased from 11% in 2000 to 24% in 2011, with a substantial increase in the use of strong opioids from 1.9% to 17.9%.<xref rid="b9-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In 2011, the odds ratio for the use of strong opioids in nursing home patients with dementia did not differ significantly compared with those without dementia.<xref rid="b9-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Buprenorphine transdermal system (TDS) has been recommended for elderly patients because of its favorable pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile, with low risk of serious adverse events.<xref rid="b11-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Buprenorphine, a strong opioid, is a partial mu receptor agonist and a kappa receptor antagonist.

Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that active treatment was associated with more persistent depressive symptoms, and 52% of patients who received active buprenorphine were withdrawn from the study due to adverse events during treatment.<xref rid="b39-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Few studies have assessed the tolerability and adverse effects of buprenorphine TDS in nursing home patients with dementia, and none with a placebo-controlled design. Furthermore, buprenorphine may have additive or synergistic interaction effects with other drugs that have sedative effects. Elderly patients and people with dementia are particularly vulnerable to adverse effects such as sedation, but interactions between opioids and other commonly prescribed psychotropic drugs such as antidepressants have not been studied in this population. Similarly, anticholinergic drugs may negatively impact cognition in people with dementia, but we do not know whether high anticholinergic drug burden is associated with poorer tolerability of buprenorphine. There is a need to investigate clinically significant interactions between opioids and anticholinergic and psychotropic drugs in people with dementia.</p><p>In these secondary analyses of our study, the primary aim was to assess the tolerability of buprenorphine TDS in nursing home patients with moderate to severe dementia, controlling for pain intensity, depressive symptoms, cognitive state, and concomitant use of psychotropic and anti-cholinergic drugs. Secondary aims were to assess which adverse effects most frequently caused discontinuation and to determine how daytime activity changed during the first week of treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design and population</title><p>The current study comprises secondary analyses of data collected in the randomized, placebo-controlled trial &#x0201c;Efficacy of analgesic treatment for depression in nursing home patients with dementia (DEP.PAIN.DEM),&#x0201d; which was conducted in 47 nursing homes in 10 municipalities of Norway, including people with dementia (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] &#x02264;20) and depression (Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia [CSDD] &#x02265;8; full inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-cia-13-935">Table 1</xref>). The intervention consisted of a stepwise increase in analgesic treatment, and patients who did not use scheduled analgesics at baseline or used acetaminophen &#x02264;1 g/day were prescribed acetaminophen in a total dose of 1 g three times daily. Patients who already used acetaminophen &#x0003e;1 g daily, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (except low-dose acetylsalicylic acid), or buprenorphine 5 &#x000b5;g/hour, or who had difficulty swallowing tablets, were prescribed buprenorphine TDS 5 &#x000b5;g/hour in addition to their regular treatment and randomized to receive active treatment or placebo for 13 weeks with no further dose adjustment.<xref rid="b39-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Patients who received buprenorphine/placebo TDS are included in the current analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Procedures</title><p>Clinicians were advised to keep doses of psychotropic and analgesic drugs unchanged during the study period, if possible. If lasting changes were made to regular analgesic treatment or antidepressants, the patient was withdrawn from the study. The study treatment was prescribed in addition to any regular or as-needed analgesics. In mild to moderate acute pain, patients were given as-needed analgesics in addition to study treatment, and the number of doses given during the study period was recorded. Patients with severe pain at baseline were excluded because it would be unethical to risk treating them with a placebo. We therefore ensured that the included patients would not suffer from prolonged or unnecessary untreated pain because of the study protocol. Furthermore, the physician who was responsible for the patient had full authority to discontinue study treatment promptly if clinical changes necessitated treatment with a known dose of active analgesic. Written informed consent was obtained from patients with medical decision-making capacity, or written presumed consent was obtained from a legally authorized representative in those with reduced capacity to consent in accordance with ethics committee requirements and current Norwegian legislation. The trial was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REC-West 2013/1474) and the Norwegian Medicines Agency (EudraCT 2013-002226-23), and registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT02267057).</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization and masking</title><p>The trial was double blinded, and participants were randomly allocated to each arm in a 1:1 ratio according to computer-generated random numbers in blocks of 12 with no stratification factors. Buprenorphine TDS and identical, inert placebo (Mundipharma Research Limited, Cambridge, UK) were packed and marked indiscernibly, identifiable only by pack number. Patients, nursing home staff, physicians, pharmacy, researchers, and statisticians were all masked to group identity until completion of the analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><p>Assessments were made by the researchers in collaboration with the nursing home staff and included scheduled assessments at baseline, 6 and 13 weeks in addition to any spontaneous reports during the whole 13-week period. The tolerability of buprenorphine TDS was operationalized by assessing how many patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events (defined as suspected adverse event, clinical deterioration, or death) and how long treatment lasted before such discontinuation. Discontinuation for other reasons, such as protocol violation, was not included in the analysis, and in the following, &#x0201c;discontinuation&#x0201d; refers only to those cases defined here as caused by adverse events. To ensure that all suspected adverse events were reported, the proxy rater received standardized detailed verbal and written information about known possible adverse effects of buprenorphine. They were instructed to pay attention to and report changes in any of the symptoms listed as potential adverse events, as well as any other clinical changes that occurred during treatment. If any clinical changes were observed during treatment, the raters were instructed to contact the researchers by phone immediately to report the symptoms. This information was distributed to other staff members, along with instructions to contact the researchers by phone immediately upon suspicion of any adverse event. In addition, the researchers asked specifically whether any adverse events were suspected at other contacts with the nursing home staff and during scheduled follow-up at 6 and 13 weeks of treatment. All suspected adverse events, irrespective of whether the patient discontinued treatment, were recorded verbatim as reported by nursing home staff, in as much detail as possible, including information about time from initiation to presenting symptoms and discontinuation of treatment.</p><p>Demographic information and a complete list of scheduled drug prescriptions (excluding prescriptions given <italic>pro re nata</italic>, ie, &#x0201c;as needed&#x0201d;) were extracted from the patients&#x02019; medical records at baseline. The total number of scheduled drug prescriptions was counted. Analgesic use was assessed by counting the number of prescriptions for drugs classified as systemic analgesics (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical [ATC] code N02 or M01A). In addition, the individual and total numbers of scheduled psychotropic drugs were counted (antidepressants [N06A], anti-dementia [N06D], antipsychotic [N05A], anxiolytic [N05B], hypnotic and sedative [N05C], and antiepileptic [N03A] drugs). The total anticholinergic cognitive burden (ACB) was calculated by assigning 1 point for each prescribed drug with mild anti-cholinergic properties, 2 points for each drug with moderate anticholinergic effects, and 3 points for each drug with strong anticholinergic properties.<xref rid="b19-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Between-group differences in drug use and morbidity at baseline were assessed by counting the number of prescriptions for drugs within each ATC group (A&#x02013;V).</p><p>Activity was assessed by actigraphy registration using the Philips Actiwatch Spectrum, which was worn on the patients&#x02019; dominant or mobile wrist continuously for 14 days (7 days before and 7 days after treatment was started).<xref rid="b21-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Total activity counts per day (Total AC) and mean intensity of activity per minute (AC/minute) for daily 12-hour intervals (09:00&#x02013;21:00) were extracted from the Respironics Actiware 6.0.9 software. Mean activity counts for Total AC and AC/minute were calculated for both 7-day periods in all patients with at least 5 valid days of actigraphy recording per week.</p><p>Cognitive function was assessed using the MMSE, a 30-item questionnaire administered directly to the patient covering 11 domains (registration, orientation to time and place, short-term recall, attention, calculation, long-term recall, naming, repetition, comprehension [verbal and written], writing, and visuospatial construction) to yield a sum score from 0 (most severe impairment) to 30 (no impairment).<xref rid="b23-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>Pain was assessed using the Mobilization-Observation-Behavior-Intensity-Dementia-2 Pain Scale (MOBID-2), a two-part staff-administered instrument to assess pain in people with advanced dementia.<xref rid="b25-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The proxy evaluation of inferred pain intensity is based on the patient&#x02019;s pain behaviors during standardized, guided movements of different body parts (Part 1), and pain behaviors that might be related to internal organs, head, and skin are recorded on an anatomical figure along with the inferred pain intensity for each region to allow monitoring over time (Part 2). The scale yields a final score from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable).

We used a Kaplan&#x02013;Meier survival plot and Cox regression models to determine whether patients who were randomized to receive active buprenorphine had a higher risk of discontinuation compared to those who received placebo. Cox regression analyses were repeated with age, sex, and MOBID-2, CSDD, and MMSE as covariates to determine which variables should be included in the adjusted analyses. To further assess whether the risk of discontinuation of active buprenorphine was modified by drug use, we tested the interaction between the treatment effect and each of the drug variables (total number of prescribed drugs, ACB score, total number of psychotropic drugs, and use of each class of psychotropic drugs [N06A, N06D, N05A, N05B, N05C, N03A]) on discontinuation, both unadjusted and adjusted for age, sex, and MOBID-2, CSDD, and/or MMSE at baseline if these covariates impacted discontinuation risk. We used cluster-robust variance estimates to account for dependence within nursing homes. To assess immediate changes in daytime activity during the early days of treatment, we used linear mixed-effects models for Total AC and AC/minute/day using the mean recording from the 7 days before treatment was initiated as baseline. Time was included as a categorical variable, with fixed effects for time, intervention, and their interaction in the models. The models were fitted with random intercepts for patients to account for correlation between longitudinal measurements, random slope for time, and residual error structure specified as independent by day.

In this model, age, sex, depressive symptoms, and pain were not significantly associated with discontinuation (age: HR 1.0, 95% CI: 0.99&#x02013;1.11, <italic>p</italic>=0.133; sex: HR 0.32, 95% CI: 0.10&#x02013;1.58, <italic>p</italic>=0.149; CSDD: HR 1.1, 95% CI: 0.90&#x02013;1.34, <italic>p</italic>=0.343; MOBID-2: HR 1.1, 95% CI: 0.91&#x02013;1.45, <italic>p</italic>=0.246).

However, patients who received active treatment and used antidepressants had 21.6 times increased risk of discontinuation compared with patients who used antidepressants and received placebo (95% CI: 2.75&#x02013;170, <italic>p</italic>=0.003; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t5-cia-13-935">Table 5</xref>).

In this model, active buprenorphine was not significantly associated with increased risk of discontinuation in patients who did not use antidepressants (HR 2.95, 95% CI: 0.53&#x02013;16.6, <italic>p</italic>=0.218), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-cia-13-935">Figure 3</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t5-cia-13-935">Table 5</xref>).

Nine of the 14 patients (64.3%) who received active treatment and used antidepressants reported adverse events and discontinued treatment.

Patients who used antidepressants and received active treatment had the highest risk of discontinuation; this suggests a clinically relevant interaction between antidepressants and buprenorphine in people with dementia. Buprenorphine significantly reduced daytime activity as measured by actigraphy on the second day of treatment compared with placebo, supporting reports from nursing home staff of increased sedation/somnolence as the most frequent adverse effect. The poor tolerability of buprenorphine TDS due to the high risk of neurological and psychiatric adverse events should be considered carefully by clinicians before prescribing to people with dementia, and particularly to patients who are also using antidepressants, which may further reduce tolerability. This study does not assess the efficacy of buprenorphine TDS for treating different types of pain in dementia, which should be addressed in future research.</p><p>In the active treatment group, 57% had reported adverse events. A recent meta-analysis of six randomized controlled studies (five were placebo controlled) found that 82% of elderly patients (&#x02265;65) had adverse events of buprenorphine TDS.<xref rid="b27-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The lower rate of reported adverse events in our study can most likely be attributed to our reliance on proxy observations of adverse events. Although self-report of symptoms is considered the gold standard, people with advanced dementia often have impaired ability to reliably report their symptom burden. For example, less than half of patients with MMSE &#x02264;6 are able to comprehend any assessment scale used to self-report painful symptoms.<xref rid="b28-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In our study, mean MMSE was 7 at baseline; therefore, many could not self-report adverse effects of buprenorphine TDS. Mild adverse effects of buprenorphine are subjective, they may not be easily observable, and subtle changes such as reduced appetite, confusion, or agitation could be misinterpreted as neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia which may not be attributed to study treatment by the proxy raters. Because people with communication difficulty due to advanced dementia cannot be expected to reliably self-report mild adverse events, the true prevalence of adverse events is likely to have been underestimated in our study due to observer bias. Therefore, this should be interpreted as a tolerability study presenting adverse events associated with discontinuation of treatment, rather than the absolute frequency of adverse events in people with dementia.</p><p>Although very frail patients with short life expectancy were not included in the trial, sudden clinical deterioration is difficult to predict and must be expected to occur during an extended follow-up period in nursing home patients with advanced dementia, regardless of exposure to a clinical intervention. The number of patients who were withdrawn from the study because of severe clinical deterioration with short life expectancy did not differ significantly between the active treatment and placebo groups, and our sample size and follow-up period were not designed to investigate whether buprenorphine use may be associated with increased mortality. Adverse events were registered on suspicion, based on detailed reports of clinical changes from nursing home staff. Even though we did not assess the likelihood of causality between the study treatment and each reported adverse event, we conclude that the difference in the total number of adverse events between active treatment and placebo can likely be attributed to adverse effects of buprenorphine.</p><p>Previous studies indicate that buprenorphine TDS is well tolerated in elderly patients, with studies reporting similar or lower rates of adverse events in healthy elderly patients compared with younger controls.<xref rid="b29-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b31-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> In elderly patients without dementia, the most common adverse events associated with discontinuation of buprenorphine treatment are gastrointestinal &#x02013; nausea (8.2%), vomiting (3.9%), and constipation (2.0%) &#x02013; followed by neurological symptoms &#x02013; dizziness (5.1%), somnolence (2.0%), and headache (2.0%).<xref rid="b27-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In our study, psychiatric and neurological adverse effects were frequent, reported in 16 of patients who discontinued treatment (36.4%). Four patients (9.1%) who discontinued treatment had gastrointestinal symptoms. This indicates that psychiatric adverse events of buprenorphine may occur more frequently in people with dementia compared with cognitively intact elderly patients. As buprenorphine has similar pharmacokinetic properties in elderly patients including those with renal impairment,<xref rid="b29-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b32-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> this reduced tolerability is most likely explained by pharmacodynamic changes in people with dementia.<xref rid="b33-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="b34-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>Buprenorphine TDS is absorbed slowly, and it reaches active concentration after ~24 hours and steady state during the first 72 hours in young healthy patients.<xref rid="b35-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Although pharmacokinetics have not been investigated in the very old and frail, buprenorphine TDS appears to be absorbed at a similar rate in people aged &#x02265;75 years compared to a younger control group.<xref rid="b29-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The largest drop in daytime activity observed in our study (recorded ~24&#x02013;36 hours after administration) may therefore correspond to the first systemic exposure to buprenorphine. While the reduction in daytime activity during the first week of active treatment was not statistically significant, this was probably due to low sample size.</p><p>Depression is associated with the use of antidepressants in nursing home patients with dementia.<xref rid="b17-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Because depression was an inclusion criterion, we may have selected patients who used more antidepressants relative to other psychotropic drugs. This may have enabled us to find a significant interaction between antidepressant use and buprenorphine discontinuation, while potential interactions between buprenorphine and other psychotropic drugs may have gone unnoticed. However, patients in the active treatment group generally used less psychotropic drugs compared with the placebo group and had a lower prevalence of antidepressant use (31.8%) than that expected from recent reports in people with dementia (~40%).<xref rid="b36-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="b37-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Thus, the observed interaction between antidepressants and buprenorphine is likely to be of clinical relevance. While we did not find significant interaction effects between other psychotropic drugs and active buprenorphine, this may be due to insufficient power rather than the absence of such effects.</p><p>As shown in two recent studies, the use of opioid analgesics in the oldest nursing home patients with dementia is increasing.<xref rid="b7-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b9-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Age is associated with increased pain, frailty, and dementia. In patients with severe pain, or very frail patients, it may be difficult to achieve full analgesic effect as the type or dose of analgesics required may not be tolerated by the patient. Because patients with dementia have not been included in safety studies, the evidence base to ensure appropriate prescribing is lacking. In the DEP.PAIN.DEM trial, neither did we find a significant change in pain intensity in either of the buprenorphine or placebo TDS groups during follow-up, nor did we find a significant treatment effect on pain between these groups.<xref rid="b39-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> However, this may be due to insufficient sample size as the DEP.PAIN.DEM trial was not powered to assess the effect of buprenorphine on pain. Further studies should investigate the efficacy and tolerability of buprenorphine and other opioid analgesics for pain in nursing home patients with dementia and painful symptoms. Use of opioids in people with dementia should be based on a careful risk&#x02013;benefit evaluation, including regular assessments of pain and potential adverse effects, in combination with nonpharmacological strategies as appropriate.<xref rid="b34-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>This study has limitations. The included patients had clinically significant depressive symptoms at baseline, but not all had pain. Therefore, our results may not be generalizable to patients who receive buprenorphine for pain. Prescribers may have had a lower threshold for discontinuation upon adverse events in this study, for instance, the risk&#x02013;benefit consideration may have been shifted toward a greater awareness of adverse events as the treatment was prescribed off-label. The patients&#x02019; level of vulnerability to adverse events, and the relative prevalence of different types of adverse events, may also be different in people with advanced dementia and severe pain as opposed to the current sample which consisted of people with advanced dementia and depression without severe pain. Similarly, the adverse effects of buprenorphine TDS may differ between subgroups of pain patients (neuropathic/nociceptive; acute/chronic pain). Since the focus of the DEP.PAIN.DEM trial was to investigate the efficacy of pain treatment on depression, we did not diagnose the type and duration of pain. Therefore, future studies should investigate the safety and efficacy of buprenorphine TDS in people with dementia and different types of pain. Patients who were prescribed buprenorphine rather than acetaminophen used more regular analgesics and/or had difficulty swallowing tablets. This means that we may have selected more frail/multimorbid patients to receive buprenorphine/placebo as opposed to acetaminophen/placebo in the DEP. PAIN.DEM trial. However, this prescribing strategy mirrors clinical practice with a stepwise increase from non-opioid to opioid analgesics and the choice of transdermal formulation for patients who cannot swallow tablets; therefore, our sample should be similar to nursing home patients with dementia who receive buprenorphine TDS. We included a mixture of opioid-na&#x000ef;ve patients, patients who had previously discontinued or received sporadic as-needed treatment with an opioid, and patients who received ongoing buprenorphine treatment; this is likely to have affected the observed pattern of adverse events which is not representative of an opioid-na&#x000ef;ve population. Despite randomization, we found that patients who received active treatment used significantly less psychotropic and anticholinergic drugs, and fewer used antidepressants. This could potentially influence the results, as these drugs are associated with adverse outcomes in people with dementia.<xref rid="b38-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> However, because these drugs were more prevalent in the control group, the high occurrence of adverse events in the active treatment group is likely caused by buprenorphine. We have not controlled for changes in concomitant drug use during study treatment. Physicians were instructed to avoid changes, particularly to psychotropic and analgesic drugs, but drug changes were not assessed in the 17 patients who discontinued treatment before week 6 assessment. The DEP.PAIN.DEM trial was designed with 90% power to detect a 2-point difference in depression (CSDD) from baseline to 13-week follow-up between active treatment (acetaminophen or buprenorphine) and placebo.<xref rid="b39-cia-13-935" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> For the secondary outcomes reported in the present study, no a priori power analyses have been conducted. This is an important limitation, and the findings from the current analyses should therefore be interpreted with caution, in particular for the subgroup analyses with lower sample sizes. Because the estimated effect sizes have very wide CIs, the exact magnitude of increased risk remains uncertain. However, we have identified significant between-group differences in reported adverse events and discontinuation risk. Although adverse events were assessed by proxy, and are therefore likely to be affected by observer bias, the placebo-controlled design provides strong evidence that the difference in adverse events is caused by the active drug rather than observer bias. Therefore, we find it important to share the presented results. Further studies are needed to provide evidence of the safety and efficacy of transdermal buprenorphine for different types of pain in people with dementia.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Buprenorphine appears to be poorly tolerated in people with dementia, with a higher prevalence of psychiatric adverse events compared with previous studies in cognitively intact elderly patients. Initiation of buprenorphine therapy is associated with reduced daytime activity. Although no dose adjustment is recommended for buprenorphine in elderly patients, our data suggest that people with dementia are susceptible to adverse events even at the lowest initial dose. When buprenorphine is administered to people with dementia, the patients&#x02019; general condition pre- and posttreatment should therefore be monitored carefully, including assessments of intended and adverse treatment effects, particularly in patients using antidepressants.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We wish to thank the patients, their relatives, and the nursing home staff for their willingness and motivation that made this work possible.
