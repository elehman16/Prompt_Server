stress and blood glucose levels in nursing students. [Subjects and Methods] The study was
a randomized controlled trial. Twenty-seven undergraduate nursing students were randomly
selected, with 12 assigned to an exercise group and 15 assigned to a control group. The
yogic exercises intervention was undertaken for 60 minutes one day a week for 12 weeks. It
consisted of physical exercise (surya namaskara) combined with relaxation and meditation
(shavasana and yoga nidra). Life stress was measured by the Life Stress Scale for College
Students, and postprandial blood glucose levels were measured with a digital glucometer.
[Results] The exercise group measurements were significantly decreased in both life stress
and postprandial blood glucose levels compared with the control group. [Conclusion] These
findings indicate that yogic exercises would reduce life stress and lower postprandial
blood glucose levels in nursing students.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Yogic exercise</kwd><kwd>Stress</kwd><kwd>Blood glucose</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stress is a multidimensional and universal phenomenon. Stress in nursing students is common
and is process oriented. Nursing students are constantly under various stressors such as
academic performance, isolation from the group, change in environment, change in food type,
irregular diet, clinical challenges, economic problems, future prospects, problems with the
value system of current society, self-expectations, and expectations from family and peers
etc<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. If
these stressors are not managed properly, they can have negative effects on the physical and
psychological health of nursing students<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Furthermore, these problems can cause academic failure and/or limited growth as a valuable
employee<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, it is necessary to put in
place various activities and behaviors to prevent and reduce life stress in nursing
students<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>All these stressors have adverse effects on the autonomic nervous system, pineal and
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis that interrupt the healthy operation of the homeostatic
mechanisms of the body<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. This has damaging
effects on various parameters of the body, and one of the common parameters is blood
glucose<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is observed that stress
increases both short-term and long-term blood glucose levels, and if it increases one or
both of them beyond the normal limits, stress can cause persistent high blood glucose
levels, resulting in diabetes mellitus<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There are various ways to reduce stress, and one of them is yoga. Yoga, which integrates
various postures, breathing exercises, and meditation, is beneficial in reducing stress. The
mechanisms by which yoga influences well-being are likely complex biochemical and
physiological mechanisms consisting of reduced sympathetic nervous tone, activation of
antagonistic neuromuscular systems, and stimulation of the limbic system<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, yoga has been reported to lower
levels of sympathetic hormones. That is to say, breathing exercises during yoga practice
reduce sympathetic tone, increases parasympathetic activity, and help to reduce stress in
yoga practictioners<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Meditation also
brings about a hypometabolic state and reduces stress induced by sympathetic
overactivity<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Also, yogic exercise has a direct influence on pancreatic secretion by rejuvenation of the
pancreatic cells through alternate abdominal contractions and relaxation<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, and yogic exercise reduces blood glucose levels due to muscular
exercise and relaxation<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The dynamic stretching of the body during yoga asanas is
postulated to rejuvenate pancreatic cells, increase insulin secretion, and hence correct the
impaired insulin secretion in chronic diabetes<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Ultimately, yoga practice has been proven to affect mental balance
of an individual by allying apprehension and stress and bringing about hormonal balance and
feelings of well-being<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In previous studies, researchers have indicated that yoga intervention played an effective
role in decreasing stress and improving general well-being in medical students<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In spite of its known positive effects on physical and psychological variables, no studies
have been conducted with yogic programs to manage nursing students&#x02019; life stress. Hence, the
purpose of this randomized controlled trial study was to evaluate the effect of yogic
exercises on life stress and biochemical markers of stress such as blood glucose levels in
nursing students.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was a randomized controlled trial. The subjects of this study were 27 healthy
female undergraduate nursing students aged 20&#x02013;23 years with no medical diseases, no history
of drug abuse, and no experience with yoga exercise. Participants having a family history of
diabetes mellitus were excluded from the study. The participants were recruited by using our
nursing department&#x02019;s Internet homepage. The subjects were all volunteer nursing students.
All participants received detailed information on the purpose and usefulness of this study
and were provided a written consent form. After the participants signed the informed consent
form, they were randomly assigned by a random permuted block design using a random number
table, to 1 of 2 groups, either the yoga exercise (n=15) or control group (n=15).
Twenty-seven subjects completed the entire study, 12 in the yoga exercise group and 15 in
the control group. Three subjects dropped out of the study before completing the posttest
due to personal reasons. The institutional review board of Kangwon National University
approved this study. Demographic information, Life Stress Scale, and postprandial blood
glucose levels were measured as pretest data. The Life Stress Scale and postprandial blood
glucose levels were also measured as posttest data.</p><p>Life Stress was measured by the Life Stress Scale for College Students<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. This instrument consisted of 50 items scored using a
4-point Likert scale (0=never, 3=very often) measuring sources of life stress in 8
subscales-economy, lover, faculty, family, the future, values, grades, and friends. A higher
score indicates a higher level of perceived stress. In this study, the internal consistency
(Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha) of the Life Stress Scale was 0.93.</p><p>After completing Life Stress Scale surveys, postprandial blood glucose levels were measured
as a stress-related biomarker. Measurements were taken from the participants both before
commencement of the study and also after the yogic intervention was over. Postprandial blood
glucose levels were measured with a digital glucometer (Accu-Chek. Sr. no-CN55303545723,
Roche Diagnosis, Indianapolis, IN, USA).</p><p>Yogic exercises were conducted for about one hour, once a week for 12 weeks. The yoga
instructor was certificated by Bihar Yoga Bharati in India. The yogic exercises were done in
the Department of Nursing. Cyclic form yoga exercises were chosen because of the
availability of scientific studies on this type of yoga<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cyclic yoga exercises
refers to surya namaskara and yoga nidra. Surya namaskara translates as &#x0201c;sun salutations,&#x0201d;
and this type of yoga is composed of 12 postures and breathing exercises. Also yoga nidra,
which means &#x0201c;psychic sleep,&#x0201d; is a specific yogic relaxation and meditation practice<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The cyclic yoga performed in this study

in the shavasana pose. It has several steps, such as resolve, rotation of consciousness,
awareness of the breath, feeling and sensation, visualization, and ending the practice with
resolve.</p><p>Statistical analyses were conducted using the SAS program (version 9.1) for Windows. All

were significantly decreased compared with those before starting yoga practice.
Additionally, nursing students in the yoga exercise group had a significant decrease in
their stress levels over this 12-week period, while those in the control group had an
increase in their stress levels. These findings are similar to the findings of Simard and
Henry, who found that Perceived Stress Scale levels significantly decreased from baseline to
mid-term, an improvement that persisted to the end of the intervention<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. They assessed the impact of a short yoga intervention on
female medical students&#x02019; health for a 16-week period. They also pointed out that a yoga
intervention may be effective in decreasing stress and improving general well-being in
medical students. Besides, the findings of Beets &#x00026; Mitchell indicated that despite short
yoga program exposure, acute changes in mental health indicators such as stress were
observed<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Similarly, the findings of
Yoshihara et al. suggested that yoga can improve mental health status and has implications
for the prevention of psychosomatic symptoms in healthy women<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, Sharma systematically reviewed 17 articles related to
yoga for stress management<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. As a result,
they reported that of the 17 studies, 12 demonstrated positive changes in psychological or
physiological outcomes related to stress. Like the previous studies, the present study also
supports the paradigm that yoga exercise can have beneficial effects in reducing
psychological problems such as stress in nursing students.</p><p>Of the Life Stress subscales in this study, the grades subscale had the highest score. This
result is inconsistent with the concept that academic factors are a greater perceived cause
of stress in nursing students<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Over the past 2
decades, many forms of intervention have been suggested to help nursing students with their
stress. Most recently, one researcher recommended biofeedback, humor, peer instructors,
mentors, and mindfulness training interventions for stress centered around academic
challenges in nursing students<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, no recent studies have been conducted with a new
generation of yoga exercises to help reduce nursing students&#x02019; stress. Ultimately, these
findings suggest that the nursing students in the yoga exercise group were able to control
the same level of stress over the 12-week period even though they experienced more stressors
and demands from their academic conditions. It is very important for nurse educators to help
nursing students manage their stress in order to prevent additional problems.</p><p>In the present study, the postprandial blood glucose level was measured as a biochemical
indicator of stress. Fasting blood sugar levels could not be checked because of the time of
the yoga class as the participants&#x02019; personal situations. The yoga class started at 5 PM
every Thursday.</p><p>After practicing yoga for 12 weeks, postprandial blood glucose levels were significantly
decreased in the yoga group. This finding is similar to that of Shende et al., who found
that both fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels were significantly improved in the
yoga group, whereas there was no significant improvement in the postprandial blood glucose
levels in their control group not practicing yoga pranayama<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. They assessed the effect of pranayama on the blood glucose level of
60 medical students and found that a short-term intervention of yogic exercise helps in
reducing the stress in medical students, which is reflected by improvement in both fasting
and postprandial blood glucose levels. They also emphasized that the beneficial effects of
yoga on fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels are well documented. As stated, most
of these studies have been done on patients with known diseases. However, there is very
little data available on the effect of yoga exercise composed of surya namaskara (which
means sun salutations) and yoga nidra (which means psychic sleep) on the blood glucose
levels in healthy subjects. The findings of the present study also support those of Jensen,
Stevens, and Kenny, who stated that yoga nidra is related to psycho-neuro-physiological
parameters<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Numerous studies have
shown yoga to have an immediate downregulating effect on both the pineal and
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis responses to stress<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The performance of asana
led to increased sensitivity of the B cells of the pancreas to the glucose signal. It also
increased the sensitivity of the progressive long-term effect of asanas. Therefore, it was
also found that brief yoga-based relaxation training normalizes the functions of the
autonomic nervous system<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. As shown in
previous studies, the findings of the present study suggest that yogic exercises can improve
stress and stress biomarkers in nursing students. However, follow-up studies will be needed
to evaluate the effect on biochemical parameters of stress such as cortisol and blood
glucose in nursing students. To my knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the
effect of yoga exercise on the blood glucose level of healthy nursing students.</p><p>The present study has some limitations. Use of only female subjects meant that we could not
make comparisons between males and females. The participants were not on a strict and
uniform diet plan, and this may have influenced the study results. Despite these
limitations, these findings suggest that cyclic yoga exercise can improve not only the score
of Life Stress, but also the postprandial blood glucose level in nursing students.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>HJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>EJ</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Meditation effects of self-efficacy between academic
