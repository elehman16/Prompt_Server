Furthermore, an event was considered a relapse if symptoms were accompanied by neurologic changes consistent with a &#x02265;0.5-point increase in the EDSS score compared with the previous evaluation, if &#x02265;2 of the 7 functional system assessments yielded an increase of 1 grade in scoring, or a 2-grade score increase in a single functional system assessment.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Secondary end points included the number of new or newly enlarging T2 lesions, number of GdE T1 lesions, and percent brain volume change. Exploratory end points included the time to first relapse, proportion of relapse-free patients, number of severe confirmed relapses, and time to 6-month confirmed disability progression. Safety was assessed by the incidence of AEs and serious AEs, changes in vital signs, clinical laboratory parameters, and ECG findings over time.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="s1-4"><title>Post hoc statistical analyses.</title><sec id="s1-4-1"><title>Calculating accumulating ARR.</title><p>As a descriptive measure, the ARR can be calculated as the number of confirmed relapses divided by the annual exposure to the drug, i.e., the number of relapses in the population divided by the number of years of exposure. ARR, it should be noted, can be calculated at any time point in the study. To calculate the accumulating ARR for the present analysis, the relapse data were censored at each study day and the statistic was estimated. The accumulating ARR at a given study day for a treatment group is therefore calculated as the total number of relapses that occurred in that group on or prior to the study day of interest divided by the corresponding number of patient-years of exposure up to the study day. The accumulating ARR at the last study day is therefore equivalent to the typical ARR presented as the primary study end point. The resulting statistics calculated at each study day provide a description of the estimated relapse rate over time and more specific insights into the timing of efficacy on relapses.</p></sec><sec id="s1-4-2"><title>Additional analytic methods.</title><p>The percentage of patients experiencing confirmed relapses was calculated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Reductions in the numbers of GdE T1 and new or newly enlarging T2 lesions were analyzed separately at months 6 and 12 using a negative-binomial model.

Thus, a significant treatment effect of MRI disease activity was observed by month 6, with the full treatment effect of GA40 observed at the end of the study.</p><fig id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>MRI lesion activity in the GALA study</title><p>GA40 = glatiramer acetate 40 mg/mL 3-times-weekly SC injection; GdE = gadolinium enhancing; SE = standard error.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="NEURIMMINFL2016010868FF4"/></fig></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This post hoc analysis of data from the phase III GALA clinical trial demonstrates that, compared with placebo, GA40 treatment in patients with RRMS provided notable improvements in accumulating ARR and lengthening of time to first relapse within 2 months of treatment initiation. MRI outcomes were observed to be significantly different between GA40-treated and placebo-treated patients at the 6-month time point, which was the first MRI conducted after baseline in the GALA study. The relevance of establishing the time to efficacy onset of a DMT in MS derives from the importance of early intervention and the need for rapid therapeutic efficacy in minimizing MRI disease activity and the frequency of relapses.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p>ARR is the most common method for reporting relapse end points in RRMS trials, in part due to its ease of quantification&#x02014;and thus transparency&#x02014;and also because of the explicit benefit to patients of a reduction in relapses.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> However, ARR values are derived from a cumulative relapse count over the course of a trial and therefore obscure time-dependent effects that may be relevant. By contrast, the use of the accumulating ARR end point in this analysis has the specific advantage of displaying the time course of ARR over the length of the entire GALA trial. The rationale for the present analysis was to establish a clear picture of the time to efficacy onset for GA using data from a controlled clinical trial. In addition, ascertaining temporal aspects of relapse-related efficacy allows for a qualitative comparison with additional pharmacologic effects over time, such as the accumulation of MRI lesions. The accumulating ARR metric will be useful to analyze the time course of efficacy on relapses in future MS clinical trials with a relapse end point.</p><p>The results reported herein show that GA40 has a relatively rapid time to efficacy onset in patients with RRMS, with potential implications for disease management and both short- and long-term clinical and MRI outcomes. The key limitation of this study is the post hoc nature of the analysis because calculating the accumulating ARR and analyzing MRI separately at the 6- and 12-month time points were not the stated end points in the GALA study.</p><p>While the efficacy and safety profiles of GA20 and GA40 have been extensively studied, the question of the time to efficacy onset has been much less explored. Prior to this analysis, the only previous study that evaluated the time to efficacy onset in GA treatment of patients with RRMS was the 9003 European/Canadian study of GA20, which was specifically designed to evaluate MRI at frequent intervals, with scans being performed every month during the 9-month placebo-controlled phase of the study.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Although the 9003 study was conducted well before the development of the GA40 formulation, it offers the best data source for a comparison with the results of our analysis of the time to efficacy onset in the GALA study. Of course, direct comparisons of 2 separate studies must be approached with caution, and no definitive conclusions based on such a comparison are entirely reliable. Nevertheless, the GALA and 9003 studies had similar designs and patient eligibility criteria.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> MRI lesion activity among patients receiving daily GA20 or placebo in the 9003 study showed separation between the 2 groups by month 2: the mean number of total enhancing lesions at month 2 was 19.4% lower in the GA20-treated group compared with the placebo-treated group. By month 6, a significant difference had been achieved, with 35.9% fewer enhancing lesions in the GA20 group (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). The differences were even greater at month 8 (49.7%, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and month 9 (40.1%, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.02).<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Taken together, these results parallel those seen in our analysis of the GALA data. Although approximately 36% less lesion activity was observed among GA20-treated patients in the 9003 study at month 6, the number of GdE T1 lesions was reduced by 38% after 6 months in the GALA study, whereas new and newly enlarging T2 lesions were reduced by approximately 24% among those treated with GA40; these differences were, in all cases, statistically significant in favor of GA therapy. In addition, results after 9 months of GA20 treatment in the 9003 study (which, of course, are not directly comparable with 6-month data) show the number of T1 lesions to have been reduced by 35%, while new T2 lesions (not including enlarging T2 lesions) were reduced by 30%, differences that were statistically significant in both cases.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>This post hoc analysis of results from the GALA study shows an improvement with regard to the development of new or newly enlarging lesions as detected by MRI in patients treated with GA40 compared with those receiving placebo; this improvement occurred early, within 2 months of the start of treatment, and was generally sustained throughout the trial. With regard to occurrence of relapses in RRMS, the use of the accumulating ARR metric provides clinically meaningful insight into the time course of the efficacy of GA. The efficacy of GA40 in reducing numbers of MRI inflammatory lesions occurred by 6 months in the GALA study, an effect similar to that previously seen in the 9003 study of GA20. These results indicate that GA40 contributes to early efficacy in RRMS through the reduction of inflammatory lesions and relapses.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>The authors thank the patients and site personnel involved with this study; and Peter Feldman, PhD (Teva Pharmaceutical Industries) and Rhonda Charles, PhD (Chameleon Communications International with funding from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries) for editorial assistance in the preparation of this article.</p></ack><sec sec-type="contributions"><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p content-type="contributions">Mat D.
