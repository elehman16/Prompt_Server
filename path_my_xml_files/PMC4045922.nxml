Conservative treatments cannot reduce the symptomatic severity satisfactorily; therefore, effectiveness of <italic>Linum usitatissimum</italic> L. (linseed) oil on carpal tunnel syndrome, as a complementary treatment, was evaluated in the current study. Linseed oil is a well-known preparation in Iranian traditional medicine and its analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects have been shown in previous studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted. One hundred patients (155 hands) with idiopathic mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome aged between 18 and 65&#x000a0;years old were randomized in two parallel groups. These two groups were treated during 4&#x000a0;weeks with topical placebo and linseed oil. In addition, a night wrist splint was prescribed for both groups. Symptomatic severity and functional status were measured using Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire. In addition, median sensory nerve conduction velocity, motor distal latency, sensory distal latency and compound latency as electrodiagnostic parameters were measured at baseline and after the intervention period.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After the intervention, significant improvement was observed regarding Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire symptomatic severity and functional status mean differences (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c;0.001) in the linseed oil group compared with those in the placebo group. Also, regarding the mean differences of both groups, significant improvement of nerve conduction velocity of the median nerve was seen in the linseed oil group by a value of 2.38&#x000a0;m/sec (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). However, motor distal latency and sensory distal latency of the median nerve showed no between-group significant changes (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.14 for both items). Finally, compound latency was improved slightly in the case group, comparing mean differences between the groups (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c;0.05). No significant adverse events were reported from using linseed oil.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>It seems that linseed oil could be effective in the management of mild and moderate carpal tunnel syndrome, especially in improving the severity of symptoms and functional status.

Various treatment options, as surgical and non-surgical, have been suggested for CTS. Surgery is usually considered for patients with an experience of conservative treatment failure and those who have severe CTS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], while non-surgical treatments are usually prescribed as an initial option for the patients who do not have any evidence of denervation in electromyography, cannot undergo surgery, or suffer from non-constant symptoms of mild to moderate CTS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Standard non-surgical treatments vary from exercise and activity modification to wrist splinting (as the most frequently reported treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]), use of oral medications like NSAIDs and corticosteroids, and even locally injected steroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, conservative treatments cannot reduce symptomatic severity satisfactorily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]; therefore, new conservative treatments are needed to be evaluated in randomized controlled trials.</p><p>Nowadays, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is welcomed by general population, governments and World Health Organization. Easy accessibility, lower costs and origination of them from nature are the main causes of this worldwide popularity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Therefore, CAM treatments can play an important role as new conservative treatments for CTS.</p><p><italic>Linum usitatissimum</italic> L. (from the family Linaceae), commonly known as flax or linseed, is a herb that is native to Europe, Asia and Mediterranean regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Linseed oil or flaxseed oil is obtained from its dried ripe seeds. In addition to edible uses of this oil, it is known as an anti-inflammatory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] antioxidant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and analgesic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] oil. Therefore, due to the mentioned beneficial properties, it is used in several studies on a variety of subjects such as arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], dermatologic complaints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and even keratoconjunctivitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The topical use of linseed oil has been approved for a variety of skin disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. For instance, the Brazilian national pharmacopoeia has approved its topical administration in cases with pruritus, and in patients of burn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In addition, some studies examined the topical usage of this compound in animal model of skin wound healing, and in the prevention of peri-ileostomy skin excoriation. No toxicity was reported in such studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Linseed oil could play an anti-inflammatory role when used by different routes of administration in animal models. In fact, its inhibition on prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>, leukotriene B<sub>4</sub>, histamine and bradykinin can make it a potent anti-inflammatory agent against distinct phases of inflammation, comparable with standard aspirin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In addition, it seems that analgesic activity of linseed oil is peripherally mediated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Analgesic activity of linseed oil may be due to a combination of its inhibitory effect of prostaglandin, histamine, bradykinin and acetylcholine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>In addition, linseed oil is a well-known and frequently-used medicine in Iranian traditional medicine (ITM). According to the most famous and reliable ITM books, i.e. Avicenna&#x02019;s Canon of Medicine and Liber Continens of Rhazes, linseed oil can be used as an analgesic and anti-fibrosis drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, according to ITM concepts and some unpublished experiences by experts about potential effect of linseed oil on CTS and also supporting data about some properties of linseed oil (e.g. analgesic, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory), we hypothesized its possible effect for CTS. Therefore, the current study aimed to assess the effectiveness of topical flaxseed oil in patients with mild and moderate CTS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The study was designed as a two-arm, randomized, placebo-controlled, double- blind clinical trial using a parallel design.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>The study protocol was in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki (1989 revision) and approved by the Local Medical Ethics Committee of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (SUMS) with reference number: CT-92-6709.

Median distal motor latency was measured by a bipolar stimulating electrode at the wrist and a bipolar surface-recording located on the abductor pollicis brevis muscle (8&#x000a0;cm from stimulus electrodes at the wrist). Antidromic sensory nerve action potentials evoked at the wrist were recorded from the middle finger. Standard distances (7&#x000a0;cm from recorder, at mid palm and 14&#x000a0;cm from recorder at wrist) were kept between the stimulator and recorder electrodes. For recording the compound nerve action potential, stimulation at mid palm and recording at wrist (7&#x000a0;cm apart) was performed. In addition, using a concentric needle electrode, electromyography was performed on the abductor pollicis brevis muscle. We defined denervation as sustained, abnormal spontaneous activity. This ranged from 0 to 4+, in the form of positive waves or fibrillations. The skin temperature during all of the electrodiagnostic studies was at least 31&#x000b0;C and all of the assessments were carried out in a similar constant room temperature between 23&#x000b0;C and 25&#x000b0;C. In addition, due to the possibility of diurnal variation in clinical and electrophysiologic assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], all of the patients were assessed at the follow up visit at a similar time of the day as the first session. In addition, the patients were assessed on their visits by the same authors (K.H and A.A) who performed clinical examinations and electrodiagnostic assessments and were blinded about each patient&#x02019;s allocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><sec><title>Splint</title><p>All of the patients were prescribed to use the wrist splint during the study period. In fact, the test drug and placebo were added to this standard treatment. The wrist splint prescription was night-only because of symptoms usually worsening at night, in addition to obtaining a higher compliance, considering the patient&#x02019;s concern about splint&#x02019;s interference with his/her daily activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Placebo and test drug</title><p>Both of the drug and placebo were prescribed to be used in the morning and evening time for a period of 4&#x000a0;weeks, 5 drops per use, topically on the palmar wrist territory.

The BCTQ assesses symptom severity score (BCTQ SYMPT) and functional status score (BCTQ FUNCT). These scores are evaluated by an eleven-item scale and an eight-item scale, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The items of each scale consist of multiple-choice responses from 1 (as the mildest) to 5 (as the most severe). The BCTQ SYMPT and FUNCT are calculated as the mean of the scores for the individual items.</p><p>We used the Persian version of BCTQ that was validated previously, showing to have a reasonable reliability, sensitivity and internal consistency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Secondary outcome measures were median nerve sensory distal latency (SDL), sensory nerve conduction velocity (NCV), motor distal latency (MDL) and compound latency (CL).</p><p>At the beginning of the enrollment and after 4&#x000a0;weeks of intervention, the data related to both primary and secondary outcome measures were obtained and recorded on the patient&#x02019;s data form.

However, this herbal preparation has an ancient history of administration for different disorders, dating back to more than 10 centuries ago in ITM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Linseed oil is a rich source of &#x003b1;&#x02012;linolenic acid that has been proved to possess noticeable anti-inflammatory activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In addition, further studies have confirmed its anti-inflammatory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], antioxidant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and analgesic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] properties.</p><p>Different mechanisms for its anti-inflammatory effects are explained. The linseed oil inhibits prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>, leukotriene B<sub>4</sub>, histamine and bradykinin-induced inflammation. The oil also inhibits arachidonic acid-induced inflammation. It shows inhibition of both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways of arachidonate metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Similar to other multiple herbal formulations, anesthetic properties of topical use of linseed is also shown in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. According to the important role of inflammatory and oxidative processes in the pathophysiology of CTS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], its significant effect on improving symptomatic and functional status of our patients, and slightly but statistically significant improving effect on NCV and CL can be explained partially.</p><p>Although no previous study on the efficacy of linseed oil on CTS was found, some studies evaluated other herbal preparations in the management of CTS. In a study by Zhang et al. on the efficacy of Chinese herbal therapy on CTS comparing with two other groups, 22 patients who received this therapy had a superior benefit on their visual analogue scale (VAS) score than the splint group and no significant changes of electromyography was shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Our results are in compliance with symptomatic relief of their patients with a common aspect about the presence of oleic and linoleic acid in some of these used herbs. However, this study was not blind and had a small sample size. Furthermore, they did not assess the effects of a specific herb with determined constituents and they used an uncommon drug delivery system (steaming and washing). Also, Branco et al. published an open protocol study in which CTS patients, who experienced standard treatments failure, were treated by a two-stage protocol. They were treated primarily with a specific laser acupuncture and microamps transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and secondarily with herbal formulas and supplements in a case-by-case manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Similar to our trial, this small size study (only 36 patients) showed a significant effect on symptomatic improvement (91.6%). However, the complexity of their management can result in practical difficulties during usage.</p><p>Another notable study, which was conducted by Eftekharsadat et al. on two groups of 30 patients, evaluated the efficacy of topical <italic>Eremostachys laciniata</italic> on CTS. This medicinal herb has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, like linseed oil. They showed significant improvement on palmar prehension and VAS of pain, compared with placebo. However, this plant had a local popularity, and no significant effect on electrodiagnostic criterion was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>There is also a case-series carried out by Jung et al. that assessed the usefulness of Jackyakamcho-tang on muscle spasm and pain on 81 patients complaining about these symptoms. The usefulness was reported as 72.8% for treating CTS (where only 11 CTS patients had been included). But, unlike the safety of linseed oil, they reported adverse effects in 11.1% of the total patients, 3.7% of which were severe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>In regard of the topical treatment for CTS, few studies were found. Of those, Jazayeri et al. published a clinical trial evaluating EMLA cream which had some beneficial effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. However, this trial was not blind and EMLA cream was not as cheap and available as linseed oil.</p><p>According to ITM, patient&#x02019;s temperament can affect some herbal medicine effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Therefore, as a minor assessment we evaluated the participant&#x02019;s temperament. However, no relationship was found between the participant&#x02019;s temperament and outcome measures. It could be explained in some ways. The used questionnaire was not designed for our target population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and the drug effects are possibly independent of the patient&#x02019;s temperament.</p><p>Linseed oil has some important advantages as feasibility of use as a topical drug and no disturbance of ordinary daily activities (comparable with treatments such as wrist splint), conservative and noninvasive nature (regarding some invasive options such as surgery), price of the oil (1 $ for a 40&#x000a0;cc bottle that is adequate for a one month use), worldwide availability, and its acceptable and significant effects, especially on symptomatic and functional status and even on some electrodiagnostic parameters.</p><sec><title>Study limitations</title><p>Here we should highlight some limitations that we have faced with in this trial. First, insufficient number of male participants (only about 10.5% of our patients), which can affect the generalizability of our findings. In fact, according to previous epidemiologic studies, about 30% of CTS encounters were attributable to males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Indeed, this is a common problem in several trials on CTS, even with male samples as small as 0-10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>Second, as regards to reliable and valid assessment by BCTQ about subjective functional status of patients, objective functional outcome measures such as dynamometer findings could offer more reliable results.</p><p>The other important issue is to determine the transdermal penetration of the linseed oil. In this respect, the measurement of transdermal permeation of the oil and its consequent absorption into the systemic circulation can be the subject of the future studies.</p><p>And finally, the short term follow-up is another limitation. However, this is partially related to our aim as evaluation of efficacy and safety of topical linseed oil as a new complementary treatment for the management of CTS. It is also considerable that herbal medicaments might show delayed pharmacological activity. Thus, long term assessment possibly leads to better results. On the other side, unwanted effects may also be revealed in long term evaluation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>It seems that linseed oil could be effective as an adjunctive therapy in the management of mild and moderate CTS, especially in improving the severity of symptoms and functional status. In addition, its effect on electerodiagnostic parameters, especially on NCV, can be considered as a valuable point.</p><p>It is, therefore, suggested that further trials of longer follow-up and larger sample size, including appropriate male/female ratio and objective functional status outcome measures are needed to confirm the value of linseed oil as a good choice for CTS and for evaluation of the involved mechanisms. Moreover, other easily applicable pharmaceutical dosage forms (such as ointment, cream, gel and patch form) can be considered in future studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CTS: Carpal tunnel syndrome; ITM: Iranian traditional medicine; BCTQ: Boston carpal tunnel questionnaire; NCV: Nerve conduction velocity; MDL: Motor distal latency; SDL: Sensory distal latency; CL: Compound latency; CAM: Complementary and alternative medicine; BMI: Body mass index; SUMS: Shiraz University of Medical Sciences; GC: Gas chromatography; SYMPT: Symptom severity; FUNCT: Functional status; SD: Standard deviation; VAS: Visual analogue scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>MHH has made substantial contributions in conception, designing, acquisition of data and drafted the manuscript.
