The patients were all candidates for treatment with an epirubicin-based chemotherapy regimen (maximal cumulative dose 400 &#x000b1; 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) according to the international standardized protocols for breast cancer.</p><p>At enrollment before randomization, all patients underwent echocardiographic analysis, a 12-lead electrocardiogram, and blood pressure measurement. The inclusion criteria were age between 18 and 68 years, and an echocardiographic left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) value &#x02265;50%. Patients were not eligible if they had a history of coronary heart disease, hypertension, or diabetes mellitus, and/or had been previously treated with chest irradiation. Our study was approved by the ethics committee of the Jiangyin People&#x02019;s Hospital, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects.</p><p>In all subjects, blood samples were collected for the assessment of serum concentrations of ROS. The echocardiography and laboratory variables were assessed at baseline (t0) and 7 days after reaching an epirubicin dose of 100, 200, 300, and 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (t1, t2, t3, and t4, respectively). Both the subjects and the echocardiographic technicians were blinded to the treatment assignment. Salidroside with a purity of 99% was ordered from the National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products (Shanghai, China).</p><p>The 60 enrolled patients were assigned as follows: 30 to the salidroside group and 30 to the placebo group. We performed a blind randomization with salidroside (600 mg/day) or placebo, beginning the therapy 1 week before the start of chemotherapy and continuing for the entire period of epirubicin administration.

The LVEF was obtained from the apical 4- and 2-chamber views according to the Simpson rule and was considered abnormal if less than 50%. Myocardial SRI was derived from DTI. Strain rate (SR) data were recorded from the basal interventricular septum (IVS), using standard apical views at a high frame rate (&#x0003e;90 frames/second). The region of interest (ROI) was constant at 5 mm<sup>2</sup> during the whole trial and was tracked automatically throughout the systole. SR data were stored in digital format and analyzed offline with dedicated software (Qlab 5.0, Philips IE33). SR data were averaged from 4&#x02013;6 cycles. Our methodology for the myocardial SR has been described previously.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] In all subjects, the ROS serum concentrations were determined on fresh heparinized blood samples, using the free oxygen radicals test (FORT).

The correlation between instrumental and laboratory variables was assessed by Pearson correlation analysis. p-Values were considered significant when &#x0003c;0.05.

Although the pathogenesis of epirubicin-induced cardiotoxicity remains controversial, the oxidative stress-based hypothesis has gained the widest acceptance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] Robust generation of ROS is defined as oxidative stress, and significant increases in generation of ROS (a collective name for hydrogen peroxide, superoxide, and hydroxyl radicals) in cardiomyocytes, as well as serum concentrations, have been reported in epirubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] ROS are excessively generated from a likely mitochondrial source, then hasten lipid peroxidation and DNA damage, and consequently initiate cell apoptosis or necrosis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] Accordingly, successful antioxidant interventions targeted to reduce ROS offer insights into preventing epirubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.</p><p><italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> has long been used as an adaptogen in traditional Tibetan medicine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] Salidroside [2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl-&#x003b2;-D-glucopyranoside], the main active compound of <italic>Rhodiola</italic> plants, is reported to possibly play a central role in alleviation of mitochondrial-generated ROS and modulation of mitochondrial-related apoptosis signaling in multiple types of cells.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] More recently, <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis showed that pretreatment with salidroside exerted remarkable benefits in inhibition of ROS overgeneration as an antioxidant, and decreased mitochondrial superoxide concentrations.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] Salidroside supplementation could protect cultured cells against ultraviolet light, paraquat, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] In the present study, an early &#x00394;SR derived from DTI parameters observed after an epirubicin dose of 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> was accompanied in the placebo group by a significant increase in ROS serum concentrations, which seems to confirm the relationship between a ROS increase and epirubicin-induced early left ventricular systolic regional dysfunction.</p><p>Safety assessments of salidroside have been reported in our earlier study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] Adverse events were spontaneously reported by the investigator at the end of the study.

There were no clinical adverse events throughout the period of salidroside therapy.</p><p>The small number of patients enrolled and the short follow-up are some of the limitations of the present study. Moreover, DTI-derived strain measurements are dependent on the direction of the Doppler angle of incidence in relation to myocardial motion.
