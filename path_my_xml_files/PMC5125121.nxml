Early studies have described patients with GLC as anxious, overconscientious [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], depressive, hysterical, meticulous, and perfectionists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Recent studies using the five-factor model of personality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], which describes human personality as a combination of extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness, have suggested that patients with GLC have a greater level of neuroticism than patients with cataracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], indicating that patients with GLC might have a neurotic personality.</p><p>However, such a neuroticism-featuring personality is not necessarily representative of the total population of patients with GLC. A previous study has revealed that adherence and persistence with medication in patients with GLC was lower than that for of individuals with other chronic diseases, such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, and osteoporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In that study, over 50% of patients with GLC stopped their medications within 6&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Another study has suggested that this trend was similar regardless of the class of medication, for example, with prostaglandins, alpha-agonists, and beta-blockers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This suggests that there is likely to be a population of patients suffering from GLC who discontinue regular visits an ophthalmologist and are thus are invisible to healthcare workers. As a result, little will also be known about their neuroticism personality trait.</p><p>In the present study, the authors compared the level of neuroticism between a population of patients with GLC who have discontinued their visits to ophthalmological clinics and a population who maintain their regular visits.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients with glaucoma were recruited from a consumer investigator database (Macromill, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Invitation letters were sent to eligible candidates. After the study protocol was presented at the dedicated website of Macromill, Inc., informed consent was obtained by clicking an agreement button. All enrolled patients had to have been diagnosed with GLC and they had to have received prescriptions by ophthalmologists before participation in the present study. Diagnosis, type of GLC, and prescription information was self-disclosed by the participants. This study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Jikei University School of Medicine.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Assessment Procedures</title><p>All assessments were conducted through the dedicated website of Macromill, Inc. Participants were assessed on their duration of visits to ophthalmologists: 0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;regularly visits, 1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;discontinued for less than 1&#x000a0;month, 2&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;discontinued for 1&#x02013;3&#x000a0;months, 3&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;discontinued for 3&#x02013;6&#x000a0;months, and 4&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;discontinued for over 6&#x000a0;months. All participants completed the assessment procedures and were subsequently assigned to two groups based on the continued duration of their visits to their ophthalmologists. These groups were referred to as the <italic>Discontinued</italic> group (participants rated as 1, 2, 3, and 4) and the <italic>Regular Visitor</italic> group (those rated as 0). Thus &#x02018;discontinued&#x02019; was defined as the duration (or number of days) from an appointment day when the participants were supposed to but did not visit their ophthalmologist. Stratified sampling was conducted by three age groups (40&#x02013;49&#x000a0;years old, 50&#x02013;59&#x000a0;years old, and 60&#x000a0;years old and over), as well as gender groups (male and female). The sample size was adopted from the previous study by Mabuchi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. All patients underwent a personality evaluation using the Japanese version of the ten-item personality inventory (TIPI-J).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Japanese Version of the Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI-J)</title><p>The ten-item personality inventory (TIPI) is a questionnaire specifically used to evaluate the &#x02018;Big Five&#x02019; personality traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

Neuroticism itself can be an auxiliary target to treat the pathophysiology of GLC. High neuroticism can not only be a risk for mortality in coronary heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and a predictor of blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], but also a possible cause of fluctuations of intraocular pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This indicates that psychotherapeutic intervention for high neuroticism could stabilize intraocular pressure.</p><p>Neuroticism can also be a marker by which ophthalmologists change their approach to gain adherence to topical GLC medications. In the present study, low neuroticism predicts discontinuation to visit ophthalmologists, and, because individuals with high neuroticism can be sensitive to negative emotions, providing them with prognostic information from an optimistic aspect (e.g., this medication will prevent 30% of patients with GLC from going blind) might help them to regularly visit ophthalmologists. As for individuals with low neuroticism, prognostic information from a pessimistic aspect (e.g., 70% of patients will go blind even if they receive this medication) might encourage them to regularly visit ophthalmologists.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Study Limitation</title><p>The current study has some limitations. First, stratification by age and gender was not enough to avoid sampling bias between the <italic>Discontinued</italic> and <italic>Regular Visitor</italic> groups. Due to lack of a control group, a referential neuroticism personality trait score could not be provided. Studies that include a control group are needed. Second, although the findings of the current study could have implications for the adherence of patients to topical GLC medications, the study did not directly measure adherence and persistence, meaning that the effect of the neuroticism personality trait on GLC medication needs further study. Third, as the definition of &#x02018;discontinuation&#x02019; in the current study included participants who simply forgot to visit to their ophthalmologists, this could lead to a selection bias that could overestimate the duration of the discontinuation in the <italic>Discontinued</italic> group. Further studies would need to include a stricter definition for &#x02018;discontinuation.&#x02019; Fourth, diagnosis, type of GLC, and prescription was self-reported by the participants, and, therefore, the accuracy of the data obtained was not independently validated by the authors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, the authors showed that neuroticism trait in patients with GLC who have discontinued visiting their ophthalmologists was lower than that in patients who visited them regularly, on the basis of the Big Five personality traits as measured by the TIPT-J.
