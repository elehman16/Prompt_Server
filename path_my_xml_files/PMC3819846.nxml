A written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Depending upon the nature of intrathecal drug used, these patients were randomized into three groups of 30 patients each, using computer generated randomization, as:</p><p>Group A: SAB with 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine 7.5 mg (1.5 ml)</p><p>Group B: SAB with 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine 5 mg (1 ml) + sufentanil 10 mg (0.2 ml) + isotonic saline 0.3 ml</p><p>Group C: SAB with 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine 5 mg (1 ml) + fentanyl 25 mg (0.5 ml).</p><p>All study drugs were made to a fixed volume of 1.5 ml and marked with a coded label by an anesthesiologist not involved with the conduct of anesthesia.</p><p>Patients with spinal deformities, local skin infection, coagulation disorders, impaired renal or liver functions, morbid obesity, neurological or mental disease, history of allergy to drugs to be used and opioid dependence were excluded from the study.</p><p>A thorough routine pre-anesthetic check-up comprising of general physical examination, systemic examination and routine investigations of all patients was conducted a day before surgery.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Anesthesia technique</title><p>All patients were given tablet diazepam 10 mg and tablet ranitidine 150 mg orally at night before surgery and tablet diazepam 5 mg with tablet ranitidine 150 mg orally in the morning on the day of surgery.

After shifting the patient to the operating table, monitoring of heart rate, non-invasive blood pressure, respiratory rate and electrocardiography and oxygen saturation was started.

It is imperative to limit the adverse hemodynamic and pulmonary effects associated with spinal block in these elderly patients. Using small doses of local anesthetics may limit these effects, but may not provide satisfactory analgesia. Opioids in conjunction with local anesthetics improve the quality of intraoperative analgesia and also prolong the duration of post-operative analgesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Morphine was the first opioid to be used intrathecally, but a wide variety of clinically relevant side-effects, especially respiratory depression limited its utility.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] A favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of lipophilic opiates e.g. fentanyl and sufentanil, makes them better alternatives, because of a rapid uptake, faster onset and shorter duration of action. This minimizes the rostral migration of the drug to the respiratory center, avoiding delayed respiratory depression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Sufentanil, a pure agonists is an N-4 thienyl derivative of fentanyl. It is considered to be more lipid soluble, a better receptor ligand and is 7-10 times more potent analgesic than fentanyl.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>In our study, the onset of adequate analgesia was delayed in sufentanil and fentanyl groups (12.73 and 11.50 min respectively) as compared with bupivacaine alone group (9.20 min). Cheng <italic>et al.</italic>, and Palmer <italic>et al.</italic>, in their studies observed that onset of analgesia was faster in fentanyl group as compared with sufentanil, when given intrathecally along with bupivacaine in labor analgesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Whereas, Ngiam and Fournier <italic>et al.</italic>, concluded that both opioids had no significant difference in the onset of sensory blockade.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>Varying results have been seen regarding the sensory blockade level by various studies conducted until date. Our findings are at variance with that of Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, who compared fentanyl and sufentanil with low dose bupivacaine in TURP.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] They reported that the peak sensory block level was in the range of S1-T6 (mean L1) in fentanyl group and S1-T6 (mean T11) in sufentanil. Lo <italic>et al.</italic>, also reported a significant higher blockade with sufentanil as compared to fentanyl and plain bupivacaine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Our study is in consistence with that of Cheng <italic>et al.</italic>, they reported a higher level of sensory block with fentanyl as compared to sufentanil.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] In our study, the reasons for the increased block height in the bupivacaine alone group may be because of high dose (7.5 mg) of bupivacaine used as compared to low dose (5 mg) of bupivacaine when combined with fentanyl or sufentanil. The reasons for the increased block level in the fentanyl group compared with the sufentanil group may be related to the density of drug solution or opioid receptor affinities. Fentanyl and sufentanil have similar densities and the density of sodium chloride (0.9%) is higher than that of fentanyl or sufentanil. In our study, drug solution in sufentanil group contained 0.3 ml of normal saline making it denser than fentanyl group drug solution.</p><p>The time required to reach maximum height of the block was significantly more in sufentanil group (16.70 min) and fentanyl group (14.20 min) as compared to plain bupivacaine group (10.10 min).

The median effective doses (ED50) of intrathecal sufentanil and fentanyl are 2.6 and 14 &#x003bc;g respectively. And relative potency for intrathecal fentanyl to sufentanil in labor analgesia is 1:4.4 at the ED50 level. Therefore, intrathecal fentanyl 25 &#x003bc;g and sufentanil 5 &#x003bc;g could be considered as an equipotent dose.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] However, we have used 10 &#x003bc;g sufentanil as has been used in various previous studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>]</p><p>To conclude, we opine that spinal anesthesia with low dose bupivacaine (5 mg) when combined with 10&#x003bc; g sufentanil or 25 &#x003bc;g fentanyl provides adequate anesthesia for endoscopic urological procedures in elderly patients and is associated with a lower incidence of hemodynamic instability as compared to spinal anesthesia with 7.5 mg bupivacaine (0.5%) alone. We recommend sufentanil as an adjuvant to bupivacaine in spinal anesthesia for endoscopic urological procedures as it provides more effective and prolonged analgesia with less degree of motor block and a better hemodynamic stability as compared to fentanyl.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn
