Subjects received a single 10 mg dose of apixaban or placebo on day 1, followed by 10 mg apixaban or placebo twice daily for 6 days (days 4&#x02013;9). The PK and PD of apixaban were assessed by collecting plasma samples for 72 hours following the dose on day 1 and the morning dose on day 9, and measuring apixaban concentration and anti-Xa activity. Safety was assessed via physical examinations, vital sign measurements, electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory evaluations.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>PK analysis showed similar characteristics of apixaban after single and multiple doses, including a median time to maximum concentration of ~3 hours, mean elimination half-life of ~11 hours, and renal clearance of ~1.2 L/hour. The accumulation index was 1.7, consistent with twice-daily dosing and the observed elimination half-life. Single-dose data predict multiple-dose PK, therefore apixaban PK are time-independent. The relationship between anti-Xa activity and plasma apixaban concentrations appears to be linear. Apixaban was safe and well tolerated, with no bleeding-related adverse events reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Apixaban was safe and well tolerated in healthy Chinese subjects. Apixaban PK and PD were predictable and consistent with findings from previous studies in Asian and non-Asian subjects. The administration of apixaban does not require any dose modification based on race.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>apixaban</kwd><kwd>oral anticoagulant</kwd><kwd>factor Xa inhibitor</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>pharmacodynamics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Until recently, available anticoagulant treatments included vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, and heparinoids, such as unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin. Apixaban is a novel oral anticoagulant recently approved in several countries for thromboprophylaxis following elective knee- or hip-replacement surgery and for prevention of stroke or systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-cpaa-5-177">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-cpaa-5-177">5</xref> Apixaban is also being developed for the treatment of venous thromboembolism.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-cpaa-5-177">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-cpaa-5-177">7</xref></p><p>Variations in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of anticoagulants such as heparin and warfarin, as well as resulting clotting times, were observed among different racial groups, including different Asian ethnicities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-cpaa-5-177">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-cpaa-5-177">10</xref> For example, genetic polymorphism of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 as well as vitamin K epoxide reductase are both responsible for the lower warfarin maintenance doses among the three major Asian ethnic groups (Chinese, Malay, and Indian).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-cpaa-5-177">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-cpaa-5-177">10</xref> In addition, certain characteristics, such as metabolism by enzymes known to show genetic polymorphism, high inter-subject variation in bioavailability, or low bioavailability, may make a drug more likely to be affected by ethnic factors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-cpaa-5-177">11</xref> Since there may be concerns regarding variations in the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of anticoagulants among different Asian ethnic groups, the PK, PD, and safety of apixaban were evaluated in healthy Chinese subjects. The primary objective of this study was to assess the PK of single- and multiple-dose apixaban. Secondary objectives included evaluating both safety and the effects of apixaban on PD markers of coagulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Subjects and methods</title><p>Healthy male and female Chinese subjects 18&#x02013;45 years of age with a body mass index of 19&#x02013;24 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included any significant or acute medical illness or relevant trauma, gastrointestinal disease, or surgery in the previous 3 months that could impact drug absorption; a history of abnormal bleeding or coagulation disorder; any significant head injury within the previous 2 years; any major surgery within the 4 weeks prior to dosing or planned within 2 weeks after completion of the study; or any history of acute or chronic pancreatitis. Female subjects were excluded if pregnant or breastfeeding, and were required to have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to dosing. All subjects were required to use an acceptable method of contraception for the duration of the study. Subjects were also excluded for a recent history of smoking or alcohol abuse.</p><p>The study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (as defined by the International Conference on Harmonisation) and with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, EU Directive 2001/20/EC, the US Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 50 (21CFR50), and all applicable local regulatory requirements. The protocol and subject informed-consent forms received appropriate approval by the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee of Peking University First Hospital (Beijing, People&#x02019;s Republic of China) before the study began. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects prior to screening.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-sequence, single- and multiple-dose study in healthy Chinese subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-cpaa-5-177">Figure 1</xref>). All subjects were screened and evaluated for eligibility within 21 days prior to study drug administration. Enrolled subjects who met all eligibility criteria at screening were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either apixaban or matched placebo. Randomization was carried out according to a computer-generated randomization scheme supplied by the sponsor.</p><p>Subjects were admitted to the clinical facility the day before study-drug administration and were confined to the facility for the duration of the study. Each subject received either a single 10 mg oral dose of apixaban (2 &#x000d7; 5 mg tablets) or matched placebo on day 1 of the study. From days 4 to 8, each subject received either oral apixaban 10 mg twice daily or matched placebo, given at approximately 9 am and 9 pm in the fasted state. The last dose of study drug was administered on the morning of day 9. Subjects were discharged from the study after completion of clinical and laboratory safety evaluations on day 12. Blood and urine samples were collected over the course of the study for clinical laboratory evaluations. Standard meals were served during the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Sample collection and analysis</title><p>Blood samples for PK and PD assessments were collected using an indwelling catheter or direct venipuncture predose on days 1, 7, 8, and 9, and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9,12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hours following the morning dose of apixaban on days 1 and 9. For PK analysis, each 2.7 mL blood sample was completely mixed immediately after collection with a 3.2% sodium citrate anticoagulant and then placed on chipped ice. Within 15 minutes, each blood sample was centrifuged for 15 minutes at approximately 1,500&#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> at 4&#x000b0;C to separate plasma. Separated plasma was transferred to cryogenic vials, immediately stored at or below &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C, and sent for analysis to Intertek Pharmaceutical Services (formerly Alta Analytical Laboratory), El Dorado, CA, USA. No PK or PD samples from subjects receiving matched placebo were analyzed.</p><p>Urine was collected on days 1&#x02013;4 (predose, 0&#x02013;12, 12&#x02013;24, 24&#x02013;48, and 48&#x02013;72 hours relative to the day 1 morning dose) and on day 9 (0&#x02013;12 hours relative to the morning dose) for the analysis of apixaban. Urine was collected in chilled collection jugs and stored under refrigerated conditions. Aliquots (10 mL) of each sample were transferred into polypropylene vials and stored at or below &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C. The samples were sent to Intertek Pharmaceutical Services for analysis.</p><p>Apixaban concentration was measured in plasma and urine samples using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography atmospheric pressure ionization tandem mass spectrometry method. Sample extraction for plasma utilized protein precipitation, and for urine, solid-phase extraction was employed. Apixaban-M4, a stable-label internal standard, was used for both assays. The lower limit of quantification was 1.0 ng/mL for both apixaban plasma and urine assays. The between-run and within-run variabilities for apixaban in plasma quality-control samples, expressed as coefficient of variation (CV), were &#x02264;5.97% and &#x02264;7.84%, respectively, with deviations from nominal concentration of no more than &#x000b1;2.15%. The between-run and within-run variabilities for apixaban in urine quality-control samples were &#x02264;13.5% and &#x02264;20.1%, respectively, with deviations from nominal concentration of no more than &#x000b1;7.56%. All samples were analyzed within the period of analyte stability.</p><p>For PD analysis, blood samples were collected in 4.5 mL 3.2% sodium citrate tubes and immediately gently mixed by inversion before being placed on ice. Within 30 minutes of blood collection, samples were centrifuged either for 15 minutes at 2,500&#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> or 20 minutes at 1,500&#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> at 4&#x000b0;C to separate plasma. Separated plasma samples were stored in vials at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C until analyzed. Anti-Xa activity was measured by a validated chromogenic assay at Esoterix Coagulation Laboratory (Aurora, CO, USA).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-cpaa-5-177">12</xref> The one-step competition reaction involved a fixed amount of bovine factor Xa, added to a mixture of citrated human plasma and synthetic para-nitroaniline (pNA)&#x02013;containing peptide substrate with exogenous antithrombin added. The quantity of pNA released was inversely proportional to the concentration of factor Xa inhibitor present in the sample mixture. The results of the assay were reported in low-molecular-weight heparin units (range 0.2&#x02013;18.4 IU/mL).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis</title><p>Individual subject PK parameters were derived by non-compartmental methods (Kinetica, version 4.4.1 within the eToolbox EP, version 2.6.1; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Single- and multiple-dose PK parameters assessed included maximum observed plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and time to maximum plasma concentration (T<sub>max</sub>). The observed plasma concentrations at trough (C<sub>min</sub>) at 12 hours postdose on day 9 were also recorded. Plasma half-life (<italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub>) was estimated as ln2/&#x003bb;, where &#x003bb; was the terminal phase of the plasma concentration&#x02013;time profile determined with a weighting factor of 1 using the method of least squares (log-linear regression of at least 3 data points). Area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve (AUC) from time 0 to time of the last quantifiable concentration following a single dose (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;</sub><italic><sub>t</sub></italic>) was calculated using conventional trapezoidal and log-trapezoidal methods. AUC from time 0 extrapolated to infinite time following a single dose (AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub>) was determined by summing AUC<sub>0&#x02013;</sub><italic><sub>t</sub></italic>, and the extrapolated area determined by dividing the last measured concentration by the slope of the terminal log-linear phase. The AUC in one dosing interval (AUC<sub>&#x003c4;</sub>) was determined by summing the areas from time 0 to the time of next dose (0&#x02013;12 hours), using conventional trapezoidal and log-trapezoidal methods. The accumulation index (AI) was calculated as the ratio of AUC<sub>&#x003c4;</sub> on day 9 divided by AUC<sub>&#x003c4;</sub> on day 1. Renal clearance (CL<sub>R</sub>) was calculated as urinary recovery (UR<italic><sub>t</sub></italic>)/AUC<sub>0&#x02013;</sub><italic><sub>t</sub></italic>, with UR<italic><sub>t</sub></italic> being the amount of drug collected in the same time interval (time 0&#x02013;<italic>t</italic>).</p><p>Mean plasma anti-Xa activity profiles were derived from individual data obtained on day 9 over one dosing interval (12 hours). Maximum and minimum anti-Xa activities for apixaban were determined from the mean plasma anti-Xa activity data.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>Subjects were closely monitored for adverse events, and were not discharged from the study until the investigator had determined that all adverse events had resolved or were not of clinical significance. Data on adverse events were collected through constant monitoring, volunteering of information by the study participants, and daily questioning by the medical staff. Additionally, adverse events could be identified by investigator review of vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), laboratory, and other data.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>The number of subjects was not based on statistical power considerations. However, administration of apixaban to twelve subjects would provide 90% confidence that the estimated apixaban C<sub>max</sub> and AUC geometric means would be within 17% and 16%, respectively, of true population values. These calculations assumed that C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;</sub><italic><sub>t</sub></italic> were log-normally distributed with intersubject standard deviations (SDs) of 0.33 and 0.31 for ln(C<sub>max</sub>) and ln(AUC<sub>0&#x02013;</sub><italic><sub>t</sub></italic>), respectively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-cpaa-5-177">13</xref> Summary statistics for each PK parameter were tabulated by study day, with geometric means and CV presented for both single- and multiple-dose PK parameters (including C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;</sub><italic><sub>t</sub></italic>, AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub>, AUC<sub>&#x003c4;</sub>, and AI). Minima, medians, and maxima were presented for T<sub>max</sub>, and means and SDs determined for <italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub> and CL<sub>R</sub>. The relationships between apixaban concentration and anti-Xa activity after single and multiple doses of apixaban were explored. A scatter plot of plasma concentration versus anti-Xa activity was plotted with a fitted linear regression line.

Apixaban was rapidly absorbed, with peak concentrations observed 3 hours (range 2&#x02013;4 hours) after administration. The descending phase of the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curves appeared to be biphasic, characterized by a relatively rapid initial descending phase followed by a slower terminal phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-cpaa-5-177">Figure 2</xref>). The mean terminal <italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub> was consistent following single- and multiple-dose administration (11.4 hours and 10.8 hours, respectively).

On day 9, maximum anti-Xa activity, corresponding to the peak apixaban concentration at 3 hours, was 5.57 (SD, 1.54) IU/mL; minimum anti-Xa activity, coinciding with the trough apixaban concentration at 12 hours, was 1.94 (SD, 0.54) IU/mL, based on mean measurement data. In addition, a direct linear relationship was observed between anti-Xa activity and plasma apixaban concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-cpaa-5-177">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>There were no deaths, other serious adverse events, adverse events leading to discontinuation, or clinically significant bleeding-related adverse events reported during the study. No adverse events were reported following administration of single-dose apixaban 10 mg or placebo. All adverse events in apixaban- and placebo-treated subjects following multiple-dose administration were mild, considered possibly related to treatment, and resolved without treatment. The types and frequencies of reported adverse events were generally similar between apixaban- and placebo-treated subjects. In total, three adverse events (elevated alanine aminotransferase [ALT], positive fecal blood, and microscopic hematuria) were reported in three subjects receiving apixaban (one of twelve subjects [8%] for each), and two adverse events (elevated ALT and positive fecal blood) were reported in one subject receiving placebo (one of six subjects [17%]). No clinically significant changes in vital signs, physical examinations, or ECGs were observed during the study.

Therefore, the similarity between apixaban PK, PD, and tolerability observed in this study with that observed in previous healthy-subject studies conducted in the US and Japan indicates that no dose adjustment is needed based on race.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Professional editorial and medical writing support was provided by Andy Shepherd, PhD, and Dana Fox, PhD, CMPP, of Caudex Medical Ltd, and funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and Pfizer Inc.
