Low vitamin D status is also a risk factor for low bone density and osteoporotic fractures. Furthermore, during the past decades, the vitamin D receptor has been found in many tissues and new actions of vitamin D have been described.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Immigrants, particularly those from South Asia and the Middle East, are at high risk of type 2 diabetes<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;8</xref> and have a high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors such as unfavorable serum lipids.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>

The aim was to test whether 16&#x02005;weeks of daily vitamin D3 supplementation (10 or 25&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/day vs placebo) would reduce glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fructosamine,and BMI and improve serum lipids.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research design and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>The study was conducted between January and June 2011 and further details of the study method have been described elsewhere.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Participants were healthy men and women, aged 18&#x02013;50 years, who were born or had parents born in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia. They were recruited through 11 different community centers in Oslo and surrounding areas (at latitude 60&#x000b0;N). They were excluded if they regularly used vitamin D-containing supplements, were receiving treatment for vitamin D deficiency, were pregnant or breastfeeding, used medication for hypoglycemia or hyperlipidemia, malabsorption, used medication interfering with the vitamin D metabolism (such as thiazides, antiepileptic drugs, prednisolone, or hormone replacement therapy), had kidney disease, cancer, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, osteoporosis, or a recent fracture, or used strong painkillers prescribed by a physician such as Paralgin forte and Aporex. The same data collection team visited all the centers and performed the baseline and follow-up data collection. Interpreters were used when necessary, but the majority of the study participants were able to communicate in the Norwegian language.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Randomization and intervention</title><p>Those who fulfilled the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to one of three equally sized intervention groups receiving one tablet per day containing 25&#x02005;&#x003bc;g vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, 10&#x02005;&#x003bc;g vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, or placebo. The tablets were similar in color, size, and packing. Each study participant was given a box of 120 tablets (a 16-week use corresponds to 112 tablets) at baseline with a self-administered compliance form. The tablets were manufactured by Bioplus Life Sciences Pvt Ltd, DMA (Bangalore, India), certified for Good Manufacturing Practice, and the ingredients met the requirements of British Pharmacop&#x000e9;. If the study participants had forgotten to take one tablet a day, they were asked to take two tablets the following day. The participants were followed up with a short text message twice a week to remind them to take the tablets. They were advised to maintain their usual dietary pattern during the 16-week trial period and contact the study staff by telephone if they had any inquiries.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Main outcome variables</title><p>The study outcomes were difference in absolute change during the 16-week intervention between the intervention groups combined (10 or 25&#x02005;&#x003bc;g of vitamin D<sub>3</sub>/day) and placebo, in HbA1c, fructosamine, serum lipids (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides), and BMI. HbA1c is correlated with the average glucose level over the preceding 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;months,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and it can be measured in non-fasting blood samples. Fructosamine reflects the average blood glucose level over the preceding 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;weeks, and the assay is not influenced by hemoglobinopathies or iron deficiency anemia that may influence HbA1c measurements.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Blood sampling and laboratory assays</title><p>Non-fasting venous blood was drawn at baseline and at the follow-up after 16&#x02005;weeks. Blood for serum was collected in serum-separator gel tubes and centrifuged after 30&#x02005;min to 2&#x02005;h, and blood for plasma was collected in EDTA tubes and centrifuged within 30&#x02005;min at room temperature at the study site. Serum and plasma were separated and frozen in several aliquots at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C the same day and within 1&#x02013;2&#x02005;weeks frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until they were analyzed.

Height was measured to the nearest centimeter with a rigid meter standard. The same devices were used both at baseline and at follow-up. The participants completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire at baseline and follow-up. Information about age, ethnicity, education, and duration of residence in Norway was collected at baseline.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Random allocation</title><p>We chose a computer-generated block randomization to ensure a good balance of the number in each group during the trial and randomly varied the block size between 3 and 6.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Blinding</title><p>Group allocation was unknown to participants, research staff, investigators, and data collectors. Data analyses were also blinded. The tablet boxes were numbered according to the randomization list by an external pharmacy (the Hospital Pharmacy at Oslo University Hospital). The group allocation list was stored at this pharmacy with a copy in a sealed envelope. Each participant was consecutively numbered and received a prepackaged tablet box with the corresponding number. The analyses of the primary outcome measures and the evaluation of the physical performance tests were performed before the randomization list was opened. At the end, the results of s-25(OH)D and plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) analyses at follow-up were unmasked.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Registration</title><p>The study was authorized as a clinical trial by the Norwegian Medicine Agency.

Notably, the 95% CI for mean difference in HbA1c (&#x02212;0.04 to 0.06) excluded &#x02212;0.5%, which was our a priori defined smallest difference of clinical relevance. We can therefore reasonably exclude large effects on HbA1c of a 16-week intervention with these dosages.</p></sec><sec id="s11b"><title>Strengths and weaknesses</title><p>The study was a strictly performed double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with good compliance and relatively high retention. According to our prestudy power calculation, our relatively large sample size should provide good statistical power to detect even small-to-moderate effects on HbA1c. Blood samples were assayed in one batch. In addition to the commonly measured HbA1c, we also included fructosamine, which refers to glycated serum proteins and reflects the average blood glucose levels for the previous 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;weeks. We reasoned that this would increase the chance of detecting changes during a 16-week intervention period. The ethnic minorities targeted in our study are known to have a generally poor vitamin D status and relatively high risk of type 2 diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors, as confirmed in our study.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>

<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The study also has some limitations. It was designed primarily for muscular strength outcomes, but HbA1c was an important prespecified outcome described in the protocol. We did not measure fasting glucose levels and insulin sensitivity, which would have been more demanding for the participants with possibly negative effects on recruitment and participation of the study participants. Also, the participants may not have been exposed for a sufficiently long time to high levels of circulating s-25(OH)D to affect some of our outcome variables.</p></sec><sec id="s11c"><title>Findings in relation to other studies</title><p>A recently published systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that currently there is insufficient evidence to recommend vitamin D supplementation in order to improve glycemia or insulin resistance in patients with diabetes, normal fasting glucose, or impaired glucose tolerance.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In the systematic review, only four studies examined HbA1c as an outcome, and all were done in participants with diabetes or another serious chronic disease, or the intervention was done with 1-hydroxyvitamin D, which circumvents the strictly controlled hydroxylation of the 1-position (normally of 25(OH)D).</p><p>A few other relevant studies including healthy participants with low vitamin D status have been published after the systematic review cited above. Studies with similar characteristics as ours, with a duration of 3&#x02013;12&#x02005;months, consistently did not show clear effects on HbA1c (see online electronic supplementary material for details), and generally supported our result. For instance, Davidson <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> examined healthy persons from ethnic minorities in the USA (Latinos and African-Americans) with HbA1c &#x0003e;5.8% and s-25(OH)D &#x0003c;75&#x02005;nmol/L at baseline. They showed no effect of high doses of vitamin D supplementation (doses corresponding to &#x0003e;200&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/day) for 1&#x02005;year on various measures of glycemia or insulin sensitivity. HbA1c was slightly reduced in those receiving vitamin D, but the effect size was deemed clinically non-relevant. While we did not restrict participants by baseline s-25(OH)D or HbA1c, the large majority of our participants in our study had levels &#x0003c;50&#x02005;nmol/L and many had HbA1c &#x0003e;5.7%. Harris <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> gave a 3-month supplementation with 4000&#x02005;IU (100&#x02005;&#x000b5;g) vitamin D<sub>3</sub> daily in overweight African-Americans with prediabetes but found no effect on HbA1c or other measures of glycemia. A RCT by Mitri <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> examining the effect of vitamin D supplementation in adults at high risk of diabetes concluded that short-term supplementation with cholecalciferol did not have a significant effect on HbA1c.</p><p>In two other relatively large studies performed in the North of Norway, capsules of 20&#x02005;000&#x02005;IU (500&#x02005;&#x000b5;g) vitamin D<sub>3</sub> or placebo were given twice weekly for 6&#x02005;months to healthy Norwegians with s-25(OH)D levels &#x0003c;50&#x02005;nmol/L, but the intervention did not improve HbA1c.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> We did not identify any other randomized studies of the effect of vitamin D on fructosamine. The lack of effect on fructosamine is nevertheless consistent with the lack of effect on HbA1c and on fasting glucose seen in other studies<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> since fructosamine also reflects aspects of glucose metabolism.</p><p>Results from systematic reviews of RCTs of vitamin D on lipids show a lack of effect of vitamin D on total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and HDL-cholesterol which was clearly consistent with our study.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Also, our updated meta-analysis of recent trials similar to ours supported the lack of effect of vitamin D on serum total cholesterol in healthy adults (confer electronic supplementary material). A consistent lack of effect of vitamin D on serum lipids was also found in a 12-month study among Pakistani immigrants in Copenhagen, Denmark.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>A recently conducted review of RCTs on either vitamin D plus calcium or only vitamin D, and reporting effects on adiposity outcomes including BMI, concluded that current evidence from RCTs did not consistently support the contention that calcium and vitamin D accelerated weight or fat loss in obesity.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Also, von Hurst <italic>et al</italic> conducted a randomized controlled study in 81 women of South Asian origin living in New Zealand and aged 23&#x02013;68&#x02005;years to 6&#x02005;months of supplementation with 100&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/day of vitamin D or placebo and stated that there was no significant effect on BMI. In accordance with other RCTs, we did not find any effect of vitamin D supplementation on BMI.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Our updated meta-analysis on BMI clearly showed that there was no indication on an effect of vitamin D on BMI in healthy adults (see online electronic supplementary material).</p><p>In our study, both doses of vitamin D supplementation were sufficient to raise s-25(OH)D concentration significantly compared with the placebo group, but &#x02265;50&#x02005;nmol/L was not reached in 43% (25&#x02005;&#x003bc;g supplementation group) and 62% (10&#x02005;&#x003bc;g supplementation group).</p><p>The existing literature on the effect of vitamin D on the end points included in our study did not identify any effects even when higher doses (even above 100&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/day) and longer duration (up to 12&#x02005;months) of treatment with vitamin D were used. Thus, we believe that the lack of effect in our study would not change with another regime of vitamin D treatment.</p><p>In conclusion, in healthy adults with an immigrant background low in vitamin D, supplementation with vitamin D<sub>3</sub> during 16&#x02005;weeks did not improve HbA1c, fructosamine, lipid profiles, and BMI. Our literature review and updated meta-analysis showed that the lack of effect of vitamin D on these end points in healthy adults was consistent and corroborated by other similar studies.</p></sec><sec id="s11d"><title>Future research</title><p>Over 1/3 of the study participants had prediabetes HbA1c levels and are at risk of development of diabetes; therefore, exploring effective preventive means for vitamin D deficiency, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease is urgently needed.
