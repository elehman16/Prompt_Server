Patients were randomized 1:1:1 according to their endoscopic findings (Grade N or M) at Visit 1. Assignment of study drugs was kept blinded by using drug numbers allocated to each study site and blinding information was kept centrally until all data were collected.

The study treatments (vonoprazan 10 mg or 20 mg and placebo) were indistinguishable in appearance.</p><p>Patients were randomized to receive vonoprazan 10 mg, vonoprazan 20 mg, or placebo. All study drugs were manufactured by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd, Osaka, Japan. During the 1-week run-in period, all patients received an oral antacid (Maaredge Combination-DS for Suspension, 1.2 g, Towa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) 3 times daily after each meal (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). During the 4-week treatment period, patients received a tablet of vonoprazan 10 mg, vonoprazan 20&#x000a0;mg, or placebo once daily after breakfast.

The FAS and safety analysis set included all patients who were randomized to the study treatments and received at least 1 dose of the study drugs.

No clinically significant changes in gastrin, pepsinogen I, or pepsinogen II were observed in the placebo group.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0075"><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial to examine the effect of vonoprazan in patients with NERD. We observed that vonoprazan 10 mg and 20 mg were not superior to placebo in NERD in the FAS with respect to the proportion of days without heartburn. In the PPS, vonoprazan 20 mg was superior to placebo and the proportion of days without heartburn was higher in the vonoprazan 20 mg group. However, according to the stratified analysis at Week 2, we observed no meaningful difference between vonoprazan 10 mg and 20 mg doses.</p><p>We also found that the difference in mean severity of heartburn was significantly lower with vonoprazan 10&#x000a0;mg and 20&#x000a0;mg compared with the placebo group, although there was no significant difference in cumulative improvement rate of heartburn. Our results are consistent with previous studies of patients with NERD, which indicate that the pathology of NERD may be distinct from erosive acid-related diseases and patients with NERD may not respond as well to some treatments that are effective in GERD with erosive mucosal injury. For example, patients with NERD often respond poorly to some PPIs.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> However, the severity of acid reflux may correlate with response to therapy. One study suggested that severity of acid reflux in NERD is predictive of response to rabeprazole.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Similarly, in our study, patients with some observable vague erythema and/or whitish turbidity mucosa (NERD Grade M) experienced significantly lower mean severity of heartburn with vonoprazan compared with placebo. In contrast, there was no significant difference in mean severity of heartburn between vonoprazan and placebo in patients with no observable mucosal change (NERD Grade N).</p><p>We observed that patients with NERD who responded to vonoprazan at Week 2 experienced a significantly increased proportion of days without heartburn and significantly reduced severity of heartburn at Week 4 compared with patients who did not respond at Week 2. Similarly, we observed that patients in the vonoprazan treatment groups experienced faster resolution of heartburn compared with placebo. Our results indicate that resolution of symptoms at Week 2 with vonoprazan may be predictive of response at Week 4.</p><p>The strengths of our study include its randomized, multicenter study design and the good retention of patients in the follow-up phase. In addition, the study stratified patients into Grades M and N categories; these are standard classifications used by Japanese endoscopists. The limitations of the study include the low numbers of patients in some groups for the subgroup analyses. Because the resolution of symptoms was measured by patient diary entries and was not confirmed by pH monitoring, recorded symptoms may be subjective or not related to NERD; for example, based on the grading scale, it is possible that very mild symptoms could be categorized as no symptoms.</p><p>There are a number of other factors that may have confounded the results of our study. First, we included a run-in period with antacid treatment in our study design. Participants were excluded from the study when they responded to antacids in the run-in period. Therefore, our study design allowed the possibility that appropriate patients with acid-induced heartburn may have been excluded. Second, the postobservation period with placebo in this study may have confounded the cumulative heartburn improvement rate. Third, according to the stratified analysis based on response at Week 2, many patients with possibly confounding conditions were included in this study; for example, patients with functional disorders such as functional dyspepsia and functional heartburn. Fourth, it should also be considered that patients with no response to antacid agents during the run-in phase may actually have had functional heartburn and would therefore not be expected to improve with vonoprazan at Week 2 or at Week 4. In contrast, patients who responded to antacid agents were probably more likely to have had true NERD; these patients responded to vonoprazan at Week 2 and continued to show response to vonoprazan at Week 4. Therefore, in patients with heartburn who have normal or equivocal findings at endoscopy, failure to respond to antacid may be predictive of failure to respond to acid-suppressing medicines. Finally, in the group of patients who responded at Week 2, there was no meaningful difference in efficacy between 10 mg and 20&#x000a0;mg vonoprazan despite the fact that the acid inhibitory effect of vonoprazan 20 mg is greater than vonoprazan 10 mg. One possible explanation for this result is that vonoprazan 10 mg is a sufficient dose for the improvement of NERD. The recommended dose of PPIs for treatment of NERD in Japanese patients is half the maximum dose for treatment of erosive esophagitis<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref>; the maximum dose of vonoprazan for treatment of erosive esophagitis is 20 mg.</p></sec><sec id="s0080"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Results from the FAS suggest that vonoprazan 10 mg and 20 mg are not superior to placebo with respect to proportion of days without heartburn in patients with NERD. However, the results from the PPS suggest that vonoprazan 20 mg may be effective in the treatment of NERD. In addition, there was no meaningful difference observed between 10 mg and 20 mg doses of vonoprazan. To confirm the clinical influence and efficacy of vonoprazan in patients with NERD, future studies should be designed to overcome the limitations found in our study.</p></sec><sec id="s0085"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>Funding for this work was provided by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Osaka, Japan.
