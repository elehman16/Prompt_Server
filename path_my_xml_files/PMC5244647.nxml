All of the patients had both AITD and Vitamin D deficiency, defined as serum values &#x0003c;20 ng/mL. They were randomly assigned into two groups. The first group included 46 patients and the second one included 36 patients. The first group was treated with Vitamin D for 1 month at 1000 IU/day. The second group served as the control group and was not treated with Vitamin D replacement. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone, free T4 (fT4), thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab), thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb), and Vitamin D levels were measured at the initiation of the study and again at 1 month in all patients.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Two groups were similar with regard to age, sex, and type of thyroid disease.

However, there were no differences in Vitamin D level associated with thyroid function. In addition, we found no difference between GD and HT in terms of Vitamin D levels in this study.</p><p>In literature, the majority of autoimmune diseases with different pathophysiologies were demonstrated to be associated with low Vitamin D levels such as RA, IBD, and AITD.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Thyroid diseases, particularly the AITDs, are nearly the most common endocrine abnormality in clinical practice.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The pathogenesis of AITD has been suggested to be multifactorial, including genetic, environmental, and hormonal factors such as Vitamin D deficiency.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Although not yet clear, numerous associations among Vitamin D and AITD have been shown. Wang <italic>et al</italic>. showed that the serum Vitamin D levels were lower in AITD patients when compared to healthy control individuals. In addition, the patients who had Vitamin D deficiency were more likely to develop AITD. Tamer <italic>et al</italic>. revealed that Vitamin D insufficiency (&#x0003c;30 ng/dl) was more commonly found in patients with HT than in controls.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] In another study, Vitamin D levels were detected to be lower in patients with AITDs than in healthy volunteers.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Inversely, another study revealed a poor relationship between Vitamin D and AITDs.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In this study, Vitamin D levels of the patients with AITD were below normal reference ranges. We evaluated HT and GD together in concordance with the literature due to an insufficient number of patients. When the groups were compared in their own, we found that TPO-Ab and TgAb levels were significantly decreased by the replacement therapy in the statistical analysis of two related groups with Wilcoxon test. However, we did not find any difference between groups in terms of antibody levels in two different group analysis with independent samples' <italic>t</italic>-test. However, we think that this situation is not a true contradiction. Because we made two measurements including before and after treatment for each patient, two related group analysis in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> have more accurate results. Finally, we can claim the existence of a relationship between Vitamin D and AITDs.</p><p>There are several studies regarding the effects of Vitamin D replacement therapy on autoimmunity with many of them focusing on thyroid autoimmunity. Agmon-Levin <italic>et al</italic>. revealed that in patients with systemic and organ-specific autoimmune diseases, Vitamin D levels were found to be lower when compared to healthy subjects and that Vitamin D supplementation had beneficial effects on autoimmune diseases.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] The positive effect of Vitamin D supplementation on the treatment or prevention of AITDs has also been shown in experimental animal studies. In a recent study, mice that had developed experimental autoimmune thyroiditis recovered by 44.4% after administration of low-dose Vitamin D. In addition, that study revealed that following Vitamin D replacement therapy, the severity of histological lesions was reduced up to 26% in mice that had experimentally AITD.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Our study design was the first study in literature that evaluated the effect of Vitamin D on thyroid antibodies in humans. We suggest administration of Vitamin D in patients with AITDs and Vitamin D deficiency as it has beneficial effects on thyroid autoimmunity. For this reason, Vitamin D replacement may be suggested as an auxiliary treatment for AITDs.</p><p>The role of Vitamin D as an immunemodulator has been reported in recent studies, and low levels of Vitamin D have been observed in several autoimmune diseases such as RA, IBD, and AITDs.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] One recent study reported an association between Vitamin D deficiency and the presence of antithyroid antibodies.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Shin <italic>et al</italic>. revealed a negative association between 25(OH) D3 and TPO-Ab levels and further demonstrated that low 25(OH) D3 may be a possible risk factor for TPO-Ab positivity.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Kivity <italic>et al</italic>. reported that Vitamin D deficiency was associated with high levels of TgAb.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] We revealed that Vitamin D deficiency may be a potential risk factor in terms of TgAb and TPO-Ab positivity. The relationship between inflammatory cytokines and AITDs is well-known.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Taking into consideration the immunemodulator effect of Vitamin D on inflammatory responses and autoimmunity, such reports support the possible relationship between AITDs and Vitamin D deficiency.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] This study has not demonstrated a relationship between Vitamin D levels and thyroid function. This result has two possible explanations:First, the study time was relatively short. If we could follow-up with the patients for a longer duration, TSH levels may be assayed differently. Second, Vitamin D deficiency is more closely associated with antithyroid antibody titer rather than thyroid function. This study could be performed for only a limited time (1 month) due to ethical reasons. Therefore, results indicated only changes in thyroid antibodies. Studies with longer durations are necessary to reflect TSH half-times to determine thyroid hormone levels. Finally, Vitamin D seems to play a potential immunemodulator role in autoimmune thyroiditis according to the data gathered during the present study.</p><p>A major limitation of our study is a very short period of intervention. Other limitations were small sample size, the short study period, and having participants from the same geographical region with similar dressing habits and ethnicity, which may have affected Vitamin D levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Vitamin D deficiency may contribute to the pathogenesis of AITDs. The molecular mechanism should be further investigated to clarify the causal relationship between the Vitamin D level and autoimmune thyroiditis. Since supplementation of the Vitamin D decreased thyroid antibody titers in the present study in Vitamin D deficient subjects, in the future Vitamin D may become a part of AITDs' treatment, especially in those with Vitamin D insufficiency. Further clinical and experimental studies are required to understand the mechanisms of AITD and results of Vitamin D replacement treatment on the pathogenesis of AITD and thyroid functions.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHORS&#x02019; CONTRIBUTION</title><p>YS contributed in the conception of the work, conducting the study, revising the draft, approval of the final version of the manuscript, and agreed for all aspects of the work, IC contributed in the design of the work, revising the draft, approval of the final version of the manuscript, and agreed for all aspects of the work, MY contributed in the conception of the work, revising the draft, approval of the final version of the manuscript, and agreed for all aspects of the work, OSD contributed in the conception of the work, conducting the study, revising the draft, approval of the final version of the manuscript, and agreed for all aspects of the work, OB contributed in the conception and design of the work, drafting and revising the draft, approval of the final version of the manuscript, and agreed for all aspects of the work, FG contributed in the conception of the work, conducting the study, revising the draft, approval of the final version of the manuscript, and agreed for all aspects of the work.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This manuscript was published as a poster in European Congress of Endocrinology (2015).
