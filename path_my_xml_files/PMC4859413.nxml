Eligible eyes were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive levofloxacin or moxifloxacin prior to cataract surgery and were randomized into one of four sampling time points (ie, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hour post-last dose). Randomization was investigator and laboratory-masked. Three days prior to cataract surgery, each patient instilled one drop of the assigned study medication into the operative eye four times daily.

Microbial keratitis and endophthalmitis can present a substantial risk to vision and treatment must be tailored accordingly. Risk factors of microbial keratitis and endophthalmitis include contact lens wear, ocular surface disease, ocular trauma, and intraocular surgery. Corneal scarring resulting from the host immune response can also threaten sight.<xref rid="b1-opth-10-783" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Therefore, clinical presentation of microbial keratitis requires aggressive treatment to eliminate infection and limit sight-threatening sequelae. Prophylaxis of endophthalmitis and effective treatment of microbial keratitis by an ophthalmic antimicrobial agent is contingent upon its ability to penetrate the cornea and aqueous.<xref rid="b2-opth-10-783" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Knowledge of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of topical ophthalmic antibiotics in aqueous humor demonstrates the potential for the drugs to penetrate the corneal epithelium.</p><p>Fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents, like levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, have in vitro activity against the bacterial pathogens that threaten the health of the eye.<xref rid="b3-opth-10-783" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Levofloxacin ophthalmic solution 1.5% and moxifloxacin 0.5% are commercial compounds and have been approved in the United States for bacterial keratitis and bacterial conjunctivitis.</p><p>Moxifloxacin 0.5% is manufactured as Vigamox by Alcon, (Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX, USA). Levofloxacin 1.5% was originally manufactured by Santen, (Emeryville, CA, USA) and later Johnson and Johnson (New Brunswick, NJ, USA) but is currently distributed by a number of international pharmaceutical companies such as Centaur Pharmaceuticals (Mumbai, India), Incepta Pharmaceuticals (Dhaka, Bangladesh), and Entod Pharmaceuticals (Mumbai, India). These agents both have a dual mechanism of action that involves the inhibition of bacterial topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase.<xref rid="b4-opth-10-783" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Consequently, they are less likely to produce resistant organisms because two simultaneous mutations are required to establish resistance.<xref rid="b4-opth-10-783" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Both drugs have very similar in vitro susceptibility profiles as documented in a nationwide longitudinal surveillance program that included longitudinal data from archived ocular isolates dating back to 2000.<xref rid="b3-opth-10-783" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>For an antimicrobial agent to demonstrate efficacy in vivo, it must attain concentrations in the target site of both sufficient magnitude and duration of time in order to eradicate bacteria. Measures of predicted antimicrobial efficacy for fluoroquinolones include pharmacokinetic&#x02013;pharmacodynamic (PK&#x02013;PD) measures denoting concentration effects relative to pathogen susceptibility.<xref rid="b5-opth-10-783" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-opth-10-783" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Herein, we describe a study comparing the pharmacokinetics in aqueous humor of levofloxacin 1.5% and moxifloxacin 0.5% ophthalmic solutions after instillation of multiple drops into the operative eye of patients undergoing cataract surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a two-visit, randomized, single-center, single-masked, active-comparator, parallel-group study to compare drug concentrations in aqueous humor following topical ocular instillation of levofloxacin 1.5% or moxifloxacin hydrochloride 0.5% ophthalmic solutions in subjects undergoing cataract surgery. At visit 1 (day 1&#x02013;14) subjects&#x02019; eyes were enrolled and randomized to a 1:1 ratio into each treatment arm. Qualified eyes were further randomized into one of four subgroups, which specified the time between the last drop of study medication and the time of aqueous humor sample collection (ie, 1-, 2-, 4-, and 6-hour subgroups).</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients and treatment</title><p>Male and female subjects aged 18 years or older who were planning to undergo elective phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation for the treatment of cataract(s) and who met all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria at the screening visit were included in this study. A written informed consent and HIPAA form, were signed and collected from each patient. This study was conducted in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization guidelines on Good Clinical Practice and local regulations and was approved by the Great Lakes institutional review board.</p><p>Demographic information, medical and medication history were obtained from each patient. For 3 days prior to the day of cataract surgery, subjects instilled one drop of study medication into their operative eye four times daily (at 8 am, 12 pm, 4 pm, and 8 pm). On the day of surgery (visit 2, day 4), patients who were randomized to the 1- and 2-hour subgroups received their final drop of study medication administered by study personnel at the study site, while patients who were randomized to the 4- and 6-hour subgroups self-administered their last drop of study medication while speaking with the study staff on the telephone on the day of surgery. Both the surgeon who collected the aqueous humor samples and the laboratory personnel who performed the concentration analysis were masked to the medication and the subgroup assignment of the patients.</p><p>Immediately prior to beginning the cataract surgery (&#x000b1;5 minutes of planned sampling time), the surgeon collected approximately 150 &#x003bc;L of aqueous humor by paracentesis using a 30-gauge needle on a tuberculin syringe. This was performed by inserting the needle through the clear cornea 1 mm from the limbus. If the patient had missed any dose of the study medication, based on each patient&#x02019;s diary of study medication administration, however, the patient was discontinued from the study and no aqueous humor samples were collected. All aqueous humor samples collected were immediately placed into a pre-labeled storage tube and were placed on ice or into a freezer within 10 minutes of collection. All samples were kept frozen (&#x02264;&#x02212;40&#x000b0;C) until shipped to the laboratory for analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Pharmacokinetic analysis and sample assay method</title><p>Aqueous humor samples were assayed for levofloxacin or moxifloxacin concentration using a validated liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC&#x02013;MS/MS) method. The LC&#x02013;MS/MS analysis was performed according to Good Laboratory Practice. Briefly, 50 &#x003bc;L of human aqueous humor samples were deproteinated with 150 &#x003bc;L of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade acetonitrile. These samples were centrifuged and 50 &#x003bc;L of the supernatant was transferred into an appropriately labeled autosampler vial containing 1 mL of HPLC-grade water. The LC&#x02013;MS/MS system was composed of a Shimadzu Prominence HPLC system and (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA)/MDS Sciex AP5000 LC&#x02013;MS/MS. The chromatographic separation was performed using a Phenomenex Luna Phenyl-Hexyl column. The mobile phase used was 85:15:0.1 ratios of water, acetonitrile and formic acid, respectively, at a flow rate of 0.75 mL/min. The levofloxacin and moxifloxacin concentrations were obtained by monitoring the MS/MS transition at 261&#x02013;362 and 384&#x02013;402 m/z, respectively, in a 5-minute LC&#x02013;MS/MS run time. Solutions of levofloxacin and moxifloxacin were each used to create a standard curve and quality control samples. The standard curve for each study medication was linear over the range of 0.0100&#x02013;10.0 &#x003bc;g/mL (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x0003e;0.998), while the quality control samples at 0.0500, 0.500, and 5.00 &#x003bc;g/mL were analyzed in repulates of six in each run. The lower limit of quantification for both moxifloxacin and levofloxacin was 0.3 &#x003bc;g/mL. The inter-day accuracy (% bias) and precision (% coefficient of variation) ranged from 3.60&#x02013;13.0 and 3.10&#x02013;9.01, respectively. Ion suppression is minimized utilizing atmospheric pressure chemical ionization inlets along with optimized chromatography to avoid interfering peaks of endogenous compounds.</p><p>For pharmacokinetic analysis, a pooled concentration vs time profile was created for each treatment arm and non-compartmental analysis was performed to determine the maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), and the linear trap ezoidal method was used to calculate the area under the concentration-time curve at 6 hours (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;6</sub>).<xref rid="b7-opth-10-783" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-opth-10-783" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>Treatment-emerged adverse events (non-ocular and ocular) were to be captured when reported, elicited or observed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Sample size (N) calculations were performed for two different powers. The assumptions for the mean concentrations and standard deviations (SD) were derived from previously published data for moxifloxacin 0.5% and levofloxacin 1.5% in aqueous humor absorption studies. Although our dosing regimen and study design (time-stratified) varied considerably from the published literature, we assumed a mean concentration of 1.0 mg/mL with an SD of 0.5 mg/mL for levofloxacin 1.5%, and a mean concentration of 0.6 mg/mL with an SD of 0.3 mg/mL for moxifloxacin 0.5%. The accepted alpha error was 0.05.</p><p>The analysis for the aqueous humor concentrations within each of the four treatment subgroups would contain approximately &#x000bc; the number of total samples. The power calculation for 50% yielded an N=7, which satisfied our estimate for an adequate number of samples in each of the four subgroups.</p><p>Baseline numeric demographic information was summarized by descriptive statistics. The sample size (N), mean, SD, median, and range values were calculated for continuous demographic variables. The number of patients and the percentage of the total were calculated for categorical variables. For the pooled aqueous humor concentrations in each of the treatment groups, N, mean, SD, median, and coefficient of variation, and range values for each time point were calculated. Since each patient contributed to this pooled non-compartmental analysis at a specified time point, a representative AUC<sub>0&#x02013;6</sub>, C<sub>max</sub>, and time to C<sub>max</sub> (T<sub>max</sub>) were determined by direct observation. The median AUC<sub>0&#x02013;6</sub> calculation was performed using the linear trapezoid method. A Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis nonparametric one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to detect differences between the concentrations in each treatment arm at various time points.</p><p>For AUC<sub>0&#x02013;6</sub> repeated measures of ANOVA were used to detect differences between the treatment groups, whereby the dependent variable was the concentration of each treatment group, the independent variables were time, treatment group, and interaction between time and treatment group. Statistical significance was set at <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05.

Research on the perioperative use of topical fluoroquinolones has revealed the abilities of several fluoroquinolones to obtain considerable concentrations at the ocular sites studied (ie, aqueous, vitreous, corneal tissue), and suggests that the abilities of these agents to acquire concentrations exceeding the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for common pathogens are a factor in the success of therapy.<xref rid="b2-opth-10-783" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b9-opth-10-783" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12-opth-10-783" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>This is the first report of a study comparing the human ocular penetration of levofloxacin 1.5% and moxifloxacin hydrochloride 0.5%.

Notably, the preparation of levofloxacin utilized in this study has a drug concentration three-fold that of the moxifloxacin preparation used.
