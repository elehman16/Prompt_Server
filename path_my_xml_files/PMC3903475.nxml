However, Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> was initially described as platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) because of its ability to hydrolyze PAF in vitro into biologically inactive lyso-PAF <xref rid="pone.0083094-Blank1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0083094-Stafforini1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, when PAF in micromolar concentrations is added to isolated human plasma, <xref rid="pone.0083094-Stafforini2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Thus, it has been postulated that Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibition may enhance PAF-mediated biology. Based on its role in platelet function, PAF accumulation could theoretically increase platelet aggregation, potentially contributing to adverse thrombotic events in the target population for which Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitors are being developed <xref rid="pone.0083094-Benveniste1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083094-Chesney1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Published evidence to date offers mixed results regarding the role of Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> activity in influencing PAF-mediated biology. Although relatively little direct evidence has been published <xref rid="pone.0083094-Henig1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083094-Naoki1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, multiple studies have reported positive associations between plasma Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> and various disorders in which PAF has been implicated, including asthma, allergic reactions, and anaphylaxis <xref rid="pone.0083094-Ito1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0083094-Vadas1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Conceptually, endogenous pathways for hydrolysis of PAF may potentially ameliorate PAF's otherwise inflammatory influence. As a result, understanding the relationship between Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> and PAF-mediated responses has been a critical step for advancing the clinical development of Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitors (darapladib and rilapladib) and initiating large-scale cardiovascular outcomes trials <xref rid="pone.0083094-ClinicalTrialsgov1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083094-ClinicalTrialsgov2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>Both darapladib and rilapladib are potent (half maximal inhibitory concentrations of 270 pM and 230 pM, respectively) and selective Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitors <xref rid="pone.0083094-Wilensky1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. As such, the highest clinical dose of darapladib (80 mg nonenteric coated or 160 mg enteric coated) can achieve approximately 80% inhibition of plasma Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> 24 hours post dose. The top clinical dose of rilapladib (250 mg enteric coated) can attain an even greater magnitude of inhibition of around 90% at the same 24-hour postdose time point, with earlier time points demonstrating essentially complete inhibition. Therefore, rilapladib represents a more robust inquiry into the relevance of Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibition to PAF-mediated biology and targets a more substantive physiology related to vascular disease. Thus, the purpose of the studies described herein was to explore the effects of the potent Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitor, rilapladib, on PAF-mediated biologic responses&#x02014;in particular, platelet aggregation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for these trials and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0083094.s002">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0083094.s003">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>In Vitro Platelet Aggregation Study</title><p>This study was conducted at GlaxoSmithKline, Upper Merion, PA, between March 15<sup>th</sup> and July 18<sup>th</sup>, 2005. Blood donors provided written informed consent to have their blood used for research, and this procedure was approved by the GlaxoSmithKline safety board. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was prepared from the blood of 10 healthy human volunteers by centrifugation at 220 g for 15 minutes (females were excluded due to possible confounding of menstrual cycles and/or estrogen therapies). After the removal of PRP, samples were centrifuged at 1500 g for 10 minutes to obtain platelet-poor plasma (PPP). Platelet-rich plasma samples were adjusted to 250,000 platelets/&#x000b5;L using autologous PPP. Light transmission aggregometry was performed using Chronolog aggregometers (Model 570-VS, Chronolog Corporation, Havertown, PA) using 100% PPP as a reference. Platelet-rich plasma samples were pretreated with 100 nM rilapladib or vehicle (DMSO) for 5 minutes prior to addition of the platelet agonist.

Statistical significance for all results was assessed by a paired t-test. Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> activity was measured in parallel using plasma samples that were derived from PRP that had been treated either with vehicle or rilapladib (100 nM) for 5 minutes using [<sup>3</sup>H]-PAF as the substrate as previously described <xref rid="pone.0083094-Oei1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

Sample size was chosen based on feasibility, with the power analysis conducted to put the sample size into the context of the statistical comparison. Based on the within-subject variability estimate (SD&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;15.6%, maximum platelet aggregation using collagen as an agonist) obtained from the preliminary analyses of a previous nonrandomized single cohort study on 14 subjects, it was calculated that a sample size of 20 subjects would provide at least 90% power to detect a difference of 15% between rilapladib and placebo using a two-sided t-test with a type I error rate of 10%. Allocation of eligible subjects was determined using a computer-generated randomization schedule, and a 1&#x02236;1 allocation ratio between 2 treatment sequences (active then placebo or placebo then active). Subject numbers were allocated to eligible subjects in sequential order. Rilapladib and placebo were in matching tablet form. The pharmacy at the investigative site was responsible for allocation and dispensing. The drug supply to the site was in treatment packs labeled as period 1 and period 2 for each individual subject. Subjects, physicians, and site staff associated with the study as well as GlaxoSmithKline teams were blinded and unaware of the allocated treatment with the exception of an unblinded pharmacist at the investigative site. The pharmacist had no direct subject contact during the trial.</p><p>Study participants were prohibited from using prescription or over-the-counter medications within 7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever was longer) prior to the study and through the follow-up visit. Anticoagulants, antiplatelets, aspirin, aspirin-containing products, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents were prohibited within 14 days before the study and through the follow-up visit. Dietary/herbal supplements including (but not limited to) St. John's wort, kava, ephedra (ma huang), gingko biloba, DHEA, yohimbe, saw palmetto, ginseng, and red yeast rice were prohibited within 14 days prior to the study. Acetaminophen (&#x02264;2 g/d) was permitted up to 48 hours prior to dosing. A total of 4 study participants took medications routinely prohibited in healthy volunteer physiology studies, including antiallergy medications (eg, cetirizine, loratadine), analgesics (propoxyphene, dextropropoxyphene+acetaminophen), and common cold medications (eg, pseudoephedrine, povidone-iodine throat gargle solution).These medications were not expected to affect subject safety or the results of the study.</p><p>Subjects were randomly assigned to receive rilapladib (SB-659032) 250 mg (non&#x02013;enteric coated formulation) or matching placebo once daily, following a low-fat breakfast, for 14 days. Upon completion of the first 14 days of treatment and a 21-day washout period (first study phase), the treatment assignments were switched, in a crossover fashion, for another 14 days of treatment, with a follow-up visit 21 days later. Therefore, the initiation of period 2 is the last follow-up day for period 1. Blood samples were collected at 0, 6, and 24 hours pre dose and post dose (respectively) on day 1 and again on day 14, and at comparable 0-, 6-, and 24-hour testing time points on day &#x02212;1 and day 35 of each treatment period (when no actual drug was administered, but time-equivalent testing was performed). The &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; time point is synonymous with the 24-hour time point of the day before (eg, day &#x02212;1).</p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>Assessments and End Points</title><p>Platelet aggregation tests were performed using 2 ADP concentrations (2 &#x000b5;M and 10 &#x000b5;M) and 4 collagen concentrations (0.7 &#x000b5;g/mL, 1.0 &#x000b5;g/mL, 1.2 &#x000b5;g/mL, and 10 &#x000b5;g/mL).The highest concentrations, 10 uM for ADP and 10 &#x000b5;g/mL for collagen, were used as the positive control. A single, participant-specific subthreshold collagen concentration was defined as the concentration (of the above) that achieved an aggregation response of less than 40% in an individual participant (established at initiation of both study periods). All platelet aggregation assessments (other than those performed as the positive control) were performed in duplicate. Additional testing was mandated if the 2 results were disparate (&#x0003e;10% apart). If none of the agonist doses resulted in less than 40% aggregation at baseline for either study period, the subject was withdrawn from the study.

The sub-maximum concentration was determined from the baseline (day &#x02212;1) data for each subject at each time point within each period independently. If, for example, the average aggregation from the baseline middle concentration at 6 hours was less than 40% for one subject, then the sub-maximum concentration would be based on the middle concentration for the 6-hour post-dose time points on all subsequent study days within that same period for that subject. After the choice of sub-maximum concentration data, baseline corrected percent maximum platelet aggregation data were derived by subtracting the baseline aggregation from the post-dose platelet aggregation for corresponding time points (eg, day 14, 6 hours - day 1, 6 hours).</p><p>The primary end point, change from baseline in maximum platelet aggregation following ADP (at 2 &#x000b5;M), was analyzed separately by a mixed-effects ANOVA model, fitting fixed terms for regimen, period, day, time, an interaction term for regimen*day*time, and subject as a random effect. Baseline was included as a covariate in the model. Point estimates and 90% confidence intervals for the difference in active-placebo at each time point on days 1 and 14 and the follow-up (21 days after the last dose of the study drug) were calculated.

Platelet aggregation responses were assessed for each study participant at each time point, using 8 levels of collagen concentration (0.3 &#x000b5;g/mL, 0.4 &#x000b5;g/mL, 0.6 &#x000b5;g/mL, 0.8 &#x000b5;g/mL, 1.0 &#x000b5;g/mL, 1.2 &#x000b5;g/mL, 1.5 &#x000b5;g/mL, 2.0 &#x000b5;g/mL; Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX). These levels were established from fitting a population model to results from period 1 of the previous study so as to optimize estimation of EC<sub>50</sub> values, and were subsequently validated using pilot data. In addition, a positive and negative control (10 &#x000b5;g/mL and 0.0 &#x000b5;g/mL, respectively) were performed on PRP.</p><p>Blood samples (approximately 18 mL) were drawn into 0.32% weight/volume (w/v) sodium citrate. Platelet-rich plasma was prepared from blood by centrifugation at 200&#x000d7; g for 15 minutes at 20&#x000b0;C. Following removal of PRP, samples were centrifuged at 1700&#x000d7; g for 10 minutes to obtain PPP. Platelet-rich plasma samples were adjusted to 200&#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L with autologous PPP. Light transmittance measurement of platelet aggregation was obtained in Aggregation Remote Analyser Module System (AggRAM) platelet aggregometers (Model 8JF52001, Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX) using 100% PRP as a reference for 100% platelet aggregation and 100% PPP as a reference for 0% platelet aggregation. Platelet aggregation assays were performed within 3 hours of blood collection; only fasted, nonlipemic, nonhemolyzed plasma was used. Aggregation studies were performed at the study center; samples were prepared and shipped to Quest Diagnostics (Van Nuys, CA) for measuring Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> activity. Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> activity was measured in parallel using [<sup>3</sup>H]-PAF as the substrate as previously described <xref rid="pone.0083094-Oei1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

An initial step in the analysis was to obtain common estimated values for slope &#x003b3;, minimum effect (E<sub>min</sub>), and maximum effect (E<sub>max</sub>) for the study population using data collected at baseline time points. Following log<sub>e</sub> transformation of the collagen concentration, platelet aggregation data (in % scale based on optimal aggregometry at baseline [0, 6, and 24 hours]) were used to fit a nonlinear mixed model using the maximum likelihood approach. The estimated slope &#x003b3;, E<sub>min</sub>, and E<sub>max</sub> were then used as fixed values for all further modelling. From the model, the collagen log-concentration that corresponded with EC<sub>50</sub> could be derived for each subject at each baseline and post-dose time point (ie, hour 6 on day 1; hour 0 and hour 6 on day 14 and day 35).</p><p>The primary end point for this study was the difference between treatment groups in EC<sub>50</sub> values 21 days after the last study dose (ie, day 35). A leftward shift, indicating a decrease in the collagen concentration versus the aggregation curve, would be indicative of enhanced platelet aggregation.</p><p>Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models were used to assess the treatment effect at all 3 days (day 1, day 14, and day 35), using the mean EC<sub>50</sub> across predose and 6-hour observations as outcome and adjusting for the baseline mean EC<sub>50</sub> (average of EC<sub>50</sub> values from 3 replicate baseline time points). A separate analysis was carried out for each time point (predose or 6 hours) and was similarly adjusted for baseline mean EC<sub>50</sub>.</p><p>The clinically relevant equivalence criterion was originally established at 15%; however, collagen EC<sub>50</sub> values provided from a pilot study of 4 repeat assessments over a 2-month duration revealed fluctuations from baseline of approximately 23%, without any treatment administration. Based on these data, a reduction in EC<sub>50</sub> of less than 25% was considered a conservative threshold for demonstrating a lack of enhanced aggregation, and the protocol was amended accordingly prior to study dosing.</p><p>The parallel-group study was powered to demonstrate a lack of effect of 14 days of repeat oral doses of 250 mg of rilapladib in platelet aggregation using an equivalence margin of 25% (ie, the lower bound of 95% CIs for the ratio of active drug&#x02236;placebo in EC<sub>50</sub> on day 35&#x0003e;75%). This was evaluated using a noninferiority testing framework based on a clinically specified noninferiority boundary of 75%. A sample size of 40 (&#x0223c;20 subjects per treatment group) would provide at least 90% power to demonstrate lack of effect, assuming a standard deviation of 0.27, modeled based on the data collected in a previous study. The study was organized in up to 3 cohorts of 28 subjects, with the option to halt the study after one or 2 cohorts based on the observed level of variability in the first cohort assessed in an unblinded fashion.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>In Vitro Platelet Aggregation Study</title><p>Mean (&#x000b1; standard error [SE]) Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> activity among the samples treated with vehicle and rilapladib was 27.0 (&#x000b1;2.5) nmol/min/mL and 0.69 (&#x000b1;0.14) nmol/min/mL, respectively, representing a 98% reduction in enzyme activity (vs vehicle) in the rilapladib samples.</p><p>In this study, there was no demonstrable effect of rilapladib on platelet aggregation (vs vehicle) when ADP, collagen, or PAF was used as an agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083094-g002">Figure 2</xref>, panels A, B, and C, respectively).

Although Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> can hydrolyze PAF in vitro, and appreciating that other metrics of platelet activity were not tested, these data suggest that inhibiting this enzyme in vivo offers at best limited alteration in PAF-mediated biology, measured in this instance by platelet aggregation.</p><p>Given that prior addition of rilapladib to human PRP, resulting in complete inhibition of Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub>, did not influence the concentration response curve of PAF-stimulated human platelet aggregation, we began to corroborate these compelling in-vitro findings in human subjects. In an initial, uncontrolled, single-dose pilot study with rilapladib involving 14 healthy adult volunteers (unpublished data not shown here), a proaggregatory signal (vs baseline) was observed 6 hours post dose and after a 2-week follow-up period, prompting additional studies to explore the potential proaggregatory effects of Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibition in a more rigorous manner. Using more robust methods, the additional studies described herein consistently demonstrate a lack of effect of Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibition on platelet aggregation. In the crossover study described in this report, which used the sub-maximum concentration chosen among 3 fixed levels using a priori rule (&#x0003c;40%), an overall lack of effect on platelet aggregation with rilapladib was observed. However, the nominal signal with collagen 21 days after the last study dose, as well as the variability inherent in single-dose assays, led to the design and conduct of the more definitive E<sub>max</sub> method. The E<sub>max</sub> method offers the greatest precision by characterizing the complete aggregation dose response for each study participant at each time point to compare mean EC<sub>50</sub> values for the aggregation responses between treatment groups. These data were more reproducible over time, and did not depend on the selection of a correct sub-threshold agonist concentration. Demonstrating less than a 25% increase in aggregation, the smallest detectable difference outside of assay error and a range considered to have no impact on coagulation, diminishes the chance of a clinically relevant platelet-induced adverse effect from rilapladib or darapladib therapies. Further, the absence of any trend toward aggregation at every time point in vitro and in vivo from our clinical data does not suggest a critical role of Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibition in enhancing PAF-mediated biology when applied to agonist-induced platelet aggregation.</p><p>Despite these compelling clinical studies using a direct and extremely potent inhibitor of the Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> enzyme, these findings contrast with results of several previously published reports that suggest Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> (plasma PAF-AH) activity is inversely associated with disorders in which PAF has been implicated, including asthma (related to overall risk <xref rid="pone.0083094-Ito1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083094-Tsukioka1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> or severity <xref rid="pone.0083094-Miwa1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083094-Stafforini3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>) and anaphylaxis <xref rid="pone.0083094-Vadas1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. These studies were largely conducted in the Japanese population, in which a common Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> gene variant (Val279Phe) is associated with reduced (heterozygotes; 27% of the population) or complete lack (homozygotes; 4% of the population) <xref rid="pone.0083094-Miwa1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083094-Stafforini4" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> of plasma Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> activity. However, similar findings on associations between Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> and asthma risk have also been reported with other gene variants in non-Japanese populations <xref rid="pone.0083094-Kruse1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083094-Triggiani1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Consistent findings have not been observed across all studies with the Val279Phe variant. In one study involving individuals homozygous or heterozygous for the Val279Phe gene variant, plasma Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> activity was not associated with asthma prevalence, type (atopic vs nonatopic), or severity <xref rid="pone.0083094-Satoh1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Aside from the studies described herein, relatively little &#x0201c;direct&#x0201d; experimental evidence is available describing the effects of PAF inhalation-mediated responses. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial <xref rid="pone.0083094-Henig1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, 14 subjects with mild atopic asthma received either recombinant human PAF-AH (ie, Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub>; target plasma concentration of &#x0003e;10 &#x000b5;g/mL) or placebo followed by exposure (inhaled) to subject-specific allergen (based on skin prick testing). In this study, treatment with recombinant PAF-AH was not associated with statistically significant differences (vs placebo) in pulmonary function or in early or late asthmatic responses following bronchial allergen challenge <xref rid="pone.0083094-Henig1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Another clinical study evaluated the effects of inhaled PAF on pulmonary function and inflammatory cell kinetics in 8 healthy individuals homozygous for the Val279Phe variant and 16 age-matched and sex-matched controls (6 who were heterozygous for the variant and 10 with the wild-type allele) <xref rid="pone.0083094-Naoki1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. While these subjects were not asthmatic, there were no statistically significant differences in the percent decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub> following PAF inhalation among the 3 Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> genotypes. Specifically, a decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub> of greater than 10% was observed in 3 subjects (38%) with PAF-AH deficiency and in 5 subjects (31%) from the control group. Transient neutropenia following PAF inhalation also did not differ among genotypes in magnitude or duration <xref rid="pone.0083094-Naoki1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This latter, more direct, study suggests that the impact of administered PAF is little influenced by the level of LpPLA<sub>2</sub> activity.</p><p>Two interpretations of the findings presented herein are (1) PAF is not a predominant factor in the underlying inflammatory processes in platelet aggregation, or (2) PAF-AH (Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub>) is not a principal mechanism involved in inactivating PAF in vivo. The possibility that Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> may not be principally involved in the hydrolysis and inactivation of PAF in vivo is further supported by the enzyme kinetics. In particular, the Michaelis constant (Km) of Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> for PAF is reported to be &#x0223c;14 &#x000b5;M; however, PAF elicits biologic responses at nanomolar concentrations <xref rid="pone.0083094-Sawyer1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083094-Snyder1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, which is consistent with findings in the present in vitro platelet aggregation study. Furthermore, it has been reported that the half-life for PAF in plasma or whole blood (both of which contain secreted Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub>) from otherwise healthy individuals is approximately 5 minutes <xref rid="pone.0083094-Yoshida1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. These enzyme characteristics tend to question the role of Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> in hydrolyzing and inactivating physiologic relevant concentrations of PAF in vivo since this phospholipid mediator is biologically active in the low nM range, having a calculated dissociation constant (Kd) for its receptor of around 1 nM <xref rid="pone.0083094-Hwang1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, a concentration of PAF that is more in line to what is found circulating in humans <xref rid="pone.0083094-Vadas1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. These data are consistent with a recent report by Liu et al, which suggests that rapid clearance of PAF by endothelial cell rich organs, such as the liver, represents the major route of in vivo PAF catabolism rather than Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> activity when assessed in Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;deficient mice. <xref rid="pone.0083094-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>In a previous 12-week clinical trial of coronary heart disease (CHD) or CHD-risk equivalent subjects (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;959), administration of darapladib, a less potent Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitor than rilapladib, did not induce a change in biomarkers related to platelet activity (P-selectin, CD40 ligand, or urinary 11-dehydrothromboxane B2) <xref rid="pone.0083094-Mohler1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. These markers, which might be suspected to be up-regulated in the setting of increased PAF influence, do not appear altered by LpPLA2 inhibition, consistent with our findings. In this study, darapladib achieved an approximately 80% inhibition of Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> using the same radiometric assay used in our two current studies with rilapladib, which demonstrated Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibition of &#x0223c;90% <xref rid="pone.0083094-Mohler1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Therefore, in the clinical studies presented herein, as well as in the biomarker study, there was at best a vanishingly small level of Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> activity available for influencing PAF catabolism, particularly when considering physiologically relevant low nM levels of PAF. In addition, one might argue that the more potent effects of rilapladib make this agent the more compelling approach to test the potential effect of residual PAF on biologic functions such as platelet aggregation, as we have done in the studies described in this report.</p><p>A profoundly hypercoagulable state (in contrast to the cohorts of our studies) could result in a proclivity toward platelet aggregation not observed in healthy controls. Such a concern is perhaps offset by the experimental design of full collagen-induced aggregation used in the current study. Further, although only one platelet agonist (collagen) was used in the E<sub>max</sub> model, collagen operates through multiple platelet pathways, thereby representing a fairly robust platelet aggregation signal. In addition, despite observing the anticipated contrasts in platelet aggregation throughout the day (circadian variation), ex vivo studies did not include a positive control for potentiation of platelet aggregation. Our studies were exclusively performed in men, and thus although it is not clear that our findings can be extended to women, it would be reasonable to expect similar findings in women. Finally, while platelet aggregation incorporates many elements of platelet function and activity, there are other metrics of platelet activity and/or biology that we did not test.</p><p>In conclusion, these data suggest that near-complete Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> (PAF-AH) inhibition did not substantially influence platelet aggregation preclinically in vitro or clinically ex vivo in male subjects. These data support the notion that PAF hydrolysis does not factor critically into the physiologic phenotype of platelet thrombogenicity that is, for example, associated with myocardial infarction and other thrombotic disorders. Further studies are necessary to conclusively determine the influence of Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> on PAF-mediated biology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0083094.s001"><label>File S1</label><caption><p>
