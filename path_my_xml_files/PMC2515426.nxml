Most of the benefit of ACE inhibitors in these patients is due to blockade of both plasma and tissue renin-angiotensin system, activated during the early phase of myocardial infarction (Omland et al 1993; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Walsh et al 1999</xref>).</p><p>Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a constellation of cardiovascular risk factors, such as abdominal obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance or glucose intolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Eckel et al 2005</xref>), and it is associated with an increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Hu et al 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Hunt et al 2004</xref>). MS has a prevalence of 15%&#x02013;20% in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Ford et al 2002</xref>) but it occurs in nearly 50% of unselected patients with acute myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Zeller et al 2005</xref>). In these patients MS further enhances the risk of death from all causes as well as the risk of cardiovascular complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Ninomiya et al 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Levantesi et al 2005</xref>). Recent evidence supports the hypothesis that the hyperinsulinemia that characterizes the subjects with MS may be associated with an overexpression of vascular angiotensin II-AT<sub>1</sub> receptors leading to an exaggerated activation of the tissue renin-angiotensin system, a condition particularly harmful in patients with acute myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Muller et al 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Zhang et al 2005</xref>). For this reason ACE inhibition may play a key role in patients with myocardial infarction and MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Prasad and Quyyumi 2004</xref>).</p><p>Zofenopril calcium is a sulfhydryl ACE inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Borghi et al 2004</xref>) which has been shown in the SMILE (Survival of Myocardial Infarction Long-term Evaluation) Study to improve both short- and long-term outcome when administered within the first 24 hours of an acute myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Ambrosioni et al 1995</xref>). The present study is a post-hoc analysis of the SMILE Study to evaluate the effects of the early administration of zofenopril on the clinical outcome in a subgroup of patients with (MS+) and without MS (MS&#x02212;).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The SMILE Study included 1556 patients admitted to 154 Italian coronary care units who were randomized to study treatment with an ACE inhibitor or placebo in addition to recommended pharmacological treatment. Details of the study protocol have been published elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Ambrosioni et al 1995</xref>). In the main SMILE Study, eligible patients were considered those of either gender, aged 18&#x02013;80 years, presenting to the intensive care unit within 24 hours of the onset of chest pain typically associated with electrocardiographic signs of myocardial infarction of the anterior wall and not eligible for thrombolytic therapy because of late admission to the intensive care unit or contraindications to systemic fibrinolysis. Upon enrollment patients were randomly allocated according to fixed blocks to receive oral zofenopril or placebo.</p><p>Patients were excluded from the study if they had on admission: a) cardiogenic shock (Killip class 4), b) systolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg (measured with the patient supine), c) serum creatinine concentration above 2.5 mg/dL (221 mmol/L), d) history of congestive heart failure, e) current treatment with an ACE inhibitor, f) contraindications to the use of ACE inhibitors, or g) were unable or unwilling to give informed consent. All potentially eligible patients received standard therapy including analgesic agents, beta-blockers, nitrates, calcium antagonists, aspirin, inotropic drugs, diuretic agents, and anticoagulants as indicated.</p><p>The initial dose of study medication was 7.5 mg and was repeated after 12 hours and progressively doubled up to the final dose of 30 mg twice daily if systolic blood pressure remained above 100 mmHg and there were no signs or symptoms of hypotension. Patients were evaluated while they were in the hospital (between day 7 and day 15 from index myocardial infarction) after 4 weeks, and at the end of the double-blind treatment period (6 weeks), during which time they could be treated with any other drug except ACE inhibitors. On completion of the 6-week double-blind period, the patients stopped taking the study medications but continued treatment in an open-label fashion for additional 11 months (&#x000b1;1) when their vital status was blindly evaluated.</p><p>The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Bologna as well as by the local ethics committees when required. All patients provided written informed consent prior to inclusion into the study.

Death or presence of severe congestive heart failure was considered as a single event for each patient and their prevalence was calculated according to whichever occurred first.</p><p>The causes of death were classified by the principal investigators and reviewed by an end-point committee acting on the basis of a blinded review. All deaths occurring during the trial were classified as due to cardiac or non-cardiac causes. Cardiac causes included progressive heart failure, sudden death, recurrent myocardial infarction, and cardiac rupture. Non-cardiac causes included cerebrovascular events, pulmonary embolism, and non-vascular causes. Progressive heart failure was classified on the basis of pump failure and the occurrence of cardiogenic shock. Sudden death was defined as sudden, unexpected death occurring within 1 hour after the onset of new symptoms.</p><p>Predefined secondary end point was the effect of 6-week double-blind treatment on cumulative 1-year mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The present study is a post hoc analysis of the main SMILE Study data carried out on MS+ and MS&#x02212; patients. The baseline characteristics and the distribution of the various parameters for the MS+ and MS&#x02212; patients were compared using a Chi-square test for categorical variables (with Yates&#x02019; continuity correction where appropriate) and a standard normal t-test for continuous variables. A Chi-square test was also employed to compare the frequency of metabolic risk factors between the placebo and active treatment group. Relative risk reductions and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for both the primary and secondary end point, separately for the MS+ and MS&#x02212; patients. The Chi-square analysis was applied to data with the Mantel-Haenzsel extension for the comparisons between the two treatment groups. Time-to-event curves were drawn using Kaplan-Meier estimates.

The relative risk reduction achieved in our study, even considering the differences in type of end points and treatment duration among the referred studies, and the fact that half our patients had hyperglycemia, exceeds that previously reported.</p><p>Our study also demonstrates that the prevalence of the MS in patients presenting at the hospital within 24 hours of an acute anterior myocardial infarction and not reperfused is high, in agreement with only two available publications on this topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Ninomiya et al 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Zeller et al 2005</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the reduction in morbidity and mortality observed in the SMILE post-hoc study was largely independent of blood pressure reduction, suggesting that zofenopril may affect MS+ patient&#x02019;s prognosis beyond and in addition to its hemodynamic effect. This may be plausible, since both myocardial infarction and MS are associated with a neurohumoral activation which involves the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Walsh et al 1999</xref>). In particular in MS+ patients this activation might be also related to the condition of insulin resistance and to the consequent hyperinsulinemia that has been frequently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Eckel et al 2005</xref>), and that could be responsible for a concentration-dependent overexpression of AT<sub>1</sub> receptors for angiotensin II at the tissue level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Muller et al 2000</xref>). In particular in MS+ patients with myocardial infarction, this mechanism could negatively interact with the concomitant activation of circulating renin-angiotensin-system, thereby providing a reasonable explanation for the greater preventive effects of ACE inhibition observed in the SMILE Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Prasad and Quyyumi 2004</xref>). In addition, the beneficial effects of ACE inhibition in post-myocardial infarction patients with MS can be also due to some primary protective effects of zofenopril against the deterioration of left ventricular function and the progression of the atherosclerotic disease that follows myocardial ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Frascarelli et al 2004</xref>).</p><p>Some limitations of our study also deserve to be discussed. First, the study is based on a post-hoc analysis of the SMILE Study and might be underpowered to demonstrate the study goal. However, a) it was based on 91% of the original study population, b) the randomization groups were well balanced, and c) the extent of relative risk reduction observed with zofenopril was similar or even greater than that observed in high risk patients with coronary disease treated with ACE inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Gustafsson et al 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Zuanetti et al 1997</xref>; Moye et al 1994; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">HOPE Study Group 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Daly et al 2005</xref>). Second, this post-hoc analysis was retrospective. However, since no prospective studies on the acute benefit of ACE inhibition in MS+ patients with non-thrombolyzed acute myocardial infarction are available, we must rely on evidence provided by the retrospective data which are the only data available for analysis. Third, for the definition of MS we rely on a modified NCEP ATP III classification, ie, we used body mass index as a surrogate of waist circumference for defining abdominal obesity. Recent data suggest that the use of body mass index for the definition of MS do not negatively affect the assessment of the prevalence and prognostic impact of this condition in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Hunt et al 2004</xref>). Moreover, we have a posteriori verified that this co-linearity exists in a subgroup of the cohort that is still continuously followed up.</p><p>In conclusion, results of this post-hoc analysis of the SMILE Study demonstrate the striking benefit of early administration of zofenopril in MS+ patients with acute anterior myocardial infarction and suggest the use of ACE inhibitors for the routine treatment of such patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Authors wish to thank Menarini group (Firenze, Italy) for the unconditioned support to the SMILE study group.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ambrosioni</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Borghi</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Magnani</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The effect of the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor zofenopril on mortality and morbidity after anterior myocardial infarction.
