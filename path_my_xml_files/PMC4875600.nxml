In order to reduce the dysfunction rates it is recommended to identify and preserve the pelvic autonomic nerves during the surgical procedure. However, visual nerve identification especially of those located in the minor pelvis (inferior hypogastric plexus, pelvic splanchnic nerves and neurovascular bundles) is challenging due to the complexity of neural distribution and further patient as well as surgery related factors such as a narrow or deep pelvic cavity, the appearance of a voluminous mesorectum, severe obesity, previous pelvic surgery, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, locally advanced tumors with anterior quadrant involvement, supra-anal or juxta-anal tumors, adherence or infiltration of adjacent organs, a bloody situs, use of additional diathermy coagulation and the applied dissection techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Therefore, poor nerve visualization and lack of neuroanatomical knowledge will consequently result in inadvertent nerve damage.</p><p>Pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring (pIONM) was introduced to rectal cancer surgery to serve as a novel method for improvement of nerve identification and further verification of its functional integrity. In previous investigations it could be already shown that the electrophysiological nerve identification is superior to sole visual assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A recently developed pIONM method is based on electric stimulations of pelvic autonomic nerves under simultaneous observation of processed electromyography (EMG) of the internal anal sphincter (IAS) and manometry of the urinary bladder. Its suitability for accurate assessment of nerve function and its predictive potential of functional outcome has been demonstrated by previous non-randomized single-center studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In a recent case-control study pIONM controlled TME in rectal cancer patients was found to offer better functional outcome compared to patients undergoing surgery without the use of this method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. An actual retrospective investigation supports these findings by demonstrating superior urogenital function in patients undergoing rectal cancer surgery with electrophysiological control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The results are encouraging. However, high quality evidence on the efficacy of pIONM is missing. In order to close the gap, we are conducting the first randomized multicenter trial comparing urogenital and anorectal functional outcome in rectal cancer patients undergoing TME with or without pIONM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective of this trial is to assess urinary functional outcome in rectal cancer patients undergoing TME with pIONM, when compared to TME without pIONM, in a 12&#x000a0;months follow-up period per patient.

A higher score indicates diminished urinary function and quality of life.

The FSFI has been developed and validated as a brief, multidimensional self-report instrument for assessing the key dimensions of sexual function in women. It was designed and validated for assessment of female sexual function and quality of life in clinical trials and has demonstrated ability to discriminate between clinical and non-clinical populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The FSFI is a 19-item questionnaire with a total score range from 2 to 36 points. A lower score indicates diminished sexual function. The IIEF has been developed and validated as a brief and reliable self-administered scale for assessing erectile function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The IIEF is a 19-item questionnaire with a total score range from 5 to 75 points.

The primary endpoint is based on previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In a group of 61 patients undergoing mesorectal excision for rectal cancer we observed long-term urinary deterioration in 13 patients determined by the IPSS. The median difference in the IPSS was 6 points (range: 1-25 points, interquartile range: 4-8 points). Answers to additional questions on the Qol ranged from 0 (delighted) to 6 (terrible). We found that an increase of the IPSS by at least 5 points leads to a clear decrease in patients&#x02019; quality of life due to urinary symptoms (median difference in the Qol score was 3 points (interquartile range: 2-4 points)).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Secondary endpoints</title><p>Secondary endpoint is the reduction of FSFI/IIEF by at least 8/15 points 12&#x000a0;months after surgery compared to the preoperative FSFI/IIEF per patient. The secondary endpoint is analyzed separately for men and women. No confirmatory analyses are planned for this endpoint. Another secondary endpoint is the change of the WVS observed 12&#x000a0;months after surgery compared to the preoperative score per patient. For assessment of safety, especially oncologic safety adverse events, the rates of pCRM-positive specimen (distance of tumor from circumferential resection margin&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;mm) and the quality of TME will be documented.

To observe IAS activity, bipolar needle electrodes (530228, CE 0297, inomed, Emmendingen, Germany) are inserted transanally under endosonographic guidance. The ground electrode (530627, CE 0297, inomed, Emmendingen, Germany) is placed on the left gluteal muscle and the electrodes are connected to the neuromonitoring device. The impedance is measured to ensure correct placement. Simultaneous observation of intravesical pressure is carried out through the transurethral bladder catheter or if applicable suprapubic catheter. The catheter is connected to a pressure transducer (520320, CE 0297, inomed, Emmendingen, Germany), which is linked to the amplifier of the neuromonitoring device. Thereby both measurements could be continuously visualized as neuromonitoring signals online on the screen of the system. Before the onset of neurostimulation the bladder is emptied and filled with 200&#x000a0;ml of Ringers&#x02019; solution. Stimulation parameters are set to currents of 1-25&#x000a0;mA, frequency of 30&#x000a0;Hz, and monophasic rectangular pulses with pulse duration of 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;s.</p><p>According to previous investigations a stimulation dependent unilateral or bilateral consecutive increase in intravesical pressure (cmH<sub>2</sub>O) or processed EMG amplitude (V) of IAS will be rated as positive response verifying functional integrity of urinary and anorectal innervation. With regard to sexual function bilaterally observed positive results by manometry and IAS-EMG were valued as preserved genital innervation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring (pIONM)</title><p>Stimulation of the pelvic autonomic nerve during mesorectal dissection is performed by the surgeon with a handheld bipolar microfork probe (EW0266 and 522027, CE 0297, inomed, Emmendingen, Germany) and served for identification and verification of functional nerve integrity.</p><p>Initial neurostimulations are carried out bilaterally after posterior/posterolateral mesorectal dissection in order to detect the pelvic splanchnic nerves. Therefore, bilateral repetitive stimulations along the pelvic sidewall are carried out (stimulation period 3-10 seconds and resting period in between the stimulations of 3-10 seconds) as a kind of neuromapping under continuous observation of processed IAS-EMG. During ongoing lateral mesorectal dissection neuromapping is performed under simultaneous manometry of the urinary bladder and IAS-EMG for identification of further potentially surgical exposed nervous tissue (pelvic splanchnic nerves S2-4, inferior hypogastric plexus).</p><p>Anterolateral mesorectal dissection is performed with neuromapping under continuous processed IAS-EMG. For quality assurance of the nerve-sparing technique after TME (resection of specimen), the autonomic innervation is finally verified by bilateral neuromapping along the pelvic sidewall and just above the pelvic floor under simultaneous manometry of the urinary bladder and IAS-EMG.

The ITT population includes all randomized patients for which a preoperative and postoperative measurement of IPSS is available. Patients will be analyzed in the treatment group to which they were randomized. In addition, analyses for the Per-Protocol population will be performed. Only patients with a minimum of compliance to the study protocol will be included into the Per-Protocol population. Relevant violations of the study protocol will be defined in the statistical analysis plan, which is finalized before the database is closed and unblinded. Differences between rates of patients with an IPSS increased by at least 5 points 12&#x000a0;months after surgery compared to the preoperative IPSS will be evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed rank test (two-sided, alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05). Patients for which no postoperative IPSS is available will be excluded from the confirmatory analysis of the primary endpoint due to missing information about postoperative urinary function. Missing IPSS scores 12&#x000a0;months after surgery will be imputed according to the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method if a postoperative IPSS is available. Postoperative IPSS measured under the influence of additional therapies against urinary dysfunction must not be used. Therefore, the last observed IPSS before urologic treatment will be analyzed. As dropout rates and imputed missing values are expected to be equal in both study arms no selection bias is expected by the application of these procedures. The secondary outcome parameters will be analyzed only descriptively. Preoperative IPSS, IPSS 12&#x000a0;months after surgery and intra-individual changes of IPSS within 12&#x000a0;months after surgery will be analyzed by distributional parameters such as mean, median, range and standard deviation separately for each study arm. An analogous analysis will be performed for the IIEF in male patients, the FSFI in female patients and the WVS. For male patients the rates of patients with an IIEF reduced by at least 15 points 12&#x000a0;months after surgery compared to the preoperative IIEF score will be displayed separately for each study arm. For female patients these rates will be calculated for the FSFI analogously. The threshold for discretizing the change in FSFI within 12&#x000a0;months after surgery is set to 8 points.</p><p>For the safety population summaries and listings of safety data will be performed. Frequencies of subjects experiencing at least one adverse event will be displayed by body system and preferred term according to MedDRA terminology. Detailed information collected for each adverse event will include: A description of the event, duration, whether the adverse event was serious, intensity, relationship to trial treatment, action taken and clinical outcome. Summary tables will present the number of subjects observed with adverse events and corresponding percentages. Additional subcategories will be based on event intensity and relationship to trial treatment.

In consequence maintaining quality of life receives particular attention among colorectal surgeons aiming for best performance of intraoperative nerve-sparing. This is reinforced by the fact that the incidence of colorectal cancer diagnosed in young adults did significantly increase as demonstrated by a recent retrospective cohort study in 393241 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Based on current trends it was stated that in 2030, the incidence rate for rectal cancer will increase by 124.2&#x000a0;%, respectively, for patients 20 to 34&#x000a0;years and by 46.0&#x000a0;%, respectively, for patients 35 to 49&#x000a0;years in the United States.</p><p>The prerequisite for intraoperative pelvic autonomic nerve preservation is the nerve identification. Only a few authors reported their rather higher or lower nerve identification rates while many others do not specifically provide such information but state its difficulty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In addition to knowledge about aggravating circumstances and confounding factors, the recognition of key zones at risk of harm to the autonomic nerves is another important step for improvement of the nerve-sparing technique regardless of whether TME is performed minimally invasive or open via a transabdominal or transanal approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In order to master intraoperative nerve-sparing the surgeon must rise to these challenges and take the lead in shifting towards aiming for a more sustainable quality of life.</p><p>The start however must be made in the informed consent discussion. A recent survey of rectal cancer patients undergoing surgery demonstrated that about 50&#x000a0;% of patients could not recall a preoperative discussion of risks to urinary, sexual and bowel function. Interestingly, they did desire more information regarding the occurrence of these possible dysfunctions than information on cure rate, need for second surgery, or the ability of surgery to treat their symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>The pIONM may offer improvement of intraoperative nerve visualization and could be particularly beneficial with regard to all the confounding factors. Nevertheless, up to now there are no data from prospective randomized studies for comparing the functional outcome after TME for rectal cancer with and without pIONM. The aim of the present study is to evaluate whether pIONM is a valuable method for maintaining patient&#x02019;s urogenital and anorectal function. This conducted prospective randomized multicenter trial will thereby demonstrate the efficacy, accuracy and safety of pIONM. Furthermore, potential advantages or disadvantages of this method can be analyzed. The study might also help to identify patients who would particularly benefit from pIONM.</p><p>With a view to primary prevention, pIONM may represent a useful tool for improvement of the nerve-sparing surgical technique in the minor pelvis. The additional quality assurance of pelvic autonomic nerve preservation after TME with predictability of postoperative urogenital and neurogenic ano(-neo)rectal dysfunctions could serve a secondary preventive function in enabling timely delivered commencement of causal urological-/sexological and proctological treatments with the potential for an improved prognosis in those patients with functional disturbances.</p><p>This is the first randomized multicenter trial comparing urogenital and anorectal functional outcome in rectal cancer patients undergoing TME with and without pIONM. If indeed found to be beneficial, pIONM will offer maintenance of patients&#x02019; quality of life and possibly decrease the amount of diagnostic and treatment costs of postoperative functional disturbances.</p><sec id="Sec32"><title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title><p>The trial is conducted according to ICH-GCP and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki in its latest version.
