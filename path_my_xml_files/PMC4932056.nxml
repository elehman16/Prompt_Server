vibration treatment after eccentric exercise can reduce muscle soreness and enhance muscle
recovery. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty untrained participants were randomly assigned to
two groups: a vibration group (n=10) and control group (n=10). Participants performed
eccentric quadriceps training of 4 sets of 5 repetitions at 120% 1RM, with 4&#x02005;min rest
between sets. After that, the vibration group received 3 sets of 1&#x02005;min whole body
vibration (12&#x02005;Hz, 4&#x02005;mm) with 30&#x02005;s of passive recovery between sets. Serum creatine kinase,
blood urea nitrogen, muscle soreness (visual analog scale) and muscle strength (peak
isometric torque) were assessed. [Results] Creatine kinase was lower in the vibration
group than in the control group at 24&#x02005;h (200.2 &#x000b1; 8.2 vs. 300.5 &#x000b1; 26.1 U/L) and at 48&#x02005;h
(175.2 &#x000b1; 12.5 vs. 285.2 &#x000b1; 19.7 U/L) post-exercise. Muscle soreness decreased in vibration
group compared to control group at 48&#x02005;h post-exercise (34.1 &#x000b1; 11.4 vs. 65.2 &#x000b1; 13.2&#x02005;mm).
[Conclusion] Single whole-body vibration treatment after eccentric exercise reduced
delayed onset muscle soreness but it did not affect muscle strength recovery.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Eccentric exercise</kwd><kwd>Whole-body vibration</kwd><kwd>Recovery</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Strength training involving repetitive eccentric exercises can cause muscle damage,
resulting in muscle soreness, swelling and eventually reduction of muscle strength,
especially when an athlete is unaccustomed to this type of muscle contraction<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies have found significant
increases in self-reported pain after performing eccentric exercises involving the elbow
flexor<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. A reduction in explosive force
and increase of muscle soreness have also been reported after 12 sets of 10 eccentric squats
in active physical education students<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.
This muscle damage is usually defined as delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), and it
appears between 8 to 20 hours after the exercise reaching its peak between 24 to 48 hours
after the damage<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In physiological terms,
DOMS is characterized by a sensation of pain felt during movement or palpation of the
affected muscle<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Inflammation, increased
serum creatine kinase (CK) levels, muscle force loss, and decrease in performance have also
been observed during this period<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recently, whole-body vibration (WBV) has been proposed as a recovery treatment for reducing
muscle soreness and muscle force loss after exercise<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Rhea et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that applying WBV after strenuous
resistance training and repeated sprints is effective at reducing the potential pain after a
training session. Similar results were found when WBV was applied before 6 sets of 10
maximal isokinetic eccentric contractions of the dominant-limb knee extensors<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, the application of vibrations at a
frequency of 30&#x02005;Hz before 70%RM and 90%RM resistance exercises suppressed increases in the
stress hormone epinephrine levels immediately after exercise<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, WBV appears to be effective regardless of the exposure
time to vibration or moment (i.e. before or after performing the eccentric exercise).
Several mechanisms could explain the benefits of WBV as a recovery tool for DOMS. WBV may
increase blood flow and oxygen delivery to the muscles<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, and decrease the pain
perception responses<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, WBV
may avoid the disruption of muscle sarcomeres that occurs during eccentric exercises, and
therefore prevent DOMS<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, the evidence regarding the use of WBV to reduce DOMS is controversial and limited.
While some authors have found WBV to positively influence DOMS<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, others have concluded
that the application of WBV after eccentric exercise does not alleviate the signs of muscle
damage (levels of serum CK and muscle soreness) compared to other traditional ways of
recovery (i.e. stretching exercise or massage)<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The large number of WBV training parameters (vibration type, frequency, amplitude, rest
interval between bouts and body position)<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> together with limited existing research on the topic make it
difficult to draw definitive conclusions on the effectiveness of WBV and the best recovery
treatment to reduce DOMS signs. Furthermore, the aforementioned studies implemented
protocols with several vibration sessions after exercise, but to date no research has
analyzed if a single session of WBV after eccentric exercise is enough to reduce muscle
damage and stimulate the recovery process. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine
whether or not a single whole-body vibration treatment after eccentric strength training can
reduce muscle soreness and enhance muscle recovery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The experiment was approved by the Committee of Biomedical Ethics of the University of
Extremadura (Spain) on May 6th, 2014, whose chairman was Mr. Fernando Henao (dossier number
31/2014), and it was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki.</p><p>Twenty-nine untrained university students signed up voluntarily for the study. Nine
participants were excluded from the study because they did not want to provide blood samples
(n=4), had some form of musculoskeletal problems (n=2) or participated in a fitness program
more than once per week (n=3). As a result, 20 participants were randomly assigned to the
vibration group (n=10) or the control group (n=10). The participants were asked to maintain
their lifestyle, not to take any medication or nutritional supplements, and not to perform
any exercise or sports activity during the period of the intervention. Each volunteer was
informed of the experimental procedure. Informed consent was obtained from all the
participants in the study.</p><p>The participants attended the laboratory on 4 occasions and had to complete all sessions at
the same time each day. Five days before their eccentric training, all the participants
performed a familiarization session involving the same kind of exercises to be performed in
the subsequent training sessions. On the same day, peak quadriceps leg extension strength of
1 repetition maximum (1RM)<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> was set and
the workload for the eccentric exercise at 120% 1RM was calculated. During the first
experimental visit, before starting the eccentric exercise session, blood samples were
collected and stored for subsequent analysis. Moreover, muscle soreness and peak isometric
torque (PIT) were evaluated. Later, participants performed the eccentric strength training
consisting of a 5-minute warm-up (30% of 1RM) and 4 sets of 5 repetitions at 120% 1RM, with
4&#x02005;min rest between sets, on a quadriceps leg extension (Selection Med machine, Technogym,
Spain). Movement was performed with both limbs in a neutral position and along a range of
motion of 90&#x000b0;. Subjects were asked to complete each repetition with maximal effort and a
slow controlled movement (2&#x02005;s) during the eccentric phase. During the concentric phase of
the movement, two assistants replaced the lift arm of the weight machine in the initial
position using a mechanical jack, so participants did not make any effort during this phase.
Five minutes. after performing the eccentric training, the participants received 3 sets of
1&#x02005;min whole body vibration (12&#x02005;Hz, 4&#x02005;mm) with 30 s of passive recovery between each set
(vibration group), or an identical protocol with the vibratory platform turned off (control
group). No information about the potential effects of the vibration treatment was given to
the participants to minimize psychological effects. An oscillating vibratory platform
(Galileo Fitness, Novotec Medical, Germany) was used. All the participants were asked to
stand on the platform barefoot in a static squat position with their knees bent 30&#x000b0; (full
extension=0&#x000b0;), hands on hips, and trunk straight. Joint angle was measured with a goniometer
(12-1001HR, Baseline, USA). The vibration protocol was chosen based on previous research
that showed that using similar frequencies leads to improvements in muscle recovery<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Assessments occurred immediately after the vibration, and at 24&#x02005;h and 48&#x02005;h
post-exercise.</p><p>Body weight and height were measured in the first session using a portable measuring
station (Seca 220, Germany).</p><p>Blood samples (5&#x02005;ml) were collected to assess serum CK and blood urea nitrogen (BUN)
concentrations. Samples were drawn from the antecubital vein at each measurement time point:
pre-exercise, post-exercise, and 24&#x02005;h and 48&#x02005;h post-exercise. Before analysis, the serum was
separated and frozen at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C. Serum concentrations were determined by a dry-chemistry
automated multi-analyzer (Spotchem EZ SP-4430, Menarini diagnostics, UK) using standard
Menarini test strips. The level of muscle soreness was evaluated using a 100-mm visual
analogue scale (VAS), with 0 at the left endpoint representing no pain and 100 at the right
endpoint representing extreme pain. All of the participants were asked to point to their
level of perceived soreness on the VAS while they maintained a static squat position with
their knees flexed at 30&#x000b0; for 5 s. Muscle strength was assessed by recording PIT through
dominant-limb knee extensor testing on an isokinetic dynamometer (System 3, Biodex Medical
Systems, USA). Participants performed two 5-s maximal isometric contractions at a knee joint
angle of 45&#x000b0; (0&#x000b0; was considered as full extension), with a 1&#x02005;min rest between each maximal
effort. They were asked to generate maximal force as fast as possible when the signal was
given. Finally, the highest PIT value of both measurements was recorded for analysis.
Dynamometer calibration and protocol procedures were performed in accordance with the
instructions provided by the manufacturer.</p><p>The statistical analysis was carried out with SPSS 19.0 computer software for Windows. The
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was conducted in order to verify the normality of the data
distribution, and Levene&#x02019;s test was used to assess the homogeneity of variance. Comparisons
between the intervention conditions (vibration vs control) over time for each variable were
subjected to two-way repeated-measures ANOVA. Post hoc pairwise comparisons were performed
using the Bonferroni test to identify significant differences within groups from
pre-exercise values. Significance was accepted for p&#x02264;0.05, a confidence level of 95%. Means
and standard deviations (SD) were used as descriptive statistics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The general characteristics of participants are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of the participants</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Vibration group</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.2 &#x000b1; 0.5</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.4 &#x000b1; 1.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">177.1 &#x000b1; 11.5</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">175.6 &#x000b1; 5.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">75.2 &#x000b1; 11.5</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">73.2 &#x000b1; 5.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">120% 1RM (kg)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">123.0 &#x000b1; 19.2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">118.1 &#x000b1; 18.8</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are mean &#x000b1; SD.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>.

the subjects were not fatigued and had not done any strenuous physical activity prior to the
experiment. Therefore, the changes observed in the experiment resulted from the performance
of the eccentric training.</p><p>Previous studies have reported that repetitive eccentric contractions can cause broadening
or disruption of muscle sarcomeres<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. It
is known that eccentric contractions may cause greater high-stress damage to recruited
muscle fibers than concentric contractions<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. This muscle damage leads to inflammation, release of CK and an
increased perception of muscle soreness for several days after the exercise<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Similar results were evident in our present research, which found
there were increased concentrations of serum CK and high pain VAS scores at 24&#x02005;h and 48&#x02005;h
after eccentric exercise in both groups.</p><p>Analysis of the influence of WBV on the values of serum parameters related to muscle damage
revealed that serum CK levels at 24&#x02005;h and 48&#x02005;h were lower in the vibration group than in the
control group. Given that serum CK activity is defined as an index of muscle damage<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>, these results indicate that the vibration
group sustained less muscle damage after eccentric training than the control group. It was
previously demonstrated that muscle blood volume and lymphatic flow increase with vibration
treatment and that the magnitude of this increase is positively associated with vibratory
load<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. This rise in muscle perfusion
may stimulate muscle recovery by improving oxygen delivery<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> and removing pain substrates<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. To our knowledge, only two studies<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> have investigated the
effects of post-exercise vibration treatment on the reduction of serum CK concentrations
after eccentric exercise in knee extensor muscles. Neither study observed variation in serum
CK levels. Caution is necessary when making comparisons because the intervention protocols
and the type of vibration (device, frequency and amplitude) were different. No significant
differences were found within groups or between groups in BUN concentrations. Protein
catabolism produces urea, which may be a useful biomarker for monitoring fatigue and
overtraining<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, Fallon<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> demonstrated that changes in serum urea
are more useful for monitoring training status than for assessing short term fatigue, which
may be the reason why there were no changes in BUN after eccentric training in this
study.</p><p>VAS scores of the vibration group at 48&#x02005;h were lower than those reported by the control
group, indicating less muscle soreness. This result is supported by previous research, which
noted that post-exercise vibration alleviated DOMS and provided an analgesic effect. Rhea et
al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> reported an attenuation of pain
ranging from 22&#x02013;61% when untrained individuals received WBV. Similar results were found by
Lau and Nosaka<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> for upper arm muscle
soreness, with peak soreness being 18&#x02013;30% less for the vibration group than for the control
group at 2 to 5 days after eccentric exercise. The benefits of vibration treatment on pain
have been reported in both clinical and experimental settings for several decades<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Muscle vibration activates afferent
inputs from sensory units in the muscle<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the subsequent afferent activity in myelinated sensory axons may
inhibit nociceptive messages, possibly at spinal segmental levels, modifying the pain
sensation and elevating the pain threshold<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Several studies have reported muscle strength loss following repetitive maximal eccentric
contractions<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, no significant decrease in PIT values was observed in our
present study. One possible explanation for these conflicting findings could be the type of
eccentric training performed. The training performed in the present study consisted of few
repetitions of very high intensity, whereas the aforementioned studies used workouts with a
high volume (100 and 300 repetitions, respectively), so it is possible that muscle
involvement and fatigue were different in these trials. Therefore, post-exercise WBV did not
attenuate PIT values. These findings are similar to those obtained by other research that
concluded that standing on a vibrating platform<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> or sitting on a vibrating cushion<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> after a session of eccentric exercise did not improve the recovery
of the knee extensor&#x02019;s PIT. A limitation of our current study might be the choice of just
one angle to evaluate muscle strength because PIT values could vary at different angles.
Moreover, other serum markers such as lactate dehydrogenase, myoglobin, troponin or
aspartate aminotransferase were not analyzed, and their analysis would have provided more
information about muscle damage.</p><p>The findings of the present study show that a single post-exercise WBV following eccentric
training alleviated muscle damage but did not attenuate muscle strength loss. Therefore,
recreational athletes should know that their performance in training or competition could
still be decreased at 48 hours after completing an intense eccentric training, regardless of
being subjected to a post-exercise vibration treatment that attenuates DOMS. Further studies
to establish the appropriate duration, frequency and amplitude of vibration are needed to
investigate the effectiveness of a single post-exercise WBV in the improvement of muscle
recovery after eccentric training.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thanks Regional Government of Extremadura (Spain) for the
