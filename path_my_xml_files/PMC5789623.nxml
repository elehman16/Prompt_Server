Participants were frail people aged 75 and older, who required an acute admission to hospital. Participants were recruited and randomized in the emergency room. The intervention group received CGA, a person-centered multidisciplinary team addressing health, participation, and safety. The control group received usual care. The main objective measured the recruitment procedure and retention rates. Secondary objectives were also collected regarding services received on the ward including discharge plan, care plan meeting and hospital risk assessments including risk for falls, nutrition, decubitus ulcers, and activities of daily living status.</p></sec><sec><title>Result</title><p id="Par3">Participants were recruited from the emergency department, over 32&#x000a0;weeks. Thirty participants were approached and 100% (30/30) were included and randomized, and 100% (30/30) met the inclusion criteria. Sixteen participants were included in the intervention and 14 participants were included in the control. At baseline, 100% (16/16) intervention and 100% (14/14) control completed the data collection. A positive propensity towards the secondary objectives for the intervention was also evidenced, as this group received more care assessments. There was an average difference between the intervention and control in occupational therapy assessment &#x02212;&#x02009;0.80 [95% CI 1.06, &#x02212;&#x02009;0.57], occupational therapy assistive devices &#x02212;&#x02009;0.73 [95% CI 1.00, &#x02212;&#x02009;0.47], discharge planning &#x02212;0.21 [95% CI 0.43, 0.00] and care planning meeting 0.36 [95% CI-1.70, &#x02212;0.02].

This population often requires thorough assessment, continuity, and follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Older people have great confidence in the care and competences that they think hospitals have [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Despite this, the health care for older people is often fragmented, focusing on single health complaints and not adequately acknowledging their needs and well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A prediction exists that a major focus in the future of in-patient acute medical care is going to be the care of the older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. As the population ages and grows, admittances to the hospital and emergency department (ED) will also continue to increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] for older people with chronic and complex illnesses. Adapting health care services by fine tuning the tasks and roles of health care professionals is a supported method that reduces adverse risks during hospitalization while addressing the needs of the frail older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Frailty includes weakness, fatigue, weight loss, low physical activity, poor balance, slow gait speed, poor motor processing and impaired cognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Frailty is an age-related central concept, where the reserves and ability to resist stressors presented to the body&#x02019;s physiological systems are severely limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Vulnerability in the population with three or more of the frailty factors was found to have a significantly increased risk of hospitalization, disability, and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">Older people who frequently visit the hospital often have social and health care needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and the majority is unable to perform at least one activity of daily living (ADL) which goes unidentified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Hospital programs often do not emphasize the need for geriatric skilled services and staff, despite the increase in geriatric patients requiring hospital admission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Historically, hospital care on acute medical wards is poorly adapted to address the multiple needs of frail older people and is insufficient in providing health care services for problems which could have been readily recognized and treated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This population is frequently exposed to dangers which can exacerbate their loss of function, resulting in unjustified social and health care dependence and even death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A focus on the right approach to health care for older people, stressing the empowerment of older people as rights holders, without discrimination and participation in relation to their health and well-being, is an important role of accountability in health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">The World Report on Aging and Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] has reported that for older people the maintenance of functional ability has the highest importance. Moreover, World Health Organization (WHO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] has identified the needs of older people which must include a transformation of health systems away from disease-based curative models, towards the provision of integrated care. Strategies delivering comprehensive person-centered services to older populations secured in evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and optimizing opportunities for health, participation, and security in order to improve life as people age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] can be achieved.</p><p id="Par33">A person-centered method designed for managing the frail population is the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], which is a coordination of multidimensional specialties, interdisciplinary diagnostic process used to determine medical, psychological, social, and functional capabilities. The CGA differs from a standard medical evaluation by including diverse domains, where the focus is on restoring healthy function and independence where possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. By aiding in the development of a tailored treatment and follow-up plan, coordination of management of care and evaluation of long-term care needs, enhanced communication, and optimal living conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] are attainable. Finally, the use of a CGA multidisciplinary team on an acute medical ward could produce significant improvements in outcomes of frail older people, including increased survival, improved functioning, and decreased need for elderly care facility placement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Sweden is a country with mainly publicly funded health care, and despite the availability of highly specialized acute care services, Swedish health care is facing challenges related to access, quality, efficacy, and funding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Services are not adapted to address frail older people requiring hospital admission, as older patients are marginalized evidenced by the lack of geriatric competence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] thus limiting their capabilities and freedom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Frail older people need a combination of approaches which are person-centred in praxis and can allow for their well-being. By identifying and acknowledging the needs unique to the person, the team can better understand and support how to assist and recognize what is required for each person to actively age. In spite of this knowledge, studies are lacking and the literature provides little guidance about the practicalities of implementing and evaluating a CGA program on an acute care setting. An urgent need for assessing the development and implementation of such an intervention in acute hospital care that optimizes the care outcomes of frail older people has yet to be realized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">This Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment study is designed to examine and prove or disprove if the frail older people who received a CGA intervention could demonstrate improved outcomes in a variety of areas. Specifically, the study will scrutinize independence in activities of daily living, physical function, self-rated health, life satisfaction, quality of care, and health care consumption compared to the control group. Prior to this exploration, a pilot study was carried out to determine the feasibility of the CGA ward&#x02019;s clinical methods, and research procedures used in the randomized control trial (RCT), before determining if a full-scale study should proceed. This article outlines the original study protocol and explores the feasibility of the pilot implementation for the CGA RCT in a Swedish acute care setting.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Pilot study objectives</title><p id="Par36">1. The primary objective was to examine the feasibility of the research procedures of the RCT by evaluating the study procedures related to the rates of recruitment, consent, randomization, eligibility, and retention. In addition, determining the feasibility of the data collection form and questions of the CGA research assessment tools by observing completion rates, missing data, and time required to administer the form was analyzed.</p><p id="Par37">2. The secondary objectives were to examine and identify the CGA ward&#x02019;s clinical methods evidenced through documentation and chart reviews by establish that the intervention participants were assessed in accordance with the CGA domains of functional ability, physical health, psychological state, and social environment. Finally, proof of principle was established for the intervention participants through the surrogate outcomes that they received hospital risk assessments, and care assessments and discharge planning.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Pilot sample size</title><p id="Par38">Justifying the pilot trial sample size in order to decrease the total sample size of the pilot and the main trial together is described to be the most appropriate means of sample size calculation.

The focus of person-centeredness is to consider the social world of the person with regards to their everyday life, relationships with others and belief system as it narrates personal values, goals, and motivations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. A person-centered approach is tailored by the operational CGA team which consisted of a medical doctor, nurse and nurse assistant (NA), occupational therapist (OT), and physical therapist (PT). When appropriate, the team is extended to include a social worker and a nutritionist.</p><p id="Par43">The key components of the CGA team is to essentially optimize the care and well-being of the frail older patients after identifying their multidimensional and rehabilitation needs, while putting forth a discharge plan in partnership with the frail older person which included recommendations for long-term follow-up.

However, the pilot study took 32&#x000a0;weeks to complete the inclusion. During portions of the pilot, admission to hospital wards had an estimated wait time of up to 48&#x000a0;h, and in some cases, patients were treated and discharged from the ED without ever receiving a bed or reaching a ward. The inclusion process was frequently retarded, due to the lack of available beds on the acute medical wards.

While it was understood, that the clinical assessment tools employed by the researchers were numerous, the comprehensive nature of this study at baseline was steadfast. Despite the wide range in time required to complete the baseline, researchers when necessary completed the data collection as piece work, due to the participants being too tired, too ill, and due to higher priority hospital procedures taking precedence. Therefore, data collection often required two, three, and on occasion four visits to the participants to complete the assessments.</p><p id="Par63">Following the pilot, data was examined by performing chart reviews and comparing the data forms with what was entered into the data base. Clarifications explaining &#x0201c;incomplete data and refusals&#x0201d; were documented as comments on the baseline forms by the researchers for participants who were too ill, too tired, too occupied with others (i.e., medical personnel, lab tests, X-rays), or just simply refused to participate. On one occasion during the pilot, a participant was discharged prior to the completion of their baseline. The research team discussed this dilemma and rather than losing the individual in the study, the baseline was completed in the home, as soon as possible after discharge.</p><p id="Par64">Throughout the pilot, the research team discussed their observations about how the participants acted during the assessment, often describing them as fatiguing quickly, refusing certain tests, and or not wanting to continue with the study after the baseline or 1-month follow-up. As a remedy, researchers reorganized the order of assessments to stagger the physical tests, allowing for recovery following physically exerting assessments and at the 1- and 6-month follow-ups the number of assessments and questions were reduced. Furthermore, during the pilot not all participant could speak Swedish and it was discovered that two test were culturally biased as the participant was required to read the Latin alphabet. This was addressed and rectified in subsequent follow-ups using universal symbols (for the KM vision test), and the translator writing out the text in the native language (for the MMSE).</p><p id="Par65">The study was originally planned with the intention to use proxy questions if participants decided that they could not complete the study; however, proxy questions were never utilized during the pilot. Rather it was decided interviews for those with decreased cognitive status could be completed with the support of a next of kin, rather than having incomplete data or losing the participant. Furthermore, during the pilot the research team identified the need for flexibility in the data collection procedures, as a means to keep people in the study. It was agreed upon that a shortened version of the questionnaire would be permitted to use over the telephone, for those not permitting a home visit and the primary outcome measure for the main study the ADL staircase, was prioritized. In addition, several secondary outcome measures addressing physical health, fatigue scale, psychological state, self-rated health question, and social environment were prioritized, as well if there had been changes to home help/home health services. This method was applied on two occasions during the pilot study, once at the first month follow-up and once at the sixth month follow-up.

This was confirmed by chart reviews and documentation which displayed that they were receiving health care services with increased focus on safety and were assessed and treated by a multidisciplinary team which was statistically significant when including an OT. Furthermore they had a greater tendency to receive a care plan and leave the hospital with a discharge plan compared to the control group. With regards to a nonsignificant difference in PT services on the wards, it is thought to be attributed to geriatric competent and trained staff that delivered services to the frail older people regardless of their ward or intervention intent. In this framework, noteworthy attention is warranted in the organization and working procedures on an acute medical ward for geriatrics. Examining the process of screening for frailty, safety, clinical assessments, and common elements related to communication and planning crucial to the CGA team intervention is essential. The process of working comprehensively to assess all health domains, regardless of reason for admission onto the acute medical ward [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and increasing interest in optimizing strategies for delivering comprehensive person-centered health care services to the older population is viable.</p><p id="Par67">The pilot study provided an indication of the rates of recruitment, refusal, eligibility, retention, and sample size which should be expected in a full-scale RCT. Despite the pilot&#x02019;s success, a noteworthy limitation was the slow inclusion rate, predominantly complicated by the reduction in the number of beds at the hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] cut backs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] and a systemic shortage of nursing staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] which decreased the possibility to randomize people eligible for inclusion. While the pilot study highlights the weakness, the organizational and operational malfunction of the hospital could not be controlled or adjusted by the researchers. Politicians and hospital administrators through negotiations have addressed and attempted to resolve this predicament stymieing the hospitals organization. Efforts to amend the overcrowding in the ED were addressed by making more beds available on the hospital wards. The research team was proactive and added additional control wards increasing the likelihood for randomization and expedited the inclusion rate. Although the issue remains unresolved, it was evaluated following the pilot and a new estimate of two inclusions per week has been deemed feasible for this RCT going forward.</p><p id="Par68">Furthermore, several limitations were discovered in the pilot related to screening, recruitment, and randomization procedures. Specifically, the majority of FRESH-screen (securing that participants were frail) was done by researchers after the inclusion and randomization. The pilot plan was designed that people (75 or older) should be screened for frailty when presenting to the ED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]; however, this was proven not to be the case in current practice procedures. Fortunately, all of the RCT participants later screened met the criteria as frail, but this was a concern during the pilot. To safeguard the FRESH-screen frailty inclusion criteria, screening was added during the pilot, to the researcher&#x02019;s protocol prior to the baseline data collection. Furthermore, a limitation might be that the pilot study results were not used to calculate the sample size for the main study. The pilot study aim was not to assess the output from ADL, but rather to insure randomization and retention and its surrogates regarding risk assessments and safety<italic>.</italic></p><p id="Par69">Another limitation identified in the pilot was related to the recruitment situation, as the responsibility to minimize bias was identified. Specifically, the person with access to the SNOSE should be distinct from those recruiting the participants into the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. However, an acceptation to this rule as in the case of this pilot&#x02019;s procedure for recruitment and randomization, which is centered on emergency medicine and the emergency department, can be deemed feasible if employing the SNOSE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Initial estimates of the demographics obtained in this pilot study were confirmed during the randomization process, and the retention rates are within the forecasted range set for the full RCT.</p><p id="Par70">Regarding the assessment, it has been observed that completing the baseline was time-consuming due to comprehensive nature of this study. However, researchers made adaptations by reorganizing the sequence of questions prioritizing by domain and allowing for rest between physically exerting tests and completing the data collection as piece work if necessary. However, the baseline questions remained steadfast. Consequently, the 1- and 6-month follow-up forms were amended, reducing the number of clinical assessments/questions, to better accommodate the frail older participants. The 12-month follow-up however was unchanged and mirrors the baseline, with measures in place for missing data using MCD if necessary.</p><p id="Par71">Finally, when examining and identifying the CGA ward&#x02019;s clinical methods, a proof of principle has been highlighted in the pilot by the practices on the intervention ward with good confidence. With regards to the research procedures and in determining the feasibility, it was found that the pilot study data collection had incomplete data and refusals. Many of these issues were clarified due to the ill and or frail state of the participants as assessments were omitted, and or not completed, in their entirety during the data collection. Other issues related to the procedures are clarified in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par72">The pilot has proven to be feasible in its methods, procedures, and data collection processes and thus is deemed secure in carrying forward to a large-scale study. The proof of principle supporting a CGA intervention was statistically significantly associated with risk assessments and occupational therapy services, and a positive tendency for receiving a care planning meeting and discharge plan compared to the control group. The pilot data is reasoned to be valid and will be utilized and pooled with the large-scale study data. This CGA randomized control trial is the precursor which may identify a breach in Swedish acute medical wards when treating the frail older population. Identifying and measuring what matters and sharing the information in a comprehensive manner will support health care workers&#x02019; competence and behavior towards people and helps to build trust. Furthermore, the values and goals unique to the frail older person are the basis for the approach securing active aging. Finally, by using the CGA model opportunities for health, participation and security are optimized, enhancing life as people age and focusing on what people themselves value. Refining and transforming the health system&#x02019;s methods, standards, and policies away from disease-based curative models towards the establishment of person-centered integrated care, as displayed in the pilot, could have significant implications for the future of frail older people&#x02019;s health care.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ADL</term><def><p id="Par6">Activities of daily living</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CGA</term><def><p id="Par7">Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p id="Par8">Confidence intervals</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CIRCS-G</term><def><p id="Par9">Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatric</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CONSORT</term><def><p id="Par10">Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ED</term><def><p id="Par11">Emergency department</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FES-I</term><def><p id="Par12">Fall efficiency scale-international</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FRESH</term><def><p id="Par13">Frail elderly support research group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GQL-Instrument</term><def><p id="Par14">Gothenburg Quality of Life Instrument</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICECAP-O</term><def><p id="Par15">Capability measure for older people</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IPA-O</term><def><p id="Par16">Impact on participation and autonomy-Older persons</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KM</term><def><p id="Par17">Konstantin Moutakis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MADRS</term><def><p id="Par18">Montogomery&#x02013;&#x000c5;sberg depression rating scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MCD</term><def><p id="Par19">Median change of deterioration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MMS-E</term><def><p id="Par20">Mini Mental Status Examination</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NA</term><def><p id="Par21">Nurse assistant</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OT</term><def><p id="Par22">Occupational therapist</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>p.r.n.</term><def><p id="Par23">Pro re nata</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PT</term><def><p id="Par24">Physical therapist</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p id="Par25">Randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SNOSE</term><def><p id="Par26">Sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelope</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TUG</term><def><p id="Par27">Timed up and go</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p id="Par28">World Health Organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Special thanks to the care coordinators at Sahlgrenska University Hospital for their participation and to research assistant Katarina Sj&#x000f6;berg, Reg.
