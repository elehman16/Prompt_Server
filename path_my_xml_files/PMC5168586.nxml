The mono-iodoacetate (MIA)-induced preclinical model of OA has been used to demonstrate pain reduction and cartilage formation. In the clinical study, 60 OA patients were randomized to receive different doses of cells (25, 50, 75, or 150 million cells) or placebo. Stempeucel&#x000ae; was administered by intra-articular (IA) injection into the knee joint, followed by 2&#x000a0;ml hyaluronic acid (20&#x000a0;mg). Subjective evaluations&#x02014;visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, intermittent and constant osteoarthritis pain (ICOAP), and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC-OA) index&#x02014;were performed at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 12&#x000a0;months of follow-up. Magnetic resonance imaging of the knee was performed at baseline, and at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months follow-up for cartilage evaluation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Stempeucel&#x000ae; differentiated into the chondrogenic lineage in vitro with downregulation of Sox9 and upregulation of Col2A genes. Furthermore, Stempeucel&#x000ae; differentiated into chondrocytes and synthesized a significant amount of sGAG (30&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.8&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;g GAG/DNA). In the preclinical model of OA, Stempeucel&#x000ae; reduced pain significantly and also repaired damaged articular cartilage in rats. In the clinical study, IA administration of Stempeucel&#x000ae; was safe, and a trend towards improvement was seen in the 25-million-cell dose group in all subjective parameters (VAS, ICOAP, andWOMAC-OA scores), although this was not statistically significant when compared to placebo. Adverse events were predominant in the higher dose groups (50, 75, and 150 million cells). Knee pain and swelling were the most common adverse events. The whole-organ magnetic resonance imaging score of the knee did not reveal any difference from baseline and the placebo group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Intra-articular administration of Stempeucel&#x000ae; is safe. A twenty-five-million-cell dose may be the most effective among the doses tested for pain reduction.

Worldwide, approximately 9.6% of men and 18% of women aged &#x02265;60&#x000a0;years have symptomatic osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Current treatment in early-stage OA includes weight reduction, quadriceps strengthening exercises, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, intra-articular (IA) glucocorticoid injections, viscosupplements, and bracing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Total joint arthroplasty is the mainstay treatment for end-stage OA of the knee joint, which is often associated with serious and life-threatening complications including increase risk of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Currently, cell therapy- and tissue engineering-based approaches are being used to address the issue of repair of damaged articular cartilage. This includes autologous cultured chondrocytes and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) obtained from various tissues that are used for transplantation into the cartilage lesion. Autologous chondrocyte implantation has inherent disadvantages such as a two-stage surgical procedure (harvesting healthy cartilage and transplanting culture-expanded chondrocytes from that sample) that may cause further cartilage damage and degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and chondrocyte dedifferentiation during culture that might result in fibrocartilage rather than hyaline cartilage formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Thus, autologous or allogeneic MSCs are rapidly emerging as an investigational product for cartilage repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of MSCs suggest that these cells can reduce inflammation and pain reduction in the knee. Concurrently, MSCs may initiate the repair process of the damaged cartilage by differentiating into chondrocytes, as well as by inducing proliferation and maturation of the remaining healthy chondrocytes or by inducing differentiation of chondroprogenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A whole host of growth factors, biological modulators, and extracellular matrix proteins produced by MSCs may play a pivotal role in enhancing neocartilage formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Several preclinical studies and clinical trials have been conducted using MSCs which have reported the safety and therapeutic effect of its administration in patients with OA, although the majority of these studies have been conducted as single-dose, single-arm pilot studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Hence, there is a need for randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials. We have carried out in vitro studies to show the differentiation efficiency of adult human bone marrow-derived, cultured, pooled, allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cells (Stempeucel&#x000ae;) into the chondrogenic lineage and the expression of chondrocyte-specific markers. In order to determine if Stempeucel&#x000ae; is efficacious in a preclinical model, we have administered these cells intra-articularly into the knee joints of rats with mono-iodoacetate (MIA)-induced OA. After completion of these studies, a phase 2 dose-finding clinical study was initiated to evaluate the safety (primary endpoint), potential efficacy, and appropriate dose (secondary endpoints) of IA administration of Stempeucel&#x000ae; in patients with OA of the knee joint.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Production and characterization of Stempeucel&#x000ae; and placebo</title><p>Stempeucel&#x000ae; is a bone marrow-derived, ex vivo expanded, pooled, allogeneic human MSC population that has been characterized previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

The study was registered in the National Institute of Health registry of clinical trials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01453738">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01453738</ext-link>). An independent data safety monitoring board was formed comprising of drug safety physicians and an expert in the therapeutic area to monitor the safety data at predefined intervals during the progress of the study. The study was conducted from November 2011 to November 2013. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before screening. Of the 82 patients screened, 62 patients were randomized to the study from five centers. Two patients dropped out from the study after randomization but before IMP administration; thus 60 patients received the IMP. Four dose levels were studied in this trial: 25, 50, 75, and 150 million cells (25&#x000a0;M, 50&#x000a0;M, 75&#x000a0;M, and 150&#x000a0;M, respectively). At each dose level, 15 patients were randomized into two groups (Stempeucel&#x000ae; and placebo) in a 2:1 ratio using a computer generated randomization. Thus, 10 subjects received Stempeucel&#x000ae; and 5 subjects received placebo at each dose level (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). As this was the first study of IA administration of Stempeucel&#x000ae; in OA patients, no formal sample size calculation was performed.

Preparation of IMP for injection was performed under a validated biosafety cabinet by a trained person independent of the investigator&#x02019;s team. A cryobag containing IMP was thawed at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in a water bath. The cell suspension was diluted to 100&#x000a0;ml using PLASMA-LYTE A using two 50-ml centrifuge tubes. The cell pellet was resuspended in 2&#x000a0;ml PLASMA-LYTE A (for the 25- and 50-million-cell dose groups) and in 4&#x000a0;ml PLASMA-LYTE A (for the 75- and 150-million-cell dose groups) based on the viable cell count and was loaded to a blinded syringe. For the placebo preparation, a similar amount of PLASMA-LYTE A was loaded to a blinded syringe. The IMP (Stempeucel&#x000ae; or placebo) was presented to the investigators in a blinded syringe (using semitransparent tape) in a temperature-controlled transport box at 2&#x02013;8&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. It was not possible to distinguish between Stempeucel&#x000ae; and placebo upon visual inspection of the blinded syringes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Injection protocol for the clinical study</title><p>Pre-medication (hydrocortisone 100&#x000a0;mg IV and pheniramine maleate 45.5&#x000a0;mg IV) was administered 15&#x02013;30&#x000a0;min before administration of the IMP to prevent the possibility of a potential anaphylactic reaction to the allogeneic cells. The IA injections were performed by qualified and experienced investigators (either orthopedician or rheumatologist) using a 2.0-inch (5.1-cm) 20-gauge needle as a lateral midpatellar injection (an injection into the patellofemoral joint). IMP injection was followed by injection of 2&#x000a0;ml hyaluronic acid (20&#x000a0;mg; Hyalgan, Fidia Farmaceutici S.p.A., Italy). Patients were hospitalized for the procedure, and were monitored for 24&#x000a0;h after the injection. Patients were discharged after inspection of the target joint, a general physical examination, and vital signs evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Follow-up for the clinical trial patients</title><p>Patients were followed up at 1&#x000a0;week, and 1, 3, and 6&#x000a0;months after injection of IMP. The clinical data were unblinded after 6&#x000a0;months and patients were further followed-up for both safety and efficacy until 12&#x000a0;months after the injection. Safety assessments included monitoring of all adverse events (AEs), assessment of electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, hematological (complete blood count including erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and biochemical (liver function tests, kidney function tests, and lipid profile) values, physical examination, and vital signs measurements. Adverse events were captured by interviewing the subjects and laboratory data evaluations during the visits. The efficacy endpoints included improvement in pain from OA graded on a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0 to 10 (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;no pain; 10&#x02009;=&#x02009;worst pain); also, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC-OA) index (total score, pain, stiffness, and physical function scores) and intermittent and constant osteoarthritis pain (ICOAP) was used (constant and intermittent pain score) to evaluate pain and function of the joint. X-ray of the knee was carried out at baseline, and at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months follow-up. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knee was carried out at baseline, and at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months follow-up. MRI of the knee was performed using a 1.5-T whole body scanner and a circumferential eight-channel knee coil. Proton density T2-weighted sequences were captured: sagittal intermediate, axial intermediate, and coronal intermediate for assessing osteophytes and cartilage (for scoring cartilage signal and morphology, marginal osteophytes, subarticular bone marrow abnormality, subarticular cysts, and subarticular bone attrition); sagittal PD FS for assessing menisci and cruciate ligaments (for scoring of ACL, PCL, medial, and lateral menisci); and sagittal 3D FIESTA-C for assessing cartilage surface and superficial erosions (for scoring cartilage signal and morphology). Images were scored to assess the whole-organ magnetic resonance imaging score (WORMS) by two experienced radiologists using combined reads. In case of non-concurrence, advice was taken from a third independent radiologist whose report was considered final. WORMS scoring used in this study was modified for calculation of total WORMS score. The parameters included were articular surface features which include cartilage signal and morphology, subarticular bone marrow abnormality, subarticular cysts, subarticular bone attrition, and marginal osteophytes. They were scored for all 14 compartments of the knee joint. The compartment totals were added to obtain the overall knee joint score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Preclinical data</title><p>GraphPad Prism software was used to calculate the statistical significance of all preclinical experimental data.

In our study, the mechanical pain threshold was measured weekly by PAM test. Pain threshold values from various time points are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>. Analysis of PAM scores indicates that animals treated with both low and high doses of Stempeucel&#x000ae; showed improvement in pain threshold from week 2 onwards as compared to vehicle or HA-treated animals and continued to improve until 8&#x000a0;weeks after cell injection. While the pain improvement appeared to reach saturation by 8&#x000a0;weeks with the low dose of cells, it continued to improve until 12&#x000a0;weeks in the animals that received a high dose of Stempeucel&#x000ae; (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Animals treated with HA alone showed some improvement in pain threshold at the initial time period (week 3); however, this improvement was not found to be consistent.

By week 12, the cartilage damage was found to be severe and the hyaline tissue was replaced with fibrocartilage (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, panel l). The HA-treated animals showed marginal improvement in cartilage architecture (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, panels c, h, and m). In contrast, animals receiving both low and high doses of Stempeucel&#x000ae; showed almost intact cartilage with a larger number of chondrocytes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, panels d, i, and n for a low dose of cells and panels e, j, and o for a high dose of cells). The calculated OARSI grades of the different treatment groups were compared at week 12. Although, both low- and high-cell doses showed histological improvement, a statistically significant reduction in OARSI grade was observed only in the high-dose Stempeucel&#x000ae;-treated animals (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) in comparison to animals in the vehicle group.

It is important to note that the intensity of Safranin-O staining increased progressively with both doses of Stempeucel&#x000ae;.

Ten patients (1 in 50&#x000a0;M, 6 in 75&#x000a0;M, and 3 in 150&#x000a0;M dose groups) experienced pain and swelling at the injection site. The events were mild to moderate in severity, assessed as related to the IMP, and recovered upon conservative therapy. Among the 10 patients, one subject (150&#x000a0;M dose group) had IMP-related synovial effusion requiring hospitalization for one additional day of observation, thus meeting the criteria of a serious adverse event (SAE). Other SAEs in the study were determined to be unrelated to the IMP and were as follows: hysterectomy for menorrhagia in one subject in the 25&#x000a0;M group, suture-related complication and varicose vein in one subject in the P1 group, and hemorrhoidal hemorrhage and umbilical hernia, respectively, in one subject each in the P2 group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Overall evaluation of adverse events</title><p>A total of 97 AEs were reported in 40 subjects (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>).

No patient died or was withdrawn from the study due to an AE. Most of the AEs were mild to moderate in severity. One severe AE was reported in each of 25&#x000a0;M (dyslipidemia), 50&#x000a0;M (anemia), 150&#x000a0;M (muscle hemorrhage), and P2 (umbilical hernia) groups. Physical examination and vital signs data were unremarkable after the injection. In cohort 1, most of the AEs observed in the study were related to the SOC (musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders); the most common AE was arthralgia. In cohort 2, most of the AE(s) observed in the study were related to the SOC (general disorders and administration site conditions). The most common AEs in the 75&#x000a0;M group were injection site pain and arthralgia. Three events of arthralgia were experienced by two subjects (one subject had two episodes of arthralgia due to OA) and four events of injection site joint pain were experienced by four subjects in the 75&#x000a0;M dose group. One event of hypersensitivity to IMP (joint swelling) was experienced by a subject in the 75&#x000a0;M dose group. Three events of hypersensitivity to IMP (joint swelling) were experienced by three subjects in the 150&#x000a0;M group. All events of joint pain and swelling recovered completely upon symptomatic treatment.

In several studies, MSCs were prepared and injected with sodium hyaluronan to increase the engraftment and chondrogenic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In the present study, the efficacy of Stempeucel&#x000ae; was evaluated in a well-validated animal model of OA that was induced by MIA injection into the knee joints. Both low and high doses of Stempeucel&#x000ae;&#x02009;+&#x02009;HA treatment showed significant improvement in the pain threshold from week 2 onwards when compared to animals treated only with HA; treatment with only HA provided a short-term benefit on pain reduction, which corroborates with an earlier publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. We did not observe a significant difference between the two Stempeucel&#x000ae; treatment groups of animals (low and high dose) on pain reduction. However, it is important to note that the pain reduction in the high-dose animals continued to improve until the end of the study (12&#x000a0;weeks). Although the exact mechanism of action of MSCs on pain reduction is not known, anti-inflammatory activity has been attributed to this effect. To date, some studies have demonstrated the role of MSCs on OA-induced pain behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Van Buul et al. reported improvement of weight-bearing joints of the affected limb after intra-articular application of both rat and human BMMSCs in MIA-induced OA rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, unlike the results presented in this study, the authors did not observe cartilage regeneration. Furthermore, in several animal studies, it has been shown that the increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines might have contributed to pain increase. Intra-articularly administered MSCs probably play an important role in attenuating the inflammation-induced pain by secreting a wide range of anti-inflammatory cytokines and analgesic peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and Stempeucel&#x000ae; might have also contributed to pain reduction through a similar mechanism.</p><p>We also demonstrated that the pooled BMMSC population are efficient in differentiating into chondrocytes in vitro, and secrete a significant amount of sGAG (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). When these cells were administered intra-articularly into OA-affected joints, we observed a progressive increase in proteoglycan staining. The improvement in cartilage repair was observed both macroscopically and microscopically. The sGAG intensity data revealed that the total proteoglycan content was significantly higher in both the cell&#x02009;+&#x02009;HA treated groups compared to animals treated only with HA. One of the short comings of the preclinical results is that we did not determine the therapeutic effect of BMMSCs without HA. However, based on the published data it appears that administration of MSCs in combination with HA provided better therapeutic benefit than either HA or MSC treatment alone in an experimental animal model of OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The concomitant reduction in MIA-induced pain followed by an increase in cartilage regeneration observed in this study suggests that human bioactive factors synthesized by BMMSCs may be responsible for both the reduction in inflammation and promotion of endogenous cartilage regeneration via a paracrine mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>This clinical study met its predefined endpoint of safety of intra-articular administration of Stempeucel&#x000ae; in osteoarthritis of the knee joint. Adverse events were predominantly local pain and swelling, particularly seen in patients randomized to the higher dose groups (75&#x000a0;M and 150&#x000a0;M) and they resolved completely upon symptomatic treatment. There was no evidence of ectopic tissue or tumor formation locally at 1-year follow-up. Hematological, biochemical, and serological parameters were comparable in both the cell and placebo arm in all groups of patients. Limited joint space, higher dose, and volume of injection (6&#x000a0;ml) may be the reason for increased joint swelling and pain seen in cohort 2 (75&#x000a0;M and 150&#x000a0;M). Furthermore, it can be assumed that a proportion of the cells injected into the joint space have not survived and this phenomenon was more pronounced with higher cell doses. Probably, such non-viable cells produce an inflammatory reaction causing pain and swelling, as reported earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The frequency of these complications was similar to a report from another study using culture-expanded bone marrow-derived MSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In another study using allogeneic non-HLA matched BMMSCs in two different doses (50 and 150 million cells) which were pre-mixed with hyaluronic acid (5&#x000a0;ml) and administered in partial medial meniscectomy patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the adverse events were similar to those seen in our study, with the most frequently reported AE by system organ class being musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; however, the adverse events did not differ between the two doses tested. Recently, Vega et al. have conducted a study using IA injection of allogeneic BMMSCs (40 million cells suspended in 8&#x000a0;ml of Ringer-Lactate) in OA of the knee joint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Post-implantation pain was observed in 53% to 60% of patients in both the experimental and control groups. The pain responded to analgesics and improved within 1 to 6&#x000a0;days. Hence, pain and local swelling may be the most common post-injection complication in patients after IA injection of MSCs which responds within a few days of symptomatic treatment.</p><p>One of the most important factors influencing the clinical outcome of a study is to determine the optimal treatment dose. In this study, patients in the low-dose group (25 million cells) showed improved outcomes in the pain measurement scores, whereas those in the higher dose groups did not. The VAS and WOMAC composite index scores decreased by 64% and 64.4% in the 25-million-cell arm as compared to 36% and 49.3% in the active controls with HA, respectively, at 12&#x000a0;months follow-up. In a proof of concept study, three doses of autologous adipose tissue-derived MSCs (AD-MSCs) were used: 10 million, 50 million, and 100 million cells. The WOMAC score improved at 6&#x000a0;months follow-up in the high-dose group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In another study using allogeneic BMMSCs at a dose of 40 million cells, improvement in pain, disability, quality of life, and cartilage quality by MRI was noted in the cell-treated group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Several reasons are hypothesized for this effect in the low-dose group of patients as observed in this study. Firstly, a dose of 25&#x000a0;M cells may be optimum with the volume of hyaluronic acid (2&#x000a0;ml) used in the study as a supporting matrix. Secondly, the 25-million-cell dose maybe optimal for the limited IA space in the knee joint. Thirdly, doses higher than 25 million might cause cell aggregation due to a high cell concentration or insufficient space in the knee joint and subsequently cause cell death. Fourthly, the 25-million-cell dose may be lying in the upper range of the efficacy dose since numerous studies reports that doses in the range of 10 to 25 million BMSCs may be efficacious in OA of the knee joint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Finally, higher doses of MSCs may activate the MSCs to function as an M1-type cell with a pro-inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], whereas the 25&#x000a0;M dose may be the optimal concentration of cells which gives rise to an M2-type MSC with an anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive response. Hence, which cell dose will lead to the best outcome cannot be determined until a series of dose-finding studies are carried out.</p><p>Various studies are ongoing to determine the optimal tissue source of MSCs for therapeutic repair of the cartilage tissue. The combination of MSCs with scaffolds, growth factors, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), and genetic modification have also been studied. It is not clear which source of stem cells, or a combination product, will be the best for the disease condition. Studies have shown that adipose tissue-derived stem cells are both safe and efficacious [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], whereas other studies have shown that bone marrow-derived cells are equally efficacious [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. A current focus for knee cartilage repair is to use scaffolds that provide a three-dimensional environment for guiding and supporting the cells for cartilage repair. An advantage for using a scaffold is containment of the implanted cells on the lesion, and these biomaterials may act as barriers for fibroblast invasion of the graft [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Koh et al. have used PRP as a scaffold as it acts as an MSC accelerator for clinical chondrogenesis, is non-immunogeneic and bioabsorbable, and can be easily prepared preoperatively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In another study, fibrin glue has been used as a scaffold in MSC implantation to induce improved cell survival, proliferation, gene expression, differentiation, and matrix synthesis leading to repair of the cartilage lesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Cartistem&#x000ae; (MEDIPOST Co. Ltd., South Korea) is a combination product of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells and hyaluronic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. This acts as a biodegradable matrix in MSC implantation as it facilitates the migration and adherence of cells to the damaged cartilage, leading to better healing of the damaged lesion. Hence, more studies are required to pinpoint the best source of stem cells and the scaffold to be used to demonstrate both safety and efficacy.</p><p>The method of delivery of cells&#x02014;either by direct intra-articular injection or by open arthroscopy injection&#x02014;into the joint cavity is also important and may be one of the factors for deriving efficacy. In one of the initial studies, Wakitani et al. transplanted cells of bone marrow embedded in collagen gel into the articular cartilage defect at the time of high tibial osteotomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Cartistem&#x000ae;, a combination product approved by the Korean FDA, has been applied to the damaged area through arthroscopy after conducting a microfracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. These open surgical methods have their disadvantages such as pain, longer hospital stay, and higher cost. Minimally invasive techniques such as intra-articular injection have been adopted by different groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. IA injection is patient-friendly in terms of being less invasive, with reduced hospital stay, and are likely to reach a larger patient population as it can be performed in peripheral hospitals. Ultrasound guidance of knee injections could be a better option to more precisely deliver the cells intra-articularly. Berkoff et al. have reported that ultrasound guidance of knee injections resulted in better IA accuracy of needle placement than anatomical guidance (95.8% versus 77.8%; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. This enhanced injection accuracy achieved with ultrasound needle guidance directly improves patient-related clinical outcomes. However, in developing countries, ultrasound-guided intra-articular injection may be a challenge due to limited access to the instrument.</p><p>The present study, though it has shown good subjective improvement in pain and functional scores, did not demonstrate improvement in cartilage signal and morphology by MRI. We have used the WORMS scoring system, which is a semiquantitative MRI system for evaluating structural change in knee OA. WORMS scoring has been extensively studied for the prevalence and severity of cartilage loss, bone marrow lesions, and meniscal damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], and has seldom been studied for cartilage regeneration. Koh et al. studied the effect of adipose-derived MSCs with PRP in OA of the knee joint and found that WORMS score significantly improved from 60.0 points to 48.3 points and cartilage subscore improved from 28.3 points to 21.7 points at 24&#x000a0;months follow-up (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) as compared to baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, in our study, the cartilage subscore did not demonstrate any significant worsening or improvement of the cartilage in any of the subgroups. The reason for the WORMS score differences between these two studies could be due to several reasons: the type of MSCs used are different, better complementarity between adipose-derived MSC and PRP, or the length of follow-up time (24&#x000a0;months vs. 12&#x000a0;months) after cell administration. The limited number of patients used in this study for MRI analysis might have contributed as well. Regardless of these differences, Stempeucel&#x000ae; administration in the preclinical model clearly suggested the ability of these cells in combination with HA to trigger adequate proteoglycan synthesis for cartilage repair. Future clinical trials of Stempeucel&#x000ae; in OA patients should consider using guided delivery of cells in and around the lesion site or by arthroscopy, followed by MRI measurements using delayed gadolinium-enhanced MRI of cartilage (dGEMRIC) or T2 mapping to perform compositional (sGAG) analysis of the cartilage before and after cell administration. One of the limitations of this study was unblinding of the trial after 6&#x000a0;months follow-up, particularly given that the subjective measurements of clinical data (VAS, WOMAC, and ICOAP) were the secondary endpoints.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This clinical study satisfied the primary endpoints of safety of Stempeucel&#x000ae; administration in OA patients at all four doses tested. In addition, a trend towards pain reduction at the lowest cell dose of 25&#x000a0;M was observed by VAS, WOMAC, and ICOAP pain scoring criteria, but this was not statistically significant when compared to placebo. Analysis of the remaining secondary endpoints did not reveal therapeutic efficacy which could be attributed to the low number of patients enrolled in the study. The fact that a pooled population of allogeneic BMMSCs could elicit pain reduction and cartilage regeneration in a preclinical model of OA coupled with the safety profile observed in human patients with a positive trend in pain reduction (in one of the cell doses tested) warrants further study in a large number of patients to investigate the therapeutic role of Stempeucel&#x000ae; in cartilage regeneration in OA patients.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p>Adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMMSC</term><def><p>Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cell</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>dGEMRIC</term><def><p>Delayed gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of cartilage</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DMSO</term><def><p>Dimethyl sulfoxide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GCP</term><def><p>Good Clinical Practice</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GMP</term><def><p>Good Manufacturing Practice</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HA</term><def><p>Hyaluronic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HED</term><def><p>Human equivalent dose</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IA</term><def><p>Intraarticular</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICH</term><def><p>International Conference on Harmonization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICOAP</term><def><p>Intermittent and constant osteoarthritis pain</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IMP</term><def><p>Investigational medicinal product</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MedDRA</term><def><p>Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MIA</term><def><p>Mono-iodoacetate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mITT</term><def><p>Modified intention to treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRI</term><def><p>Magnetic resonance imaging</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MSC</term><def><p>Mesenchymal stromal cell</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OA</term><def><p>Osteoarthritis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAM</term><def><p>Pressure Application Measurement</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PT</term><def><p>Preferred term</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAE</term><def><p>Serious adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>sGAG</term><def><p>sulfated glycosaminoglycan</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SOC</term><def><p>System organ class</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p>Visual analog scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WCB</term><def><p>Working cell bank</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WOMAC-OA</term><def><p>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WORMS</term><def><p>Whole-organ magnetic resonance imaging score</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>This study was funded by Stempeutics Research Pvt.
