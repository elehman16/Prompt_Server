Among various opioids, remifentanil, a selective &#x003bc;-opioid agonist, is widely administered due to its rapid onset, short acting period and predictable rapid recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, remifentanil infusion during anesthesia has been associated with increased early postoperative pain and rescue analgesics due to the development of opioid induced hyperalgesia and acute opioid tolearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This could be a challenge for postoperative pain control and thereby result in increase of postoperative analgesic requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The mechanism underlying hyperalgesia after opioid infusion is still unclear. The animal experimental results showed that both peripheral and central changes in nociceptive processing are involved in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Central sensitization through activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors is considered to be responsible for opioid induced hyperalgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Excitatory amino acids such as glutamate, aspartate, and substance P are released from excitatory synapse membranes through central sensitization and then activate postsynaptic NMDA receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The recent study showed that remifentanil induced rapid and persistent increases in NMDA responses at clinically relevant concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Another animal experiment also showed that abrupt withdrawal from &#x003bc; opioid receptor induced long-term potentiation at the synapse of the pain pathways, which is related with opioid induced hyperalgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Several pharmacologic methods including NMDA antagonists, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and alpha agonists have been investigated to prevent opioid induced hyperalgesia. Besides pharmacologic preventions, the authors hypothesized that stepwise tapering of high-dose remifentanil at the end of surgery could prevent long-term potentiation at synapses of the pain pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and thus diminish postoperative pain and rescue analgesics during postoperative period. In this study, the effect of intraoperative tapering of remifentanil on postoperative pain and rescue analgesics was investigated in patients undergoing thyroidectomy with desflurane-remifentanil anesthesia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>The protocol of this prospective, randomised, and single-blind investigation was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Kangbuk Samsung Hospital (IRB No. KBC12145) and then registered with the Clinical Research information Service (CRiS, registration number KCT0000589). Informed consent was obtained from each patient. A total of 62 American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) physical status I-II patients, aged 19&#x02013;70 years, and scheduled for thyroidectomy under general anesthesia from November 2012 to January 2013 were enrolled. Patients with hypersensitivity or allergy with opioids, alcohol or opioids abuse, chronic pain, or psychiatric disease were excluded from the study. Patients were instructed with the use of numerical rating scale (NRS, 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;no pain to 100&#x02009;=&#x02009;most severe pain) at the preoperative visit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Anesthesia</title><p>All patients were premedicated with i.v. 0.03&#x000a0;mg/kg midazolam and i.m. glycopyrrolate 0.2&#x000a0;mg 30&#x000a0;minutes before arriving at the operating room. In the operating room, standard monitors (electrocardiogram, noninvasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry and capnography) and spectral entropy for monitoring depth of anesthesia were applied. Anesthesia was induced with i.v. 5&#x000a0;mg/ kg thiopental, 0.3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/min remifentanil and desflurane 6&#x000a0;vol% followed by 0.6&#x000a0;mg/kg rocuronium to facilitate endotracheal intubation. Maintenance of anesthesia consisted of desflurane 3.0-6.0% (end-tidal concentration) with medical air in oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.5) and remifentanil to maintain spectral entropy value of 40&#x02013;60. Patients were mechanically ventilated to maintain an end-tidal concentration of carbon dioxide between 35&#x02013;40&#x000a0;mmHg throughout the surgery. Muscle relaxation was achieved with 0.15&#x000a0;mg/ kg rocuronium to maintain 1&#x02013;2 twitches in response to train-of-four stimulation of the ulnar nerve. Esophageal temperature was monitored and maintained at 36-37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C throughout the operation using a warming pad. At the end of the surgery, desflurane and remifentanil administration were discontinued and muscle relaxation was antagonized with i.v. 0.01&#x000a0;mg/ kg glycopyrrolate and 0.04&#x000a0;mg/kg neostigmine. Tracheal extubation was done after patients&#x02019; respond to the verbal command and adequate spontaneous ventilation. Patients were transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) until they fulfill discharge criteria (moderate Aldrete score&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and then moved to the ward.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Intervention and randomization</title><p>Randomisation was performed before induction of anesthesia by an independent anesthesiologist responsible for patient allocation.

The results of this study showed that stepwise tapering of remifentanil at the end of the surgery reduced the postoperative pain scores and the requirement of rescue analgesics.</p><p>Patients in control group showed higher pain scores and required more rescue analgesics than those in tapering group did during immediate postoperative period. The possible explanation for this finding may be the development of opioid induced hyperalgesia or acute opioid tolerance. Opioid induced hyperalgesia is defined by the increased sensitivity by pain whereas acute opioid tolerance is a decreased sensitivity to opioid analgesics after administration of high dose opioids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, it is difficult to discriminate acute opioid tolerance and opioid induced hyperalgesia since a mixture of these phenomena may be associated with the infusion of high-dose opioids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, both phenomena are known to be induced by the activation of the NMDA receptor and the subsequent central sensitization of nociceptive system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. One of the current review of clinical data suggested that increased postoperative pain scores and subsequent greater requirement of analgesics may be associated with acute opioid tolerance, and the greater demand of opioids at a later recovery stage could be related with opioid induced hyperalgesia after high-dose remifentanil anesthesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Remifentanil differs from other opioids in that it directly acts on NMDA receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Glycine, a vehicle of remifentanil, is bound with glutamate of the NMDA receptor during activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The present study showed clinically that stepwise tapering of remifentanil at the end of surgery reduced the postoperative pain.</p><p>Remifentanil is a short-acting opioid with a predictable rapid recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the current study, high-dose remifentanil (0.3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/min) was used throughout the operation before intervention. Then, patients with control group were maintained with 0.3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/min remifentanil until the end of surgery whereas patients with tapering group received titration of remifentanil (0.3 -&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.2-&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/min) for at least 30&#x000a0;minutes. Several previous investigation on opioid induced hyperalgesia infused high dose of remifentanil from 0.2 -0.4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Guignard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], evaluated postoperative pain scores in patients after major abdominal surgery who had received high-dose remifentanil (mean dose 0.3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/min) perioperatively and found that patients with high-dose remifentanil anesthesia needed morphine earlier and greater doses to achieve satisfactory analgesia postoperatively. In the study by Schmidt et al., patients undergoing eye surgery received either a high (0.4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/min) or a low (0.1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/min) dose of remifentanil and reported opioid-induced hyperalgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Surgical site pain was assessed and postoperative values were compared with preoperative baseline measurements at other sites with cold and cold pressor test at 30 and 90&#x000a0;min after discontinuation of remifentanil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Previous investigation of patients undergoing major abdominal surgery suggested hyperalgesia after high dose remifentanil and preventive effect of ketamine for opioid-induced hyperalgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Patients with intraoperative high-dose remifentanil (0.4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/min) showed larger areas of hyperalgesia surrounding the wound and the request of higher doses of postoperative opioid for pain control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. On the other hand, patients with low-dose remifentanil (0.05&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/min) alone, or higher-dose remifentanil and ketamine, reported similar areas of hyperalgesia and required similar doses of postoperative morphine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In the study of comparing the effects of ketamine and paracetamol on preventing remifentanil induced hyperalgesia, anesthesia was maintained with 0.4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/min remifentanil infusion in all groups and it was shown that ketamine and paracetamol were both effective in preventing remifentanil induced hyperalgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Previous investigations with various anesthetics reported that anesthetics also affect opioid induced hyperalgesia since anesthetics have NMDA antanogist effect. Propofol suppresses NMDA receptor and there is a possibility of confusion for the interpretation of the results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Therefore, balanced anesthesia with desflurane-high dose remifentanil was used for this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The concentration of desflurane was adjusted to maintain the spectral entropy between 40 and 60 and there was no difference in the end-tidal concentration of desflurane between the two groups.</p><p>A few limitations should be considered. The first limitation is the dose of remifentanil infusion during intervention. There was no established tapering regimen and the dose of remifentanil was stepwise reduced for at least 30&#x000a0;minutes (0.3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/min for 10&#x000a0;minutes&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;0.2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/min for 10&#x000a0;minutes&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;0.1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/min for at least 10&#x000a0;minutes) based on the previous animal experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Second, NSAID was used as a rescue analgesic instead of opioids in this study since patients with thyroidectomy have a high risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Therefore, it is insufficient to explain the result of this study as opioid induced hyperalgesia. Third, only postoperative pain score was assessed without direct measurement of somatosensory threshold after anesthesia. Postoperative surgical site pain should have been assessed and compared with preoperative value. In addition, postoperative surgical site pain should have been compared with those of other sites with cold and cold pressor test after discontinuation of remifentanil. Thyroidectomy was chosen in this study because balanced anesthesia with inhalation agent and remifentanil is used for the maintenance of anesthesia. During thyroidectomy, tracheal stimulation with endotracheal cuff pressure needs adequate depth of anesthesia with high dose of remifentanil. However, it is difficult to detect statistical difference between the two groups after postoperative 2&#x000a0;hr and this phenomenon seems to be related with lesser degree of pain after thyroidectomy (10&#x02013;30 NRS). It remains to be seen whether increased pain scores could be associated with hyperalgesia and further study is needed to evaluate effect of tapering of remifentanil on the opioid induced hyperalgesia with direct measurement of somatosensory threshold before and after anesthesia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the results of this study suggested that stepwise tapering of remifentanil at the end of surgery could decrease postoperative pain and rescue analgesics after desflurane-high dose remifentanil anesthesia in patients with thyroidectomy.
