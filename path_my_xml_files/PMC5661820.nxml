One possible cause for this is poor endometrial receptivity. Various approaches to addressing this problem have been explored and some recent studies have shown that local endometrial injury can improve both the implantation rates and pregnancy outcomes in patients with unexplained recurrent implantation failure.<xref rid="rmb212031-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="rmb212031-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, <xref rid="rmb212031-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="rmb212031-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="rmb212031-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="rmb212031-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="rmb212031-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="rmb212031-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="rmb212031-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>
</p><p>In 2003, a study reported that the sampling of the endometrium of IVF patients by using a biopsy catheter substantially increased their chances of conceiving during the subsequent IVF&#x02013;embryo transfer cycles.<xref rid="rmb212031-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> Another study performed a systematic review and meta&#x02010;analysis in order to assess the efficiency of endometrial injury in participants with unexplained repeated implantation failure and found that local endometrial injury in the preceding ovarian stimulation cycles had a beneficial effect.<xref rid="rmb212031-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>
</p><p>However, those interventions mainly focused on fresh embryo transfers. Frozen&#x02010;thawed embryo transfers have been performed frequently with the aim of preventing the development of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and improving the pregnancy rate. In fact, the pregnancy rates of frozen&#x02010;thawed embryo transfer cycles have risen consistently, and in the past decade, have exceeded the pregnancy rate of fresh embryo transfer cycles.<xref rid="rmb212031-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>
</p><p>One study reported a negative impact of frozen&#x02010;thawed embryo transfer on pregnancy rates, but it only investigated cleavage&#x02010;stage embryos, not blastocysts, and not only patients with repeated implantation failure.<xref rid="rmb212031-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>
</p><p>To the best of the authors&#x02019; knowledge, no study has reported the use of induced endometrial injury in frozen&#x02010;thawed blastocyst transfer cycles in women with a history of repeated unsuccessful embryo transfers. Therefore, here is reported the effect of this procedure on frozen&#x02010;thawed blastocyst transfer in hormone replacement therapy.</p></sec><sec id="rmb212031-sec-0006"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>One&#x02010;hundred&#x02010;and&#x02010;twenty&#x02010;four patients, aged &#x0003c;40&#x000a0;years old with a history of at least three unsuccessful embryo transfers who underwent blastocyst transfer during hormone replacement treatment between February and June, 2013 were enrolled in this study. All the patients underwent a hysteroscopy and hysterosalpingography prior to each embryo transfer cycle and all the abnormal findings were treated prior to the embryo transfer cycle. The patients with uterine morphological abnormalities were excluded from this study. The eligible patients were allocated to one of two groups, based on their clinical record number: a &#x0201c;scratch&#x0201d; group and an untreated control group.</p><p>In the scratch group, endometrial scratching was performed with an Endocyte<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> sampler (Laboratoire CCD, Paris, France), as follows. The sampler was inserted through the cervical os and advanced gently along the shape of the uterus into the endometrial cavity. The outer catheter of the device was withdrawn to create suction, rotated three times in the same direction, and then pulled out. Scratching was performed once during the luteal phase of the cycle preceding the one that was used for the embryo transfer. Simultaneously, endometrial tissue was obtained from some patients with the endometrial sampler, processed for histology, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and examined microscopically in order to evaluate how deeply this type of sampler invades the endometrium.</p><p>Transdermal estradiol, in combination with vaginal progesterone suppositories, was used in the hormone replacement cycles. The preparation of the endometrium started on day 2 with transdermal estradiol, with the doses escalating from 1.44 to 4.32&#x000a0;mg. The vaginal progesterone suppositories (1200&#x000a0;mg/day) were started on day 15. In all cases, it was checked that the endometrial thickness was &#x02265;8&#x000a0;mm on that day. All the frozen&#x02010;thawed blastocyst transfers were performed on day 20 of the hormone replacement cycles. The endometrial thickness was measured again on the day of the blastocyst transfer.</p><p>The primary outcome measure in this study was the clinical pregnancy rate and the secondary outcome measure was the ongoing pregnancy rate. &#x0201c;Clinical pregnancy&#x0201d; was defined as the detection of a gestational sac in the uterus by ultrasound examination. &#x0201c;Ongoing pregnancy&#x0201d; was defined as a clinical pregnancy that continued after 12&#x000a0;weeks of gestation or resulted in a live birth.</p><p>The baseline characteristics of the two groups of patients are expressed as the mean&#x000b1;SD and as the number of patients. The scratch and control groups were compared by using the Student's <italic>t</italic> test for the continuous variables, while the chi&#x02010;square test with Yates&#x02019; correction was used to compare the categorical data, including the clinical and ongoing pregnancy rates. All the tests were two&#x02010;tailed and <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p><p>All the patients provided written informed consent and the study's procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Hanabusa Women's Clinic, Kobe, Japan.</p></sec><sec id="rmb212031-sec-0007"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><p>In total, 124 women were enrolled in the study. Of these, five participants in the scratch group withheld consent to participate in the study. In 23 cases, the scratching could not be performed during the appropriate period. A further eight women in the scratch group did not attend their clinic appointment for their procedure. Eleven women (four in the scratch group and seven in the control group) were excluded from the study because their second embryo transfer occurred during the intervention period. Therefore, the final scratch group comprised 22 participants and the control group comprised 55 participants. There was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics between the two groups (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="rmb212031-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="rmb212031-tbl-0001" xml:lang="en" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Characteristics of the participants</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><thead valign="top"><tr style="border-bottom:solid 1px #000000"><th align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Characteristic</th><th align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Scratch group (n=22)</th><th align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group (n=55)</th><th align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

The authors believe that the depth of scratching would have been similar in all cases because the procedure was standardized and all scratches were created by the same physicians. These findings indicate that even superficial scratching with a sampler had a positive effect on pregnancy outcomes. However, it is unclear whether the depth of scratching would affect pregnancy outcomes.</p><p>In this study, the scratches were created during the luteal phase of the cycle preceding that used for embryo transfer for the convenience of the patients. One study stated that it is appropriate to take samples during the secretory phase of a cycle because injury&#x02010;induced decidualization is stimulated by progesterone.<xref rid="rmb212031-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> However, some studies have reported the effectiveness of injuring the endometrium during controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) cycles.<xref rid="rmb212031-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="rmb212031-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> One study reported that endometrial injury was performed during days 5&#x02010;22 of the COH cycle.<xref rid="rmb212031-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> Another study reported that the injury was performed during days 4&#x02010;7 of the COH cycle.<xref rid="rmb212031-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> In the current study, an injury was created once in the menstrual cycle. However, there is insufficient evidence as to how many such injuries are required in order to achieve beneficial results.<xref rid="rmb212031-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>
</p><p>Some mechanisms have been proposed by which the endometrial injury might increase endometrial receptivity and improve clinical pregnancy rates. One possibility is that decidualization might be induced in this way.<xref rid="rmb212031-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="rmb212031-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="rmb212031-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> Another is that wound healing elicits the secretion of cytokines and growth factors that might be beneficial for embryo implantation.<xref rid="rmb212031-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> Moreover, the reaction to endometrial injury might assist in synchronizing the embryos with the stage of the endometrium. A third possibility is the up&#x02010;regulation of gene expression. Taking a biopsy increases the expression of the gene encoding uroplakin Ib and other genes that are linked to uterine receptivity.<xref rid="rmb212031-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="rmb212031-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>
</p><p>Interestingly, the favorable effects on endometrial receptivity were manifested in the cycle following the one involved in creating the injury. This long&#x02010;term effect might be associated with the activity of monocytes in the injured sites; these cells are long&#x02010;lived and can remain in some tissues for months.<xref rid="rmb212031-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>
</p><p>In conclusion, in the cycles involving frozen&#x02010;thawed blastocyst transfer, endometrial injury appears to improve the endometrial receptivity and increase the pregnancy rates in those women who are aged &#x0003c;40&#x000a0;years old and who have a history of at least two unsuccessful embryo transfers. The endometrial sampler that was used in this study is easy to use, the procedure could readily be standardized among physicians, and there is no obvious adverse side&#x02010;effect. The limitations of this study are the small number of participants and the incomplete nature of random allocation. Further studies to evaluate the effectiveness of induced endometrial injury on pregnancy outcomes with more participants and complete random allocation are needed.</p></sec><sec id="rmb212031-sec-0009"><title>Disclosures</title><p>
