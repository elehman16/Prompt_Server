In a retrospective analysis of two 6-month, placebo-controlled, phase III trials, corticosteroid use decreased from 30 to 26% among patients treated with the novel thrombopoietin-mimetic romiplostim (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;83) and remained above 30% for placebo-treated patients (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;42). Moreover, compared to placebo, patients were spared 7 weeks of corticosteroid treatment for every 100 weeks of romiplostim treatment. Thereafter, corticosteroid use continued to decrease significantly, from 35 to 20%, in patients treated with romiplostim for up to 3 years in an open-label extension study (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;101), and patients were spared a further 8 weeks of corticosteroid treatment for each additional 100 weeks of romiplostim treatment.

Hence alternative, corticosteroid-sparing, therapies are needed.</p><p>Romiplostim is a novel, TPO-mimetic which is approved for the treatment of chronic ITP in adults. To date, continuous long-term treatment has been shown to maintain platelet counts for up to 5 years with minimal side effects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> In the retrospective analysis presented here, concomitant corticosteroid use among patients treated with romiplostim for up to 3 years was analyzed.</p><p>In two placebo-controlled, phase III studies, the rate of corticosteroid decreased from 30 to 26% among romiplostim-treated patients, and remained above 30% in placebo-treated patients. While the analyses presented had insufficient power to demonstrate statistical significance, the differences observed are deemed clinically relevant. Indeed, patients were spared 7 weeks of corticosteroid treatment for every 100 weeks of romiplostim treatment. In an open-label extension study, corticosteroid use continued to decrease. After 3 years of continuous romiplostim treatment, the rate of corticosteroid use had decreased from 35 to 20%, a reduction that was statistically significant. Moreover, patients were spared an additional 8 weeks of corticosteroid treatment for each additional 100 weeks of romiplostim treatment.</p><p>While some patients continued to receive corticosteroids, the dose administered in these patients decreased. This trend was observed for both romiplostim- and placebo-treated patients. The decrease in the placebo group may be due to the widespread use of rescue medications among these patients, which has been reported elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> Furthermore, in the phase III studies corticosteroids were reduced when platelet counts were below 100&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>/l, a higher threshold than used in clinical practice. Hence, the corticosteroid-sparing effect of romiplostim may be underestimated in this analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The analyses presented demonstrate that concomitant corticosteroid use is reduced among patients treated with romiplostim, and remains low during long-term treatment with this agent. In addition, data in patients treated for up to 5 years show that continuous, long-term, romiplostim treatment safely and effectively maintains platelet counts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> Hence romiplostim is an important corticosteroid-sparing therapy for adult ITP, and may improve HRQOL by alleviating the side effects associated with corticosteroids. This improvement in HRQOL needs to be quantified in controlled, prospective studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was funded by Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA.
