Suspension laryngoscopy causes prolonged stimulation of the deep pressure receptors of the larynx leading to adverse circulatory responses and consequently cardiac complications. In this study, dexmedetomidine infusion was used to assess its effectiveness for attenuation of this hemodynamic stress response.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Material and Methods:</title><p>Sixty patients undergoing elective microlaryngeal surgery randomly received either dexmedetomidine 1 &#x003bc;g/kg over 10 min followed by continuous infusion of 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg (Group D) or normal saline infusion at the same rate (Group P) till the end of surgery. Anesthesia in all patients was induced with propofol, succinylcholine to facilitate endotracheal intubation after premedication with fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg and glycopyrrolate. Intraoperative, vital parameters were maintained within 20% of baseline with rescue analgesic fentanyl 1 &#x003bc;g/kg and subsequently with propofol boluses up to 1 mg/kg. The percentage of patients and the total amount of intraoperative fentanyl and propofol required in each group were recorded. Sedation score at 10 minutes postextubation was assessed by Ramsay sedation score.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Intraoperative heart rate and mean arterial pressure in Group D were lower than the baseline values and the corresponding values in Group P (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).

The adverse circulatory changes occurring throughout the procedure can be of sufficient magnitude to induce myocardial ischemia, cardiac dysrhythmias, and cerebrovascular accidents in elderly patients with poor cardiopulmonary reserve.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Mitigating the perioperative stress response with a drug that effectively suppresses these obnoxious stress stimuli while handling the laryngeal aperture and vocal cords along with maintenance of adequate depth of anesthesia without compromising oxygenation and ventilation and with a rapid recovery profile is required.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine, a highly selective, specific, and potent &#x003b1;2 adrenergic receptor agonist, owing to its central sympatholytic, anxiolytic properties are known to be effective in suppressing stress response to intubation.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Hence, we hypothesized and investigated the effects of dexmedetomidine infusion on hemodynamic response in patients undergoing microlaryngoscopy (MLScopy) under general anesthesia. The primary aim was to maintain hemodynamics within 20% of baseline values during critical incidences such as laryngoscopy, endotracheal intubation, and MLScopy. The intraoperative requirement of fentanyl as rescue analgesic and propofol as an anesthetic to maintain the hemodynamics within the range of 20% baseline values was the secondary endpoint.</p></sec><sec sec-type="material|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>This prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was undertaken after institutional ethics committee approval. Sixty patients of either sex, having the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Grade I to III, aged between 18 and 60 years, undergoing elective microlaryngeal surgery under general anesthesia were included and written informed consent was obtained from all the participants. Hemodynamically unstable patients, patients with Ischemic heart disease, and those having left bundle-branch block or atrioventricular block more thanfirst degree were excluded from the study. A computer-generated randomization table was used to assign each patient to either Group &#x0201c;P&#x0201d; or Group &#x0201c;D.&#x0201d; Randomly allocated coded syringes containing either normal saline or dexmedetomidine 4 &#x003bc;g/ml (200 &#x003bc;g diluted in 50 ml normal saline) were prepared by an anesthesiologist not involved in either conducting the case, data recording or for monitoring during intra- and post-operative periods. After confirming adequate nil per oral status, patients were wheeled in the operation theater, and baseline heart rate (HR), electrocardiogram (ECG), arterial blood pressure (BP), oxygen saturation were recorded.</p><p>An intravenous access was secured with 20-gauge cannula for infusion of intravenous fluid, and Ringer lactate solution was infused at 2&#x02013;3 ml/kg/h. An additional intravenous access was secured for infusion of study drug after premedication with glycopyrrolate 0.004 mg/kg and fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg. Group D received intravenous dexmedetomidine 1 &#x003bc;g/kg over 10 min followed by continuous infusion of 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/h. Group P received normal saline infusion at the same rate. All the patients received oxygen through nasal prongs at 2 l/min.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, induction of anesthesia was carried out using propofol (2&#x02013;2.5 mg/kg) till loss of eyelash reflex. Endotracheal intubation was facilitated by muscle relaxant succinylcholine (1.5 mg/kg). Under direct laryngoscopic vision, tracheal intubation was done with MLScopy tube of appropriate size 5 and 5.5. Anesthesia was maintained with 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen, and 2.0% end-tidal sevoflurane on close circuit with attached capnometer and ventilation was adjusted to maintain end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> at 34&#x02013;45 mmHg. Loading (0.5 mg/kg) and supplemental doses of atracurium 0.1 mg/kg were administered to provide immobile vocal cords. Suspension laryngoscope was fixed when HR and mean BP (MBP) returned to baseline values. Hemodynamic parameters, i.e., MBP, HR was recorded at specific time points, i.e., premedication, later every 2 min during loading dose infusion of study drugs and then at induction, laryngoscopy and intubation and thereafter at regular interval of 5 min throughout the surgical procedure. HR and MBP were maintained within 20% of baseline values. Fentanyl 1 &#x003bc;g/kg and later bolus doses of propofol up to1 mg/kg were used to maintain the hemodynamics. Number of patients requiring fentanyl as rescue analgesic and anesthetic propofol and their total dose required in each group was recorded. Hypotension (fall in systolic BP &#x0003e;20%) was treated with fluids and ephedrine hydrochloride if required. Bradycardia, i.e., HR &#x0003c;45 on two consecutive readings was treated with atropine sulfate. The infusion of study drugs and sevoflurane were continued till the removal of suspension laryngoscope. All patients received dexamethasone 0.1 mg/kg and ondansetron 4 mg. On completion of surgery, residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed using glycopyrrolate 0.008 mg/kg and neostigmine, 0.06 mg/kg. Tracheal extubation was performed after application of 4% lignocaine spray and excluding cord edema when patients were able to respond to simple verbal commands. Sedation score was assessed 10 min&#x02019; postextubation and was shifted to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) after complete clinical recovery where they received nasal O<sub>2</sub> supplementation, and were monitored for hemodynamic parameters, adverse events if any every 30 min for 2 h&#x02019; till transferred to the surgical ward.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data analysis was done with the help of SPSS version 15 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).

A transient increase in MBP was observed at 2 min of administration of dexmedetomidine infusion, which was followed by a fall probably due to the vasoconstriction effect of dexmedetomidine mediated by &#x003b1;2B receptors appearing before the central sympatholytic action.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Perioperative stress during MLScopy can result in undesirable myocardial events. Dexmedetomidine modifies the stress response by reducing the release of stress hormones (norepinephrine, cortisol). Jianjun Ren <italic>et al</italic>. have evaluated this property of dexmedetomidine in patients of coronary artery disease undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB). They witnessed a reduction in the levels of cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase-MB, norepinephrine, cortisol, BP, HR, myocardial ischemia, and postoperative arrhythmia with 0.2&#x02013;0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/h dexmedetomidine.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] In the present study, none of the patients in Group D developed ST-T changes. The lower HR and BP in Group D could probably have resulted in reducing the myocardial oxygen demand and thus facilitating the maintenance of the myocardial oxygen supply and demand balance.</p><p>Intraoperatively, hemodynamics in Group D were well maintained and lesser mean dose and fewer number 2 (6.6%) of patients required fentanyl as rescue analgesic in contrast to 11 (36.6%) patients in Group P. Similar findings have been described by Bajwa <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] where patients in dexmedetomidine required lesser doses of fentanyl to maintain intraoperative hemodynamics. This could be due to the documented analgesic properties of dexmedetomidine.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, end tidal concentration of sevoflurane was maintained at 2% throughout the procedure. Exaggerated hemodynamic response was attributed to inadequate depth of anesthesia due to unavailability of bispectral analysis (BIS)/entropy and was treated with a slow bolus of up to 1 mg/kg propofol. Propofol requirement to maintain hemodynamics was significantly reduced with dexmedetomidine exploring the anesthesia sparing properties of the drug. Bakhamees <italic>et al</italic>. also found a reduction in propofol requirement with dexmedetomidine in morbidly obese patients when propofol was used for maintenance of anesthesia using bispectral analysis (electroencephalogram) as the depth of anesthesia monitor.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>The study of time taken for extubation and quality of extubation was not a part of our study as laryngeal microscopic surgery leads to irritable airway due to mechanical trauma to laryngeal tissues, and hence extubation is sometimes delayed due to laryngeal edema. Ten percent lignocaine spray was found to be effective in suppression of cough response during extubation by Lee <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] In the present study, lignocaine spray was used in all the patients to reduce airway irritation.</p><p>Smooth emergence and recovery from anesthesia is the goal for successful management of MLScopy.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Postoperative recovery of the patients was found to be better in Group D, could be due to anxiolytic, analgesic and anesthetic sparing properties of dexmedetomidine leading to improved recovery profile. Sedation produced by dexmedetomidine is like normal sleep where patients are easily arousable and responding to verbal commands and then return to sleep like state when not stimulated.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In the placebo group, however, 9 (30%) patients were agitated whereas 2 patients had RSS of 4. This deeper level of sedation could be due to the excessive perioperative requirement of higher doses of other anesthetic drugs such as fentanyl and propofol.</p><p>The sympatholysis caused by dexmedetomidine has potential to increase the incidence of bradycardia and hypotension. Only one patient in the present study developed bradycardia in contrast to 3 patients in clonidine group as reported by Sunitha J Zachariah in their study of comparison of clonidine versus metoprolol for suppression of hemodynamic response to MLScopy.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Dexmedetomidine, a novel &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonist, is an excellent drug for attenuation of pressor response during intubation, during continuous airway manipulation as in microlaryngeal surgery.
