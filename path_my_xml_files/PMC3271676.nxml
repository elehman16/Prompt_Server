NT-Pro BNP levels showed significant increase after 35 minutes of endurance exercise. Our data was similar to the results of other researchers who showed significant increases in plasma levels of NT-Pro BNP after activities like marathon running, cycling and endurance triathlon.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Middleton <italic>et al</italic>. showed that both cardiac Troponin-T and NT-Pro BNP levels were significantly elevated after exercise, indicative of an increase in either left ventricular wall stress or left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Leers <italic>et al</italic>. proposed that post-exercise transient increases in NT-Pro BNP and Troponin-T may reflect myocardial stunning.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] In the present research, we reported that NT-Pro BNP was decreased significantly after 8 weeks of endurance exercise. Previous reports strongly suggested that this reduction in circulating NT-Pro BNP concentration is likely a marker of reduced ventricular wall tension and improved myocardial function.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] With respect to the fact that the functional status of the myocardium contributes to the physical capacity of an individual and the quality of life, reduced NT-Pro BNP after 8 weeks of endurance exercise should signal a valid benefit of exercise training.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Effect of strength exercise on N-Terminal Pro Brain natriuretic peptide release</title><p>In the present study we found that NT-Pro BNP showed no significant change after 35 minutes of strength exercise; however, significant increase in NT-Pro BNP was found after 8 weeks of strength exercise, which may be a marker of strength exercise-induced subtle myocytes injury. We also investigated the effect of androgenic anabolic steroid abuse on NT-Pro BNP release. Bodybuilders regularly using androgenic anabolic steroids had significantly lower basal NT-Pro BNP levels compared with bodybuilders not using anabolic androgenic steroids. This finding may be due to higher body mass index (BMI) of bodybuilders using anabolic androgenic steroids. In the Framingham study, NT-Pro BNP levels were lower in subjects with higher BMI.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Decreased release of natriuretic peptides from the heart or increased clearance may be responsible for the association between higher BMI and lower natriuretic peptide levels.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Endurance exercise training reduces circulating NT-Pro BNP concentration which is likely a marker of reduced ventricular wall tension and improved myocardial function.
