Patients were randomly divided into three groups, i.e., single-visit group (Group 1), multi-visit group without any intracanal medicament (Group 2), and multi-visit group with Vitapex as interim intracanal medicament (Group 3). Comparison was done radiographically using periapical index (PAI). The primary outcome measure was the change in periapical radiolucency after 1 year assessed by PAI scores. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to evaluate differences between groups at baseline (immediate postoperative) and at the 12-month follow-up evaluation. Change in PAI score for each group from baseline to 12-month follow-up evaluation was tested with the Wilcoxon signed rank test.

Ethical clearance for the study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board.</p><p>The primary criterion for inclusion of subjects in the study was the presence of radiographically demonstrable AP (minimum size - 2.0 mm &#x000d7; 2.0 mm) in maxillary anterior or mandibular anterior tooth/teeth. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were included in the study. Patients were excluded from the study if (a) they had a diagnosis of diabetes, (b) they had a diagnosis of immune-compromising disease, (c) they were &#x0003c;16 or &#x0003e;65-year-old, or (d) the tooth had been previously accessed or treated. Once the eligibility was confirmed, the study was explained to the patient, and the patient was invited to participate. After written and verbal informed consent was obtained, the patients were randomly assigned to the treatment groups by throwing of a dice viz., Group 1 (single-visit treatment group), Group 2 (multi-visit treatment group without any intracanal medicament), and Group 3 (multi-visit treatment group with Vitapex as an intracanal medicament).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Clinical procedure</title><p>All patients were treated by one investigator (gsg) according to a standard regimen including elements of access, rubber dam, and establishment of asepsis. Local anesthesia (2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine) was administered to the patient. Initial caries excavation was performed, rubber dam isolation was obtained, and a standard access cavity was prepared. Initial canal working length was established by using the Root ZX electronic apex locator (J. Morita Co., Tokyo, Japan) and a #15 stainless steel K-file. Working length was confirmed and adjusted as needed by using radiographs. Canals were instrumented using stainless steel K-files and H-files using step-back technique. Canals were irrigated with 5.0 mL 2.5% sodium hypochlorite after each instrumentation cycle, and canal patency was maintained by passing a #10 stainless steel file up to working length. After the completion of canal instrumentation, all canals were irrigated with 5.0 mL, 17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (Glyde, Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) for 1 min followed by a final irrigation with 5.0 mL 2.5% sodium hypochlorite. Canals were then dried with sterile paper points. Obturation was done with Gutta-percha and zinc oxide eugenol sealer using lateral condensation technique.</p><p>Teeth in Group 1 were obturated at the same appointment by using the lateral condensation technique using Gutta-percha and access cavities were restored using anterior composite restorations.</p><p>In Group 2, instrumentation was completed at the first appointment. The canal was left empty, and access cavity was closed using Cavit-G (3M ESPE) for at least 1 week before the second appointment. On the second appointment, the obturation was completed using lateral condensation technique and tooth/teeth restored with composite restoration.</p><p>In Group 3, instrumentation was completed at the first appointment. Vitapex was placed in the canal to remain for at least 1 week before second appointment. At the second appointment, the Vitapex paste was removed by using circumferential filing with Hedstrom-files and copious irrigation with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite followed by 5.0 mL 17% EDTA and a final rinse of 5.0 mL 2.5% sodium hypochlorite. Complete removal of the Vitapex paste was confirmed radiographically. The canals were dried with sterile paper points, and obturation was performed with the same technique described for Group 1. After completion of treatment, the teeth were restored with a composite restoration.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Radiographic technique</title><p>All radiographs were done using Kodak RVG5000 size#2 sensor and Gnatus X-ray machine operating at (70 KVp-7 mA-0.08-1540VA) with exposure settings kept constant at 0.32 s. Immediately after obturation, digital radiographs were taken using Rinn XCP sensor holder (Rinn Corp., Elgin, IL, USA) stabilized with polyvinyl siloxane impression material (AFFINIS-Coltene Whaledent) to standardize image geometry. Impression of each patient was preserved for follow-up radiograph in a polythene packet.

Consensus was reached on images that were not initially scored the same by all examiners.</p><p>To assess intrarater agreement, 4 weeks after the first session the examiners again scored all study images. This method generated a total of 6 PAI scores for each image, 2 from each of the three examiners. Agreement between and within examiners was determined by using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Intrarater reliability was measured with the single measure ICC (SPSS 13 for Windows, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and inter-rater agreement was measured with the average measure ICC (also known as the inter-rater reliability coefficient).</p><p>After the second independent scoring session, the examiners met as a group to reach consensus on cases that did not receive unanimous agreement on the PAI score. Consensus was reached on all images. The consensus score for each image was considered the true score and was used for statistical analysis. The identifying code for each image was not broken until after the consensus score was determined.

The secondary outcome measures, proportion of teeth in each group that could be considered improved (decreased PAI score) or healed (PAI &#x0003c; 2), were assessed with the Chi-square test.

Periapical surgery was done in one patient due to persistant draining sinus, within 3 months of obturation, other patient had an accident and both teeth had to be extracted because of fracture. Ten patients (16 teeth) were lost to follow-up.

The expectation that teeth treated in two visits with an interappointment dressing of Vitapex paste would result in improved healing when compared with one-visit root canal therapy was not supported by this study. No statistically significant differences were found between the three treatment groups in the healing of AP; our findings are consistent with the majority of well-controlled clinical studies.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] When comparison was done between initial and final (1 year recall) PAI score in each group, statistically significant improvement in PAI score was found in every group (including Group 2), which corroborates the study of Gesi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] that with proper use of aseptic operating procedures, proper instrumentation, and filling, an inter-appointment dressing with calcium hydroxide does not seem to influence outcome.</p><p>Leaving the canal empty without obturation or use of any additional medicament (Group 2) was numerically (though not statistically significant with given sample size) the worst method of treatment, which are consistent with the study of Trope <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Main problems with prospective studies are the recall rate, adequate sample size, and control of the baseline status. Sixty teeth out of the original sample of 81 teeth were included in the final analysis with a recall rate of 74% which is more than the median recall rate of 52.7% Ng <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and Penesis <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] but less compared to the studies by Weiger <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and Paredes-Vieyra and Enriquez.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</p><p>Although the sample size in this study was small, it is typical when compared with similar studies,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] but the sample size of the present study was not large enough for statistical significance. Because even inferior protocols result in about 60% success, it requires a large sample size to show statistically significant differences in results for different treatment protocols. These numbers are extremely difficult to achieve in a prospective study like this one considering the time constraints, limited resources, and subject dropouts associated with long recall period. To compensate for this problem, a power analysis[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] of the results was performed to calculate the adequate sample size required to make the results clinically significant. In general, a sample size of 49 per group would have resulted in significant differences between the single visit and multiple visit groups.</p><p>To minimize the bias, patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups, and root canal therapy was performed according to a standardized regimen.

The only known independent variable was number of visits and use of Vitapex as intracanal medicament. Fortunately, the number of teeth in each group was reasonably evenly distributed during treatment and after 1 year recall, neither group varied significantly from the study dropouts.</p><p>Calcium hydroxide is currently acknowledged as the best intracanal medicament in endodontic treatment procedures. It is effective against most endopathogens but has a limited activity against Candida albicans and Enterococcus faecalis. Leonardo <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] recommended the addition of other substances to the paste to increase or maintain the paste consistency of the material which does not harden or set in the root canal, to improve flow, maintain pH of calcium hydroxide, to improve radio-opacity, to make clinical use easier and not alter the excellent biological properties of calcium hydroxide itself. Hence, Vitapex was used as an intracanal medicament which contains iodoform (synergistic action), silicone oil (silicone oil based calcium hydroxide is effective in the elimination of E. faecalis),[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and radiopacifiers, which increase the paste radiopacity, which helps in confirming insertion and complete removal from the root canal using radiograph.</p><p>Vitapex was placed in the root canals of Group 3 for a period of 7 days before obturation as in the studies by Law and Messer,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Siqueira <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] for calcium hydroxide dressings.</p><p>After root canal treatment the probability of healing increases over time,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] however periapical changes are evident by 1 year.[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] Orstavik[<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] concluded that 1-year follow-up predicts long-term success and the risk of disease development at 2 years or later is not greater than general risk based on epidemiological studies.

To overcome this disadvantage as much as possible, calibration of examiners was done and consensus score was taken as a true score. Agreement between and within examiners was determined by using the ICC. Single and average measure inter-reliability score of 0.91 and 0.95, respectively, in this study, represent a very high level of agreement between the examiners, even before meeting for a consensus score for each image similar to that in the study by Penesis <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</p><p>In most studies, PAI scores are generally dichotomized as healed (PAI 1, 2) and diseased (PAI 3, 4, 5), but it may obscure the small amount of change that may be clinically significant. The process of calibrating observers and arriving at a consensus is also very time-consuming.</p><p>Measurement of density as a continuous variable can be more expressive than the PAI scoring system[<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref><xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Use of digital radiography has added advantages of less radiation exposure, time saving, and freedom from processing errors. However, variations in soft tissue superimposition and physiologic modeling over time may influence the measurements, producing erroneous information.</p><p>Nevertheless, the sample and operator may not accurately represent the true population of patients and clinicians. Results can be influenced by many unknown and uncontrolled variables like on an average, every patient contributed two teeth in the study with some patients contributing three or four teeth which increased the dependency of results on subjects. Similarly, diabetic and immune-compromised patients were excluded from the study, but smokers were not despite the evidence that they also experience poorer treatment outcomes.[<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref><xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] All cases in the study were done during the period of postgraduation course (2010-2013) under faculty supervision with the opportunity for consultation and assistance as needed; therefore, the treatment environment might not be truly representative of either specialty or general dental practice setting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>From the present study, it can be concluded that 12 months after initial nonsurgical root canal therapy on teeth with AP, there was no statistically significant difference in periapical healing between single visit treatment and multi-visit treatment with the given sample size.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We sincerely acknowledge the support of Dr. Pynshngain Phyllei, Dr. Monali Purkayastha, Dr. Satheesh S.
