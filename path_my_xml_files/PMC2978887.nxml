This report describes the pharmacokinetics and resulting serum calcium response to teriparatide in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Pharmacokinetic samples for this analysis were obtained from 360 women who participated in the Fracture Prevention Trial. Postmenopausal women with osteoporosis received daily subcutaneous injections of either teriparatide 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g (4.86&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol) or placebo, median 21&#x000a0;months&#x02019; treatment. Serum teriparatide and calcium concentrations were measured throughout the study. An indirect-response model was developed to describe the pharmacokinetic&#x02013;pharmacodynamic relationship between teriparatide concentrations and serum calcium response. The pharmacokinetics of teriparatide were characterized by rapid absorption (maximum concentration achieved within 30&#x000a0;min) and rapid elimination (half-life of 1&#x000a0;h), resulting in a total duration of exposure to the peptide of approximately 4&#x000a0;h. Teriparatide transiently increased serum calcium, with the maximum effect observed at approximately 4.25&#x000a0;h (median increase 0.4&#x000a0;mg/dl [0.1&#x000a0;mmol/l]). Calcium concentrations returned to predose levels by 16&#x02013;24&#x000a0;h after each dose. Persistent hypercalcemia was not observed; one teriparatide 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g-treated patient had a predose serum calcium value above the normal range but &#x0003c;11.0&#x000a0;mg/dl (2.75&#x000a0;mmol/l). Following once-daily subcutaneous administration, teriparatide produces a modest but transient increase in serum calcium, consistent with the known effects of endogenous PTH on mineral metabolism. The excursion in serum calcium is brief, due to the short length of time that teriparatide concentrations are elevated.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Anabolic agent</kwd><kwd>Osteoporosis therapy</kwd><kwd>Peptide hormone</kwd><kwd>Parathyroid hormone</kwd><kwd>Teriparatide pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>Calcium pharmacodynamics</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The extracellular calcium concentration is of utmost importance for maintenance of both intracellular and extracellular processes playing a critical role in the regulation of a variety of physiological functions. In response to slight decrements in extracellular calcium levels, there is a rapid (within seconds) increase in the rate of parathyroid hormone (PTH) release into the systemic circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The most immediate effect of PTH is on the renal tubule, where it stimulates conservation of calcium. This effect is almost instantaneous and is the primary way PTH regulates serum calcium minute by minute. If elevated for 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;h, PTH stimulates translocation of calcium from an extracellular compartment located between bone lining cells and the bone surface into the circulation. Finally, if elevated for several hours, PTH promotes intestinal absorption of calcium by stimulating the conversion of 25-OH vitamin D to the highly active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. PTH regulation by calcium, coupled with the rapid secretion and rapid clearance (half-life&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;min) of the endogenous hormone, assures that PTH can adjust to sudden changes in plasma calcium flux [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Teriparatide, recombinant human parathyroid hormone (rhPTH[1&#x02013;34]), is a skeletal anabolic agent that, when injected subcutaneously once daily, increases bone mass and reduces the risk of osteoporotic fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Calcium metabolism is affected in a pattern consistent with the known actions of endogenous PTH. Given the role of PTH in the regulation of extracellular calcium over both short- and long-term periods, it is important to understand the time course of the calcemic response to exogenously administered teriparatide as well. The purpose of this article is to describe the pharmacokinetics (PK) and resulting serum calcium pharmacodynamic (PD) response following subcutaneous injection of 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g (4.86&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol) of teriparatide in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis participating in the Fracture Prevention Trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study Design and Participants</title><p>Full details on the Fracture Prevention Trial have been published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and prevalent fractures were randomized to receive once-daily subcutaneous injections of teriparatide 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;541), teriparatide 40&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;552), or placebo (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;544) plus daily calcium (1,000&#x000a0;mg) and vitamin D (400&#x02013;1,200&#x000a0;IU) supplements. This report includes results from the marketed 20-&#x003bc;g/day dose of teriparatide. Study exclusion criteria included the following: diagnosis with any disease known to affect bone or calcium metabolism, urolithiasis within 2&#x000a0;years, serum creatinine level &#x0003e;2&#x000a0;mg/dl, alcohol or drug abuse, and medication use known to alter bone metabolism within the previous 2&#x02013;24&#x000a0;months depending on the drug. Patients who were treated with oral bisphosphonates within 3&#x000a0;months of randomization or for more than 60&#x000a0;days in the 24&#x000a0;months prior to randomization or who were treated with intravenous bisphosphonate within 24&#x000a0;months prior to randomization were excluded.</p><p>All study sites obtained institutional review board approval. Written informed consent was given by each participant prior to her inclusion in the study. Study methods and procedures were conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Teriparatide and Calcium Measurements</title><p>Serum teriparatide concentrations were measured in a subset of 360 patients at months 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18. One blood sample was collected per patient at each study visit within prespecified sampling windows of 0&#x02013;30&#x000a0;min, 30&#x000a0;min&#x02013;1&#x000a0;h, 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;h, 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;h, and 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;h postdose. The exact postdose collection times were documented. The blood sampling scheme was based on a sparse sampling strategy such that a complete PK profile was not obtained from each patient but, rather, a few samples were drawn from many patients and the data combined to characterize the PK profile for the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The serum was separated from whole blood by centrifugation and stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C until assayed. Teriparatide was measured by a validated two-site immunoradiometric assay (Phoenix International, Montreal, Canada). Two different antibodies to the 1&#x02013;34 region of PTH were supplied by Immutopics (San Clemente, CA). One antibody was immobilized on a plastic bead and used to capture teriparatide. The second antibody was labeled with <sup>125</sup>I and used to detect the bound teriparatide.</p><p>The specificity of the assay was determined by using PTH(1&#x02013;34) and smaller fragments. The assay could detect (1&#x02013;31) but not (1&#x02013;27) on the C terminus; it could also detect (2&#x02013;34) and (3&#x02013;34) but not (4&#x02013;34) on the N terminus. The percent cross-reactivity of PTH(1&#x02013;84), relative to the PTH(1&#x02013;34) standards, was 67% on a molar basis. However, results from phase 1 and phase 3 studies demonstrated that endogenous PTH secretion was dramatically suppressed following teriparatide injection (data on file); thus, interference by endogenous PTH(1&#x02013;84) in the quantification of PTH(1&#x02013;34) was negligible. Serial blood samples collected from a phase 1 study demonstrated that the decline in PTH(1&#x02013;84) concentrations was immediate, reaching a nadir approximately 2&#x000a0;h postdose and remaining suppressed for at least 6&#x000a0;h in most subjects. In the phase 3 study that is the focus of this report, PTH(1&#x02013;84) was measured at screening and 12&#x000a0;months after initiation of teriparatide therapy. During screening visits, prior to teriparatide treatment, mean PTH(1&#x02013;84) was 35&#x000a0;pg/ml; there were no samples below the limit of quantification for the PTH(1&#x02013;84) assay, i.e., &#x0003c;16.6&#x000a0;pg/ml. Following 12&#x000a0;months of teriparatide treatment, 91% of the samples were below quantifiable limits. The high number of nonquantifiable samples illustrates the suppression of endogenous PTH secretion during teriparatide therapy, suggesting minimal interference in the detection of PTH(1&#x02013;34).</p><p>The PTH(1&#x02013;34) assay was validated to accurately and reproducibly quantify exogenously administered PTH(1&#x02013;34); accuracy and precision were both &#x000b1;20%. A standard curve of 9.8&#x02013;20,000&#x000a0;pg/ml was used with the quantification range of 50&#x02013;2,000&#x000a0;pg/ml determined in the assay validation experiments.</p><p>Blood samples for serum calcium were collected in all patients at baseline (i.e., prerandomization) and 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;h after injection at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24&#x000a0;months of treatment. Additionally, routine clinical chemistry laboratory testing, which included serum calcium, was performed at baseline and at 1, 6, 12, and 24&#x000a0;months of treatment. The clinical chemistry labs were collected at random times, and the exact postdose collection time was documented. If the calcium concentration was &#x0003e;10.6&#x000a0;mg/dl (2.647&#x000a0;mmol/l), the test was normally repeated within a couple of weeks. If the retest value was also elevated, the calcium supplement dose was reduced or discontinued or the dose of the injectable study material was reduced by half and the serum calcium laboratory test repeated. If still elevated, the patient was discontinued from the trial. Adverse events were collected throughout the trial.</p><p>All clinical chemistry labs from an individual patient were performed at one of three laboratories that used identical, cross-calibrated methods of measurement. Serum albumin was normal in the study population, and adjusting serum calcium concentrations for albumin appeared only to increase the variability of the measure without having a significant effect on the mean values; therefore, the unadjusted total serum calcium is presented.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>PK Model</title><p>A population PK model was first developed to characterize the concentration&#x02013;time profile following subcutaneous injection of teriparatide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Both one-compartment and two-compartment open linear models were considered for the PK model. Absorption was assumed to follow a first-order process, and elimination was assumed to occur from the central compartment in the two-compartment model. These models were parameterized in terms of absorption rate constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub>), apparent clearance (CL/F), central compartment volume (Vc/F), intercompartmental clearance (Q/F), and peripheral compartment volume (Vp/F).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>PK&#x02013;PD Model</title><p>A PK&#x02013;PD model was also developed to characterize the serum calcium response to daily teriparatide injection as a function of time and teriparatide concentration. The PK&#x02013;PD analysis data set contained 3,085 calcium and 1,282 teriparatide concentrations obtained from 360 patients whose age and weight ranged from 49 to 85&#x000a0;years (10th&#x02013;90th percentile range 60&#x02013;77&#x000a0;years) and 39.5 to 120&#x000a0;kg (10th&#x02013;90th percentile range 51&#x02013;80&#x000a0;kg) at study entry, respectively. Baseline serum calcium values ranged from 8.28 to 10.6&#x000a0;mg/dl, mean value of 9.2 with a variability of 0.38&#x000a0;mg/dl (&#x000b1;standard deviation [SD]).

The PK and PK&#x02013;PD models were developed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling techniques in NONMEM (version VI) with PREDPP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. First-order conditional estimation with interaction (NONMEM User&#x02019;s Guide, Part VII) was used for the PK model, while first-order estimation was used for the PK&#x02013;PD model. Additive and proportional interpatient variability models were tested. Three residual error models&#x02014;(1) additive, (2) proportional, and (3) combined additive and proportional&#x02014;were also evaluated.</p><p>Model development strategies were consistent between the PK and full PK&#x02013;PD analyses. First, basic structural models were built, with interpatient variability included on all parameters where it was estimable. In addition, covariance between parameters was tested using the OMEGA BLOCK option in NONMEM. Second, factors potentially influencing the PK and PD of teriparatide, including age, body weight, injection site, creatinine clearance, smoking, and alcohol history, were examined graphically and then tested through estimation of covariate models.</p><p>A stepwise forward and backward approach was applied such that each covariate was added or deleted one at a time. When possible, physiologic relevance was considered in covariate selection. However, the log-likelihood ratio test was the primary criterion used to determine the appropriateness of a selected covariate. A decrease in the objective function value of &#x02265;6.635 (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01, degree of freedom&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1) in a full model compared with the reduced model indicated that the full model was the superior model. If the difference in the objective function value was &#x0003c;6.635, then it was assumed that there was no significant difference between the two models and the simpler reduced model (i.e., without covariate) was retained.</p><p>Potentially significant covariates were then added to the base model in combination so that a full model containing all possible covariates was established. Highly correlated patient factors (e.g., age and years postmenopausal) were evaluated separately and the most statistically significant covariate was retained. The process was then reversed, with potential covariates being removed individually from the full model. Finally, covariates retained in the final model were those which resulted in a significant increase in objective function (&#x02265;10.828 points for 1 degree of freedom, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001), when removed from the full model. The fit of the resulting model was evaluated using diagnostic plots of predicted versus observed values, as well as a visual predictive check [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Predose serum calcium was also analyzed by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with baseline as a covariate using SAS v.8.2 for MVS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The numbers of patients with calcium values &#x0003e;10.6 or &#x0003e;11.0&#x000a0;mg/dl were compared between treatment groups using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Results</title><p>The treatment groups were well balanced for baseline characteristics and disease severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].

The peptide reached a maximum concentration about 30&#x000a0;min after subcutaneous injection and then declined with a half-life of 1&#x000a0;h. This half-life reflects the time required for absorption from the injection site as the true elimination half-life following intravenous administration was 5&#x000a0;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>In most subjects, teriparatide concentrations were &#x0003c;50&#x000a0;pg/ml by 3&#x000a0;h after injection of a 20-&#x003bc;g dose.

On a molar basis, the teriparatide concentrations briefly exceeded the upper limit of normal for about 3&#x000a0;h and remained above basal concentrations for about 4&#x000a0;h.</p><p>A one-compartment absorption rate-limited PK model with first-order elimination and interpatient variability on CL/F, V/F, and <italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> served as the base model for further covariate search and model refinement; a two-compartment model did not significantly improve the fit of the data. Of all the covariates tested, only body weight and injection site were found to have small but statistically significant influences on the rate of teriparatide absorption. No association was found between age, smoking, alcohol history, or renal function and teriparatide PK. Injections into the thigh were estimated to have a 21% slower rate of absorption than abdominal wall injections, resulting in an 18% reduction in maximum teriparatide concentrations (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) and 1.5&#x000a0;min prolongation in the time to reach the peak concentration (<italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub>).

The slower rates of absorption did not affect the overall systemic exposure to teriparatide. Furthermore, population PD analyses demonstrated no statistically significant differences in lumbar spine BMD or biochemical marker responses based on body weight or injection site (data not shown). Therefore, the magnitude of the effects of body weight and injection site on the rate of teriparatide absorption, and the resultant peak serum concentrations, is not considered to be clinically meaningful.</p><p>The <italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> of 0.63&#x000a0;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> supports the assertion of absorption rate-limited PK since the half-life based upon this rate constant (i.e., ln 2/0.63&#x000a0;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.1&#x000a0;h) is consistent with the observed half-life of teriparatide following subcutaneous injection.

One reason for this is the rapid rates of absorption and elimination of teriparatide. After subcutaneous injection, maximum teriparatide concentrations are achieved within 30&#x000a0;min, followed by a rapid decline from the systemic circulation with a half-life of 1&#x000a0;h. Teriparatide transiently increases serum calcium, with the maximal effect observed at approximately 4.25&#x000a0;h (median increase, 0.4&#x000a0;mg/dl or 0.1&#x000a0;mM) followed by a decline to predose levels before the next teriparatide dose is administered 24&#x000a0;h later.</p><p>The results of studies in rats have also shown that the therapeutic interval for PTH(1&#x02013;34) exposure is brief but that prolonged exposure results in severe hypercalcemia. Using a total daily dose of 80&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg body weight of hPTH(1&#x02013;34), Dobnig and Turner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] demonstrated that a single subcutaneous injection or continuous infusion for 1 or 2&#x000a0;h/day had no effect on serum calcium. In contrast, continuous infusion of hPTH(1&#x02013;34) for 6&#x000a0;h/day resulted in hypercalcemia. Frolik et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] confirmed that sustained elevated serum calcium concentrations occurred following subcutaneous injections of teriparatide every hour for six injections but not following once-daily subcutaneous injection of teriparatide or six injections within 1&#x000a0;h.</p><p>The PK&#x02013;PD profile of teriparatide 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g has practical clinical implications because the PK and calcium PD results show notable differences compared to those of the full human recombinant PTH (rhPTH[1&#x02013;84]), which is also available for the treatment of osteoporosis in some countries at a daily dose of 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g.</p><p>The PK and PD of single-dose rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) subcutaneous injection (dose range 0.02&#x02013;5.0&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg) were reported by Schwietert et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The serum concentration&#x02013;time profile of rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) exhibited a double-peak profile, with the first peak appearing approximately 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;min after dosing and the second peak occurring about 1.5&#x02013;2&#x000a0;h after subcutaneous injection of this hormone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Interestingly, at all rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) doses administered, there was a fixed equilibrium between elevated PTH(1&#x02013;84) and PTH(1&#x02013;34), a biologically active fragment of PTH(1&#x02013;84) that was further accompanied by a double-peak profile in serum total calcium concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The apparent terminal half-life of rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) was reported to be 1.5&#x02013;2.5&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In contrast, the time to peak concentration of teriparatide is 30&#x000a0;min following injection, with a half-life of 1&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Based on the PK concentration&#x02013;time profile for each drug, we calculated the duration of time that PTH concentrations were &#x0003e;65&#x000a0;pg/ml, the upper limit of normal for endogenous PTH, and &#x0003e;28&#x000a0;pg/ml, the typical basal endogenous PTH concentration for postmenopausal women. Using the published PK profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] for rhPTH(1&#x02013;84), we calculated that the time above the upper limit exceeded 6&#x000a0;h and the time above basal concentrations exceeded 9&#x000a0;h for the marketed dose of 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g (1.66&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg, assuming an average body weight of 60&#x000a0;kg). In contrast, teriparatide concentrations exceeded the upper limit of normal and remained above the basal concentrations for approximately 3 and 4&#x000a0;h, respectively. Such differences compared to the PK&#x02013;PD relationship of teriparatide could translate into the formation of a longer &#x0201c;drug exposure time&#x0201d; for rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) compared with teriparatide. Indeed, the resulting calcemic response elicited by 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) led to a peak serum calcium increase of 0.6&#x000a0;mg/dl (0.15&#x000a0;mmol/l) between 6 and 8&#x000a0;h postdose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These apparent differences in the duration of exposure may help to explain why hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria are relatively rare events following administration of teriparatide 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], although they have been more frequently reported in the rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g pivotal trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Whether it is the slower rate of absorption and elimination of rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) due to its larger size and/or the parallel generation of PTH(1&#x02013;34) and possibly other biologically active amino-terminal PTH fragments whose biological half-lives are less well characterized that leads to a larger calcemic response than teriparatide has yet to be determined.</p><p>Another potential explanation for the differences in the calcemic responses is that the dose of rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) used in the pivotal phase 3 trial (100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/day, 10.62&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/day) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] is approximately twofold greater on a molar basis than teriparatide 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g. However, it has been reported that the bioavailability of rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) is 55% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] compared with the 95% bioavailability of teriparatide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Thus, when adjusting for molecular weight and bioavailability, the relative doses administered in the rhPTH(1&#x02013;84) pivotal phase 3 trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and the teriparatide Fracture Prevention Trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] were 5.84 and 4.61&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol, respectively, a difference that is unlikely to explain the disparity in the rates of hypercalcemia or drug exposure time between the two studies.</p><p>In conclusion, the pharmacologic effect of teriparatide following once-daily subcutaneous administration produces a modest but transient increase in serum calcium, consistent with the known effects of endogenous PTH on mineral metabolism. The PK&#x02013;PD indirect-response model illustrates that the excursion in serum calcium is brief due to the short length of time that teriparatide concentrations are elevated.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was funded by Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN.
