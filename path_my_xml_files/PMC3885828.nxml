response time in the attention and concentration tasks. [Subjects and Methods] The
participants were 30 healthy university students, who were randomly and equally divided
into two groups, the experimental and control groups. They were treated using the
Happy-sleep device or a sham device, respectively. All participants had a one-week
training period. Before and after training sessions, a behavioral task test was performed
and EEG alpha waves were measured to confirm the effectiveness of training on cognitive
function. [Results] In terms of the behavioral task test, reaction time (RT) variations in
the experimental group were significantly larger than in the control group for the
attention item. Changes in the EEG alpha power in the experimental group were also
significantly larger than those of the control group. [Conclusions] These findings suggest
that sleep induced using the Happy-sleep device modestly enhances the ability to pay
attention and focus during academic learning.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Sleep function</kwd><kwd>Electroencephalography (EEG)</kwd><kwd>Alpha brain wave</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Sleep function is known to include physical and psychological restoration and recovery,
memory consolidation, the discharge of emotions, and the enhancement of cognitive
processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cognitive processes are
related to intrinsic academic motivation, learning performance, and task performance, and
thus, the cognitive aspects of sleep function have become a popular theme these days<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>It is well known that sleep is closely related to cognitive function, for example, it has
been reported that poor sleep quality is associated with decrements in performance in tests
of cognition, especially executive function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
addition, some studies have reported that task performances, such as, arousal, reaction
time, arithmetic operation, short-term or long-term memory, and logic/reasoning decrease
when people are deprived of sleep<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. These findings suggest that poor sleep
quality can have a negative effect on academic performance. In particular, poor sleep can
deplete attention and lead to fatigue resulting in severe impediments to academic work<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many previous studies have addressed the relationship between attention and brainwaves. In
particular, the alpha waveband has been found to contribute perceptual facilitation as a
result of featured-based visual attention<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Alpha waves are relatively lower than other waves, like beta waves, and are closely related
to memory, creativity, and academic performance, because they appear during a stable state
of the brain, which seems to be in the best state in terms of learning and attention<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, many trials have been
undertaken to prompt brain states to achieve recovery from memory disorders and cognitive
functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, some studies
have reported that EEG activity of the alpha and theta wavebands reflect cognitive and
memory performance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has also been
reported that a peak alpha rhythm of less than 10&#x02005;Hz is associated with poorer academic
performance and that an alpha rhythm frequency of more than 10&#x02005;Hz is associated with better
academic performance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, &#x003b1;
waves provide an excellent means of inducing sleep, and it has been shown that alpha rhythm
is related to NREM (Non-Rapid Eye Movement) at the beginning of sleep<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Despite of these studies, there is a lack of evidence to suggesting a relationship between
induced alpha rhythm sleep and attention/cognitive performance. Hence, in this study, we
undertook to investigate the effectiveness of alpha rhythm induced sleep on attention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Thirty healthy normal subjects were recruited for this study. Individuals with a
neurological or visual impairment or a cognition problem were excluded. All subjects were
assigned randomly to either the experimental group, which used the Happy-sleep device, or
the control group which used a sham device. The study was approved by the Daegu university
ethics committee and participants provided their written informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The Happy-sleep sound pillow and Happy-sleep application are produced by Rabiotech
(Seoul, Korea). The sound pillow has a bone conduction transducer that can convert
electrical signals into vibrations. Thus, allowing sound to be directly conducted to skull
and then to the inner ear without being conducted through the eardrum when the occipital
region is closely in contact with the device. The Happy-sleep application contains a
program to induce deep sleep by emitting only alpha and theta waves. This program is
claimed not only to induce deep sleep, but also to improve academic performance by
inducing alpha and theta waves. The studies have been performed to confirm the results of
this program in Korea, and it has been approved by Korean Mind Training Center (KMTC). The
sham device used had an identical shape and produced the same sound. The frequencies
generated by the sham device were randomly mixed so as not to settle on any frequent wave,
such as, those of an alpha or theta waves, or any other known brainwave. In addition, no
particular wave was provided for more than a second. All other characteristics related to
typical use of the Happy-sleep application were imitated.</p><p>Before and after the intervention, a brainwave measurement system, QEEG-8 (LXE 3208,
LAXTHA Inc., Korea), comprising of 8 channels and Telescan software (LAXTHA Inc., Korea),
were used to measure and analyze EEG activity. Rehacom (HASOMED GmbH, Germany), which is a
Cognitive Rehabilitation/Brain Performance Training system, was also used to assess
Attention and concentration in the behavioral task performance.</p><p>This study had a randomized controlled trial design. All subjects in the experimental and
control groups performed a behavioral task in the pre- (Day 1) and post test (Day 9)
sessions. Between test sessions, there was a one-week training period. In intervention
period, all subjects practiced for an hour before sleep each day with the Happy-sleep or
sham device, depending on the experimental condition. In the test session, The behavioral
task was performed using the Attention &#x00026; Concentration section of the Rehacom program.
The test consists of 3 trials and has 24 levels and it involves finding a picture on the
screen that matches a provided picture. After 10 minutes testing, the number of trials,
maximum response time, and minimum response time at each level were measured and compared
between the pre- and post-testing.</p><p>For EEG measurements, brainwaves were measured over a 10-minute period while performing
the Rehacom program with 8 electrodes attached to the scalp. Activity in 8 channels was
recorded at Fz, Cz, Pz, C3, C4, T7, and T8 in the left/right hemispheres. Electrode
placement was in accordance with the international 10&#x02013;20 system, using an electrode cap.
Reference and ground electrodes were attached to the left and right mastoid processes,
respectively.</p><p>After both groups had performed the pre-testing on the first day, each device was used
for a week, and then the post-testing was performed on the ninth day. During the
experimental period, all subjects were asked to use the Happy-sleep sound pillow with the
application or the sham device respectively for an hour before sleep every day. In
addition, they were also instructed not to consume alcohol or caffeine during the study
period. Each subject kept a diary, and these were used to confirm that they had complied
with the study protocol.</p><p>Demographic data such as age (22.87&#x000b1;1.63&#x02005;years) and gender (male: 13, female: 17) were
analyzed by one way ANOVA. To demonstrate intergroup difference in response time changes
during the attention task, two dependents variables, namely, maximum reaction time (RT)
and minimum RT, were analyzed using the independent t-test. Differences in EEG alpha power
during the attention task between the experimental and control groups were analyzed using
the independent t-test for each of the eight channels (Fz, Cz, Pz, C3, C4, T7, and T8).
All data were analyzed using SPSS ver. 18.0 for Windows, and &#x003b1;=0.05 was used as the level
of significance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>No significant difference in gender (male: 13, female: 17) or age (22.87&#x000b1;1.63&#x02005;years), which

attention task and in alpha power of EEG activity after sleep when the device was used.
However, no significant changes were observed in the sham-device group. These results imply
that sleep produced using the device provides a modest enhancement in attention and focus
during academic learning.</p><p>Our finding of a decline in response times is in line with previous behavioral experiments
using the attention task, and these reflect a gradual reduction in audio-visual entrainment
(AVE). Many previous studies have reported that the AVE device can increase attentional
skill and decrease impulsive behavior<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In addition, according to prior studies conducting cognitive performance and functional
outcome with cognitive remediation therapy, motor skill training with the audio-visual
stimulation improved performance, indicating that sensorimotor integration processing is a
part of motor skill learning<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, we speculate that sleep induced with the device
could reduce processing times via cognitive entrainment and increase motor skills.</p><p>Recently, many neural activity studies have investigated changes in brain wave activity in
different brain areas and their relationships with behavioral changes. According to previous
EEG studies, EEG activity of neural areas concerned with deficient attention, hyperactivity,
and insufficient sleep, show relatively lower alpha activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several studies have revealed that alpha activity, and not theta
or beta activity, is the major band associated with arousal, which has been linked to
attention, perceptual processing, and semantic memory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, alpha
activity is of specific interest because its frequency is thought to reflect indirectly the
level of cortical activation underlying brain regions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. Greater alpha activity
is thought to reflect active preparation of the cortical system for complex information
processing, that is, to increase the state of preparedness to perform a task. Accordingly,
greater alpha activity is related to positive behavioral outcomes, including rapid and
accurate responses, and enhanced cognitive task performance, such as, at attention and
target detecting tasks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present
study, the global increases in alpha activity observed are in line with the findings of
previous studies, which found that physiologic arousal and relaxation are achieved during
cognitive task. Therefore, it is believed that alpha activity oscillators induce
synchronization between immediate execution and selective inhibition by inducing the
neuronal excitabilities of multiple processes.</p><p>These findings showed that higher alpha activity after sleep with the device could have a
direct impact on brain regions, and effectively improve cortical excitability subserving
particular cognitive functions, such as, attention. Furthermore, the combined use of this
facilitatory device and training could enhance academic learning. We acknowledge that this
study has some limitations, for example, task complexity and difficulty were not considered.
In addition, we did not analyze cortical excitability volumes of various brain areas.</p><p>Further studies on the efficacy of performing and neural mechanisms underlying various
behavioral tasks and comparisons of changes in various brain areas as determined by
neuro-imaging techniques are required.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Julio</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Mendoza</surname><given-names>EOB</given-names></name><name><surname>Karataraki</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Insomnia with objective short sleep duration is associated
