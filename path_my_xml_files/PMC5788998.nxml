This classical view of a two peak kinetic immune response is currently controversially discussed. This study was a sub-study of the randomized clinical Trial SISPCT registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT00832039, Registration date: 29/01/2009). Blood samples from 76 patients with severe sepsis and septic shock were incubated for 48&#x02009;h at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C <italic>in vitro</italic> with bacterial or fungal recall-antigens or specific mitogen antigens within 24&#x02009;hours of sepsis onset. Recall-antigen stimulation led to a severe dampening of normal cytokine release. This immunologic anergy was similarly observed after mitogen stimulation. Moreover, patients under hydrocortisone therapy or with lowered arterial oxygen tension had further reductions in cytokine levels upon B- and T-cell mitogen stimulation. This investigation reveals an early onset of immunoparalysis during sepsis. This immune incompetence in mounting an adequate response to further infections includes previously sensitized pathogens, as seen with recall-antigens. Also, the immune-suppressive role of hydrocortisone and low PaO<sub>2</sub> is highlighted. Aside from early broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, our findings reinforce the need for maximal immunological support and protection against further infections at the onset of sepsis.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Sepsis and sepsis-associated disease states are not only an observation in modern medicine, there have long been many reports dealing with this particular condition in the past. Sir William Osler (1849&#x02013;1919) observed that patients apparently died from the body&#x02019;s response to the infection rather than from the infection itself<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. His observations of the immune system still hold true today, making sepsis a particularly dangerous and tenacious disease. At the end of the 20th century, incidence of sepsis has increased annually by 8.7% in the US, peaking in the year 2000 at 240.4 per 100,000 inhabitants. Although the in-hospital mortality decreased from 27.8% to 17.9%, the total number of deaths continued to rise due to the increase in incidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Despite all advances in modern medicine and antimicrobial therapy, sepsis and in particular septic shock are still the leading causes for death in critically ill patients in the United States<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Considering sepsis to cause a comparable number of annual deaths as acute myocardial infarction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, further research leading to new therapeutic strategies is directly needed.</p><p id="Par3">Besides systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which still is the hallmark sign of sepsis, another contrary condition in the progression of sepsis is described in the literature. It is associated with an inhibition of the immune system, resulting in a lack of response to pathogens, and goes by different names, such as compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS) or immune paralysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. This condition causes a severe susceptibility to secondary infection and might be responsible for a significant number of deaths in the later phases of sepsis. There are different hypotheses concerning this immunosuppressive state. It is assumed that a shift from a TH<sub>1</sub>-dominated initial immune response resulting in excessive inflammation and, subsequently, SIRS, to a TH<sub>2</sub>-dominated anti-inflammatory state might contribute to the development of CARS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Different works state that extensive lymphocyte apoptosis during sepsis progression seems to be, at least in part, responsible for the genesis of CARS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Recent findings suggest that hyperinflammation and hypoinflammation are two concurrently developing processes in sepsis, terming it as mixed anti-inflammatory response syndrome (MARS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. There are numerous further theories concerning the pathophysiology of immunosuppression in sepsis, including impaired leukocyte recruitment and decreased cell surface protein expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. After all, the exact pathophysiology of sepsis and the accompanying hyperinflammatory and immunosuppressive states are still poorly understood.</p><p id="Par4">To gain better insight into the early phase of septic shock we have recruited patients for the present clinical trial. The main focus was to evaluate the patients&#x02019; initial immune function shortly after onset of severe sepsis or septic shock. This was carried out with a recall-antigen whole blood assay, along with specific innate and adaptive immune cell activation assays. We hypothesized a pre-existing global immunosuppression at this time point. Moreover, this report looks at the capacity of these assays to detect effects of additional early hydrocortisone (HC) treatment as well as the immunosuppressive consequences of hypoxia in this patient cohort.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and demographic data</title><p id="Par5">The <italic>immune function study</italic> was conducted from June 2011 to February 2013 as part of the clinical trial SISPCT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>: NCT00832039, Registration date: 29/01/2009).

These responses and the immunologic memory to such re-call antigens is one of the key adaptive immune competencies of the host when re-exposed to known pathogens.

Murine sepsis models based on cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) showed that the systemic inflammatory response represented by elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the blood plasma began to emerge within 2&#x02013;8&#x02009;hours after the insult, depending on the individual cytokine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.

The degree of tissue injury and thus the disease severity, as seen by a marked rise in pro-inflammatory markers such as CRP and IL-6, is negatively correlated with the whole blood response to immunologic stimulants. This results in a heightened susceptibility to secondary infections and thus late-phase mortality. The critical players include all immunologic cells and especially cells with leukocytic origin. Regardless of leukocyte differentiation, the cell count in itself already indicates an upset in the immune response. Unsurprisingly, our patients with moderate leukocytosis had the best immune response, whereas both leukopenia as well as severe leukocytosis were associated with increased immune dysfunction.

Selective activation of T-cells via co-receptor CD3 and the co-stimulant CD28 was also strongly suppressed in septic patients. In light of the mechanisms of Ca<sup>++</sup>-ionophore (Ionomcyin)/PMA action which leads to reduced T cell activation and cytokine synthesis, a reduction in the signaling capacity of the proteinkinase C (PKC) pathway can be anticipated. Moreover, activation of CD14/TLR4 from innate immune cells (monocytes and granulocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>) through the endotoxin stimulus LPS led to a strong and significant reduction in the release of several key cytokines (IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF-&#x003b1;).

Within our patient population, this applies to patients in the most fulminant phase of septic shock and defines a high severity of the septic state.

Moreover, in the light of this knowledge and due to the very strict handling of ethical boards to minimize risks to volunteers, an arterial draw was not possible in the healthy subjects as it seemed hardly justifiable due to an increased risk of potential severe side effects such as malperfusion or necrosis.

In the volunteers, we have been also using the same lot of reagents/antigens and the exactly same methods and operators to try minimizing the risk of a methodologic bias.
