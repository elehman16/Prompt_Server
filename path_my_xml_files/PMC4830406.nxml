Alcohol advertising is also prevalent in the USA, where 91% of those aged 12&#x02013;20 are exposed to televised alcohol advertising (<xref rid="AGV104C8" ref-type="bibr">Centre on Alcohol Marketing and Youth, 2010</xref>), and in Australia, where adolescents under the legal drinking age are as likely as young adults to be exposed to alcohol advertisements (<xref rid="AGV104C47" ref-type="bibr">Winter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="AGV104C38" ref-type="bibr">Pettigrew <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). In an effort to counter the pervasive nature of alcohol advertising, governments and public health organizations have developed alcohol use warning advertisements that highlight the dangers of alcohol consumption and encourage responsible use.</p><p>There is now a reasonable level of evidence from observational data that exposure to alcohol promoting advertising is associated with future alcohol use (<xref rid="AGV104C2" ref-type="bibr">Anderson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="AGV104C43" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Foxcroft, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of experimental studies investigating the immediate effects of alcohol promoting advertising on alcohol consumption found evidence that a one-off exposure to alcohol promoting advertising may increase amounts of alcoholic beverage consumed following exposure by small amounts, equivalent to between 0.39 and 2.85 alcohol units for males and between 0.25 and 1.81 units for females (K Stautz <italic>et al.</italic>, in preparation). These studies were limited, however, by a sole focus on undergraduate students as participants and inadequate power to detect small effects. Regarding alcohol warning advertisements, whilst there is a small amount of observational evidence supporting the effectiveness of these messages in relation to reductions in drink-driving (<xref rid="AGV104C1" ref-type="bibr">Agostinelli and Grube, 2002</xref>), there is a dearth of experimental studies that test their immediate effects.</p><p>In examining whether alcohol promoting and alcohol warning advertisements influence alcohol use, it is important to consider potential mechanisms of effect. One way in which advertising may affect behaviour is through changes in implicit and explicit attitudes towards alcohol. Implicit attitudes are memory associations outside of conscious awareness that can be activated automatically (<xref rid="AGV104C20" ref-type="bibr">Greenwald and Banaji, 1995</xref>), whereas explicit attitudes comprise individuals' consciously reported beliefs. Implicit and explicit attitudes towards alcohol are modestly related, and both account for unique variance in measures of alcohol consumption (<xref rid="AGV104C39" ref-type="bibr">Reich <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Longitudinal evidence suggests an indirect effect of alcohol promoting advertising on alcohol use via an increase in positive alcohol-related attitudes (<xref rid="AGV104C37" ref-type="bibr">Morgenstern <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). To our knowledge, only one study provides experimental evidence for such an effect (<xref rid="AGV104C19" ref-type="bibr">Goodall and Slater, 2010</xref>). Participants in this study were randomized to watch alcohol promoting advertisements, alcohol warning advertisements, or control non-alcohol advertisements. Viewing alcohol promoting advertisements resulted in more positive implicit responding for alcohol compared with viewing alcohol warning or non-alcohol advertisements. Although explicit attitudes towards alcohol were more positive for those in the alcohol promoting relative to the alcohol warning condition, the attitudes of individuals in both conditions did not differ from those in the control group. In addition, both implicit and explicit positive attitudes predicted willingness to engage in risky alcohol-related behaviour.</p><p>Goodall and Slater's study does, however, have three design limitations. First, the measure of implicit attitudes used, the Affect Misattribution Procedure, assesses only positive versus negative attitudes. Attitudes towards alcohol are often ambivalent, i.e. comprise both positive and negative attitudes (<xref rid="AGV104C14" ref-type="bibr">de Visser and Smith, 2007</xref>). The use of a unidimensional measure of implicit attitudes renders it unclear whether the ineffectiveness of the alcohol warning advertisements in Goodall and Slater's study was due to the advertisements' inability to activate negative implicit attitudes, or whether they served as a cue to activate positive implicit attitudes. A second limitation was that the alcohol warning advertisements used focused on drink-driving, which may have been too narrow a focus to change more general attitudes towards alcohol. Third, baseline measures of attitudes towards alcohol were not recorded. Each of these limitations are addressed in the current study: first, by using a measure of implicit attitudes that assesses positive and negative associations separately (an adapted version of the Implicit Association Test; <xref rid="AGV104C21" ref-type="bibr">Greenwald <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="AGV104C27" ref-type="bibr">Houben <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>); second, by using alcohol warning advertisements that focus on general negative consequences from alcohol use; and third, by assessing attitudes both pre- and post-exposure to advertisements.</p><p>Any impact of alcohol-related advertising on cognition or behaviour may be dependent on individual characteristics. Primarily, an individual's previous experience with alcohol is likely to influence their response to messages that aim to promote or to dissuade alcohol use. Heavier drinkers show increased attention towards alcohol-related cues (<xref rid="AGV104C18" ref-type="bibr">Field and Cox, 2008</xref>) and may be more likely to attend to alcohol-related advertising and thus be influenced by its message. Education, a marker of socioeconomic status, is another possible effect modifier. Lower levels of education are associated with increased quantity of alcohol consumed per occasion (<xref rid="AGV104C7" ref-type="bibr">Casswell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="AGV104C28" ref-type="bibr">Huckle<italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), and increased likelihood of binge drinking in males (<xref rid="AGV104C31" ref-type="bibr">Jefferis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Individual differences in inhibitory control may also be important. Poor inhibitory control has been shown to strengthen the association between implicit attitudes and drinking behaviour (<xref rid="AGV104C26" ref-type="bibr">Houben and Wiers, 2009</xref>).</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Aims and hypotheses</title><p>This study aims to replicate and extend findings by <xref rid="AGV104C19" ref-type="bibr">Goodall and Slater (2010)</xref> by testing effects of alcohol promoting and alcohol warning advertising on changes in implicit and explicit attitudes and on alcohol seeking behaviour, with typical alcohol consumption and level of education as potential moderators. We predict that individuals exposed to alcohol promoting advertisements, compared with those shown advertisements unrelated to alcohol, will exhibit more positive implicit and explicit attitudes, and be more likely to select an alcohol-related reward. Individuals exposed to alcohol warning advertisements, compared with those shown non-alcohol advertisements, will exhibit more negative implicit and explicit attitudes and be less likely to select an alcohol-related reward. These effects are expected to be increased in heavier drinkers and in those with lower levels of education. Further, we predict that the impact of alcohol promoting and alcohol warning advertisements on choice of reward will be mediated by changes in implicit attitudes. If such a mediation effect is present, we predict that it will be weaker in those with greater inhibitory control.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 373 participants (59.5% (222) female; Mean age = 28.03, SD = 5.64) completed the study.

Participants not meeting the inclusion criteria of being aged 18&#x02013;40 and residing in the UK were excluded at this point. Eligible participants were sent a web link to complete the remainder of the study. For the second part of the study participants were randomly assigned to experimental condition according to an algorithm used within the survey software. Participants each viewed eight advertisements, presented in random order, for a total duration of between 310 and 330 s. Four advertisements were related to experimental condition whilst four were shown to all groups and served as filler advertisements. Following advertisement presentation participants again completed measures of implicit and explicit attitudes as well as questions on their familiarity with the advertisements and associated brands. They were then asked to select a choice of voucher reward ostensibly as compensation for their time (see Measures). Upon completion participants were debriefed and given &#x000a3;2 worth of credit via the research agency. Participants did not receive their voucher reward, but instead were given an additional &#x000a3;5 worth of credit. (Participants' bank details were held by the research agency irrespective of our study. The agency also offers cheques for participants who do not wish to give their bank details.)</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Stimuli</title><p>Sixteen advertisements were used in total: four alcohol promoting advertisements, four alcohol warning advertisements, four control advertisements for banking products, and four filler advertisements for non-alcohol-related products.

Criteria for selecting advertisements were that they were for popular products and were relevant to the target sample. Advertisements were independently ranked for suitability by four authors according to potential appeal, how prominently alcohol was featured, and whether there was potential ambiguity regarding the message content. Two authors independently rated advertisements for their likely target audience using four categories: age, gender, level of education and ethnicity.</p><p>Alcohol promoting advertisements for four types of alcohol products (lager, wine, cider and alcopop) were selected. Three of the brands selected (&#x02018;Carling&#x02019;, &#x02018;Smirnoff&#x02019;, &#x02018;Jacob's Creek&#x02019;) are in the top 20 alcohol brands by off-trade value in Great Britain (<xref rid="AGV104C46" ref-type="bibr">The Grocer, 2014</xref>). The advertisements for these brands were respectively targeted towards adult males aged 21&#x02013;30, adults aged 18&#x02013;30 of any gender, and adults aged 25&#x02013;40 of any gender. A fourth (&#x02018;WKD&#x02019;) was selected for its potential appeal to younger participants. The inferred target audience of this advertisement was males aged 18&#x02013;25.</p><p>Alcohol warning advertisements were selected from the UK Department of Health <italic>&#x02018;Know Your Limits&#x02019;</italic> campaign from 2006, which was targeted at 18- to 24-year-old males and females with the aim of reducing heavy episodic drinking (UK <xref rid="AGV104C24" ref-type="bibr">Home Office, no date</xref>), and from the &#x02018;Change 4 Life&#x02019; campaign from 2009, targeted at older adults who drink frequently.

We found no main effects on these outcomes. There were, however, significant interactions with alcohol consumption: in heavier drinkers, viewing alcohol promoting advertisements increased positive implicit attitudes and decreased negative implicit attitudes towards alcohol. This result is consistent with evidence that exposure to alcohol advertisements leads to increased alcohol consumption immediately following exposure in heavier, but not lighter, drinkers (<xref rid="AGV104C32" ref-type="bibr">Koordeman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011a</xref>). Alcohol promoting advertisements may be more salient to heavier drinkers (<xref rid="AGV104C18" ref-type="bibr">Field and Cox, 2008</xref>), and more likely to trigger positive emotions and memories related to alcohol use. Incentive sensitization theory (<xref rid="AGV104C41" ref-type="bibr">Robinson and Berridge, 2001</xref>) proposes that greater use of alcohol may lead to alcohol-associated stimuli taking on heightened motivational significance, producing increased desire for alcohol when viewed. The alcohol industry argues that advertising of alcohol products is designed only to promote brand switching (<xref rid="AGV104C29" ref-type="bibr">International Centre for Alcohol Policies, 2003</xref>). Our data suggest that such advertising also promotes positive implicit attitudes towards alcohol in heavier drinkers. Given evidence that implicit attitudes towards alcohol predict subsequent consumption (<xref rid="AGV104C39" ref-type="bibr">Reich <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), one possible consequence of prevalent alcohol advertising is to reinforce attitudes that make it difficult for heavier drinkers to reduce their alcohol intake.</p><p>Viewing alcohol warning advertisements reduced negative implicit attitudes in heavier drinkers. This counterintuitive finding may be evidence of a well-documented &#x02018;boomerang&#x02019; effect, whereby messages that attempt to discourage a certain behaviour actually make the behaviour more likely (<xref rid="AGV104C40" ref-type="bibr">Ringold, 2002</xref>). Such an effect has been observed in studies looking at counter-advertising of alcohol and other substances (<xref rid="AGV104C5" ref-type="bibr">Bensley and Wu, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="AGV104C44" ref-type="bibr">Snyder and Blood, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="AGV104C11" ref-type="bibr">Czyzewska and Ginsburg, 2007</xref>). Heavier drinkers who viewed alcohol warning advertisements may have experienced reactance (<xref rid="AGV104C6" ref-type="bibr">Brehm, 1966</xref>), implicitly disagreeing with these advertisements to minimize dissonance (<xref rid="AGV104C15" ref-type="bibr">Dillard and Shen, 2005</xref>). Alternatively, it is possible that heavier drinkers' negative implicit attitudes became less negative due to a sensitization effect of viewing words and images related to alcohol, rather than the specific content of the alcohol warning advertisements. The methods employed do not enable us to clarify the psychological processes that underpin this effect. However, the possibility that alcohol warning advertisements have iatrogenic effects on a population that is a key target for their message warrants further investigation.
<fig id="AGV104F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3.</label><caption><p>Changes in negative implicit attitudes following exposure to alcohol warning advertisements and advertisements unrelated to alcohol by heaviness of recent alcohol consumption.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="agv10403"/></fig></p><p>Viewing alcohol promoting or alcohol warning advertisements did not change explicit attitudes compared to viewing non-alcohol advertisements, consistent with two experimental studies that have investigated effects of alcohol advertising on explicit attitudes previously (<xref rid="AGV104C48" ref-type="bibr">Slater <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="AGV104C19" ref-type="bibr">Goodall and Slater, 2010</xref>). We found no evidence that heavier drinkers experienced greater changes in explicit attitudes than lighter drinkers following advertisement exposure, suggesting that cognitive responses to alcohol-related advertising in heavier drinkers may occur only at a less conscious, implicit level. Additionally, we found no evidence of moderation of effects by level of education, indicating that differences in socioeconomic position did not influence cognitive responses to alcohol-related advertising in this sample.</p><p>The type of advertisement viewed had no effect on our index of alcohol seeking behaviour. This finding may be a consequence of a choice that offered future, not instant, alcohol consumption. Previous studies that have found an effect of alcohol promoting advertising on alcohol consumption have offered the immediate opportunity to consume alcohol during the experiment (<xref rid="AGV104C17" ref-type="bibr">Engels <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="AGV104C32" ref-type="bibr">Koordeman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011a</xref>,<xref rid="AGV104C33" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>), encouraging impulsive alcohol seeking. In contrast, the presentation of a voucher choice may have triggered deliberative cognitions such as considering an outlet where vouchers might be accepted and planning an appropriate time to use them. Such deliberation may have attenuated any impulsive motivations to use alcohol (<xref rid="AGV104C22" ref-type="bibr">Hofmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In future tests of the hypothesis that advertising influences behaviour via automatic or impulsive processes, researchers should aim to minimize the opportunity for reflection before behaviour by providing an opportunity for immediate consumption.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Strengths of the current study include using participants that were not recruited from a student population, assessment of alcohol-related attitudes before and after advertisement exposure, and consideration of individual-level factors as potential effect modifiers. The study is the first, to our knowledge, to assess the impact of alcohol warning advertisements explicitly aimed at reducing alcohol consumption and increasing negative attitudes towards excessive consumption. However, a number of limitations affect the interpretation of our findings. We did not assess participants' prior exposure to more general alcohol marketing or media. The association between alcohol promoting advertisements and brand-specific consumption has been shown to diminish at heightened levels of exposure (<xref rid="AGV104C42" ref-type="bibr">Ross <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Over half of the sample was educated to degree level, and effects of advertising may differ in less educated individuals. The age range of our sample was quite broad, such that any effects of advertisements targeted at individuals of specific demographic characteristics may have been attenuated in participants who were not the target audience. Finally, the alcohol promoting advertisements presented were for four different types of alcoholic beverage. Combining advertisement presentation in this way did not allow us to analyse the effects of specific advertisements.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our findings suggest that alcohol promoting advertising may have a unique cognitive impact on heavier drinkers, causing an increase in positive associative thoughts about alcohol. Alcohol warning advertisements may cause paradoxical effects in heavier drinkers, leading to a reduction of negative associative thoughts. Further research is needed to test whether either of these effects leads to greater alcohol consumption.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/alcalc/agv104/-/DC1">Supplementary Material is available at <italic>Alcohol and Alcoholism</italic> online.</ext-link></p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>FUNDING</title><p>This work was jointly supported by the <funding-source>National Institute for Health Research</funding-source> School for <funding-source>Public Health Research</funding-source>, and by the <funding-source>Department of Health Policy Research Program</funding-source> [Policy Research Unit in Behaviour and Health (<award-id>PR-UN-0409-10109</award-id>)].
