Introduction</title><p>Congenital glaucoma (CG) is a major cause of blindness in children, despite its low incidence (1&#x02009;:&#x02009;10,000 births). It may be isolated (primary congenital glaucoma) or associated with other developmental anomalies, either systemic or ocular. The eyes with primary congenital glaucoma have an isolated maldevelopment of the trabecular meshwork not associated with other developmental ocular anomalies or ocular diseases that can raise intraocular pressure. It is the most common glaucoma of infancy, occurring in about 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;30,000 live births [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) is a bilateral disease in about 75% of cases, with males accounting for approximately 65% of cases. Most cases are sporadic in occurrence, with no evident hereditary pattern. In approximately 10% of cases, a hereditary pattern is evident; it is believed to be autosomal recessive. Many authors believe that the inheritance pattern is polygenic [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Congenital glaucoma is essentially a surgical disease, in which surgery must be performed as early as possible. Goniotomy and trabeculotomy are usually the first procedures of choice. Both are safe and have a low incidence of complications. When goniotomies or trabeculotomies fail or are impossible, trabeculectomy is the usual alternative. Glaucoma drainage implants, nonpenetrating surgery, and cyclodestructive procedures are other options [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Combined trabeculotomy and trabeculectomy is the most common procedure for congenital glaucoma in our locality because many cases present late with advanced disease. It allows high chance of success from the first intervention and reduces the need for secondary intervention which carries high failure rate.</p><p>MMC is a chemotherapeutic agent that has been widely used intraoperatively to enhance the success rate of glaucoma filtration surgery [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, it is frequently accompanied with short- and long-term postoperative complications such as hypotony, bleb leaks, cataract formation, avascular filtering blebs, thinning of the conjunctiva, subsequent blebitis, choroidal effusions, maculopathy, and endophthalmitis [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, there is still a need for other adjuvants with similar or better efficacy and less complications.</p><p>Recently, several tissue-engineered biodegradable implants have been introduced to augment success of trabeculectomy with less complications than MMC [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Ologen (Aeon Astron Europe BV, Leiden, The Netherlands) is a biodegradable collagen-glycosaminoglycan (GAG) implant which decreases early postoperative scarring and prevents collapse of the subconjunctival space [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It is a disc-shaped porcine-derived collagen matrix that is inserted under the conjunctiva at the time of trabeculectomy, acting as a reservoir and helping to mechanically separate the conjunctiva from episcleral surface preventing adhesions between them. After implantation, the device should completely degrade within 90&#x02013;180 days [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>This study aims to verify the safety and efficacy of Ologen implant compared to MMC application as an adjuvant in the surgical treatment of primary congenital glaucoma.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Patients and Methods</title><p>Thirty-four eyes of twenty-one patients with primary congenital glaucoma were included in this study. Thirteen patients underwent surgery in their both eyes and eight patients had surgery in one eye. Approval from ethical committee of Sohag Faculty of Medicine was obtained, and a written informed consent was obtained from the parents of all children after explaining the benefits and risks of the procedure.</p><p>Surgery was done by 4 surgeons to all infants and children with primary congenital glaucoma admitted to the Department of Ophthalmology in Sohag University Hospital in the period from April 2014 to October 2015.</p><p>The inclusion criteria of the study were patients aged less than three years with primary congenital glaucoma as evidenced by history of lacrimation, photophobia, blepharospasm, and/or eye enlargement in additition to the signs of elevated IOP, increased corneal diameters, corneal haze, and/or increased cup-to-disc ratio, while the exclusion criteria included patients with secondary glaucoma; patients with other ocular pathologies, for example, congenital cataract; patients with previous ocular surgery including glaucoma surgery; and patients who could not adhere to the follow-up schedule (lost from follow-up for more than two visits).</p><p>All patients were subjected to preoperative evaluation including history taking from the parents; the data collected included age, sex, main symptoms, family history, and medical history. The patients were referred for full systemic evaluation by a pediatrician to rule out any associated systemic anomalies. Under general anesthesia, complete anterior segment examination was done including measurement of the corneal diameters with surgical caliper (<italic>vertical and horizontal</italic>) and measurement of IOP using Perkin's applanation tonometer. Indirect fundus examination and refraction were done if the corneal clarity permits. Preoperative ocular ultrasonography was done for cases in which the fundus cannot be seen.</p><p>The patients were divided into two equal groups, each included 17 eyes (odd numbers for the first group and even numbers for the second group). In the first group (OLO group, group A), the patients had combined trabeculotomy and trabeculectomy with Ologen implantation while in the second group (MMC group, group B), the patients had combined trabeculotomy and trabeculectomy with MMC application.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>3. Surgical Techniques</title><p>All surgeries were done under general anesthesia.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><title>3.1. Group (A): Combined Trabeculotomy and Trabeculectomy with Collagen Matrix Implant (OLO Implant)</title><p>Antiseptic solution (povidone-iodine 7.5%) was applied to the periocular area, and a sterile ophthalmic surgical drape was applied.</p><p>The technique started with corneal traction suture including partial thickness at 12 o'clock using 6-0 silk and with creating a superior fornix-based conjunctival flap by dissection of the conjunctiva and Tenon's fascia to show bare sclera. Compression hemostasis was attained by cotton sponge compression or gentle diathermy if needed.</p><p>A 4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;4&#x02009;mm triangular limbal-based partial-thickness scleral flap was dissected extending into about 1&#x02009;mm of the clear cornea leaving about two-thirds of the scleral thickness as a scleral bed. A radial incision was then carried out about 2&#x02009;mm from the limbus at the junction between white and bluish zones of the sclera to enter the Schlemm's canal, evidenced by a gush of aqueous humour and/or blood, its characteristic pearly white color and appearance of transverse fibers running at the floor of the canal. Trabeculotomy was then performed using the internal arm of Harm's trabeculotome probes, first to the left and then to the right to complete about 100&#x02013;120&#x000b0; of the circumference. Then, a 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2&#x02009;mm trabecular meshwork block was excised and a peripheral iridectomy was then performed.</p><p>A cylindrical collagen matrix implant (1&#x02009;mm in height and 12&#x02009;mm in diameter) was used. The implant was divided unequally into two parts: a smaller part and a larger part. The smaller part was implanted under the scleral flap over the scleral bed, and the scleral flap was closed with one 10-0 nylon suture leaving the two ends of the smaller part bulging from both sides of the scleral flap. The remaining larger part was inserted in the sub-Tenon's space over the scleral flap, and then, a watertight closure of the conjunctival flap was done with continuous buried 10.0 nylon stitches.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>3.2. Group (B): Combined Trabeculotomy and Trabeculectomy with MMC Application</title><p>The technique was similar to that of the first group except that four sponges soaked with MMC with a concentration of 0.4&#x02009;mg/ml were placed deeply in the subconjunctival space as follows: one sponge at 12 o'clock, two sponges on both sides of superior rectus position, and the fourth sponge was applied between the scleral bed and the scleral flap and left for 2 minutes followed by irrigation of the eye with balanced salt solution. The scleral flap was closed with one tight 10-0 nylon suture at its apex and two 10-0 nylon sutures at both sides of the scleral flap.</p><p>The postoperative treatment of all patients included moxifloxacin 0.5% eye drops 5 times daily for 2 weeks and prednisolone acetate 1% eye drops five times daily for one week, three times daily for another week, and once daily for a final week, as well as cyclopentolate eye drops twice daily for one week.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Schedule of Follow-Up Visits</title><p>All patients were seen daily for the first few days looking for eye injection, corneal edema, anterior chamber formation, and red reflex; then, postoperative visits were scheduled at one week; two weeks; and one, two, four, six, nine, and twelve months. Patient examination was performed under general anesthesia for IOP, corneal clarity and diameters, bleb status, fundus examination, and postoperative complications.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Statistical Analysis</title><p>Data was analyzed using SPSS computer program version 16.0. (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Intl). The data were tested for normality using Shapiro-Wilk test which was insignificant indicating the use of parametric tests as data was normally distributed. Quantitative data were expressed as means&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;standard deviation and were analyzed by using <italic>t</italic>-tests and paired samples <italic>t</italic>-test. Independent samples <italic>t</italic>-test was used to assess statistical significance between both groups in predetermined parameters. While paired samples <italic>t</italic>-test was used to assess statistical significance within the same group. Chi-square (<italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup>) test and Fisher's exact tests were used for comparison regarding qualitative variables. A 5% level was chosen as a level of significance in all statistical tests used in the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>6. Results</title><p>This study included thirty-four eyes of twenty-one patients having primary congenital glaucoma. Thirteen patients had surgery in both eyes and eight patients in only one eye. These eyes were divided equally into two groups: seventeen eyes for the OLO group (group A) and seventeen eyes for the MMC group (group B). Three eyes did not complete the follow-up schedule and lost from follow-up for more than two visits, so they were excluded from the study. In addition, intraoperative inadvertent scleral perforation occurred in one case, and thus, such case was excluded from the study. Finally, thirty eyes of eighteen patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Fifteen eyes of nine patients (six bilateral and three unilateral) were included in each group for this study.</p><p>The preoperative characteristics did not differ significantly between the 2 groups.

Discussion</title><p>Congenital glaucoma is a major cause of blindness in children, despite its low incidence (1&#x02009;:&#x02009;10,000 births) [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In this study, a comparison between Ologen (group A) and MMC (group B) application in combined trabeculotomy and trabeculectomy for treatment of primary congenital glaucoma was done to verify efficacy and safety of Ologen.</p><p>As regards preoperative characteristics of the patients, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups. Postoperatively, the two groups showed a highly significant reduction (<italic>P</italic> value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) in IOP levels.</p><p>This significant reduction in both groups can be explained by the surgical procedure which was combined trabeculotomy and trabeculectomy. However, this level of reduction in the mean IOP cannot be relied on as an indicator of success due to presence of cases with very high preoperative IOP on the one hand and cases complicated with bleb leakage and hypotony on the other hand.</p><p>Although the frequency of postoperative complications especially hypotony was higher in the MMC group than the OLO group, the difference does not reach statistical significance probably due to the small sample size of the study.</p><p>Ologen implant could have a tamponading effect and provide a controlled drainage of aqueous. In addition, the implant might have a valve-like mechanism through its two parts: subscleral and subconjunctival parts; when they were inflated with aqueous, more pressure on the sclera flap would be exerted decreasing aqueous flow and vice versa.</p><p>After its success in animals [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], many studies tried to verify the efficacy and safety of Ologen in trabeculectomy for primary open-angle glaucoma and other glaucomas of adults [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, few studies verified it in primary congenital glaucoma.</p><p>In his pilot study, Hamdi [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] used subconjunctival Ologen implant as an adjuvant to subscleral trabeculectomy in 3 cases of primary congenital glaucoma. After a follow-up of 6&#x02013;8 months, results were as follows: &#x0201c;satisfactory success&#x0201d; for the first case, &#x0201c;full success&#x0201d; for the second case, and &#x0201c;poor success&#x0201d; for the third case. He reported that the advantages of this implant are its safety over MMC and its ease of use. Ologen would prevent secondary interference such as needling after the use of antifibrotic agents and also would avoid tube-related complications.</p><p>Unlike Hamdi, we used Ologen both subconjunctivally and subsclerally to augment effects of combined trabeculotomy and trabeculectomy and avoiding risks of MMC and we followed up cases for one year.</p><p>In his study over twenty eyes of 15 patients with primary congenital glaucoma, Hafez [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] divided cases into two groups. The first group (MMC group) included 10 eyes and was subjected to trabeculectomy with MMC. The second group (OLO group) included 10 eyes and was subjected to trabeculectomy with a collagen matrix implant (Ologen). The postoperative IOP level was classified into four groups (&#x0003e;21, &#x0003e;17&#x02013;21, 15&#x02013;17, and &#x0003c;15&#x02009;mmHg). At the end of the sixth postoperative follow-up month, in the MMC group, only 10% of eyes achieved the target IOP, 10% of eyes had failed surgery, and 80% of eyes had IOP ranging from 15 to 21&#x02009;mmHg. However, in the Ologen group, 40% of eyes achieved the target IOP, 60% of eyes had IOP ranging from 15 to 21&#x02009;mmHg, and there were no failed surgeries. In terms of complications, the MMC group had a higher rate of complications than the Ologen group in the form of early hyphema, bleb leakage, hypotony, and choroidal detachment.</p><p>Unlike Hafez, we used Ologen with combined trabeculotomy and trabeculectomy and we followed up cases for one year.</p><p>Elmallah et al. [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] compared trabeculotomy with deroofing of Schlemm's canal augmented with subconjunctival Ologen implant (study group) and conventional trabeculotomy (control group) in primary congenital glaucoma and found that the success rate was higher in the study group (100%) than in the control group (75%) after a 6 month follow-up period.</p><p>Unlike Elmallah et al., this study used Ologen (both subscleral and subconjunctival) with combined trabeculotomy and trabeculectomy and cases were followed up for one year with a success rate of about 87%.</p><p>The major limitations of this study are the small sample size and the relatively short follow-up period. Future studies should be carried out on larger samples and for longer follow-up periods to establish the long-term safety and efficacy of this new device. Ologen implant can be also tried in cases with secondary glaucoma, resistant glaucoma, and congenital glaucoma associated with other ocular congenital anomalies.</p><p>In conclusion, this study suggests that the collagen matrix implant (Ologen) is a safe and effective adjuvant in combined trabeculotomy and trabeculectomy for treatment of primary congenital glaucoma. Although there was insignificant difference between Ologen and MMC as regards efficacy, Ologen appears to be safer than MMC regarding postoperative complications especially postoperative hypotony.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.</p></sec><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dickens</surname><given-names>C.
