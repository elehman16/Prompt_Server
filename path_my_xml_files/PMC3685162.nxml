Scientific evidence in the literature have demonstrated that after an acute exercise bout, BP levels are reduced for minutes or hours in relation to pre-exercise levels <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>]</sup>. This phenomenon is called post-exercise hypotension (PEH) and considered as an important strategy in the control and reduction of BP <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>]</sup>. The mechanisms responsible for PEH remain unclear. This phenomenon may occur due to a reduction of sympathetic nervous activity, cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance, apart from changes in the release of vasoactive substances <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>]</sup>. PEH has been demonstrated after aerobic exercise <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>]</sup> However, whether or not resistance exercise results in a post-exercise hypotensive response is relatively unknown. Only a few studies have investigated the BP responses following resistance exercise, and these have shown increase <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]</sup>, maintenance <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>]</sup>, and even decrease <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>]</sup> in post-exercise BP. Although occurrence of PEH in resistance exercises is demonstrated by some studies, however there is still no consensus on an ideal protocol to enhance this effect <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">13</xref>]</sup>. According to results of some studies, resistance exercise intensity affects the duration (longer PEH in the protocol with the highest intensity), but not the magnitude of PEH <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref>]</sup>, and different training methodologies (set repetition vs. circuit format) does not affect the magnitude or duration of the post-resistance exercise hypotensive response <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref>]</sup>. In addition to exercise intensity, volume and sequence that were previously studied, other variables such as the amount of muscular mass involved, number of repetitions, type of training and rest interval (RI) between the exercise sets can affect the hemodynamic responses to a bout of resistance exercises <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">17</xref>]</sup>. However, RI is considered as one of the main variables of resistance exercises <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">19</xref>]</sup>, there are few studies in the literature regarding investigation and comparison of the effects of different RI on the BP responses to resistance exercises. Also, to our knowledge, there has been no study to date which has investigated the comparison of the effects of different RI between circuit training exercises on post-exercise BP. RI length influences the removal of metabolites produced during muscle contraction <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">18</xref>]</sup>. The use of a shorter RI may lead to increased accumulation of metabolites and ions with vasodilator effects (e.g. nitric oxide, prostaglandins, adenosine, hydrogen and potassium); and this can influence the reduction in peripheral vascular resistance <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>]</sup>. Therefore, one might hypothesize that if PEH is mediated by some peripheral factors, resistance exercise with lower RI would be expected to result in a greater decline in BP.</p><p>Thus, the objective of the present study was to investigate and compare the effects of different RI between circuit training exercises (30s and 40s; the ratio of exercise to rest was approximately 1 to 1.5 and 1 to 2, respectively) on post-exercise BP responses in non-hypertensive young males.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>METHODS AND SUBJECTS</title><sec id="S20003"><title>Subjects</title><p>Eleven healthy sedentary males volunteered to participate in this study.

Our results have shown that, both CRE with RI30s and RI40s were effective in promoting reductions in post-exercise blood pressure. The main finding was that CRE with RI30s and RI40s elicited PEH of SBP and no change of DBP in young healthy males, so that, there was no significant difference between CRE with RI30s and RI40s in post-exercise blood pressure responses. The absence of BP changes during the non-exercise control trial shows that, in fact, the decreased SBP levels after exercise are due to the exercise effect and not to the normal diurnal variations.</p><p>Based on previous studies, the data about PEH and resistance exercise is still scarce and controversial results have been reported. Increase <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]</sup>, maintenance <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>]</sup> or even decrease <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>]</sup> in post-resistance exercise BP has been observed. The present study found a significant PEH of SBP compared to pre-exercise measurements in the protocols tested. The reductions in blood pressure levels after a single exercise session is in agreement with the results obtained by other studies that observed PEH after resistance exercises <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">20</xref>]</sup>. In a study conducted by de Salles et al <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">20</xref>]</sup>, volunteers performed 3 sets of 10 repetitions per exercise at 70% 10RM, with 1 or 2 minutes RI between sets and observed PEH of SBP after both 1 and 2 minute sessions. Sim&#x000e3;o et al <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref>]</sup> compared the effect of intensity, volume and session format on post-resistance exercise hypotensive response and observed significant reduction of SBP after the protocols. mohebbi et al <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>]</sup> and Rezk et al <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>]</sup> also reported significant reduction of SBP after two resistance exercise sessions with different intensities in normotensive young individuals. Mota et al <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref>]</sup> observed PEH of SBP after circuit model for resistance exercise composed of 13 resistance exercises that were performed with 20 repetitions at 40% 1RM and 30 seconds rest interval between exercises. In contrast to the results of the present study, Veloso et al <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>]</sup> observed no change in SBP after three resistance exercise protocols with RI of 1, 2 and 3 minutes between the sets, that consisted of three sets of eight repetitions in six exercises. The loads used in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd exercise sets were 80%, 70% and 60% 1RM, respectively. Sim&#x000f5;es et al <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>]</sup> did not find significant differences between post-exercise measurements and rest measurements of SBP in type-2 diabetic and nondiabetic subjects after performance of a resistance exercise session at 23% of 1RM. Rodriguez et al <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">21</xref>]</sup> observed no significant variance in the SBP after both of traditional multiple set and tri-set methods that six upper limb exercises were used for two distinct muscular groups (chest and back). Also Polito et al <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">22</xref>]</sup> failed to induce a hypotensive response in SBP following three series of 12 maximal repetitions of knee extension unilaterally and bilaterally.</p><p>The differences between the results found in the present study and those reported by Veloso et al <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>]</sup> and Sim&#x000f5;es et al <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>]</sup> may be attributed to the differences in the protocols used as well as differences between subjects. Veloso used a protocol in which the load decreased at each set, with the purpose of maintaining the same work volume (load &#x000d7; repetitions) in all protocols. On the other hand, the differences between the results found in the present study and those reported by Rodriguez et al <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">21</xref>]</sup> and Polito et al <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">22</xref>]</sup> may be related to the amount of muscle mass involved in exercise. In the present study that performed 3 circuit of 6 exercises for upper and lower limbs, exercising muscle mass were more than Rodriguez et al <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">20</xref>]</sup> and Polito et al <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">22</xref>]</sup> studies that used lower and upper limb exercises, respectively. One of the physiological mechanisms that could explain the influence of muscle mass on blood pressure after resistance exercise is the reduction in vascular resistance, caused by the liberation of vasodilating endothelial substances (e.g. nitric oxide and prostaglandins).</p><p>Regarding DBP, compared to pre-exercise values there was no significant PEH of DBP observed in all measured moments during recovery period of exercise trials.</p><p>In the Sim&#x000e3;o et al <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref>]</sup> study, significant post-exercise decrease in DBP was also observed 10 minutes after completion of a protocol of 12 repetitions with a load of 50% of 6RM. Rezk et al <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>]</sup> also found significant post-exercise decrease in DBP; however, the duration of PEH was longer (30 minutes) than that found by Sim&#x000e3;o et al <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref>]</sup>. In contrast, Rodriguez et al <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">21</xref>]</sup> and Polito et al <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">22</xref>]</sup> did not observe significant variation in the DBP after resistance exercise. Also, Veloso et al <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>]</sup> observed no changes in DBP after resistance exercise with 2 min RI between resistance exercise sets but, significant reduction in DBP occurred after 1 and 3 min RI. De Salles et al <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">20</xref>]</sup> reported no changes of DBP after resistance exercise with 2 min RI between sets but observed significant reductions after a 1 min RI session.</p><p>Similar to the results of the present study, mohebbi et al <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>]</sup>, Polito et al <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">23</xref>]</sup> and MacDonald et al <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0024">24</xref>]</sup> observed significant PEH of SBP and no changes of DBP following resistance exercise. One of the possible explanations for SBP's higher sensitivity to PEH would be the posture subjects adopt after the exercise. Although all mentioned studies have chosen the seated position to assess arterial pressure, it was observed that the post-exercise SBP declines more deeply in the seated position rather in the supine position due to decrease in venous return and cardiac output <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">26</xref>]</sup>. Resistance protocols typically differ among studies, and these differences may likely be responsible for some of the variations seen in the results. The resulting differences in the degree of metabolic stress produced by differences in exercise intensity, number of sets, rest intervals and stations of resistance exercise may be enough to affect recovery blood pressure.</p><p>Possible mechanisms involved in mediating post-exercise reductions in arterial blood pressure include decreased stroke volume and cardiac output; reductions in limb vascular resistance, total peripheral resistance and muscle sympathetic nerve discharge <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>]</sup>. Rezk et al <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>]</sup> assessed some mechanisms of BP control after a resistance exercise session and observed decrease in the systolic volume and cardiac output, no change of the peripheral vascular resistance and, consequently, a reduction in BP. Teixeira et al <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027">27</xref>]</sup> reported decrease in cardiac output, stroke volume and BP after a bout of resistance exercise despite the increase in systemic vascular resistance.</p><p>Additionally, there may be a reduction in vascular resistance influenced by an accumulation of metabolites and ions (e.g. nitric oxide, prostaglandins, adenosine, H<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>) produced in muscle contraction, which, according to MacDonald et al <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>]</sup>, is one of the factors accounting for vasodilation and subsequent decrease in peripheral vascular resistance. RI length influences the removal of metabolites produced during muscle contraction. A greater accumulation of metabolites in the protocol with lower RI had been demonstrated by previous studies <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">28</xref>]</sup>. The use of shorter RI may lead to increased accumulation of metabolites and ions with vasodilator effects that are produced in muscle contraction, and this can influence the reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and BP <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>]</sup>. However, this effect was not observed in the present study.</p><p>In this study no significant differences were observed between CRE with RI30s and RI40s in post-exercise level of SBP and DBP. In our study, rest interval differences between the two protocols were 2.5 minutes. Probably this time is low and not sufficient to make significant differences in removal of metabolites and vascular resistance. However, in consistent with the results of this study, Veloso et al <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>]</sup> observed no significant differences between three resistance exercise protocols with RI of 1, 2 and 3 minutes between the sets in the post-exercise responses of SBP and DBP. Similarly, de Salles et al <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">20</xref>]</sup> reported no significant differences between two resistance exercise protocols with 1 and 2 minutes RI between sets in the post-exercise responses of SBP and DBP. Regardless of the occurrence or non-occurrence of PEH, the results of studies show no significant differences between resistance exercises with different RI in post-exercise BP responses. Although in the present study potential causes of PEH were not measured, but based on the results of studies it doesn't seem that metabolites produced from cellular activity to be the main cause of post-exercise decrease in BP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="S0012"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The present findings have shown that the CRE with RI30s and RI40s led to significant post-exercise decrease in SBP and no change of DBP. Although it has been suggested that RI length influences the removal of metabolites produced during muscle contraction that may be involved in PEH by vasodilator effects, we found no significant differences between exercise trials in post-exercise level of SBP and DBP in all measured moments. We suggest further studies to evaluate the effects of other RE variables on PEH in different populations such as those of elderly and hypertensive individuals. Additionally, the physiological mechanisms involved in post resistance exercise hypotension need to be better explained.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge all the subjects who took part in this study for their cooperation.
