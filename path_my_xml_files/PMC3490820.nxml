This study evaluated the effects of a intervention with psychosocial stimulation (PS) on the quality of the home environment and mothers&#x02019; child-rearing practices in a community-based trial with severely malnourished Bangladeshi children.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>Severely underweight children (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;507), 6&#x02013;24&#x02009;months of age, were randomly assigned to five groups: PS; food supplementation (FS); PS&#x02009;+&#x02009;FS; clinic-control (CC); and, hospital-control (CH). PS included fortnightly follow-up visits for six months at community clinics where a play leader demonstrated play activities and gave education on child development and child rearing practices. FS comprised cereal-based supplements (150&#x02013;300&#x02009;kcal/day) for three months. All groups received medical care, micronutrient supplements and growth monitoring. Mothers were given the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) inventory and a questionnaire on parenting at baseline and after six months to assess the outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>322 children completed the study. After six months of intervention the PS&#x02009;+&#x02009;FS and PS groups benefitted in the total HOME score (depending on the comparison group, effect sizes varied from 0.66 to 0.33 SD) The PS&#x02009;+&#x02009;FS and PS groups also benefitted in two HOME subscales: maternal involvement (effect sizes: 0.8 to 0.55 SD) and play materials, (effect sizes: 0.46 to 0.6 SD), and child-rearing practices scores (effect size: 1.5 to 1.1 SD). The PS&#x02009;+&#x02009;FS group benefitted 4.0 points in total HOME score compared with CH, 4.8 points compared with CC and 4.5 points compared with FS (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 for all). The PS group benefitted 2.4 points compared with CH (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.035), 3.3 points compared with CC (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.004), and 2.9 points compared with FS (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.006). Child-rearing practice scores of the PS&#x02009;+&#x02009;FS group improved 7.7, 6.4 and 6.6 points and the PS group improved 8.5, 7.2 and 7.4 points more than CH, CC and FS, respectively (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 for all).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Child-rearing practices of mothers of severely malnourished children and the quality of their home environment can be improved through community-based psychosocial stimulation with or without food supplementation.

Any sustained disruption to this may result in irreversible damage to the child&#x02019;s development, which may lead to difficulties at school and to behavioural, emotional and personality problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Improving parenting skills would be a cost-effective and sustainable strategy to promote child development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>In low-income countries young children are exposed to multiple developmental risk factors including poverty, malnutrition, poor stimulation at home, and lack of care that adversely affect the ability to reach their developmental potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Mothers/primary caregivers of malnourished children living in poor socioeconomic environments are often less sensitive to their child&#x02019;s needs, less involved and emotionally responsive, and less engaged in reciprocal interaction with their children than caregivers of adequately or well-nourished children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Parent education interventions have improved parenting practices and child development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Home visiting interventions in Jamaica, Colombia and South Africa improved mother&#x02019;s knowledge on child rearing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], mother-child interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], the home environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and child development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In two studies in Bangladesh, one used group sessions with mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] whereas the other also used home visiting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and both studies showed improved knowledge of child rearing and higher scores on Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) inventory.</p><p>In Bangladesh, malnutrition is one of the major health problems in children under five years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and there is a need for proper rehabilitation of these children. A recent case&#x02013;control study conducted in Bangladesh found that the mothers of severely underweight children were younger, shorter, more frequently energy deficient and less educated compared with mothers of well-nourished children. The fathers were younger, poorer, less educated, and more likely to have low paid jobs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Such characteristics are also likely to be associated with child care and parenting practices.</p><p>Little is known about parenting practices of Bangladeshi mothers. A survey among rural mothers found that almost half had no education and most are unaware of the importance of providing opportunities for play and conversation with their child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>A community-based trial with 5 groups including food supplementation (FS), psychosocial stimulation (PS), both treatments, community controls and hospital controls was carried out with severely underweight children aged 6&#x02013;24&#x02009;months (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;507) attending the Dhaka hospital of International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B). The psychosocial stimulation included play activities and parenting education. After six months of intervention, children who had received any stimulation with or without food supplementation scored higher on the Mental Development Index (MDI) of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-II) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] (effect size 0.37 SD) and had a higher weight-for-age Z-score (WAZ) (effect size 0.26 SD). These results have been reported in a separate paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. It is likely that improvements in mothers&#x02019; child rearing practices and the stimulation they provide in the home may have led to some of these benefits. In this paper, we report the effect of the interventions on the quality of home environment and child-rearing practices of the mothers of the same children six months after the start of intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Children aged 6&#x02013;24&#x02009;months with WAZ&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;&#x02212;3SD who had recovered from acute infection at the hospital of ICDDR,B were the study participants.

Mothers were encouraged to continue the activities at home. They were lent toys and picture books to take home and changed them at every visit for different toys.</p></sec><sec><title>Parenting education</title><p>The PL discussed early child development and the importance of mothers being responsive to their infants and playing, chatting, singing, showing love to and praising their child. They demonstrated how to chat and incorporate play into daily activities, such as feeding and bathing, in order to promote child development. The mothers were discouraged from using physical punishment. We also aimed to improve mothers&#x02019; self-esteem by praising them, listening to them and providing new skills. The sessions were participatory and mothers/caregivers were encouraged to share their views and suggestions.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Food supplementation</title><p>Children in the FS and PS&#x02009;+&#x02009;FS groups were supplemented with food packets for the first three months of follow-up, according to the guidelines of the national food supplementation programme of Bangladesh. The packets were distributed at discharge from hospital and at each follow-up visit at the CNFU. One packet per day was provided for children below 12&#x02009;months of age and two packets per day for older children. Food packets were also provided to siblings younger than five years in order to minimise food sharing. Each packet provided about 150&#x02009;kcal (~ 630&#x02009;k joules) of energy, with 11% of the energy derived from protein. It contained 20&#x02009;g of roasted rice powder, 10&#x02009;g of roasted lentil powder, 5&#x02009;g of molasses and 3&#x02009;g of soybean oil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><p>At the end of the third and the sixth month of follow-up children had anthropometric and developmental assessments (BSID-II) at the HNFU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Stimulation at home</title><p>The quality of stimulation at home was measured by a modified version of the Infant/Toddler HOME inventory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The modification was made for use in Bangladesh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The phrasing of some of the questions was modified to improve relevance considering differences in living conditions in Bangladesh. The modified version of inventory contained 60 items and six sub-scales: i) Organisation of the physical and temporal environment ii) Stimulation (opportunities for variations in daily stimulation at home) iii) Maternal involvement with the child iv) Play materials v) Avoidance of restriction and punishment and vi) Emotional and verbal responsivity of the mother. The total score was calculated by summing up all positive responses.</p><p>A research assistant, unaware of the group assignments, visited the children&#x02019;s homes and administered the HOME at baseline and after 6&#x02009;months. Before and during the study, 20 interviews were observed by the trainer and the inter-observer reliability between interviewer and trainer was high (r ranged from 0.91 to 0.98).</p><sec><title>Child-rearing practices</title><p>Research assistants unaware of the group assignment assessed the mother&#x02019;s child rearing practices at baseline and after 6&#x02009;months using a modified version of a questionnaire, previously used in Bangladesh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The questions concerned chatting, praising, showing love and affection, how the mothers teached children using different objects or play materials and how they interacted during activities such as feeding, bathing and dressing. We added few items to the parenting questionnaire on setting limits. Total scores were calculated by summing up all positive responses. The test-retest reliability on mothers of 20 children was good (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.92).</p></sec><sec><title>Maternal depressive symptoms</title><p>At baseline and after 6&#x02009;months the frequency of maternal depressive symptoms was assessed with a questionnaire based on the modified version of the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. This instrument was previously used in Bangladesh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and Jamaica [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The questionnaire addressed six aspects of depressive symptoms: depressed mood, worthlessness, helplessness/hopelessness, lethargy/fatigue, loss of appetite, and sleep disturbance. The scale was designed to assess the frequency of depressive symptoms expressed in number of days with these symptoms. After piloting, the wording of the questions was adapted to be more culturally appropriate. Mothers were asked to recall how many days in the past week they experienced depressive symptoms and the number of days (0&#x02013;7) was recorded, and then summed to make a total depression score. Higher scores indicated the presence of more depressive symptoms. Inter-observer reliability between trainer and tester with 20 mothers was high (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.98).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Socioeconomic status</title><p>Data were collected on the families&#x02019; wealth, standard of housing, family structure and parental characteristics.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>The outcomes of this analysis are the quality of home environment (HOME scores) and mothers&#x02019; child-rearing practices with the severely malnourished children six months after the start of intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>A sample size of 60 in each group was estimated to demonstrate a difference of 5 points in the MDI, based on a previous study in Bangladesh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] where the MDI had a SD of 12, a significance level of 5% and power of 90% for five treatment groups.

It has been used previously in Bangladesh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. When implemented in a rural area, HOME scores were related to children&#x02019;s scores on the Bayley Scales as well as a language test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Another study reported satisfactory internal consistency of the scale (&#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.72) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, scores of the total HOME and two of the HOME subscales- &#x02018;Maternal involvement&#x02019; and &#x02018;Play materials&#x02019; were significantly improved by the PS&#x02009;+&#x02009;FS and PS interventions but not by FS alone. This finding is encouraging, because in the intervention we particularly focused on improving maternal-child interaction.</p><p>A substantial number of studies have reported that parenting education has resulted in improved results in subscales of the HOME, especially maternal involvement, play materials, and emotional and verbal responsivity subscales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In Jamaica, mothers with preterm low birth weight infants had higher scores on the total HOME and two specific HOME subscales &#x02018;Avoidance of restriction and punishment&#x02019; and &#x02018;Maternal involvement&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Bangladeshi mothers in a rural community-based parenting programme obtained higher scores on the total HOME and on the &#x0201c;Stimulation subscale&#x0201d; (sum of 14 items from the &#x02018;Play materials&#x02019; and &#x02018;Maternal involvement&#x02019; subscales) than control mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Our intervention did not affect the other subscales of the HOME i.e. physical environment, stimulation, and emotional and verbal responsivity. All the families in the present study came from a low socioeconomic background, were dwelling in the slums and had few entertainment facilities at home. However, the intervention was not home-based and did not aim at improving physical conditions of the home beyond efforts to increase safety. Therefore, we did not expect improvements in the &#x02018;Physical environment&#x02019; and &#x02018;Stimulation&#x02019; but lack of effect on &#x02018;Emotional and verbal responsivity&#x02019; was not predicted.</p><p>There are relatively few studies in low-income countries to which the results could be compared. The intervention in the present study (sessions every second week through existing primary health care services) had a relatively low intensity in comparison with earlier trials. A meta-analysis of 48 published articles from different socio-economic groups in high-income countries revealed that interventions using 5 to 16 home-based sessions with the mother within a limited period, starting prenatally or 6&#x02009;months after birth, were the most effective in improving the HOME scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>In this study we reported the parenting practices of mothers who were young, had poor educational levels and were mostly housewives. The opportunities provided for these mothers to practice with their own children probably made the difference. If the mothers&#x02019; behaviour is changed, the benefits to their children&#x02019;s development are more likely to be sustainable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>There was considerable attrition from the trial. It is unusual that children with more educated mothers and with less depression were more likely to be lost in the PS&#x02009;+&#x02009;FS and PS groups respectively. It may be that the most disadvantaged families valued the intervention the most. Children with fathers with unstable jobs were also more frequently lost in the PS group. These losses could have potentially modified the effect of the intervention. We therefore employed a conservative approach, controlling for the differences between lost and tested participants as well as any difference among the groups on enrolment in the analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results indicate that the home environment and child-rearing practices of mothers of severely malnourished children can be improved through community-based parenting education and play activities with or without food supplementation. For a sustainable programme of psychosocial intervention, mothers/caregivers need to be empowered through training and supervision so they become confident and can carry out the programme activities independently. Further studies in different settings are required to identify the best strategies for supporting parents in caring for their young children in low-income countries.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>PS: Psychosocial stimulation; FS: Food supplementation; PS&#x02009;+&#x02009;FS: Both psychosocial stimulation and food supplementation; CC: Clinic control; CH: Hospital control; HOME: Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment; SD: Standard deviation; ICDDR,B: International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh; MDI: Mental development index; BSID: Bayley Scales of Infant Development; WAZ: Weight-for-age Z-score; WLZ: Weight-for-length Z-score; CNFU: Community nutrition follow-up unit; HNFU: Hospital nutrition follow-up unit; PL: Play leader; UNICEF: United Nation Children&#x02019;s Education Fund; CESD: Centre for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale; ANOVA: Analysis of variance; ANCOVA: Analysis of co-variance; BDT: Bangladeshi taka.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Author&#x02019;s contributions</title><p>BN was responsible for proposal writing, field supervision, and data analysis and reporting of the study results.
