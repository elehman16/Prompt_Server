It complied with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and was approved by an institutional review board or independent ethics committee. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient prior to study enrolment.</p><p>Eligible participants were aged at least 18&#x02005;years, had OHT or open-angle glaucoma, and were either treatment-naive with IOP &#x0003e;24&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg in at least one eye or were receiving IOP treatment that was considered to be inadequate (IOP &#x0003e;18&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg in at least one eye). At baseline, following 4&#x02005;days&#x02019; to 4 weeks&#x02019; washout of IOP-lowering medications, patients were required to have an IOP of 22&#x02013;30&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg in each eye, with IOP asymmetry &#x0003c;4&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg between eyes and a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) equivalent to a Snellen score of 20/100 or better in each eye. The minimum washout period was 4&#x02005;days for parasympathomimetics and topical or systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, 2&#x02005;weeks for sympathomimetics and &#x003b1; agonists, and 4&#x02005;weeks for &#x003b2;-adrenergic blocking agents, combination products and prostaglandin agonists. Primary exclusion criteria were: uncontrolled systemic disease; known allergy or sensitivity to the study medications or their components; introduction or anticipated alteration in ongoing use of medication that may have a significant effect on IOP; ocular surface findings (eg, hyperaemia or irritation equal to +0.5 (trace) or greater) in either eye; history (within 6&#x02005;months prior to baseline) of any ocular anterior segment laser or other intraocular surgery in either eye; required chronic use of other ocular medications during the study; visual field loss that in the opinion of the investigator was functionally significant or evidence of progressive visual field loss; or anticipated wearing of contact lens in either eye during the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Treatment and assessments</title><p>Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) at each investigator site (by automated interactive voice/web response systems) to once-daily treatment in the morning in each eye with bimatoprost/timolol PF or bimatoprost/timolol for 12&#x02005;weeks. The randomisation scheme was prepared by the study sponsor. Randomisation was stratified by baseline mean diurnal IOP (&#x02264;24&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg or &#x0003e;24&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg). Patients were dispensed study medication kits containing unit-dose (single-use) containers that were identical for both formulations, thereby ensuring masking of patients, investigators and evaluators. The treatment was to be instilled in the morning to facilitate timing of study assessments. Compliance was assessed by the investigator who kept a detailed inventory of the units dispensed and reconciled containers returned to the study site.</p><p>IOP was measured using a slit lamp-mounted Goldmann applanation tonometer, and a two-person masked reading method (ie, one adjusts the dial in a masked fashion while the second reads and records the value) at 8:00 (hour 0), 10:00 and 16:00 at baseline, and at weeks 2, 6 and 12. Two consecutive measurements were taken of each eye; if these two measurements differed by &#x02264;1&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg, the IOP for the given eye was the average of the two readings. If the difference between measurements was &#x0003e;1&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg, a third measurement was made, and the IOP for the given eye was the median of the three readings.</p><p>Safety parameters included adverse events (AEs; coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities V.14.1), biomicroscopy, fundus examinations (including vertical cup/disc ratio), macroscopic bulbar conjunctival hyperaemia (graded by gross inspection in comparison with standard photographs), visual acuity, visual field measurements and vital signs.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Endpoints and analyses</title><p>Two sets of primary efficacy analyses were performed: one based on worse eye IOP and one based on average eye IOP data. For worse eye IOP analysis, the efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in worse eye IOP at week 12 in the per-protocol (PP) population (patients without a major protocol violation). Worse eye IOP referred to the eye with the higher mean diurnal IOP at the baseline visit. If both eyes had the same mean diurnal IOP at baseline, the right eye was designated as the worse eye. The treatments were compared using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with fixed effects of treatment and investigator and baseline worse eye IOP at the time-matched hour as the covariate. A two-sided 95% CI for the treatment difference (bimatoprost/timolol PF minus bimatoprost/timolol) was constructed from the ANCOVA model. Bimatoprost/timolol PF would be considered non-inferior to bimatoprost/timolol if the upper limit of the 95% CI did not exceed 1.5&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg at any hour at week 12.</p><p>For the average eye analysis, IOP was evaluated at each time point (8:00, 10:00 and 16:00) at weeks 2, 6 and 12 in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Missing data were imputed using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method. Treatments were compared using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with fixed effects of treatment and investigator. A two-sided 95% CI for the treatment difference was constructed from the ANOVA model with an estimated treatment difference based on least squares means. Bimatoprost/timolol PF would be considered equivalent to bimatoprost/timolol if the 95% CI upper limit was &#x02264;1.5&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg and the lower limit was &#x02265;&#x02013;1.5&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg at all time points, and the upper limit was &#x02264;1.0&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg and the lower limit was &#x02265;&#x02013;1.0&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg at the majority of time points.</p><p>The proportion of responders, defined as patients with a &#x02265;20% reduction in worse eye IOP from the corresponding hour (hour 0, 2 or 8) of baseline at week 12, was also analysed in the ITT population. Treatment group differences were assessed using Pearson's &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Sample size calculations</title><p>Sample size calculations were based on a one-sided &#x003b1;=0.025, 80% power and an assumption of no difference between treatment groups. The sample size needed to demonstrate the non-inferiority of worse eye IOP (1.5&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg inferiority margin) and equivalence in average eye IOP (equivalence limit of &#x000b1;1.5&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg at all follow-up time points, and of &#x000b1;1.0&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg at the majority of follow-up time points) were estimated. The largest sample size from these estimates ensured adequate power for all criteria, given an expected 10% dropout rate.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Baseline demographics and patient characteristics</title><p>The study was initiated on 31 October 2010 and completed on 21 February 2012.

On biomicroscopic and macroscopic assessments, severity grades of hyperaemia were similar between the bimatoprost/timolol PF group and the bimatoprost/timolol group (see online supplementary figure S2). The overall between-group difference was p=0.943 for biomicroscopy evaluation of conjunctival hyperaemia and p=0.852 for macroscopic evaluation of bulbar hyperaemia.

<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Although the first-line option for lowering IOP is typically a single hypotensive agent, patients frequently require a second IOP-lowering agent.

<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This study compared a PF formulation of bimatoprost/timolol with the standard BAK formulation. The principal conclusion is that bimatoprost/timolol PF demonstrated non-inferiority and equivalence in IOP lowering compared with bimatoprost/timolol, with differences between the treatments in IOP lowering consistently favouring bimatoprost/timolol PF. There were no significant differences in safety and tolerability between the two formulations except for treatment-related skin pigmentation which was reported more frequently in patients receiving bimatoprost/timolol PF. Differences in reports of skin hyperpigmentation overall were not statistically significantly different between groups. Based on ex vivo pharmacokinetic data, increasing BAK concentration should enhance penetration of bimatoprost across human skin (data on file, Allergan), and the incidence of skin pigmentation would be expected to be greater with bimatoprost/timolol than the PF formulation; the opposite was observed in our study. Therefore, the higher incidence of skin hyperpigmentation with bimatoprost/timolol PF is likely an incidental finding.</p><p>In conclusion, bimatoprost/timolol PF provided an effective IOP-lowering alternative to bimatoprost/timolol for patients who are not sufficiently controlled on monotherapy and/or are sensitive to preservatives. Studies that address the present design limitations are warranted, such as including patients with ocular surface disease and those using multiple topical medications over a longer duration, analysing patients who required additional therapy during long-term use, and cost effectiveness of the treatment options based on individual patient needs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bjophthalmol-2013-304064-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e900" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Medical writing assistance was provided by Linda Whetter, DVM, PhD, and Diann Glickman, PharmD, of Evidence Scientific Solutions and was funded by Allergan, Inc.
