According to statistics, 470 million people will be suffering pre-diabetes by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Some studies have reported that approximately 5-10% of pre-diabetic population would suffer from diabetes and problems associated with it in around a year such as heart problems, imbalance in glucose and lipid metabolism, and vascular disorders. Timely interventions in this population can preserve pancreatic beta cells, and improve their performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Current medications to control blood glucose and lipid profile may have dangerous side effects over time such as increased risk of weight gain, liver toxicity, and cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Thus, we need to use stronger alternatives with less side effects. In this line, nutritional interventions, change in lifestyle, and behavioral therapy are on the rise. However, these interventions may not be effective alone to prevent the development of type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Aloe (<italic>Aloe vera</italic> L., Liliaceae family) has applications in health and cosmetic products as well as antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, laxative, anti-atherosclerosis properties.

There is also evidence which shows that the glucose metabolism can be regulated with <italic>Aloe vera</italic>. The plant has other properties such as the reduction of hepatic tissue damage resulting from diabetic complications in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and reduction of the oxidative damage in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of mice with type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Although hypoglycemic properties of <italic>Aloe vera</italic> have been reported for years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], few human studies have been carried out so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

We used a formula comparing difference between two means for independent groups (power calculation = 80%) based on Devaraj et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] study results. According to purposive non-probability sampling, blocking randomization method was used for the random allocation of patients among three groups (n = 24): <italic>Aloe vera</italic> groups (AL300, AL500) and placebo group (PL). The AL300 and AL500 groups received two capsules per day which contained 300 and 500 mg pure powdered of <italic>Aloe vera</italic> extract (Barij Essence Company, Kashan, Iran). The PL group received capsules that contained micro-crystalline cellulose (Aldrich, America). All the participants took the capsules after breakfast and after dinner for as long as eight weeks.</p><p>At the beginning of the study, fasting blood sample was taken to check for glucose and lipid profiles through standard methods. Plasma variables were measured by chemistry analyzer (Prestige 24i, Japan) using biochemical kits (ParsAzmoon, Iran) in one laboratory. Their BMI was calculated (based on measured their height by Seca 206, Germany and their weight by Beurer-PS07, Germany) and their systolic and diastolic blood pressures (standard sphygmomanometer) were also measured by one nurse. Then, the package of capsules with the timeline of how to use them was given to the participants. Participants visited the Research Center to give blood sample at the end of the fourth and eighth weeks of the study. The researcher&#x02019;s phone number was given to the participants for probable queries. In addition, all the participants were reminded to take the pills and were emphasized not to use any other herbal medicine through phone calls.</p><p>Finally, they were requested not to have any change in their diet and routine activities during the study.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All results are presented as mean &#x000b1; SD. Statistical analysis was done in SPSS (version 16, SPSS Inc, Chicaogo, IL) using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey&#x02019;s or Bonferroni tests for parametric variables. For non-parametric variables (HbA1C, CHOL-C, HDL-C), Friedman and Wilcoxon tests were used to analyze within-group changes, and Kruskal-Wallis and Mann&#x02013;Whitney tests were used to assess changes between groups. Chi-square test was used for comparing sex status.

A primary preventive measure for this disease is lifestyle modification, which is usually difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to utilize other therapies to reduce the consequences of this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, the effects of different doses of <italic>Aloe vera</italic> extract at different time spans were studied on blood glucose and lipids in diabetic patients. The results of this study showed that both the 300 and 500 mg <italic>Aloe vera</italic> capsules within one and two months significantly reduced fasting blood glucose levels. Also, the capsules significantly decreased hemoglobin by the end of the study. Similar studies indicate that <italic>Aloe vera</italic> extract is effective in increasing insulin sensitivity, reducing fasting blood glucose, and decreasing the level of HbA1C in patients with pre-diabetes during eight weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Several human studies have reported the anti-diabetic effects of <italic>Aloe vera</italic> extract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In models of type I diabetes laboratory animals, it is shown that <italic>Aloe vera</italic> extract had a similar effect on blood glucose to that of glibenclamide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Even in patients who did not respond to glibenclamide alone, consumption of <italic>Aloe vera</italic> extract for 2 weeks could reduce fast blood glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Other studies have also shown the effectiveness of <italic>Aloe vera</italic> extract on the regulation of blood glucose levels in diabetic animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Few studies have indicated a rise in blood sugar levels after consumption of <italic>Aloe vera</italic> extract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] which might be related to the use of different parts of the plant (not the gel) or short duration of the intervention (2 times a day for 3 days).</p><p>Researchers have also introduced an important element in the hypoglycaemic effects of <italic>Aloe vera</italic> in a substance called Acemannan. This is actually a D-isomer of compound polysaccharide that is extracted from <italic>Aloe vera</italic> leaf gel and has such properties as anti-virus, anti-cancer, digestive, and immune stimulating properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. <italic>Aloe vera</italic> also contains other compounds such as hydrophilic fiber, glucomannan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and phytosterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] that reduce blood glucose.</p><p>It is suggested that <italic>Aloe vera</italic> can increase insulin sensitivity in the cells with reduce the level of blood glucose and insulin in serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] perhaps the <italic>Aloe vera</italic> can increase the Insulin Genetics activity In pancreatic beta cells. Study on the effects of anti-diabetic extract of <italic>Aloe vera</italic> showed that this plant cannot reduce the level of blood glucose in non-diabetic animals which is contrary to the results for hypoglycemic effects of glybenclamid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>The results of this study showed that AL500 could significantly reduce the levels of total cholesterol, TG, and LDL-C, and increase the level of HDL-C significantly during the 60 days of drug intake. However, AL300 could only increase the level of HDL-C in 60 days than before. For the first time, Agrawal studied the effect of <italic>Aloe vera</italic> on 5000 patients with type 2 diabetes for 5 years. After this period, a significant reduction was shown in the level of total cholesterol and triglycerides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] that is consistent with our data. In another study, <italic>Aloe vera</italic> extract in dose of 300 mg was given on a daily basis to patients with type 2 diabetes for two months. The results indicated a significant reduction in the level of total cholesterol and LDL-C that are similar to our results. However, <italic>Aloe vera</italic> did not affect the level of HDL-C and triglycerides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The reason may lie with the fact that only the 300-mg capsules of <italic>Aloe vera</italic> were used in that study on a population of type 2 diabetic patients who had high levels of blood glucose where, we know, that high levels of blood glucose can cause complex problems such as stress oxidative that will lead to the development of type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Also, it has been demonstrated that acute and chronic increase in the levels of blood glucose could increase the level of serum lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, VLDL and decreased levels of HDL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The researcher believes that the reason for lack of response to this dose of <italic>Aloe vera</italic> (300 mg) capsules in this study was high chronic level of blood glucose in patients or the low dose of <italic>Aloe vera</italic>. It is conjectured that <italic>Aloe vera</italic> can bring the distribution of fatty acids in the blood to normal status by controlling the metabolism of lipids in the liver. In fact, <italic>Aloe vera</italic> extract can construct non-saturated fatty acids that remove free radicals from blood stream and control the metabolism of lipids in the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>It is known that beta Sistostrol, Camposterol, and Stigmosterol are of close similarity to Phytosterols. Besides, it is found that beta Sistostrols chain available in some plants such as <italic>Aloe vera</italic> can significantly decrease the level of plasma total cholesterol, LDL-C, and triglycerides by inhibiting activation of fat absorption mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In one study, it was shown that the use of <italic>Aloe vera</italic> extract as much as 200 mg/kg on a daily basis for as long as 100 days can significantly reduce the level of cholesterol, Triglycerid, free fatty acids, and phospholipids in normal mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It is also shown that taking <italic>Aloe vera</italic> extract for 8 weeks in diabetic rats can lower the level of cholesterol and TG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Nonetheless, <italic>Aloe vera</italic> is beneficial even in short-term intakes (21 days) of 300 mg dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Some studies have mentioned that maximal dose of 50 mg <italic>Aloe vera</italic> could not improve the level of cholesterol in diabetic rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This suggests that the dose of <italic>Aloe vera</italic> that is required to reduce the level of cholesterol of serum is higher than the dose needed for reducing the level of blood glucose.</p><p>In a clinical trial conducted on 36 patients with type 2 diabetes, it was found that <italic>Aloe vera</italic> could reduce the level of triglycerides but had no effects on the level of cholesterol after daily use of one tablespoon of <italic>Aloe vera</italic> along with glibenclamide for 6 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] which are not similar to the results of our study. Perhaps, high blood glucose which may in turn lead to increased levels of blood lipid in the patients may suggest that they were taking lipid-lowering drugs instead of complementary medicine. The patient took <italic>Aloe vera</italic> juice which was not of sufficient accuracy to determine the exact amount of medication received. Devaraj and colleagues also showed, that taking two 500 mg capsules of <italic>Aloe vera</italic> (AC952) on a daily basis was effective in lowering the level of LDL and total cholesterol, is consistent with the results of our study. However it was not found to be effective in reducing the level of triglyceride and increasing the level of HDL-C of the serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Perhaps, it was because of the small number of participants in each group (n =15) or the little amount of active ingredients in the gel of, which can be as a result of the specific method of pasteurization and separation of the extract.</p><p>It was also reported that a high intake of <italic>Aloe vera</italic> (2 tablespoons three times daily for 12 weeks) could reduce the level of triglyceride of serum without effect on the levels of cholesterol, while no renal or hepatic toxicity was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Increased activity of hormone-sensitive lipase during insulin secretion defect, increased release of free fatty acids from fat tissue. Thus, it produces more phospholipids and cholesterol in the liver due to accumulation of fatty acids in plasma. These two substances are released into the bloodstream as triglycerides which can increase the level of lipoproteins in the blood. It is suggested that can reduce the level of lipids in blood by controlling the fat metabolism in the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Another theory is that the <italic>Aloe vera</italic> extract can lower the level of blood glucose and lipid in diabetic rats by improving sensitivity of cells to insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. It is well known that <italic>Aloe vera</italic> extract can suppress the adipogenesis gene and suggested that the plant can improve insulin resistance by reducing toxic effects of fat in the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>We had some limitations in quantitative control of some confounder variables such as food intake which could be considered for future researches.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Use of <italic>Aloe vera</italic> extract in pre&#x02013;diabetic patients can significantly regulate levels of fast blood glucose within four weeks and revert the levels of lipid profile, within eight weeks. It could be an interesting supplement strategy to alleviate impaired serum glucose level and lipid profile.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>MF was involved in Study conception/design, data analysis, interpretation of data and drafting the article.
