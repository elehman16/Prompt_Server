Sixteen amateur soccer players ingested their respective treatments before, during and after performing a 90-min intermittent repeated sprint test. Primary outcomes included time for a 90-min intermittent repeated sprint test (IRS) followed by eleven 15 m sprints. Measurements included creatine kinase, myoglobin, interleukine-6, Neutrophil; Lymphocytes and Monocyte before (pre), immediately after (post), 1h and 24h after exercise testing period. Overall, time for the IRS and 15 m sprints was not different between treatments. However, the perception of fatigue was attenuated (P&#x0003c;0.001) for the multi-ingredient (15.9&#x000b1;1.4) vs. placebo (17.8&#x000b1;1.4) but not for the carbohydrate (17.0&#x000b1;1.9) condition. Several changes in immune/inflammatory indices were noted as creatine kinase peaked at 24h while Interleukin-6 and myoglobin increased both immediately after and at 1h compared with baseline (P&#x0003c;0.05) for all three conditions. However, Myoglobin (P&#x0003c;0.05) was lower 1h post-exercise for the multi-ingredient (241.8&#x000b1;142.6 ng&#x000b7;ml<sup>-1</sup>) and CHO (265.4&#x000b1;187.8 ng&#x000b7;ml<sup>-1</sup>) vs. placebo (518.6&#x000b1;255.2 ng&#x000b7;ml<sup>-1</sup>). Carbohydrate also elicited lower neutrophil concentrations vs. multi-ingredient (3.9&#x000b1;1.5 10<sup>9</sup>/L vs. 4.9&#x000b1;1.8 10<sup>9</sup>/L, P = 0.016) and a reduced (P&#x0003c;0.05) monocytes count (0.36&#x000b1;0.09 10<sup>9</sup>/L) compared to both multi-ingredient (0.42&#x000b1;0.09 10<sup>9</sup>/L) and placebo (0.42&#x000b1;0.12 10<sup>9</sup>/L). In conclusion, multi-ingredient and carbohydrate supplements did not improve intermittent performance, inflammatory or immune function. However, both treatments did attenuate serum myoglobin, while only carbohydrate blunted post-exercise leukocytosis.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Maxinutrition GlaxoSmithKline provided joint funding for the development of the project.

This stress response induces the release of the noradrenaline, adrenaline, and cortisol/corticosterone, as well as a number of neurotransmitters, hormones, peptides, cytokines and other factors that potentially affect performance and the perception of fatigue perception [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Prolonged intermittent repeated-sprint-running exercise involving a high numbers of eccentric contractions as typically performed by soccer players has been associated with both transient structural muscular damage [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and an alteration in the number and function of the innate immune system cells e.g. Neutrophils, Monocytes and Lymphocytes [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The exercise induced muscular damage and inflammatory response observed during, immediately post and throughout the recovery leads to the leakage of proteins and cytokines such as creatine kinase (CK) [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Myoglobin (Mb) and interluekine-6 (IL-6) out of the cell and into the circulation [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Collectively, these responses may influence performance in sports involving intense, intermittent bouts of work.</p><p>Various nutritional interventions have been proposed to improve performance [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] attenuate the perception of fatigue [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; muscle damage [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] immune dysfunction [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] or to enhance recovery [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] following training and intermittent sport competition. Alghannam (2011) [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] observed a positve effect on intermittent running performance after ingesting 0.3g&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup> and 0.7g&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup> of carbohydrate and protein in young male amateur soccer players. Similar effects were noted by Highton <italic>et al</italic>. (2013) [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. While various studies have shown that combining carbohydrates with protein may improve performance [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], increase protein synthesis and enhance tissue repair [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], less is known about combining this nutrition schema with other ingredients. Accordingly, glutamine supplementation has been shown to attenuate fatigue [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and aid immune recovery [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] while the ingestion of 1 to 2 g of L-carnitine L-tartrate has been associated with a decrease in exercise induced oxidative stress [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The examination of multi-ingredient formulae containing protein, carbohydrate and amino acid derivatives is important given recent reports attesting to an increased usage of such supplements among team sports athletes [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Posited benefits include an effort to support performance, reduce the perception of fatigue perception and maximize recovery between training and competitions [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Though scientific information is available, supplement users rely more on coaches, teammates, family and friends to obtain advice about nutrition products and protocols for consumption [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The final decision appears to be mainly based on the marketing claims, rather than on the available scientific information [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The primary aim of this investigation was to examine the effects of a commercially available multi-ingredient formulae composed of protein and carbohydrate, L-glutamine and L-carnitine L-tartrate versus a carbohydrate only (CHO) and placebo treatment on sprint performance, rate of perceived exertion, muscle damage, temporary immune dysfunction and recovery from intermittent protocol over 24h post exercise period in amateur soccer players. We hypothesized that the ingestion of a multi-ingredient would improve performance, attenuate perception of fatigue enhance recovery and reduce markers of muscle damage and immunosuppression compared to the ingestion of CHO alone or a placebo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants</title><p>Sixteen males, amateur soccer players (age 24&#x000b1;3.7 years; height 181&#x000b1;1 cm; body mass 77.5&#x000b1;8.7kg) volunteered to participate in the study signed informed consent forms, and all study procedures previously approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Greenwich (UK). The study was conducted during the spring of 2013 at the Centre for Sport Sciences of Human Performance at the Medway Campus in Kent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the University ethics committee. All participants were screened for any musculoskeletal injuries, metabolic conditions, or diseases; and use of medications, smoking, and nutritional supplements that would affect performance, rate of perceived exertion, muscle damage, immunology or recovery process (e.g., creatine, whey protein, and amino acids) within 6 weeks prior to the start of the study. A minimum sample size of 15 participants was calculated assuming a 0.05 significance level, a 0.80 power, and a correlation &#x02265;0.70 among the 4 repeated measures within each condition, in order to detect medium effect sizes.

An aliquot of the whole blood was used to perform leukocyte (Neutrophil; Lymphocytes and Monocyte) counts as general markers of immunity using an automated haematology analyser (ABX Pentra 60C+, Horiba Medical, Montpellier, France). Nonheparinised blood samples were inverted 5 times and allowed to stand for 1h prior to being centrifuged at 3500 r x min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, at a temperature of 4&#x000b0;C, for 10 min, after which the serum was aliquoted into Eppendorf tubes and frozen at&#x02014;70&#x000b0;C for later analysis. Heparinised samples were inverted 8 times in the vacutainer to ensure adequate mixing with the heparin. Thirty-two microlitres of heparinised blood was pipetted out onto a test strip and analysed, for CK, using a colorimetric assay procedure (Reflotron Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) (Horder et al. 1991).

Supportive analyses were undertaken to detail immune and muscle damage indices related to muscular function. Overall, we found that the ingestion of a MTN or CHO supplement had no ergogenic or ergolytic affect on performance or patterns of serum creatine kinase and IL-6 responses over a 24h recovery period. Therefore, we reject our hypothesis that a MTN formula will improve performance under the parameters associated with our trial. We did, however, observe that ingesting MTN divided into four smaller intakes administered before and during a 90-min IRS plus another additional full dose ingested immediately after exercise was sufficient to attenuate the perception of fatigue experienced at the end of the 90-min IRS protocol. Although both MTN and CHO supplementation blunted the 1h-post exercise Mb increases, only CHO seems to be effective to attenuate the transitory 1h-post exercise neutrophilia and monocytosis commonly observed after heavy prolonged exercises [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Our results agree with those of Alghannam (2011) [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], who reported lower RPE values at the beginning and toward the end of a 90-min soccer-specific intermittent exercise when participants were supplemented with a similar carbohydrate-protein beverage prior and an interval synonymous with &#x0201c;halftime&#x0201d; compared to the ingestion of only carbohydrate or a low calorie placebo. In contrast to our findings, Alghannam reported a significant improvement during an exercise time-to-exhaustion test performed at 80% of V02max carried out just after a soccer-specific task, when the carbohydrate-protein mixture was administered.</p><p>Fatigue in intermittent sprint endurance activities can be caused by a number of factors, ranging from the generation of an inadequate motor command in the motor cortex (i.e. neural factors) to factors related to metabolite accumulation or energy supply [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The capacity to maintain a high level of performance while exercising at submaximal intensities closer to VO2max is limited by the amount of muscle glycogen available and the maintenance of higher levels of blood glucose toward the end of the task [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Conversely one single bout of a maximal 15-meters sprint performed after a 90-min IRS protocol would rely more on the ability to produce high levels of neural drive and the energy supply from the phosphagen system [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Consequently ingesting a nutritional supplement would be more effective to enhance performance at the post endurance run to fatigue exercise rather than on a single maximal 15-meter sprint run. In such as types of explosive short duration activities, regardless of the level of muscle glycogen or the amount of nutrient ingested during and after exercise, the progression of fatigue along long lasting intermittent activities leads to a failure to fully and maximally activate contracting musculature with a concomitant loss of force and sprint performance [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Indeed, other previous studies have observed similar drops in sprint performance, of about 2 to 9%, measured after intermittent sprints protocols [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In our study, we found that a multi-ingredient supplement had no effective attenuation for the reduction in sprint performance or the necessary speed up to reach the benchmark performance determined in the 15-meter sprint test.</p><p>The benefits of adding protein to carbohydrate on performance have shown to be evident when carbohydrate is provided at less than optimal rate of 60 g&#x000b7;h<sup>-1</sup>. However when exogenous carbohydrates are consumed at or above the optimal rate no further ergogenic effect has been reported by the ingestion of added proteins [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We administered two isoenergetic beverages providing a total of 53 g or 46 g of carbohydrate along a 90-min IRS protocol at CHO and MTN condition, respectively. Hence in both conditions the rate of carbohydrate delivered during exercise was beneath the optimal (46 g&#x000b7;h<sup>-1</sup> and 35.5 g&#x000b7;h<sup>-1</sup> respectively). Although of the addition of protein to a suboptimal amount of carbohydrate would be expected to improve performance, the energetic content of the supplements (~3.5 kcal&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) may represent a limiting factor associated with the lack of any ergogenic effect observed during the IRS protocol [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Muscle glycogen depletion and dehydration observed during prolonged intermittent exercises would closely relate with a decrease in the exercise intensity [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Moreover, the perception of effort originated from the central nervous system would influence the intensity of exercise performed as fatigue progress along the workout or competition [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It has been postulated that the co-ingestion of carbohydrate-protein containing higher amount of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) could reduce the ratings of perceived exertion, attenuate mental fatigue, and in some situations improve endurance performance [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] via a mechanism in accordance with the central fatigue hypothesis [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Results of our study would support the positive effect of added high quality protein to CHO to attenuate the rate of perceived exertion as the exercise approaches to the end (<xref rid="pone.0125188.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>), however no concomitant improvement in the intermittent endurance capacity was observed and therefore these results do not support the previously reported positive effects of carbohydrate-protein containing BCAA mixture to improve the intensity [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] enhance central drive and endurance capacity during prolonged exercises [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Perceived exertion has been proposed as useful to control pacing strategy in intermittent sport [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, in our study athletes were allowed to self-select the intensity only during the 20 m walking whilst had to maximally sprint or perform at a relative pre-established sub-maximal intensity for the rest of the IRS test. Therefore, the proposed benefit of proteins added to carbohydrate for improving submaximal self selected exercise performance [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] would be expressed only at the central level with no impact on performance when exercising at pre established or maximal possible intensities. The exact mechanism by which the used MTN supplement has affected the perception of effort with no impact on the IRS performance warrants furthers investigations.</p><p>Regardless of the effect on performance, multi-ingredients supplementation has also been proposed as an effective countermeasure to attenuate exercise induced muscle damage [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and the transitory post exercise immunosuppression [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Our results differ slightly from those reported by Naclerio et al [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] who observed positive effects of a multi-ingredient to blunt the rise in serum CK and Mb measured at 24h and 1 h respectively after performing a 90 min intermittent test in a sample of recreationally active team sport individuals. The present study showed inconsistent results, whereas CK peaks at 24h after exercise with no differences between treatment conditions, both MTN and CHO showed lower Mb values than placebo at 1h with no differences between them (<xref rid="pone.0125188.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Differences in the characteristic of the samples used in both studies (amateur soccer players vs recreationally practitioners from different team sports) or the high variability of the results would be the reason of such as the observed differences. In fact total CK is a highly variable, indirect and nonspecific biomarker of skeletal muscle disruption [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The analysis used for the assay of both CK and Mb does not distinguish between skeletal or cardiac muscle isoforms. In addition, substantial variation between participants (<xref rid="pone.0125188.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) together with the lack of homogeneity in the observed response for the three tested conditions makes difficult to identify any protective effects obtained from the ingestion of either MTN or CHO supplements. Furthermore, muscle damage, per se, is only a minor contributor to the rise of serum IL-6 during exercise. Indeed only sustained elevation in the IL-6 concentration observed from 6h to several days after exercise have been associated with the inflammatory response triggered by exercise induced muscle damage [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. During prolonged exercise, active muscles secrete IL-6 in a hormone-like fashion to stimulate glucose output from the liver and lipolysis in adipose tissue when muscular glycogen becomes progressively depleted [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Thus, the patterns of IL-6 response observed in our study, increasing immediately after, 1h post and returned toward the baseline at 24h after exercise without differences between treatment conditions, would indicate that for our participants the 90-min IRS protocol was not hard enough to elicit both elevated levels of myofibrillar disruptions and to significantly deplete muscle glycogen to a level that would have been elicited higher IL-6 concentrations at least in the placebo condition. Moreover, exercise-evoked IL-6 may also act on the central nervous system to induce fatigue sensation [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] that has ultimately resulted in a significant decrement in endurance performance [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, RPE values were lower only at the end of IRS during MTN condition. This result suggests that when glycogen is available, consuming a carbohydrate-protein based multi-ingredient supplement would attenuate the rise in fatigue perception even though no further effects on performance are achieved. Perhaps the 2h pre standardized meal containing 1 g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> CHO and 0.15 g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> protein, ingested by our participants was enough to prevent substantial glycogen depletion when this group of amateur soccer players performed a habitual 90-min intermittent activity.</p><p>On the other hand, CHO supplementation alone showed some effect to attenuate increases in blood neutrophil and monocyte counts observed at 1h post exercise (Figs <xref rid="pone.0125188.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0125188.g005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). These results support the notion that only carbohydrate ingestion with no added proteins during and after heavy exercises would probably be the only effective scientifically supported nutritional countermeasure to exercise induced immune dysfunction [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Cells of the immune system have high metabolic rates and glucose availability can theoretically influence the immune response to exercise and the ability to maintain immunecompetence [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Additionally, a MTN combining CHO high quality proteins and enriched with L-glutamine, would have been expected to provide additional immunosuppression effects by counteracting exercise induced plasma glutamine depletion. However plasma glutamine concentrations following exercise do no decrease below threshold values that are detrimental to immune-function [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Thus, in ours previously well nourished athletes, the consumption of high quality proteins would not be effective to protect against exercise-induced immunosuppression. Furthermore the lower amount of carbohydrate provided in the MTN could have been the cause by which CHO and not MTN attenuated the increase in Neutrophil and monocyte counts.</p><p>The addition of L-glutamine and L-carnitine L-tartrate into the MTN formula does not appear to have any additional effect on the IRS performance or the 24h recovery period compared to CHO alone or placebo. There was also no effect on Mb levels since these were similar in both the MTN and CHO conditions. Even though the positive effects of L-glutamine supplementation on performance are not scientifically supported [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], some effects to prevent excessive muscle damage and neutrophil function suppression have been observed after several days of supplementation [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] but not after an acute intake as administered in the present study. In fact Neutrophil counts were higher in MTN compared to CHO at 1h post exercise (<xref rid="pone.0125188.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). With regard to L-carnitine, its positive effects on exercise induced muscle damage and oxidative stress have been reported as a result of a three-weeks regular administration protocol [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and not after an acute intake. Furthermore, as plasma L-carnitine peaks after 3 to 6h of ingestion [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], in order to promote its benefits, two doses where the last single intake should be administered around 3h before exercise has been recommended [<xref rid="pone.0125188.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Thus, the protocol used in the present study where participants were supplemented immediately before, during and after exercise, would likely not favors some marketed positive effects of L-carnitine on performance, recovery and muscle damage.</p><p>A potential limitation of our study is that we only examined a 24h recovery period involving three time points and, therefore, is unable to generalize for longer periods of recovery time. In addition, we are unable to generalize to other sports that do not exhibit similar performance characteristics. Furthermore, other markers were not analyzed such as plasma aminoacidemia, glycaemia, serum glutamine and carnitine concentrations. We measured only general markers of immunity related to one aspect of innate immune function. Further studies should investigate the effect of feeding strategies on other aspects of immune function (e.g., lymphocyte proliferation and in vivo immune responses). Lastly blood IL-6 values do not allow estimating the autocrine and paracrine effects of this myokine within the skeletal muscle. To better analyze the IL-6 response to exercise, future investigations using microdialysis techniques or muscle biopsies should be considered. A strength of the present investigation is that we have implemented a randomized, counter balanced, cross over design using participants of similar training characteristics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec023"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The ingestion of a MTN (53g of CHO, 14.5g of whey protein, 1.5g of L-carnitine and 5g of L-glutamine) or CHO (69.5g maltodextrin) alone does not improve performance when ingested during and immediately after a 90-min intermittent repeated sprint test. Nor does this ingestion schema attenuate functional fatigue or alter CK and IL-6 responses measured immediately after, 1h, and 24h post exercise in amateur soccer players. Conversely, ingesting a MTN would be effective to attenuate fatigue perception compared to only CHO or placebo. Although both MTN and CHO appear to have some effects in blunting the Mb increases observed 1h post exercise, the high variability of our results makes difficult to consider a real positive effect of those supplements on muscle damage. Moreover only CHO with no added protein blunt the increase in Neutrophil and monocytes counts commonly observed after a 90-min intermitted repeated sprint protocol.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec024"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0125188.s001"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title>Supporting information including all data collected during the study.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0125188.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank all participants, and Kelly Cooper, Mark Chapman, Sergio Garcia, Tobia Zanotto and Dan Baddeley for their help and support during the collection data process.</p><p>
