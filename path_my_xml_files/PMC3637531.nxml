Older patients are generally at higher risk of adverse drug reactions due to age-related changes in physiology that affect drug disposition, metabolism, and response. These analyses examined efficacy and safety outcomes of older (&#x02265;65&#x000a0;years) versus younger patients from clinical trials of duloxetine in the management of OA knee pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This is a post hoc analysis of two 13-week studies, in which patients were randomized to duloxetine 60 mg/day or placebo. Both studies allowed potential dose changes after 7&#x000a0;weeks of dosing, with Study I re-randomizing duloxetine treated patients to either stay on 60&#x000a0;mg/day or increase to 120&#x000a0;mg/day; while Study II more closely mimicked clinical practice by escalating only non-responding patients to 120&#x000a0;mg/day. For all analyses patients were subgrouped by age: older (&#x02265;65&#x000a0;years) and younger (40&#x02013;64&#x000a0;years). Overall efficacy and safety age-group comparisons of duloxetine versus placebo were performed using pooled data from both studies with all duloxetine dose levels combined. Safety analyses included discontinuation rates, treatment-emergent adverse events, and serious adverse events. To evaluate the effects of increasing the dose in non-responding patients, only Study II data were evaluated. Treatment arms were defined post hoc as placebo, duloxetine 60&#x000a0;mg/day, and duloxetine 60/120&#x000a0;mg/day.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At study end, patients in each age group who were treated with duloxetine versus placebo had significantly greater improvement in pain (both, p&#x0003c;.05), and there was no significant effect of age on treatment (p=.72). Increasing the dose to 120&#x000a0;mg in non-responding patients was not found to have a significant advantage. Among treatment-emergent adverse events with duloxetine treatment, only dizziness had a significantly differential treatment effect (p=.02) with greater incidence over placebo in younger patients (6.6% versus 0.6%, p=.02), but not in older patients (1.0% versus 3.2%, p=.29).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Duloxetine was efficacious and generally well tolerated for management of symptomatic knee OA in both older and younger patients, but increasing the dose to 120&#x000a0;mg in non-responding patients did not provide additional benefit.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Duloxetine</kwd><kwd>Osteoarthritis of the knee</kwd><kwd>Older patients</kwd><kwd>Pain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is the most common form of arthritis in older individuals and a leading cause of pain and disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], which contributes to overall decreased quality of life, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] as well as the increased risk of depression and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Alleviation of pain symptoms is paramount in managing knee OA, and should be the focus of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The approach to pain management in older patients may differ from that for younger patients, due to generally higher risk of adverse drug reactions from age-related changes in physiology that affect drug disposition, metabolism, and response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Since many adverse events are dose related, appropriate dosing for analgesic medications in this sensitive population is a particularly important clinical concern.</p><p>Prescription pain management options for OA knee pain include topical or oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), intra-articular injections of corticosteroids and hyaluronates, and opioids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. NSAIDs and opioids are associated with potential use-limiting risks or side effects which may be heightened in the older patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These effects include gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulcer disease, nephrotoxicity, and serious long term cardiovascular effects with NSAID use, and risks of sedation, respiratory depression, overdose, misuse, or dependency with opioids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. When treating OA knee pain in older patients, it is important to have alternative treatment options that offer efficacy with an acceptable risk profile in this population.</p><p>Current evidence-based literature addressing the pharmacological management of chronic pain in older persons is sparse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. As a result, algorithms for treatment are mostly generated from study outcomes in younger patients that are extrapolated to older individuals. Since clinical trials in OA knee pain often include patients ranging in age from 40&#x000a0;years to 65&#x000a0;years and older, analyzing treatment outcomes in age-stratified data may provide better clinical insight than extrapolations from younger to older patients.</p><p>In clinical studies, duloxetine (a selective, relatively balanced serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) has demonstrated efficacy in four distinct chronic pain conditions: diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], fibromyalgia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], chronic low back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and OA knee pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Since the OA knee pain trials included many older patients, we conducted a post hoc analysis of those trials to examine any differential effect of age on the efficacy and safety of duloxetine. In addition, we examined data that might suggest appropriate dosing of duloxetine in this population. In a recently published study, Abou-Raya et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] reported that duloxetine 60&#x000a0;mg/day significantly improved pain as compared with placebo in older patients with OA knee pain, many of whom also had comorbid depression. Our post hoc analysis differs from that study in that the patients in our studies were not depressed, thereby allowing determination of the direct analgesic effect of duloxetine without confounding by improvement in depression. Furthermore, we compared treatment outcomes between older and younger patients, and investigated the utility of increasing the dose in non-responding patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Data were from two published 13-week, randomized, placebo-controlled studies in male and female outpatients who were at least 40&#x000a0;years of age, and met American College of Rheumatology clinical and radiographic criteria for the diagnosis of OA of the knee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In both studies, pain was assessed daily using an ordinal 11-point numerical rating scale (0 to 10) that was recorded in patient diaries. Efficacy assessments were based on the weekly mean of the daily average pain severity from these patient diaries. Pain was also assessed with the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] (severity range: 0&#x02013;10) at weeks 4, 7, and 13. All patients provided written informed consent before the commencement of any study procedures.</p><p>For both studies, patients were required to have pain for &#x02265;14&#x000a0;days of each month for 3&#x000a0;months prior to study entry, with a mean pain severity &#x02265;4 on daily pain diary ratings during the screening and baseline periods. In addition, patients had to agree to maintain their usual activity level throughout the course of the study. Key exclusion criteria for both studies included having a body mass index &#x0003e;40&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>; a diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis or an autoimmune disorder; having received invasive therapies within the prior 3&#x000a0;months, or joint replacement to the knee; being non-ambulatory or needing assistance walking with crutches or walker; any serious medical condition or psychiatric disorder, including major depressive disorder, as identified by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] that could compromise participation in the study.</p><p>Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 in double-blind fashion to treatment with duloxetine 60&#x000a0;mg/day or placebo as determined by a computer-generated random sequence using an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS). All patients randomized to duloxetine were started on 30&#x000a0;mg/day for one week then escalated to 60&#x000a0;mg/day. After 7&#x000a0;weeks, the duloxetine dosing regimen could change. In Study I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], patients in the duloxetine group were re-randomized via IVRS without regards to change in pain severity to either continue duloxetine 60&#x000a0;mg/day or to have their dose increased directly to 120&#x000a0;mg/day, and were continued on that dose for the remainder of the study. In Study II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], patients in the duloxetine group who had &#x0003c;30% reduction from baseline in pain severity on the BPI 24-h average pain severity scale, had their dose increased directly to 120&#x000a0;mg/day and continued on that dose for the remainder of the study.</p><p>For this post hoc analysis, two patient groups were defined by their age at study entry: older patients were at least 65&#x000a0;years of age, and younger patients were less than 65. For the efficacy and safety analyses comparing duloxetine with placebo within age groups, studies were pooled and doses were pooled. In addition, a subgroup analysis was conducted to determine the efficacy of duloxetine in the &#x0201c;oldest of the old&#x0201d; (&#x0003e;75&#x000a0;years) as compared with the &#x0201c;younger of the old&#x0201d; (65 to &#x0003c;75&#x000a0;years) patients. For comparing the effect of increasing duloxetine to 120&#x000a0;mg in non-responding patients, only data from Study II were evaluated as it most closely reflected clinical practice; whereas re-randomization to a higher dose does not. Treatment arms were defined post hoc as placebo, duloxetine 60&#x000a0;mg/day (patients who remained on 60&#x000a0;mg for the entire study), and duloxetine 60/120&#x000a0;mg/day (patients who received 60&#x000a0;mg for 7&#x000a0;weeks, followed by duloxetine 120&#x000a0;mg for 6&#x000a0;weeks). Safety assessments included spontaneously reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), discontinuation rates due to TEAEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), and treatment-emergent abnormal vital signs.</p><p>Categorical baseline characteristics were compared between age groups using a logistic regression model with terms for study, treatment, age group and the treatment-by-age group interaction. Quantitative baseline characteristics were compared using an analysis of variance model with similar explanatory terms. Weekly means of change from baseline in the average pain severity ratings from patient diaries were analyzed using a likelihood-based, mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM) approach that used all available observations. The model included the fixed categorical effects of site, treatment, week, age group, treatment-by-week interaction, age group-by-week interaction, treatment-by-age group interaction, treatment-by-age-group-by-week interaction, as well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline score and baseline-by-week interaction.</p><p>The analysis of completion rates, discontinuation rates due to adverse events (AEs), and incidence of spontaneously reported TEAEs and SAEs were compared using a logistic regression model with terms for study, treatment, age category, and the treatment-by-age interaction. For comparison among treatment groups and age groups, test results were considered statistically significant if p&#x02264;.05; for tests of interaction, results were considered statistically significant if p&#x02264;.1. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Demographic characteristics and baseline pain severity of patients stratified according to age group and treatment arms are summarized in Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.

Rates of TEAEs that occurred after patients were escalated to duloxetine 120&#x000a0;mg were numerically higher in the younger patients as observed in the older ones (24.4% versus 20%), and these rates were also numerically higher than those observed in patients who remained on the 60&#x000a0;mg dose (14.6% in older and 14.9% in younger patients).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) occurring in at least 5% of patients who received duloxetine</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></th><th colspan="2" align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>Older</bold><hr/></th><th colspan="2" align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>Younger</bold><hr/></th><th align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="left">&#x000a0;</th><th align="center"><bold>Placebo N=94 n (%)</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Duloxetine N=103 n (%)</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Placebo N=154 n (%)</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Duloxetine N=136 n (%)</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Treatment-by-Age Group Interaction p values</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Patients with at least one TEAE<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">40(42.6)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">55(53.4)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">51 (33.1)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">65(47.8)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">.66<sup>a</sup><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Constipation<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">2 (2.1)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">11 (10.7)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">0 (0)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">3 (2.2)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1.00<sup>b</sup><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Diarrhea<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">2 (2.1)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">4 (3.9)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">4 (2.6)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">7 (5.1)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">.93<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dizziness<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">3 (3.2)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1 (1.0)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1 (0.6)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">9 (6.6)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">.02<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Nausea<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">3 (3.2)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">9 (8.7)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">2 (1.3)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">11 (8.1)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">.40<sup>c</sup><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Somnolence<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">3 (3.2)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">6 (5.8)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1 (0.6)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">4 (2.9)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">.49<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Patients with at least one SAE</td><td align="center">2 (2.1)</td><td align="center">3 (2.9)</td><td align="center">2 (1.3)</td><td align="center">1 (0.7)</td><td align="center">.57</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup> treatment effect, p=.005.</p><p><sup>b</sup> treatment effect, p=.03.</p><p><sup>c</sup> treatment effect, p=.004.</p><p>Abbreviations: <italic>TEAE</italic>, treatment-emergent adverse event; <italic>SAE</italic>, serious adverse event.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>The frequency of SAEs did not differ significantly between age or treatment groups and there was no significant treatment-by-age interaction (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).

This is an important finding as it suggests that duloxetine is efficacious in the treatment of OA knee pain regardless of age. The lack of an age effect on pain reduction in this patient population is supported by similar findings in a post hoc age-stratified subgroup analysis of duloxetine in the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>In both older and younger patients, treatment with duloxetine 60&#x000a0;mg/day was associated with significantly greater pain reduction as compared to placebo. However, increasing the dose of duloxetine in older and younger patients, who were not experiencing adequate pain reduction, was not found to provide additional benefit. These findings may be particularly relevant to the treatment of older patients to avoid unnecessary dose escalation.</p><p>Overall, duloxetine was generally well tolerated by patients in each age group, considering that rates of completion and discontinuation due to adverse events did not differ significantly or show a tendency toward more drop outs in the older population, and were similar to findings in other studies across indications. Further, adverse events with duloxetine generally did not differ between age groups except that dizziness was associated with greater risk among younger patients relative to older ones. While orthostatic hypotension was the most common treatment-emergent vital sign abnormality reported in each age and treatment group, there was no significant treatment-by-age group interaction.</p><p>The interpretation of this post hoc analysis has limitations to be considered. First, neither study was specifically designed to assess safety or efficacy in exclusively older patients. Furthermore, the results of subgroup analyses should generally be interpreted with caution due to concerns about multiple testing and increased likelihood of finding potentially spurious and un-reproducible results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Duloxetine 60&#x000a0;mg was efficacious for managing OA knee pain in both age groups, but increasing the dose to 120&#x000a0;mg in non-responding patients did not provide additional benefit.
