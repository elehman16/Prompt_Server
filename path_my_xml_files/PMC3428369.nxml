Magnitude and breadth of pre-infection responses did not correlate with distance of the viral sequence to the insert (p&#x0003e;0&#x000b7;50). Acute log viral load trended lower in vaccine versus placebo recipients (estimated mean 4&#x000b7;7 vs 5&#x000b7;1) but the difference was not significant (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0&#x000b7;27).

Three thousand high-risk HIV-1 negative individuals at 34 sites in North America, the Caribbean, South America, and Australia were randomized to vaccine or placebo. Immunizations were halted in September 2007 based on early evidence that the vaccine was ineffective at reducing HIV acquisition or viral load setpoint <xref rid="pone.0043396-Buchbinder1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>Rolland <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0043396-Rolland1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> compared breakthrough HIV-1 sequences for male infected vaccine and placebo recipients to the vaccine insert sequence. They found greater protein distances to the insert sequence for vaccine recipients than for placebo recipients when restricting the analysis to regions with predicted T-cell epitopes. Importantly, this sieve effect was specific to the HIV proteins used in the vaccine, and was not found in other proteins. Thus, while the vaccine did not protect against infection, it did impact founding virus populations. Subsequent studies from the RV144 trial have suggested that reduction in acquisition of HIV-1 is associated with immune responses to envelope, a gene not included in the MRKAd5 vaccine <xref rid="pone.0043396-Haynes1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>This paper explores immunological and virological factors that may further elucidate the findings of Rolland <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0043396-Rolland1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Specifically, we assessed whether pre- or post-infection T-cell responses were responsible for the viral sequence changes by correlating T-cell immunogenicity and viral sequence data. In addition, we evaluated whether the sieve effect on infecting viruses was associated with acute viral load. Our results indicate that while anamnestic responses were generated, the vaccine effect on viral sequences was largely not predicted by available measures of T-cell function. Neither was sequence divergence from the vaccine insert found to be significantly associated with viral load. There was some suggestion that the vaccine had a weak and transient impact on viral load, although the result was nonsignificant and future studies with more subjects with acute viral load data would be needed to confirm the effect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The protocol was approved by the ethics review committee at every study site.

Specifically, within the measured pre-infection reactive epitopes, we would expect an unusually high rate of mismatches in vaccine recipient founder sequence epitopes compared to the corresponding insert epitopes. To address this hypothesis, for each vaccine recipient we estimated the percentage of mismatches as the observed rate at which any of his founder sequences mismatched the insert residue, across all sites within his reactive 15-mers. These percentages were averaged across the vaccine recipients with at least one positive response, for each protein region.

However the T-cell response data only partially explained the vaccine-induced sequence changes identified by Rolland <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0043396-Rolland1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Pre-infection T-cell responses did not predict divergence of the breakthrough sequences from the vaccine insert, yet there was some evidence of differences between vaccine and placebo breakthrough sequences in regions with observed pre-infection T-cell responses. This evidence was concentrated in Nef which has been shown to be highly immunodominant during acute infection <xref rid="pone.0043396-Licterfeld1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>Analyses of the T-cell data were challenged by methodological and data availability issues. T-cell responses were sparse such that few epitopes were recognized by multiple individuals; hence we had limited power to detect a sieve effect in immunofocused regions and to correlate the T-cell responses and sequence data. The T-cell response-based sieve analysis also had limited power since only a fraction of epitopes may experience selection pressure due to an immune response. We were limited by sample availability and minimal overlap between the viral sequence and immunogenicity data as well. In addition, methodological improvements, such as refinement of epitope-mapping algorithms and novel assays, are needed to more directly measure vaccine-induced T-cell responses. Finally, the immune responses we measured in the blood do not necessarily reflect responses in the mucosal tissue which play a key role in early infection.</p><p>The vaccine did not significantly reduce acute log viral load, although the point estimate of a 0.4 log<sub>10</sub> reduction suggests the possibility of weak suppression that would need confirmation in a study with more acute viral load data. Separate analyses of viral load data in Step from HIV diagnosis to 4 years post-infection (median follow-up two years post-infection) demonstrated that the vaccine did not reduce post-acute viral load <xref rid="pone.0043396-Fitzgerald1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Therefore any impact of the vaccine on viral load was early and transient.</p><p>We tested the following hypotheses regarding the impact of the viral sequence changes on acute viral load. If vaccine-induced changes in breakthrough sequences led to decreased viral fitness in terms of viral load, we would expect higher epitope-based distances to be associated with lower acute viral load, differentially so in the vaccine group. There are a few examples in the literature of CTL escape being associated with reduced viral fitness <xref rid="pone.0043396-MartinezPicado1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0043396-Troyer1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, although the SLYNTVATL epitope that encompasses the Gag-84 signature site is well known to escape without fitness cost to the virus. Alternatively, if vaccine-induced T-cells recognized certain epitopes and were therefore able to suppress viral replication, we would expect lower epitope-based distances to be associated with lower acute viral load among vaccine recipients, but no association in placebo recipients. Our analyses linking acute viral load with viral sequence data were designed to be sensitive to either hypothesis. We found no detectable evidence of a fitness cost as measured by acute viral load, or of reduced viral replication due to vaccine-induced epitope recognition.</p><p>The viral load analyses were also limited by low power. Acute viral load was missing for 70% of subjects, largely due to the Step study&#x02019;s six-monthly HIV testing from Week 30 on (four weeks after the last vaccination). This highlights the importance of more frequent HIV testing in efficacy trials. Had HIV testing been more frequent, we would likely have been adequately powered to detect a vaccine effect on acute viral load of the size estimated here, a reduction of 0&#x000b7;4 log.</p><p>Sieve analysis plays a key role in the assessment of immune correlates. Specifically, it can be useful for identifying the specific immune responses responsible for any observed vaccine efficacy. This study emphasizes the need for immune correlates assessments to be based on assays that are epitope-specific and that are rigorously validated and have high reproducibility.</p><p>Despite detecting vaccine-induced anamnestic responses, this study found that the observed T-cell responses did not adequately explain the vaccine effect on founding virus populations identified by Rolland <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0043396-Rolland1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Importantly, this implies that the measures of T-cell response that were employed did not adequately explain some immune functions that were nonetheless able to put pressure on the virus. Possible explanations include a lack of sensitivity of our immune assays or use of inappropriate assays. Neither was there evidence of a consequence of the viral sequence changes in terms of acute viral load. Nevertheless, the trend toward modest viral load suppression in vaccine recipients suggests a hypothesis that vaccines with improved CD8+ T cell responses may be able to exert stronger pressure with greater fitness cost and improved viral load suppression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0043396.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Datasets Included in the Analysis and Associated Scientific Questions.</p><p>(EPS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0043396.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0043396.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>Post-Infection Depth of T-Cell Response.
