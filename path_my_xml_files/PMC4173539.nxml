Peritoneal insufflation induces alteration of hemodynamics characterized by decrease in cardiac output, elevation of arterial pressure, and increase in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance. Heart rate remains unchanged or increases only slightly.</p><p>PNO and trendelenburg position increase the intraocular pressure (IOP) leading to decrease in perfusion of retina and at times the significant risk of ischemic retinopathy. Increase in IOP, in patients with ocular hypertension has raised concern that laparoscopic surgery may aggravate IOP in susceptible patients.</p><p>The IOP is defined as the pressure exerted by the contents of the eye against the containing wall. Normal IOP is in the range of 10.5 and 20.5 mmHg with a mean pressure of 15.5 &#x000b1; 2.57 mmHg. A diurnal variation of 2-3 mmHg is normal.</p><p>IOP is affected by the various factors. Hypoventilation, hypercapnia, the increase in central venous pressure (CVP), light planes of anesthesia, laryngoscopy and intubation, drugs like atropine, depolarizing muscle relaxants like, succinylcholine, ketamine, trendelenburg position and large volume of fluid of peribulbar block are responsible for increase in IOP.</p><p>Reduction in IOP is induced by 15&#x000b0; head up tilt, hyperventilation, thiopentone, fentanyl, propofol, inhalation agents like, nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), halothane, Isoflurane, non-depolarizing muscle relaxants, small taming dose of succinylcholine, alfentanyl, lignocaine, topical application of pilocarpine, timolol, and acetazolamide etc.</p><p>Propofol total intra venous anaesthesia (TIVA) prevents the increase in IOP with PNO and head down position in laparoscopic surgeries. The mechanism of this propofol taming effect on IOP during laparoscopic surgery may be attributable to the effect of propofol on arginine vasopressin (AVP) which is markedly increased during laparoscopy especially post-insufflation and trendelenburg position. AVP and its synthetic derivative desmopressin produce a dose dependent increase in IOP. Propofol inhibits the somatodendritic AVP release from the supraoptic nucleus and may therefore prevent the increase of IOP associated with PNO and the trendelenburg position.</p><p>Our present aim is to find out the suitable combination of induction and maintenance agent for combating the increase in IOP by PNO and trendelenburg position and to study changes in IOP at different time points and positions with different combinations of drugs in gynaecological laparoscopic procedures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><p>After taking permission from the Ethical Committee of the institution 120 female patients of ASA grade I and II with age between 20 and 45 years and weight between 40 to 70 kg were selected for the study that were scheduled for diagnostic and therapeutic gynaecological laparoscopic surgery requiring general anesthesia. Pre-anesthetic check-up was done a day before surgery and informed written consent was taken.</p><p>The patients with compromised cardiac, renal or pulmonary status on medications, patients suffering from acute or chronic disorders of eye, any coagulopathy, diabetes, hypertensive, and coronary artery disease, patients unwilling to participate in the study, anemic (Hb &#x0003c; 10gm), and obese patients (&#x0003e;70 Kg) were excluded from the study.</p><p>The patients were divided arbitrarily in four groups each comprising 30 patients. Patients were kept fasting after 10 pm on night before surgery. In operation theatre proparacaine 0.5% eye drop (one drop in each eye) was instilled. After 1 min, base line IOP was measured with Schiotz tonometer in supine position. Normal saline was instilled in both eyes. Base line vitals, e.g. HR, SBP, DBP, MBP, and arterial saturation of O<sub>2</sub> (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were noted.</p><p>After getting an IV access, an infusion of ringer lactate, at the rate of 4 ml/Kg/h. was started. The patients were premedicated with inj. glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg, inj. ranitidine 150 mg, inj. midazolam 2 mg, and inj. ondansetron 4 mg and inj. fentanyl 2 mg/Kg body weight given intravenously. After 2 min of premedication, IOP and vitals were noted. Patients were preoxygenated for 2 min with 100% oxygen and induction agent was given according to the group.</p><p>Induction of anesthesia was done as follows:</p><p>Group A &#x02013; Induction with propofol 2.5 mg/kg and atracurium 0.5 mg/kg</p><p>Group B &#x02013; Induction with propofol 2.5 mg/kg and atracurium 0.5 mg/kg</p><p>Group C &#x02013; Induction with thiopentone 5 mg/kg and atracurium 0.5 mg/kg</p><p>Group D &#x02013; Induction with thiopentone 5 mg/kg and atracurium 0.5 mg/kg.</p><p>Patients were ventilated with 100% O<sub>2</sub> and LMA was inserted and bilateral expansion of chest was observed and LMA fixed. After 1 min of LMA insertion IOP was measured in supine horizontal position before PNO and vitals were measured. Patients were ventilated with Bain's circuit.</p><p>Maintenance of anesthesia was done as follows:</p><p>In group A &#x02013; Maintenance of anesthesia was done with propofol TIVA. Propofol infusion was started at the rate of 10 mg/kg/h for first 15 min, then it was reduced to 8 mg/kg/h for next 15 min and for the rest of the time infusion was given at the rate of 6 mg/kg/h. Inj. atracurium was repeated in a dose of 5 mg whenever required. Patients were ventilated with 100% O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>In group B &#x02013; Maintenance of anesthesia was done with 1% isoflurane with O<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O in the ratio of 40:60. Inj. atracurium was repeated in a dose of 5 mg as and when required.</p><p>In group C &#x02013; Maintenance of anesthesia was done with propofol TIVA. Propofol infusion was started at the rate of 10 mg/kg/h for first 15 min, then it was reduced to 8 mg/kg/h for next 15 min and for the rest of the time the infusion was given at the rate of 6 mg/kg/h. Inj. atracurium was repeated in a dose of 5 mg whenever required. The patients were ventilated with 100% oxygen.</p><p>In group D &#x02013; Maintenance of anesthesia was done with 1% isoflurane along with O<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O in the ratio of 40:60 Inj. atracurium was repeated in a dose of 5 mg as and when required.</p><p>Infusion rate of propofol and concentration of isoflurane was decreased if SBP fell &#x0003e;20% of the base line values and the infusion rate of propofol and concentration isoflurane was increased if SBP increased &#x0003e;20% of the base line value.</p><p>Patients were put in lithotomy position and PNO was created by intraperitoneal insufflation of Co<sub>2</sub> with patients in supine position. Throughout the surgery intraperitoneal pressure was maintained at 12 mmHg by a Co<sub>2</sub> insufflator. Expired concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) was kept between 30 and 35 mmHg. After 1 min of establishment of PNO, IOP was measured in lithotomy position along with vitals. After that, the patients were positioned to 20&#x000b0; head down tilt position (trendelenburg). After 5 min of head down position and PNO <italic>in situ</italic>; IOP was measured along with vitals.</p><p>At the conclusion of the procedure and after the laparoscope was taken out, infusion of propofol was stopped in group A and Group C and isoflurane was stopped in group B and D. The patients were returned to horizontal position and PNO was evacuated. After 2 min of evacuation of PNO, IOP was measured in supine horizontal position along with vitals. Ciprofloxacin 0.3% eye ointment was put in both the eyes. The patients were reversed with inj. neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and inj. glycopyrrolate 8 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg given IV. LMA was removed when patient had good spontaneous efforts, adequate tidal volume on spontaneous respiration and adequate muscle power. Consciousness and orientation were checked. Vitals were recorded at the time of shifting.</p><p>Scaled readings noted with Schiotz Tonometer were converted to pressure in mmHg (intra ocular pressure) with the help of Schiotz tonometer chart. At the end of the study the data were compiled systematically and analyzed using statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 15 for Windows. Chi-square test was used to compare the proportional data. Mean differences were compared using students <italic>t</italic>-test and a <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 showed a significant intergroup difference.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>This study comprised 120 patients between the ages of 20 and 45 years weighing between 45 and 60 kg.

The aim was to find out an appropriate combination to combat an increase in IOP in gynaecological laparoscopic surgeries.</p><p>Since all the four groups received the same premedication, it can be presumed that it did not influence the results of our comparison. Out of all the drugs used in premedication, fentanyl contributed mainly for fall in IOP. Similar views were expressed by Mustafa <italic>et al</italic>., when they compared the effects of fentanyl and alfentanyl on IOP.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Carter <italic>et al</italic>. and Oberacher-Velten <italic>et al</italic>. found that midazolam does not significantly affect IOP.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Therefore, fall in IOP after premedication can be mainly attributed to fentanyl as midazolam does not have significant effect on IOP.</p><p>Since IOP increase is more with endotracheal intubation, we used LMA instead of endotracheal tube. Whitford and Ghai <italic>et al</italic>. also found that IOP is less when LMA is inserted as compared to endotracheal intubation.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] In all the four groups LMA was inserted after induction with propofol (in group A and B) or thiopentone (in group C and D) and atracurium used as a NMBA. Maharaj <italic>et al</italic>. found that neither atracurium nor pancuronium produced any change in IOP.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Keeping these results in mind it can be assumed that IOP changes 1 min after LMA insertion were due to persistent effect of induction agents as atracurium and LMA insertion do not affect IOP significantly.</p><p>After induction with propofol IOP decreased by almost 50% while it decreased by almost 25% only after thiopentone induction. Mirakhur and Eti <italic>et al</italic>. also reached the same conclusion when they measured IOP after propofol and thiopentone.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] IOP increased in all the four groups after PNO and lithotomy and 20&#x000b0; head down position. With propofol TIVA the IOP increase was less as compared to1% isoflurane maintenance. This single observation endorses the hypothesis that the administration of propofol in any form (induction or TIVA) is better than 1% isoflurane in controlling the rise in IOP. As shown in the graph 1, with thiopentone induction and 1% isoflurane as maintenance agent (group D) IOP increased and remained above the base line value even after exsufflation and return to supine position. This clearly indicates that propofol induction and maintenance with propofol TIVA was the best option as regards the decrease in IOP (group A) and induction with thiopentone and maintenance with 1% isoflurane could not decrease IOP (group D). Similar results were found by Lentschener <italic>et al</italic>., Demiroluk <italic>et al</italic>. and Vanacker <italic>et al</italic>. when they measured the effect of propofol on IOP used for induction and maintenance for anesthesia. They found that IOP was significantly below the baseline value and never exceeded the pre-induction value.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Mirakhur <italic>et al</italic>. studied the changes in IOP in patients given propofol or thiopentone followed by succinylcholine for tracheal intubation. Propofol decreased IOP more as compared to thiopentone. The administration of succinylcholine increased IOP in all the patients, more so in those given thiopentone.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>1% isoflurane could not combat IOP even after propofol induction as the effect of latter was short lived. Similar results were obtained when Mowafi <italic>et al</italic>. compared thiopentone-isoflurane anesthesia vs total IV propofol anesthesia. IOP decreased significantly after induction of anesthesia in both the groups and remained so throughout the procedure in propofol group. However, in isoflurane group IOP increased significantly above pre-induction level after PNO and head down position. They concluded that total IV anesthesia with propofol is a better choice for laparoscopic surgery when control of IOP is a concern.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Park <italic>et al</italic>. also concluded that in gynaecological laparoscopy propofol is a better choice than desflurane for control of IOP during PNO.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>There was a significant fall in heart rate 2 min after premedication in all the groups. The decrease in HR was due to combination of midazolam (2 mg) and fentanyl (2 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg). Opioids stimulate central vagal nucleus to produce bradycardia. Opioids also have direct effect on cardiac pacemaker cells. In group A and B, HR decreased further at 1 min after LMA insertion, due to propofol induction. In group C and D, HR increased at 1 min after LMA insertion where thiopentone was used as induction agents. Same results were found by Amr <italic>et al</italic>. when they compared I-gel insertion using thiopentone or propofol.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>After premedication SBP, DBP, and MBP decreased in all the four groups and reached 93% of baseline value due to midazolam (2 mg) and fentanyl (2 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg). SBP, DBP, and MBP decreased further at 1 min after LMA insertion (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) with propofol atracurium induction. This was due to the effect of propofol which reduces stroke volume, cardiac index, and systemic vascular resistance. SBP, DBP, and MBP increased at 1 min after PNO and lithotomy position and 5 min after 20&#x000b0; head down tilt and PNO <italic>in situ</italic>. Falabelle <italic>et al</italic>., studied hemodynamic changes associated with PNO and trendelenburg position during GA. They concluded that PNO and trendelenburg position significantly increase MAP and systemic vascular resistance.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Awad <italic>et al</italic>. measured IOP in patients undergoing robot assisted prostatectomy. They found that surgical duration (in minutes) and EtCo<sub>2</sub> were the only significant variables predicting changes in IOP during stable and prolonged trendelenburg positioning. On an average, IOP increased 0.21 mmHg per mmHg increase in EtCo<sub>2</sub> after adjusting for time.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] This study depicts that a straight line correlation exists between IOP changes and EtCo<sub>2</sub> during PNO and trendelenburg position in laparoscopic surgeries. EtCo<sub>2</sub> was kept constant between 30-35 mmHg throughout the procedure, so that EtCo<sub>2</sub> changes may not show any variation on our results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Thus, we conclude that to mitigate increase in IOP during gynaecological laparoscopic surgeries with a combination of propofol and propofol TIVA (Group A) proved to be very satisfactory and superior to all combination of drugs. Propofol and isoflurane (Group B) thiopentone and propofol TIVA (Group C) were not as effective as group I in controlling an increase in IOP. However, induction with thiopentone and maintenance with isoflurane (Group D) did not prove to be satisfactory out of all four groups.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
