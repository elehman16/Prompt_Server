Evidence on health effects of ALA is not conclusive, but some observational studies found an increased risk of prostate cancer with higher intake of ALA. We examined the effect of ALA supplementation on serum concentrations of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a biomarker for prostate cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The Alpha Omega Trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00127452) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of ALA and the fish fatty acids eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA) on the recurrence of cardiovascular disease, using a 2&#x000d7;2 factorial design. Blood was collected at the start and the end of the intervention period. The present analysis included 1622 patients with a history of a myocardial infarction, aged 60&#x02013;80 years with an initial PSA concentration &#x0003c;4 ng/mL. They received either 2 g per day of ALA or placebo in margarine spreads for 40 months. T-tests and logistic regression were used to assess the effects of ALA supplementation on changes in serum PSA (both continuously and as a dichotomous outcome, cut-off point: &#x0003e;4 ng/mL).</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Mean serum PSA increased by 0.42 ng/mL on placebo (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;815) and by 0.52 ng/mL on ALA (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;807), a difference of 0.10 (95% confidence interval: &#x02212;0.02 to 0.22) ng/mL (P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0&#x000b7;12). The odds ratio for PSA rising above 4 ng/mL on ALA versus placebo was 1.15 (95% CI: 0.84&#x02013;1.58).</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>An additional amount of 2 g of ALA per day increased PSA by 0.10 ng/mL, but the confidence interval ranged from &#x02212;0.02 to 0.22 ng/mL and included no effect. Therefore, more studies are needed to establish whether or not ALA intake has a clinically significant effect on PSA or prostate cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration information</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov; Identifier: NCT00127452.

Human tissues can convert ALA into the longer chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20&#x02236;5 n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA C22&#x02236;6 n-3), but only to a limited extent. <xref rid="pone.0081519-Burdge1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081519-Goyens1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> Major dietary sources of alpha-linolenic acid are soybean oil, canola oil and walnuts. Flaxseed is particularly rich in alpha-linolenic acid and capsules of flaxseed oil are sold as supplements. The average dietary intake of ALA in high-income countries is about 2 g per day. <xref rid="pone.0081519-Elmadfa1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Observational studies suggest that an increased intake of alpha-linolenic acid is associated with a moderately lower risk of cardiovascular disease. <xref rid="pone.0081519-Pan1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> In contrast, a higher intake of alpha-linolenic acid has also been suggested to be associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer. Two meta-analyses that included both prospective and case control studies found that higher intakes of alpha-linolenic acid and higher levels in blood and adipose tissue were associated with increased risk of prostate cancer. <xref rid="pone.0081519-Simon1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081519-Brouwer1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081519-Brouwer2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> Simon et al. observed that higher concentrations of ALA in blood or adipose tissue were associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer (relative risk [RR]&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.54; 95% CI 1.16&#x02013;2.06), but no association was found for dietary ALA intake as assessed by food frequency questionnaire (RR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.09; 95% CI 0.91&#x02013;1.32). <xref rid="pone.0081519-Simon1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> Carayol et al. limited their meta-analysis to prospective studies on dietary ALA and incident prostate cancer, and found no association (RR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.97; 95% CI 0.86&#x02013;1.10). However, this meta-analysis showed a small significant adverse association when comparing high with low ALA intake categories <xref rid="pone.0081519-Carayol1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and another large observational study that was not yet included in the meta-analysis suggests a similar association. <xref rid="pone.0081519-Pelser1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> We conclude from these results that the association of ALA with prostate cancer is not clear.</p><p>The Alpha Omega Trial was a double-blind placebo-controlled trial in 60&#x02013;80 year-old patients with a history of myocardial infarction who received moderate additional amounts of omega-3 fatty acids for the prevention of recurrent cardiovascular diseases.

We only included patients with a baseline PSA concentration &#x0003c;4 ng/mL, because patients with a PSA level above 4 ng/mL have a high chance of having undiagnosed prostate cancer (21.3%) or of having hyperplasia or prostatitis; this may influence the effect of alpha linolenic acid on PSA. <xref rid="pone.0081519-Orsted1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> This left a study population of 1622 men (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081519-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

However, the 95% confidence interval ranged from &#x02212;0.02 to 0.22 mg/mL. Effects of ALA supplementation on PSA velocity and on the combined endpoint of prostate cancer and a PSA level above 4 ng/mL were in the direction of a raising effect, but the confidence intervals were wide and all included 1.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale clinical trial that investigated the effect of ALA on serum PSA. The major limitation of our study was that we did not have enough prostate cancer cases to test the hypothesis that ALA supplementation increases the risk of this clinical outcome. It is important to realize that an effect on PSA cannot be translated one to one into an effect on prostate cancer. Serum PSA is a sensitive predictor of prostate cancer <xref rid="pone.0081519-Catalona1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> but it is also increased in men with prostatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia because PSA reflects prostate tissue volume. PSA levels &#x0003e;4.0 ng/mL do not always indicate a higher risk of cancer; only 25&#x02013;33 percent of men with PSA &#x0003e;4.0 ng/mL indeed have prostate cancer. <xref rid="pone.0081519-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>Another limitation is that we tested the hypothesis that ALA supplementation increases the serum PSA level in older patients who have had a myocardial infarction. This limits the generalization of the results of our trial to the general older male population or to younger men. We excluded men who died during the trial, who had prostate cancer or a PSA level above 4 at baseline, who refused final examination, or for whom we had insufficient blood (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081519-g001">figure 1</xref>). On average the patients in our sample were therefore slightly healthier than the full cohort. However, we do not expect that had a major impact on our outcomes because treatment groups were quite similar at baseline (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0081519-t001">Table 1</xref>). Thus, we consider bias from differential prognosis in the four groups unlikely. Strengths of the trial were that the compliance to ALA supplementation was excellent and the additional amount of 2 gram ALA per day was realistic and of the same size as the recommended dietary allowance. Also the follow-up of 40 months was longer than in other trials and allowed us to study the long-term effects of ALA supplementation on serum PSA.</p><p>Our results should be very carefully interpreted as the observed 95% confidence interval ranges from &#x02212;0.02 to 0.22 ng/mL. This range includes zero, i.e. no effect. However, it also includes clinically meaningful effects. In the Copenhagen City Heart Study <xref rid="pone.0081519-Orsted1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, men aged &#x0003e;60 yrs had a 10-year prostate cancer risk of approximately 1.1%, if their PSA between 0.01 and 1.00 ng/mL and the risk was 3.6% for men with a PSA between 1.01 and 2.00 ng/mL. Thus, in this range, a 1 ng/mL higher PSA level was associated with a 2.5% higher absolute 10-year prostate cancer incidence risk. Extrapolation from the Copenhagen City Heart Study <xref rid="pone.0081519-Orsted1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> suggests that the observed mean increase in PSA of 0.10 ng/mL could lead to one extra new case of prostate cancer per 400 older men in 10 years. The upper limit of the confidence interval was 0.22 ng/mL, and such a rise could lead to one extra case per 180 men. When millions of men eat foods high in ALA they could easily reach the 2 g of ALA/d supplemented in our trial, and then the numbers start to add up. This reasoning is, however, highly speculative because it assumes a causal relation between the ALA-induced rise of PSA and prostate cancer incidence.</p><p>As far as we know we are the first to investigate the effect of pure alpha-linolenic acid by itself on PSA in men without prostate cancer. However, an earlier small study investigated the effect of flaxseed supplementation on prostate cancer proliferation rates and PSA in men with prostate cancer. <xref rid="pone.0081519-DemarkWahnefried1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> Flaxseed is a rich source of alpha-linolenic acid. Although patients with prostate cancer are quite different from our population and the study was small it should be noted that they did not show an effect on PSA and even showed a reduction in prostate cancer proliferation rates. <xref rid="pone.0081519-DemarkWahnefried1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>The average dietary intake of ALA is approximately 2 g per day in men aged 50 to 70 yrs in The Netherlands. <xref rid="pone.0081519-vanRossum1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> In our trial we provided another 2 g which increased the total intake to about 4 g/d. Habitual intakes of 4 grams or more per day are rare, <xref rid="pone.0081519-vanRossum1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> but supplements rich in ALA can easily increase intake by 2 to 3 g/d, especially if people take teaspoons of flaxseed oil (linseed oil) daily. We observed a mean increase of 0.1 ng/mL in serum PSA concentrations after 40 months of supplementation with 2 g ALA per day, but confidence interval were too wide for definitive conclusions. Therefore, more trials are needed to investigate the effects of additional doses of 2&#x02013;4 gram ALA per day.</p><p>The present study suggests that an additional amount of 2 g ALA per day may increase serum PSA, but it is unclear if and how ALA could influence prostate carcinogenesis. Sparse evidence from animal and cell structure studies suggests that ALA might act through other pathways than the very-long chain omega-3 fatty acids from fish fatty acids (eicosapentanoic acid and docosahexanoic acid). These have been claimed to be protective in the multistep process of carcinogenesis. <xref rid="pone.0081519-Larsson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081519-Pandalai1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> Our study did not have the objective to investigate the effect of these longer chain n-3 fatty acids. However, the effect of the EPA/DHA group versus placebo was in the direction of a protective effect (&#x02212;0.12; 95% CI &#x02212;0.25 to 0.00 ng/mL). Two studies that investigated effects of intervention with the longer chain n-3 fatty acids found either no effect <xref rid="pone.0081519-Hamazaki1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> or a protective effect <xref rid="pone.0081519-Safarinejad1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In contrast, a large prospective case cohort study indicates an increased prostate cancer risk for men with high blood concentrations of longer chain n-3 fatty acids <xref rid="pone.0081519-Brasky1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Therefore, effects of longer n-3 fatty acids on prostate cancer risk remain unclear.</p><p>In conclusion, an additional amount of 2 g ALA per day did increase the PSA concentration by 0.1 ng/mL, but the confidence interval ranged from a nil finding to a clinically meaningful effect. More research is needed to find out whether ALA influences the serum PSA level and the risk of prostate cancer and which levels of ALA intake are optimal for human health.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0081519.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>
