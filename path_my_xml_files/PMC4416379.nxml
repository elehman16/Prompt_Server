To ensure that negative results of a diagnostic PCR assay are true, it should be properly monitored by an inhibition control. In this study, a cloning vector harboring a modified target DNA sequence (&#x02248;375 bp) was constructed to be used as a competitive internal amplification control (IAC) for a conventional PCR assay that detects &#x02248;550 bp of the <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> oocyst wall protein (COWP) gene sequence in human feces. Modification of the native PCR target was carried out using a new approach comprising inverse PCR and restriction digestion techniques. IAC was included in the assay, with the estimated optimum concentration of 1 fg per reaction, as duplex PCR. When applied on fecal samples spiked with variable oocysts counts, &#x02248;2 oocysts were theoretically enough for detection. When applied on 25 <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>-positive fecal samples of various infection intensities, both targets were clearly detected with minimal competition noticed in 2-3 samples. Importantly, both the analytical and the diagnostic sensitivities of the PCR assay were not altered with integration of IAC into the reactions. When tried on 180 randomly collected fecal samples, 159 were <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>-negatives. Although the native target DNA was absent, the IAC amplicon was obviously detected on gel of all the <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>-negative samples. These results imply that running of the diagnostic PCR, inspired with the previously developed DNA extraction protocol and the constructed IAC, represents a useful tool for <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> detection in human feces.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Cryptosporidium</italic></kwd><kwd>diagnostic PCR</kwd><kwd>internal control</kwd><kwd>feces</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p><italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> is a unicellular microscopic parasite that infects a wide range of vertebrate hosts including humans [<xref rid="b1-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Typically, this pathogen is enteric, shed in feces, and commonly transmitted through drinking water causing diarrhea [<xref rid="b2-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Laboratory diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis is commonly established through microscopic examinations of fecal smears stained with acid fast dye for the presence of oocysts [<xref rid="b3-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Certain oocysts surface antigens, captured by synthesized monoclonal antibodies, have been used as targets of detection with immunoassays-based methods. Unlike these methods, PCR is a more sensitive tool not only for parasite detection but for characterization as well [<xref rid="b3-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Several PCR-based molecular assays have been developed for detection of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> infection in human feces since decades. Most of these assays have been executed without internal standards that give assurance of the PCR-negative results. PCR-negative results may be true-negative or false-negative due to its amplification failure [<xref rid="b4-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Being an enzymatic reaction, PCR may be constrained by organic or inorganic substances in clinical samples. Fecal samples, in particular, can contain many of these substances [<xref rid="b4-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="b6-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Other substances that could inhibit PCR may be accidentally brought to reactions during the sample processing or nucleic acid extraction steps [<xref rid="b4-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. PCR can be partially or completely inhibited by one or another of these substances. Partial inhibition decreases PCR sensitivity while complete inhibition causes false-negative results. Both results represent major problems in clinical laboratories and have significant negative impacts on patient management as well as infection control.</p><p>PCR inhibition could be avoided or minimized by an appropriate selection of sample processing procedure, a nucleic acid extraction protocol, a stable polymerase enzyme or use of specific PCR additives [<xref rid="b4-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="b6-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Besides these useful measures, PCR inhibition has to be monitored by a suitable internal amplification control (IAC) to avoid false-negative results, especially in clinical laboratories as previously recommended [<xref rid="b7-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>IAC is a non-target nucleic acid sequence that is simultaneously co-amplified with the primary target sequence in the same PCR tube [<xref rid="b7-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Internal control could be designed to monitor the sample preparatory step (s) alone [<xref rid="b8-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] or PCR amplification step alone [<xref rid="b9-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="b11-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], or both steps [<xref rid="b12-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. IAC may be designed to be competitive or non-competitive. The competitive IAC shares the target DNA sequence in the reaction constituents including the primers. As a result, 2 amplicons of various molecular weights are produced for each positive sample [<xref rid="b7-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. On the contrary, the non-competitive IAC has a nucleic acid sequence which is distinct from the target DNA sequence and is amplified by another primer pair different from that is designed to amplify the primary target sequence [<xref rid="b14-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>In an earlier study, an extraction protocol based on QIAamp<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> DNA Stool Mini Kit has been developed for protozoan DNA extraction, including <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>, directly from the diarrheic stool specimens. The DNA yield has been sufficiently purified and proved compatible with diagnostic PCR [<xref rid="b15-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Thus, no PCR inhibition has been described in all control samples subjected to amplification. Together with the subsequent IAC-free <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> PCR assay, it has been applied on a panel of random fecal samples and as a result, many samples have been diagnosed as <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>-negatives. Questions about the level of confidence for these previously prescribed findings, have served as a motivation for construction of an appropriate internal standard for the <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> PCR assay in the current study. To achieve this goal, we (i) presented an in-house constructed IAC, (ii) incorporated it in the assay with an estimated optimal concentration, (iii) evaluated it using the same panel of control as well as random fecal samples that have been previously examined with the IAC-free PCR assay, and (iv) compared the results before and after the IAC integration into the assay.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Types of samples</title><p>The PCR assay was tested on different samples including clinical samples and purified oocysts.

Briefly, a genomic <italic>C. parvum</italic> DNA sample, extracted from the purified oocyst suspension, was subjected to amplification by the target PCR assay. Gel-purified PCR products (&#x02248;550 bp), with the YORBIO Gel/PCR DNA Purification Kit (Yorkshire Bioscience, York, UK) were cloned into the pGEM<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>-T-Easy cloning vector (Promega).

For subsequent PCR use, 1 ng DNA Stock was prepared and the copy number of the COWP gene sequence was calculated following a previously described equation [<xref rid="b21-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of internal amplification control (IAC) plasmid</title><p>As shown in <xref rid="f2-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, a short competitive IAC (375 bp) was prepared by deleting a DNA fragment between the Cry-9 and Cry-15 primers using a certain type of PCR called inverse PCR (Inv PCR) as described by Ochman et al. [<xref rid="b17-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] as follows: The retrieved EAC plasmid sequence was found free from unique restriction enzyme sequence. Therefore, 2 inverse primers were manually designed with additional <italic>Hind</italic>III restriction enzyme recognition sequence plus 2 additional nucleotides were incorporated at the 5&#x00384; terminus of each primer. The Inv PCR was set up and as a result, &#x02248;210 bp was deleted using the following primers; Inv P-F (ATA AGC TTA TTG ATA TGG TCT GCC CAC C&#x00384;) and Inv P-R (TTA AGC TTA AAA CCA GAA GGA CAA ACG G). The gel purified amplicons (&#x02248;3.4 kb) were subsequently, subjected to restriction digestion (RD), with DpnI (New England Biolabs), and <italic>Hind</italic>III (Roche, Sussex, UK). The Inv PCR-truncated plasmid was re-ligated on itself and transformed into TOP10 <italic>E. coli</italic> competent cells.

Secondly, the defined EAC concentration was included with each IAC dilution in 1 PCR tube as a duplex PCR.

The EAC with the lowest concentration of 0.4 fg per &#x003bc;l (&#x02248;100 copies) was sufficient to be clearly detected by the assay as an external positive control for the PCR.

As has been mentioned earlier, many strategies can be adopted for IAC construction. Selection among these strategies is usually based on many factors including the desired purpose, PCR type and length of the PCR product [<xref rid="b22-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In our study, construction of IAC was carried out by deleting a number of nucleotides internal to the primers attaching sites of the cloned PCR product. According to previous studies, modification of the target DNA sequence may be accomplished through deleting or inserting a number of nucleotide sequences internal to the PCR primers [<xref rid="b14-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This could be done straightforward if a unique restriction enzyme sequence, present in the cloned DNA target but not in the cloning vector backbone was present. In the present study, this unique restriction enzyme sequence was absent. Thus, insertion of a <italic>Hind</italic>III restriction enzyme sequence inside the PCR target sequence was mandatory. The inv PCR, as strategy for IAC construction, has been previously adopted but with approach that is different from that followed in this study [<xref rid="b23-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In the current study, the inv PCR was used to insert the <italic>Hind</italic>III restriction enzyme's sequence inside the cloned PCR target sequence and to delete a certain number of nucleotides. The enzyme's sequence was inserted as an overhanging sequence at the 5&#x00384; terminus of each inverse primer. Two additional nucleotide bases were added at the 5&#x00384;, distal to the enzyme's recognition sequence, to provide stability of DNA-enzyme complex and facilitate efficient cutting of sites located close to the ends of the linear DNA as previously explained [<xref rid="b24-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Prior to ligation, the Inv PCR amplicon was firstly treated with <italic>DpnI</italic> that selectively cuts only the methylated DNA removing any remaining of the template plasmid DNA [<xref rid="b25-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and secondly with the <italic>Hind</italic>III restriction endonuclease to facilitate ligation by producing sticky ends. Storage of the recombinant plasmids in competent bacterial cells offers the continuous availability of high quality IAC DNA with controlled stability, size and high copy number. The size of IAC was selected to be close to that of the native target DNA to reduce the primers preference towards 1 target over the other as previously reported [<xref rid="b26-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Another important finding of this study was the adequate feasibility of the constructed IAC. When spiked with the target DNA sample, 2 PCR products of various molecular weights were developed and easily analyzed on gel till a certain concentration described as the optimum concentration. In this study, the PCR assay was re-tested against DNA samples of various purities. On its integration into the <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> diagnostic PCR while doing re-testing for <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>-positive control fecal samples, both PCR targets were successfully amplified but with minimal competition noticed on gel for few number of samples. The reduced intensities of the PCR products, alternated between the IAC and the native target, on gel were apparent for 2-3 <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>-positive control fecal samples with various oocysts load. In spite of the observed competition between IAC and the primary PCR target towards the shared reaction kinetics, including the primers, the analytical as well as the diagnostic sensitivity of the assay was not altered by integration of IAC [<xref rid="b15-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>In view of the literature, the mean number of oocysts shed by a <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>-infected person has been reported to be &#x02248;3.3&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> oocysts per ml of stool during symptomatic infection and &#x02248;3&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> oocysts per gram of stool for asymptomatic cases [<xref rid="b27-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Thus, any competition that may occur between the IAC and the native PCR target, when applied as duplex PCR on diarrheal feces, will be in favor of the later. Taking all together, the <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> PCR with the inhibition control proved sensitive, properly standardized assay and were useful for detection of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> infection in humans.</p><p>Equally important finding, all the <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>-negative samples obtained in the previous study [<xref rid="b28-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] proved to be true negatives. Only the IAC amplification bands were successfully noticed on gel for all samples. This adds more confidence to the capability of the DNA extraction protocol that has been previously developed to extract and purify the protozoan DNA directly from human feces [<xref rid="b15-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>A variety of exogenous (non-competitive) IAC has been adopted in few previous real-time PCR assays. In these assays, a control signal, instead of amplicons on gel, is always produced when there is no target sequence in the test sample. In 2013, Yang et al. [<xref rid="b9-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] have used a fragment of a coding region from Jembrana disease virus (a cattle disease) in 1 assay. Hadfield et al. [<xref rid="b10-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] have used a commercial IAC in another assay. The phocin herpes virus 1 (PhHV-1) has been adopted as IAC for real-time multiplex PCR assays detecting <italic>Giardia</italic> and <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> in parallel with <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> in human feces [<xref rid="b12-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b29-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In spite of the reported high sensitivities (1-10 oocysts/PCR), in many cases, real-time assays are often hampered by the high cost of the thermal cyclers, extra primers and PCR reagents. Moreover, the virus that has been spiked into feces prior to extraction is unlikely to be a suitable extraction control for <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> protozoan DNA because the oocysts are undoubtedly much more resistant to extraction than this lipid enveloped herpes virus. Persson et al. [<xref rid="b30-kjp-53-2-147" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] have used the broad-range bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA-based primers to amplify bacterial DNA found in fecally derived crude DNA samples as an IAC for non-bacterial diagnostic PCR assays. However, due to the massively high copy number of the 16S ribosomal DNA (IAC) relative to the non-bacterial targets sought in these enteric PCR assay, the PCR reaction kinetics would be heavily biased towards IAC amplification. Hence, amplification of the IAC sequence could not rule out, with any confidence, the presence of inhibitory substances present in the fecally derived DNA samples.</p><p>In conclusion, an IAC control, of competitive trait, was constructed for <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> diagnostic PCR assay to monitor the amplification. This IAC was found to be very helpful in ruling out PCR inhibition for all the fecally-derived crude DNA samples without alteration of the performance of the PCR assay. All results that have been given by the IAC-free <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> diagnostic PCR assay were identical to that obtained in the current study with IAC/target PCR assay. Therefore, Integration of IAC into the <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> diagnostic PCR assay added more assurance to the previous results.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank
