self-mobilization on chest expansion and pulmonary function in healthy adults. [Subjects]
Nineteen healthy adults were randomly allocated to either an intervention group (n = 8) or
a control group (n = 11). [Methods] Subjects in the intervention group performed
self-mobilization of the thoracic region 3 times per week for 6 weeks (18 sessions). The
outcome measures included chest expansion when breathing, pulmonary function, and
predicted pulmonary function. [Results] There was a significant difference in chest
expansion between the intervention group and the control group. However, there was no
significant difference in pulmonary function between the intervention group and the
control group. [Conclusion] Thoracic region self-mobilization may be beneficial for
increasing chest expansion in healthy adults.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Thoracic self-mobilization</kwd><kwd>Chest expansion</kwd><kwd>Pulmonary function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In modern society, the incidence of cervical lordosis and thoracic and lumbar kyphosis is
increasing, because many people maintain a fixed posture for long periods and number of aged
people is increasing. An increase in thoracic kyphosis causes restrictions in chest
expansion and respiratory muscle weakness, thereby reducing lung capacity and the thoracic
cavity size and deforming vertebral column alignment<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Previous studies have investigated the use of thoracic joint mobilization and thoracic
flexibility exercises to improve deformations of the chest and vertebrae and thereby enhance
pulmonary function<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. These interventions enhanced pulmonary function and thoracic
mobility and improved respiratory muscle function, chest expansion, and diaphragm movement
by reducing the stiffness of the inter-vertebral discs and surrounding tissues and by
improving vertebral extensor muscle stretch and endurance with thoracic flexibility
exercises<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As reported in previous studies, chest mobilization exercises and stretching exercises
increase thoracic vertebral mobility, chest expansion, and lung capacity. However, these
exercises required firsthand therapeutic application by therapists and cannot be easily
performed by the subjects in a non-clinical environment<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therefore, the present study examined self-mobilization of thoracic vertebrae in healthy
adults and investigated the effect of these exercises on pulmonary function and chest
expansion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 19 healthy adults who understood the purpose of the study
and provided written consent to participate. Those diagnosed with neurological findings and
had undergone operations, or were receiving surgical treatment, or taking medicines on a
regular basis to relieve pain, were excluded from the study. The study was approved by the
Ethics Committee of the Catholic University of Pusan and adhered to the tenets of the
Declaration of Helsinki (1975, revised 1983). The subjects were assigned to one of two
groups, the thoracic region self-mobilization group (TSMG; 2 males and 6 females) or the
control group (CG; 5 males and 6 females). None of the subjects showed restrictive pulmonary
disease or obstructive pulmonary disease, as determined by a spirometer pretest. Age,
height, and weight were 22.50 &#x000b1; 1.06&#x02005;years, 164.25 &#x000b1; 10.60&#x02005;cm, and 60.12 &#x000b1; 13.35&#x02005;kg,
respectively in the TSMG, and were 22.36 &#x000b1; 3.26&#x02005;years, 165.50 &#x000b1; 7.37&#x02005;cm, and 65.09 &#x000b1;
14.90&#x02005;kg, respectively in the CG.</p><p>To measure chest expansion when breathing, the subject&#x02019;s chest wall was measured with a
tapeline in an upright sitting position. Chest expansion was calculated using the difference
in chest wall circumference during the state of maximal expiration and maximal
inspiration<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. A spirometer (Pony Fx, COSMED, Italy) was used to measure pulmonary
function. Using a maximal-effort expiratory spirogram, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced
expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1,</sub>), FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC, peak expiratory
flow (PEF), and predicted pulmonary function (pred FVC, pred FEV<sub>1</sub>, pred
FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC, pred PEF) were measured while the subjects were in an upright
position<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Thoracic region self-mobilization exercise was performed by the intervention group using a
method modified and a self-mobilization tool from previous studies for 20 minutes, three
times per week for 6 weeks<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. If a
participant felt pain or inconvenience, the self-mobilization tool was moved toward the
transverse process of the spine or the rib, and the exercise was performed again<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Before the experiment, the participants
were requested to practice 2&#x02013;3 times to become familiar with the exercise<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Results are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD). Data were analyzed using SPSS for
Windows (ver.18.0). Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare differences between the
two groups (TSMG and CG). The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the two groups at the
significance level of (&#x003b1;) = 0.05. A p value of &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Chest expansion (axillary, sternum, low costal region) measurement results are summarized

by reduced thoracic vertebral mobility and structural changes in the thoracic and lumbar
angles<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although many interventions have been applied in previous studies
to address these issues, those interventions have shortcomings because they require
firsthand application by therapists<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the present study aimed to
verify whether active thoracic vertebrae self-mobilization methods are sufficient<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> and to investigate changes in chest
expansion and pulmonary function caused by thoracic region self-mobilization.</p><p>Although engaging in thoracic joint mobilization and self-stretching exercise for 6 weeks
improved pulmonary function in a previous study<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, another study showed no improvement in pulmonary function after
chest region respiratory muscle stretching exercise for 4 weeks<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the argument that interventions applied to the
thoracic region are involved in pulmonary function improvement is controversial. In the
present study, no significant change in pulmonary function was observed. This may be
attributable to the fact that the intervention was applied to healthy subjects, who were
relatively less affected by the intervention. However, the intervention applied in the
present study resulted in larger increases in axillary region and sternum region
measurements, than in previous studies in which respiratory muscle stretch gymnastics were
applied<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Interestingly, previous studies have reported that changes in low costal region
measurements were relatively larger than changes in axillary region and sternum region
measurements when thoracic flexibility exercise was applied. Conversely, changes in lower
costal region measurements were not significantly larger in the present study<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
These results may be attributable to the fact that although thoracic region
self-mobilization directly affected ribs 1&#x02013;10, which are directly connected to the thoracic
vertebrae or to the cartilage, it could not directly affect ribs 11 and 12. The control
group showed a statistically significant decrease in low costal region measurements
post-test. Thus, it could be indirectly concluded that if thoracic vertebrae are not
mobilized, chest region muscle stiffness persists and the mobility of the muscles around the
chest wall declines owing to over activation of the muscle spindles, potentially leading to
respiratory disorders<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, thoracic region self-mobilization is an easy
intervention that can be self-applied by patients with low chest mobility in order to
improve expansion capability of the entire chest region.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Hwangbo</surname><given-names>PN</given-names></name><name><surname>Hwangbo</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>The effect of thoracic joint mobilization and
