Polygenic heredity is considered to be its cause; in addition male, hormone testosterone plays a major role. Hormone binds to androgenic receptor on hair follicle leading to early entry to telogen phase and inducing hair fall.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] PRP is rich in many growth factors and proteins. It is very rich in PDGF, epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and various pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-8, IL-13, IL-17, tumour necrosis factor alpha and interferon alpha.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] These growth factors may induce an internal signal-transduction pathway, unlocking the expression of a normal gene sequence of a cell thereby initiating and improving tissue regeneration process.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Data present in this manuscript clearly suggests that PRP treatment during the hair transplant plays a significant role in hair re-growth, and it remarkably improves density and quality of hair growth. As shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, all patients in PRP-treated group had more than 75% follicle growth whereas in non-PRP treated group only 20% of the patient showed more than 75% follicle growth. The catagen loss in transplanted hair reduced significantly at 1 month interval though there was a delayed fall but not as severe as in non-PRP group.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The fall was noticed as breakage of hair strand just above skin surface rather than actual shedding of transplanted hair in these cases. This can be explained by the effect of growth factors on the newly transplanted hair. Furthermore, the new growth of follicles was noticed as early as 2 months in video microscopic images [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>]. In contrast in the study by Uebel <italic>et al</italic>., new anagen hair started after 4 months of transplant. Only the length of newly growing follicles was studied in video microscopic images, so maximum length attained may not be commented upon. Since most of the clients that showed more than 10 mm length, even the trailing anagen hair got activated at around 4&#x02013;5 months to sport a length of 10 mm or more. On the other hand in non-PRP group, 65% (No. 13) clients showed the length of follicles 6&#x02013;10 mm at 6 months meaning most of these trailing follicles entered anagen phase more recently [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. The difference could be attributed to injected PRP therapy in our study compared to submersion of grafts in PRP in the above-mentioned study. The injected therapy could be better as there is less wastage, added benefit of faster recovery of skin, activity of dormant follicles and faster entry into the new anagen hair. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref> shows video microscope image at 2 months showing new anagen hair in centre and activity of dormant follicles in the periphery. It may be inferred that spontaneous apoptosis of 15&#x02013;30% hairs mentioned by Uebel <italic>et al</italic>. can be reduced by injected PRP significantly with PRP induced new vessel formation and effect of growth factors on stem cells of bulge region and mesenchymal cells in dermal papillae. The combination of growth factors plays pivotal role in tissue repair, and regeneration and presence of plasma proteins act as a scaffold in epithelial migration. The effect may result into anagen hair growth as early as 2 months.</p><fig id="F10" position="float"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p>Digital microscopic image showing new anagen hair at 2 months post transplant</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCAS-9-157-g012"/></fig><p>The quality of hair was better in PRP-treated group as compared to non-PRP group. In PRP group, multiple erupting roots from the graft as early as 3 months besides lengthier shafts clearly suggest the role of growth factors in PRP in stimulating as well as nourishing transplanted follicular unit grafts [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>]. However, we did not compare the exact diameter in the two groups, which is a limitation in this study.</p><p>PRP is the source of various growth and regulatory factors involved in cells growth and differentiation.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] PRP not only induces growth but also improves cell survival by its anti-apoptotic activity. Activated PRP stimulates growth and differentiation of stem cells in hair follicle bulge along with activation of mesenchymal cells in dermal papilla. It stimulates transcriptional activity of b-catenin responsible for differentiation of stems cells to hair follicle cells. PRP is reported to stimulate Bcl-2 regulatory protein levels, which possess anti-apoptotic activity and prolongs survival of derma papilla cells.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] This effect was clearly observed <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> study by Rinaldi <italic>et al</italic>. where they observed prolongation of the anagen and shortening of the catagen and telogen phase due to the effect of PRP released growth factors.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] PRP is also reported to activate AKT and ERK signalling pathways to protective dermal papilla cells from apoptosis. PRP up-regulates FGF-7 growth factors, which are known to stimulate hair growth.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] VEGFs and platelet-derived growth factors contribute in increasing peri-follicular vasculature thus, improving the blood supply and nourishment to the transplanted grafts.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] This was also evident in our 1-month results where redness was more marked in PRP group due to new vessel formation but after 3 months, most of the patients had recovered from scalp redness whereas in non-PRP group 30% of the patient still reported scalp redness [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Figure 11</xref>]. PRP has already been reported to augment tissue repair and regeneration process. Activity in dormant hair follicles was significantly high in PRP group which can again be explained by normalisation of scalp milieu with reduced fibrosis and neovascularisation secondary to the action of FGF and VEGF, which facilitated significantly higher activity in PRP group.</p><fig id="F11" position="float"><label>Figure 11</label><caption><p>Digital microscopic images of PRP And Non-PRP Group, evidence of persistent redness in Non-PRP Group at 3 Months Post Transplant</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCAS-9-157-g013"/></fig><p>Overall, PRP therapy improves the skin milieu of grafted area by cell growth and differentiation, anti-apoptotic activity and neovascularisation making grafted area more receptive and fertile for newly transplanted hair. It also helps in providing conducive environment for dormant hair follicles leading to their activity and appearance of new anagen hair as early as 2 months.</p><p>Our study is the first reported study observing various aspects of hair transplant from follicle growth and density, catagen loss of transplanted hair, re-growth of transplanted hair, type of graft, length of shafts, activity of dormant hair follicles and post-surgical healing over a period of 6 months.</p><p>Some researchers believe that the comparison between the two groups should be on half and half side of scalp rather than on different subjects. Since this study was based on injected PRP therapy, there will be a possibility of diffusion of plasma into the control side and thus confounding the outcome. Moreover, hair transplant is an aesthetic procedure and we as clinician need to understand the implications of attaining and justifying variable densities on two sides of the scalp. Hence, in the quest of achieving better results for our future clients, whether it is justified to give aesthetically unpleasant result to present ones is again debatable!</p><p>The limitation in the study is that exact hair count is not performed as can be done with more sophisticated equipment like cross-sectional trichogram, though we have taken serial video microscopic images. Future studies may be directed to achieve more objective evidence using these equipment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study clearly demonstrated impact of PRP treatment during and after hair transplant and its beneficial effect on quantity and quality of hair re-growth.
