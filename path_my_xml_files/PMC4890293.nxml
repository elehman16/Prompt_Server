Outcomes were assessed by parent report and direct observation at baseline (0&#x000a0;weeks), post-intervention (12&#x000a0;weeks) and follow-up (32&#x000a0;weeks). Primary outcomes were parent verbal responsivity and home activities with child at 32&#x000a0;weeks. Secondary outcomes included parenting confidence, parent wellbeing and children&#x02019;s communication, socio-emotional and general development skills.

Impoverished early life home environments are associated with a range of poorer developmental outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Large-scale community interventions to improve the quality of young children&#x02019;s home learning environments have seldom been rigorously evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This paper describes a large community-based effectiveness study designed to address this gap. The study comprises two cluster randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one for infants and one for toddlers. The trials are conducted in parallel and evaluate the effects on home learning environment of a brief group parenting intervention for disadvantaged families. The intervention has been designed for future use in early childhood services, and the study additionally seeks to address implementation questions regarding the optimal timing and amount of individual support required for change.</p><p>Twenty-three percent of Australian children lack key early learning skills when they commence school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Socioeconomic disparities in learning and development are evident from birth and persist across childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. To narrow these gaps, programs are needed that successfully engage disadvantaged families and are effective in changing the modifiable mechanisms that underpin socioeconomic differences. As described below, the daily interactions that occur between parents and children are one such mechanism.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Parenting and the home learning environment</title><p>A home environment rich in language and age-appropriate stimulating play activities has a strong positive impact on children&#x02019;s development in early childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Responsive interactions characterised by parental sensitivity, warmth and cognitive stimulation promote neurological development and the acquisition of cognitive and language skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Parenting sensitivity refers to parents&#x02019; attunement to their child&#x02019;s cues, emotions, interests, and capabilities in ways that balance the child&#x02019;s need for support with the need for autonomy. Parenting warmth refers to parents&#x02019; expressions of affection and respect toward their children supporting skills for learning such as mastery, security, autonomy, and self-efficacy. Cognitive stimulation refers to parental efforts to enrich their children&#x02019;s cognitive and language development through language-rich interactions and activities that promote learning.</p><p>Early childhood parent&#x02013;child interactions have been shown to mediate the effects of family socioeconomic disadvantage on developmental outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].

Supporting high-quality parenting may therefore be an effective way to mitigate the developmental risks faced by young children from disadvantaged families.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Early childhood parenting interventions for disadvantaged families</title><p>Parenting interventions can be effective in supporting parents to provide a rich home learning environment for their young children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Intensive home visiting interventions have shown variable degrees of success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], with greater improvements reported for high fidelity programs involving frequent visits by professionally-qualified staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. These approaches have limited potential for large scale provision, as they are costly to deliver and have reported difficulties engaging and retaining families over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>While there is a clear need for interventions that can be provided on a wider scale, only a few studies have examined the efficacy of brief programs addressing the quality of the home learning environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Two studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] found that a structured home-based curriculum was associated with increases in responsive parenting behaviours, greater use of home learning strategies and improved infant social and cognitive skills 3 to 6&#x000a0;months post intervention. Home-based approaches are costly to provide and it is unknown whether similar effects could be obtained via community-based group programs. It is possible that brief home-based intervention provided as an add-on to group programs may enhance potential outcomes through the reinforcement of program content and provision of additional individual support and appropriate referral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], but this has yet to be evaluated using an appropriate controlled design.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The current study</title><p>In Australia, no large-scale experimental studies have evaluated the effectiveness of brief parenting interventions that seek to enrich the early home learning environment of children from disadvantaged families. The current research was commissioned by the State Government of Victoria to address this research gap. The goal was to conduct a large-scale effectiveness study to determine whether a brief group parenting intervention (the <italic>smalltalk</italic> program) delivered within existing community services could improve the capacity of parents experiencing social and economic disadvantage to provide a rich home learning environment to their young children. This presented a unique opportunity to embed a major service development initiative within a rigorous scientific framework and to build knowledge that would guide future early childhood policy and services.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Development of the <italic>Smalltalk</italic> programs</title><p>The <italic>smalltalk</italic> programs were designed for delivery within the existing structures and human resources of the Australian early childhood sector. Five pragmatic and scientific criteria guided program design: evidence-informed intervention strategies; developmental appropriateness; content able to be delivered reliably and proficiently by early childhood workers; compatibility with existing services; and capacity to provide additional individualised support. The first two of these criteria are described next.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Developmentally appropriate, evidence-informed content</title><p><italic>Smalltalk</italic> employed active skills training to increase parent behaviours that would promote children&#x02019;s development of language and communication skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Targeted parent behaviours (quality parent&#x02013;child interactions and provision of a stimulating home learning environment) are defined in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. To support the maintenance of these behaviours, information was provided about self-care, having confidence in one&#x02019;s parenting skills and building connections with other parents and relevant services.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

<italic>Key Parenting Strategies (active skills training in-session and exemplified in DVDs)</italic>
</td></tr><tr><td>1. Quality parent&#x02013;child interactions: Responsive interactions characterised by parental sensitivity, warmth and cognitive stimulation</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;Tuning in: refers to moments when the parent is fully focussed on what the child is doing, saying and possibly feeling. This creates the opportunity for the parent to be sensitive and responsive to the child&#x02019;s needs.</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;Following the child&#x02019;s lead: involves paying attention to and building on the child&#x02019;s interests. This provides opportunities for teachable moments</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;Listening and talking more: involves increasing exposure to language (both the frequency and variety of words) in a way that promotes &#x02018;conversation&#x02019; (e.g., interactive turn-taking that involves both listening and talking). This is a powerful driver of language development from a very young age.</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;Using teachable moments: involve capitalising on everyday opportunities for learning. Children are most open to learning when they are interested in something. A teachable moment arises when a parent encourages a child to extend their knowledge or experience of something with simple comments and questions (e.g., &#x0201c;Yes, it&#x02019;s a car &#x02013; what colour is that car?&#x0201d;).</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;Being warm and gentle: relates to the tone or quality of the interaction. The expression of affection and acceptance strengthens the relationship between parent and child and has powerful effects on child development and wellbeing.</td></tr><tr><td>2. Stimulating home learning environment: An environment rich in language and age-appropriate play activities</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;Shared reading: a dialogic (shared) approach to reading that is interactional and relationship-building and promotes the use of both book and non-book literacy resources. Where parents have low literacy themselves, they are encouraged to &#x02018;tell a story&#x02019; based on the pictures.</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;Learning through everyday routines: predictable, positive daily routines that help children feel secure and provide a daily &#x02018;infrastructure&#x02019; for parent&#x02013;child interactions that promote learning and development (e.g., a bedtime routine that involves reading to children).</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;Supporting children&#x02019;s play: provision of developmentally appropriate play objects and activities essential for child development. Emphasis is given to the use of inexpensive, safe household objects that make excellent toys for learning.</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;Using community resources: involves introducing parents to activities and resources in the community such as libraries and toy libraries.</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;Monitoring use of media: emphasis is given to choosing age appropriate programs and limiting exposure to advertising and &#x02018;background&#x02019; television (e.g., television that is on in the background, which interrupts and distracts children from their activities).</td></tr><tr><td>Supporting Information Provided on strategies to build parents&#x02019;:</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;Personal agency: building confidence, efficacy and reflective practice around parenting<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;Self-care: enhancing/maintaining wellbeing, accessing practical, emotional &#x00026; informational support, stress management<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;Community connectedness: increasing parental awareness of and ability to access needed services, being supported by and involved with their community</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>Children&#x02019;s developmental skills undergo considerable, rapid development across the first 3&#x000a0;years of life. Approaches for promoting, reinforcing and extending these skills change accordingly. Two versions of the <italic>smalltalk</italic> program were developed: one for parents of infants (6&#x02013;12 months) and one for parents of toddlers (aged 12&#x02013;36 months). Key intervention strategies remained consistent across the two formats but different age-appropriate examples were used.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>The service context</title><p>Government-funded programs in the state of Victoria are provided free and universally to disadvantaged families with young children through two key community services&#x02014;the maternal and child health service and facilitated playgroups. Both services have a policy focus on the enhancement of early child development and offer group programs to parents. Program delivery is coordinated by local government authorities (i.e. councils), either directly or in partnership with community organisations. The maternal and child health service has its highest rates of participation by parents of infants, declining after 12&#x000a0;months of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Facilitated playgroups are designed to enhance toddlers&#x02019; skills through structured play activities and to support parents in their parenting role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>Session timing and the methods of instruction employed in the <italic>smalltalk</italic> groups were tailored to these contexts and the skills of existing staff. For the parents of infants, the intervention was structured as a weekly parent education group, established for the purpose of delivering the <italic>smalltalk</italic> content. For the parents of toddlers, <italic>smalltalk</italic> content was delivered via incidental teaching methods within weekly playgroup sessions structured around play activities.</p><p>An additional home-based component was developed (<italic>&#x02018;smalltalk plus&#x02019;</italic>) to address concerns that parents facing multiple sources of socio-economic disadvantage may struggle to achieve and maintain behaviour change in the absence of individualised support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. It comprised a DVD-based intervention delivered in a series of home visits by a coach as an adjunct to group participation. The narrated DVD provided video modelling of strategies discussed in the group sessions. The DVD prompted the coach to guide the parent through practicing each strategy and to videotape the practice for review and goal setting.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Aims and hypotheses</title><p>The aim of this study was to conduct two parallel cluster RCTs to evaluate the effectiveness of the <italic>smalltalk</italic> and <italic>smalltalk plus</italic> programs with parents from economically and socially disadvantaged circumstances. The RCTs were conducted with parents of infants aged 6 to 12&#x000a0;months and toddlers aged 12 to 36&#x000a0;months respectively. The <italic>smalltalk</italic> programs sought to: (i) improve the quality of parent&#x02013;child interactions and the home learning environment (primary outcomes, parent focussed) (ii) improve parenting confidence, parents&#x02019; wellbeing and community connectedness (secondary outcomes, parent focussed); and consequently (iii) improve children&#x02019;s early communication, socio-emotional and general developmental skills (secondary outcomes, child focussed).</p><p>We hypothesised that in both the infant and toddler trials, families who received the <italic>smalltalk group only</italic> and <italic>smalltalk plus</italic> interventions would show greater improvements in primary outcomes (parent verbal responsivity, home activities with the child at 32-week assessment) and secondary outcomes (parent-reported and directly observed parent&#x02013;child interactions; the home literacy environment and household disorganisation; parent wellbeing, self-efficacy and community connectedness; and directly observed and parent reported child communication skills) compared to parents who received the <italic>standard</italic> (control) program. In the absence of prior evidence regarding differential outcomes by child age, we made no hypotheses regarding differences in program effectiveness for the infant versus toddler samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods and design</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Approval and registration</title><p>Ethics approval and permission to conduct the research were obtained from the Victorian Government Department of Health Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC08/10) and the Department of Education and Early Childhood Research Committee.

The study was conceptualised as an effectiveness trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] designed to assess program outcomes as delivered under real-world conditions. It has been implemented and reported in accordance with the requirements of the CONSORT statement for cluster RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p>In each RCT, there were three trial arms (intervention conditions): standard, <italic>smalltalk group-only, smalltalk plus</italic>. Clusters were randomised to condition (1:1:1 allocation ratio), stratified by LGA. Clusters were the geographical location where group programs were to be delivered. Approximately six locations were randomised in each LGA to deliver one of the three programs: standard, <italic>smalltalk group-only,</italic> or <italic>smalltalk plus</italic> programs. Parents were allocated to the location nearest to their residential address and received the intervention delivered by that location.

As part of their service agreements, each of the participating LGAs (10 providing infant programs and 10 providing toddler programs) were funded to recruit and provide programs to 100 parent&#x02013;child dyads. LGAs were also funded to appoint a site coordinator to oversee recruitment, staff employment, service delivery and reporting.</p><p>Twenty LGAs were recruited in metropolitan and rural areas as follows. All 79 LGAs in the state of Victoria were informed about the study through a letter of introduction to Chief Executive Officers, followed by briefings in each administrative region. Meetings with service managers were held as requested, and interested LGAs were invited to apply to participate. Applications were accepted from LGAs that met the following criteria: evidence from administrative data of significant levels of socioeconomic disadvantage in the community; prior successful collaboration with external agencies; willingness to adhere to the design and reporting requirements of the research trial; and experience and capacity to deliver parent groups or facilitated playgroups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Allocation</title><p>Cluster randomisation of locations was chosen to reduce the potential for cross-condition contamination arising from parents gaining exposure to another condition through others in their immediate community. Additionally, staff were only trained in one of the three program conditions.</p><p>Allocation of locations was stratified by LGA using block randomisation with a fixed block size of 3. Locations were allocated in the order that they were consented, in blocks of 3 to maintain blinding during the recruitment of locations. Randomisation was performed by a biostatistician (OU) who was unaware of the identities of the locations and played no role in the recruitment of locations or parents. Researchers involved in parent recruitment and baseline assessment were blind to the trial arm status of the locations, thus, allocation concealment was ensured.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Intervention delivery</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Smalltalk program development and content</title><p>Program content, methods of delivery and staff training were developed through extensive consultation and a co-production process. In 2010, two one-day forums were conducted with practitioners and service managers to seek input on program content, strategies for engaging disadvantaged families and potential logistic issues. From April to September 2010, members of the research team attended weekly sessions of two existing facilitated playgroups and undertook home visits with a subgroup of families. Parents were asked for feedback on the program content, with particular attention to the way the ideas were expressed, the language used and examples given. Facilitators provided feedback on program content, how it could be used, and the training and resources needed.

Thirteen percent were single parents and 14&#x000a0;% were born outside Australia. Parents in the toddler RCT were also mostly biological mothers (96&#x000a0;%), with a mean age of 33&#x000a0;years. Eleven percent were single parents and one-third (32&#x000a0;%) were born outside Australia. Across the two RCTs, very few participating parents or children identified as Indigenous (1 and 2&#x000a0;% respectively). Around 5&#x000a0;% came from households where there was no parent in paid employment, and around 20&#x000a0;% had a very low income or received their main income from government benefits. As shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> there was no evidence of baseline differences in the characteristics of parents by group allocation.</p><p>The study was successful in recruiting families experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage. At baseline, 84&#x000a0;% of participating families displayed one or more of the following risk factors for poor child development: young parent, single parent, language other than English spoken at home, low parental education, low family income, receipt of government benefits, low parenting self-efficacy, or parent psychological distress. The study was also successful in attracting families experiencing multiple challenges. Over half the families reported two or more risk factors and approximately 20&#x000a0;% reported four or more risk factors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Discussion</title><p>This cluster randomised controlled trial is the largest experimental study undertaken in Australia to improve the quality of the home learning environment during a child&#x02019;s formative years. The study seeks to determine whether a brief group parenting intervention can assist parents from socially and economically disadvantaged circumstances to enhance the home learning environment of their 6&#x02013;36 month old children. By concurrently undertaking two independent cluster RCTs, the study will provide new information regarding the relative effectiveness of intervening during infancy compared to the toddler years.</p><p>This study will also provide insight into the relative benefits of adding an individualised, highly structured home-based component to the group intervention. Only one study to our knowledge has examined a home-based addition to a group parenting intervention involving 10 home-based sessions delivered by a trained therapist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In a non-controlled pre-post design, Lees and Fergusson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] reported acceptable recruitment and retention with improved parent and child outcomes. The current study employs a home visiting component that is feasible within the Australian early childhood sector and will provide the first rigorous evidence internationally of the extent to which benefits for this approach exceed those achieved by the group program alone.</p><p>The way the intervention was developed and the conduct of the research trial within existing community services, addresses a number of the concerns that are directed at traditional efficacy studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In particular, it was designed to ensure the trial service delivery conditions were a good match to how the programs would be used in the future. Locally-based services received program funding based on enrolments and were responsible for parent recruitment, staff employment and program scheduling. This ensures that the resulting trial data are relevant to the state government funders and community service providers. Co-production and extensive consultation during program development, further aimed to enhance future uptake of the programs by ensuring end-user acceptability and maximising the sense of program ownership. Early indicators suggest that the program has been successful in attracting families from the target population.</p><p>In seeking to design and implement a study that has strong external validity, we have not ignored internal validity and data quality. Strengths of the design include: the collection of observational data in addition to parent self-report; collection of detailed process data to guide future refinements; the use of attention-matched control conditions that reflected the programs currently offered; and the use of a cluster design to minimise cross-condition contamination. A possible weakness is the absence of a fourth trial arm that evaluates the effectiveness of the home-coaching component alone. Home coaching alone was considered unlikely for future implementation. Group-based programs are more efficient to deliver and building social connections was an important policy goal. The results of this trial will provide valuable data of international relevance on a novel approach to enhancing the home learning environment for young children from disadvantaged circumstances, whilst providing practical information to service providers in Australia.</p><sec id="Sec26"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AUD, Australian dollars ($1AUD roughly equivalent to $0.70US); ECI, Early Communication Indicator; IPCI, Indicator of Parent&#x02013;Child Interaction; LGA, Local Government Area; RCT, randomised controlled trial</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the many Parenting Research Centre staff who made valuable contributions to this project: Jane Bennetto, Kim Campbell, Eloise Cameron, Olivia Clayton; Hilary Davis, Simon Fox, Emily Gutierrez, Laurel Johnson, Nicola Johnson, Michelle Kehoe, Tammy Kendall, Tracey Phan, Monique Seymour, Amanda Scicluna, Alvin Vista, Rona Weerasuriya and Maggie Yu.
