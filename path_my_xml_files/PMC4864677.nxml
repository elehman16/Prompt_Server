</p><p>Patients had a thorough preanesthetic check-up. Solid foods restricted for 8 h, but clear fluids allowed up to 2 h prior to surgery. Venous access achieved after local anesthesia and was premedicated with injection midazolam 0.02mg/kg and injection atropine 0.02 mg/kg. Children were brought to the operation room and preinduction monitors such as a precordial stethoscope, pulse oximeter, electrocardiogram, and noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) were attached. Children were induced with injection ketamine 2 mg/kg intravenous and maintained with 40% oxygen, 60% nitrous oxide, and sevoflurane at a concentration ranging from 0.5% to 2.0% using Jackson-Rees circuit on spontaneous respiration.</p><p>Patients who received caudal block with 1 ml/kg of bupivacaine 0.25% (limiting the dose to 2.5 mg/kg) were allocated to Group A, while patients who received a combination of rectal diclofenac suppository 2 mg/kg (corrected to 25 mg or 37.5 mg) and preincisional infiltration with 0.25% bupivacaine 0.5 ml/kg were allocated to Group B. Vital signs such as pulse rate, NIBP, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were monitored throughout. At the end of surgery, anesthetic agents were discontinued, and 100% oxygen through face mask was administered for 3&#x02013;5 min. The total duration of surgery was also recorded for comparison. Once the vital signs were stable, the child was shifted to the recovery room and placed in the recovery position. When fully awake and hemodynamically stable, children were transferred to the postoperative ward.</p><p>Postoperative pain was assessed using, modification of objective pain scale by Hannallah <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Pain was assessed 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 min, and half hourly thereafter until 8 h following surgery or until patient requires rescue analgesic. Whichever happened earlier was considered as the end point of observation. At the score &#x02265;3 rescue analgesic oral paracetamol 15 mg/kg was given. Time of requirement of first rescue analgesic was also noted.

There are arguments re-evaluating its role and indications. Herniotomy requires a block up to T12 or higher, requiring a larger dose of local anesthetic (1 ml/kg) for a reliable block. The required dermatomes are blocked last and recover first as the block regresses, providing a relatively short period of analgesia at the surgical site. Most herniotomies are done as day care procedures, so leg weakness can be a problem in older children unless a lower concentration of the solution is used. Another less invasive analgesic technique in pediatric herniotomy is local infiltration of the surgical site with 0.25% bupivacaine along with simultaneous insertion of diclofinac rectal suppository. This technique need only lower dose of bupivaine compared to caudal anesthesia. Furthermore, easier to perform, faster acting, and consumes less time. Hence, this technique makes more sense. We compared the duration of analgesia between the two techniques, i.e., the combination of local wound infiltration with 0.25% bupivacaine and diclofenac suppository (Group A) to caudal block with 0.25% bupivacaine (Group B).</p><p>The mean duration of analgesia in Groups A and B were 228.5 and 331.0 min, respectively. Indicating the analgesic duration was significantly longer in Group B, who received local infiltration and diclofenac suppository.</p><p>Moores <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] compared the effects of rectal diclofenac with 0.25% bupivacaine administered caudally for postoperative analgesia in pediatric inguinal herniotomy. Forty-three children were assigned randomly to receive either 1 ml/kg caudal bupivacaine 0.25% or rectal diclofenac 0.25 mg/kg intraoperatively to provide postoperative analgesia. They found that caudal bupivacaine although provided more pain-free patients at first; later the incidence of pain was similar in both groups and concluded that rectal diclofenac is a useful alternative to caudal blockade in this group of patients. In our study, none of the patients presented with pain in the early postoperative period, i.e. up to 180 min postoperatively. This may be because of the additional local infiltration of bupivacaine received by those in the diclofenac group.</p><p>Seyed <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] compared the analgesic effects of an acetaminophen (NSAID) suppository, bupivacaine wound infiltration, and caudal block with bupivacaine on postoperative pain in pediatric inguinal herniorrhaphy and observed that in children, bupivacaine infiltration group and the group who received caudal bupivacaine produce better analgesia than the third group who received suppository acetaminophen. They concluded that bupivacaine infiltration is better than a caudal block because of its simplicity, lower incidence of complications, and reduced failure rates.</p><p>William and Splinter, Juan Bass, Lydia Komocar, <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] compared the analgesic efficacy, adverse effects and the cost associated with supplementation of local infiltration with either intravenous ketorolac or caudal analgesia in children having an inguinal hernia repair. They concluded that, supplementation of intraoperatively administered local anesthesia with ketorolac results in a small improvement in pain, a lower incidence in vomiting and a more notable decrease in the time to micturition than a caudal block. These findings are consistent with our present study. However, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug used here was intravenous ketorolac instead of diclofenac suppository.</p><p>Machotta <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] compared between instillation of bupivacaine versus caudal analgesia for postoperative analgesia following inguinal herniotomy in children. They concluded that instillation of Bupivacaine into a wound provides postoperative pain relief following hernia repair, which is as effective as that provided by a postoperative caudal block. In our study, there was better analgesia in local infiltration group compared to caudal. This may be because we added diclofenac suppository to local infiltration group.</p><p>Bhattarai <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] in their study compared the combination of ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve blocks and wound infiltration against caudal block with 0.25% bupivacaine in children undergoing pediatric herniotomy. They observed that simplified ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve blocks described by Dalens in combination with small volume local anesthetic wound infiltration with its longer analgesia and better safety margin. These findings are consistent with the results of our study. The mean duration of analgesia in a caudal group of their study was 219.6 min and in local infiltration with block group it is 253 min. In our study, it was 228.5 and 331.0 min respectively. This extended analgesia observed in our local infiltration group may be attributed to the rectal diclofenac suppository.</p><p>Borkar and Dave[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] compared the analgesic efficacy of caudal block against diclofenac suppository with local anesthetic infiltration in children undergoing laparoscopy. They found that the analgesic efficacy of diclofenac suppository combined with local anesthetic infiltration at port sites were comparable to caudal block. Given the necessarily invasive nature of caudal block, they suggested the combined use of diclofenac suppository with local anesthetic infiltration at port sites as a useful and more economical alternative for analgesia following pediatric laparoscopy. Although these observations were for laproscopy, their conclusions are consistent with that of ours.</p><p>Gupta <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] studied postoperative analgesia in children undergoing infraumbilical surgeries. They concluded that rectal diclofenac in combination with caudal block provides good postoperative analgesia in early as well as later in the postoperative period, in comparison to caudal block alone which provides analgesia only in early postoperative period or rectal diclofenac alone which does not provide good analgesia in the early or immediate postoperative period.</p><p>Chipde <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] compared caudal bupivacaine and ropivacaine in pediatric patients who underwent urogenital surgeries under general anesthesia. Mean duration of analgesia in patients who received Bupivacaine were 276.8 min which is more compared to our study. It can be attributed to additional opioids received in this study.</p><p>Nayna <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] studied bupivacaine infiltration versus diclofenac suppository for posttonsillectomy pain relief in pediatric patients. The study compared the effect of preincisional infiltration of bupivacaine 0.25% versus diclofenac suppository on postoperative pain relief in children. They found that diclofenac suppository is a better option as compared to preincisional bupivacaine infiltration because of its convenience and efficacy equivalent to that of bupivacaine infiltration and duration of analgesia more than bupivacaine infiltration.</p><p>Ejnell <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] demonstrated in their study that diclofenac sodium is the only nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug for postoperative pain relief, which is safe to administer in its therapeutic range with least or no side effects. Our study also suggested that significant analgesic activity of diclofenac, and it was also free from major side effects.</p><p>In our study, time for first voiding of urine postoperatively was significantly prolonged in caudal group. The incidence of vomiting was also significantly more in the caudal group compared to those obtained bupivacaine local infiltration with diclofenac suppository.</p><p>Although the pain assessment tool used in our study has been employed by previous investigators,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] it may be noted that the child's cry, movement, and agitation could not be entirely attributed to pain. The dose of rectal diclofenac used has been corrected according to availability. Technical, as well as anatomical factors, can also affect the results observed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Duration of analgesia obtained from the combination of bupivacaine local infiltration with diclofenac suppository is significantly longer than the duration of analgesia obtained from the caudal epidural block with bupivacaine. Hence, a less invasive, less time consuming and comparatively easier method of analgesia provided by diclofenac suppository and local infiltration of bupivacaine can be a better alternative to caudal bupivacaine for pediatric herniotomy.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no
