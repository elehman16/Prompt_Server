We aimed to investigate whether 12 months of exercise training in patients with both T2DM and coronary artery disease (CAD) reduced the genetic expression of the proinflammatory markers fractalkine (CX3CL1) and its receptor (CX3CR1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in the subcutaneous adipose tissue. Expression of the genes in the circulating leukocytes and circulating levels of the markers were also investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and methods</title><p>A total of 137 patients with T2DM and CAD were included to study the effects of exercise on atherosclerosis progression and glucose control. Patients were randomized to exercise training (combined aerobic and strength training) or control. At inclusion and after 12 months, fasting blood samples and a subcutaneous adipose tissue sample were taken. RNA was extracted from the adipose tissue and circulating leukocytes, and the expression levels were examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Circulating fractalkine and MCP-1 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The analyses were performed in 114 patients who completed the study and adhered to the intervention principle. At baseline, gene expression of fractalkine and CX3CR1 in the adipose tissue was similar in the two groups. There were no change within either group and no between-group differences in changes from baseline. Circulating fractalkine increased after 12 months in the exercise group (<italic>P</italic>=0.044), significantly more compared to controls (<italic>P</italic>=0.042), however only in the patients with advanced vascular disease. Neither the expression levels of MCP-1 nor the circulating levels changed significantly in either group. At baseline, CX3CR1 expression in the adipose tissue was associated with body mass index (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>No significant effects of long-term exercise training on adipose tissue expression of fractalkine, CX3CR1, or MCP-1 were found in our patients with combined CAD and T2DM. However, a slight increase in circulating fractalkine after the intervention was recorded. The association of CX3CR1 expression with body mass index might indicate increased immune activation in the adipose tissue.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>diabetes</kwd><kwd>coronary artery disease</kwd><kwd>subcutaneous adipose tissue</kwd><kwd>exercise</kwd><kwd>MCP-1</kwd><kwd>fractalkine (CX3CL1)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The adipose tissue secretes several inflammatory cytokines to the circulation, and the inflammatory activity increases with the increasing adipose tissue mass.<xref rid="b1-dmso-9-055" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The adipose tissue contains adipocytes and a stromal vascular fraction (SVF), consisting of endothelial cells, fibroblasts, leukocytes, macrophages, nerve terminals, and other cells, capable of producing inflammatory proteins, which can be secreted to the systemic circulation.

However, we could show a slight increase in the circulating levels of fractalkine after 12 months exercise compared to controls, however, only in the patients with advanced vascular disease. Whether the slight increase in the circulating levels of fractalkine in the exercise group with advanced vascular disease should be judged as a deleterious effect of exercise in these patients is obviously debatable and should be confirmed in other studies.</p><p>The gene expression of CX3CR1 in leukocytes was significantly reduced after 12 months intervention, however, not different from controls when the baseline levels were taken into account. Leukocyte MCP-1 expression did not change during the intervention.</p><p>The &#x0201c;inflammatory state&#x0201d; of the adipose tissue could be influenced by the size of the adipose depot, the content of immune cells, the diet, the fitness, the comorbidity, and the use of medication. The majority of the research on inflammation in the adipose tissue is performed in obese humans or animals. In the present study, the intervention did not change the expression levels of the measured biomarkers in the subcutaneous adipose tissue. The population was classified as overweight, but not as obese, and there might be a gradual increase in inflammation from lean to obese state. The participants had unchanged body weight after 12 months of intervention<xref rid="b18-dmso-9-055" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and a reduction in the markers after an intervention has been shown to be accompanied by weight loss by others.<xref rid="b17-dmso-9-055" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The fact that our patients have both CAD and T2DM might also influence the results as both diseases are related to inflammation. Also, the accomplished exercise levels might not have been sufficiently intense to induce a reduction in the investigated markers. The lack of improvement after the intervention might also be related to disease severity, which could be discussed along with the finding of neutral effect on circulating fractalkine levels in the group without advanced vascular disease, whereas a tendency to an increase was obtained in the group with advanced disease.</p><p>The use of medication and adherence to the intervention may also have influenced the results. Most patients included in our study were using antiplatelet therapy (94%) and statins (93%), both known to have anti-inflammatory effects.<xref rid="b24-dmso-9-055" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25-dmso-9-055" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>In a study of healthy individuals, statins were shown to reduce the circulating levels of fractalkine<xref rid="b26-dmso-9-055" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and the same was shown for high-dose atorvastatin in patients with CAD by Dam&#x000e5;s et al.<xref rid="b11-dmso-9-055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> We have previously reported that there were no significant changes in diabetes medication use during the study period.<xref rid="b18-dmso-9-055" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> However, we can only speculate that the use of medications could mask a possible beneficial additional effect of exercise training.</p><p>Both fractalkine and MCP-1 are expressed in many of the cell types that comprise the subcutaneous adipose tissue (eg, adipocytes and macrophages) and are released from both adipocytes and the SVF.<xref rid="b27-dmso-9-055" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In a previous study of human subcutaneous adipose tissue, it was shown that CX3CR1 mRNA was only present in the SVF and not in adipocytes<xref rid="b6-dmso-9-055" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>; therefore, it could be likely that the CX3CR1 determined in the present work derives from the SVF. With the method used, homogenizing the tissue for total gene expression, it cannot be disregarded that any effect on the stromal fraction may have been masked.</p><p>The correlation between CX3CR1 and BMI, which in average fit people can reflect the amount of adipose tissue, might be because the adipose tissue mass itself is larger and therefore contains more macrophages in the SVF.<xref rid="b28-dmso-9-055" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>Monocytes express relatively more CX3CR1 compared to mature macrophages; thus, our correlation between CX3CR1 and BMI could indicate a &#x0201c;younger&#x0201d; population of macrophages or a higher turnover of macrophages in the tissue.<xref rid="b29-dmso-9-055" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> It could also be discussed as a self-energizing effect of the low-grade inflammation, trying to recruit more monocytes expressing CX3CR1 into the adipose tissue.</p><p>At baseline, there was significant correlation between the gene expression levels of CX3CR1 in the adipose tissue and BMI as discussed, whereas other glucometabolic variables did not associate with the gene expression of the variables. Circulating fractalkine levels were inversely correlated with HbA1c, which is not easily explainable, but it can be discussed along with our previous finding of no increased levels of fractalkine in patients with both CAD and diabetes compared to having either diagnosis alone.<xref rid="b12-dmso-9-055" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>The lack of correlations between circulating MCP-1 and insulin and homeostatic model assessment 2 of insulin resistance score is in accordance with a previous report,<xref rid="b30-dmso-9-055" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> although in this study, patients did not have diabetes. Different from our result of no correlation between MCP-1 and BMI, another study in patients without diabetes showed a significant correlation between circulating MCP-1 levels and BMI.<xref rid="b10-dmso-9-055" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, this was in a small study of eight healthy persons with BMI classified as normal to obese, and not taking medications.</p><p>We observed no correlation between MCP-1 mRNA in circulating leukocytes and HbA1c. MCP-1 gene expression in the leukocytes showed, however, an inverse relation to BMI. This was somewhat surprising but might represent a compensatory mechanism to counteract negative inflammation.</p><p>The expression levels of the biomarkers do not seem to be reflected in the circulating protein levels as there were no significant correlations between them.</p><p>The source for the circulating markers we have chosen to study can also be discussed. In addition to the adipose tissue and leukocytes, skeletal muscle has been shown to be a source of the proteins. A secretome analysis of muscle biopsies before and after acute and chronic exercise showed increased gene expression levels of MCP-1 and fractalkine, which were reflected in the circulating levels.<xref rid="b31-dmso-9-055" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>The choice of subcutaneous adipose tissue sampling from the gluteal as opposed to the abdominal region could be discussed. It has been suggested that the gluteal adipose tissue might be considered beneficial or protective. However, we have previously shown an unbeneficial inflammatory state in the adipose tissue from the gluteal region of patients with cardiovascular disease and the metabolic syndrome.<xref rid="b2-dmso-9-055" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> It should also be emphasized that investigating the genes expressed in the adipose tissue does not necessarily reflect the tissue protein content as not all mRNA transcripts are translated to proteins.</p><p>Limitations to this study include the fact that it is a sub-study; thus, the power calculations prior to the study were not performed for the investigations of these markers, but for HbA1c-levels. In addition, the patients were well treated with regard to their diabetes with HbA1c-levels of 7.4 (6.8, 8.3)% (57 [51, 67] mmol/mol). Nevertheless, positive effects of the exercise training were observed in HbA1c of patients without complicated cardiovascular disease states.<xref rid="b18-dmso-9-055" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Also, for the purpose of readable adipose tissue samples, the number of samples is relatively small. The challenges of performing an exercise intervention in this patient group have been discussed elsewhere.<xref rid="b18-dmso-9-055" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, no significant effects of long-term exercise training on the adipose tissue expression of CX3CL1, CX3CR1, or MCP-1 were found in our population of patients with combined T2DM and CAD. A slight increase in the circulating fractalkine after the intervention was recorded, however, only in patients with advanced vascular disease. The variables, either circulating or genetically expressed, seem to be limitedly influenced by glucose control. The association between CX3CR1 and BMI might be indicative of increased immune activation in the adipose tissue.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The work was supported by
