Furthermore, blood transfusion seems to increase the risk of surgical site infection; it may increase the duration of surgery, and cause pulmonary and cerebral edema due to fluid shift and hypovolemic shock.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] In addition, allogeneic blood transfusion costs about 250 USD/blood unit.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>There are multiple pharmacologic approaches and anesthetic techniques recommended to decrease both preoperative and operative blood loss during surgery.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Recommended strategies to reduce the blood loss include autologous blood donation before operation,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] appropriate positioning of patient, abdominal muscle paralysis to minimize intra-abdominal pressure, epinephrine injection in paraspinal tissues, normovolemic hemodilution,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] controlled hypotension,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and antifibrinolytic agents. Antifibrinolytic agents have been effectively used previously in cardiac, orthopedic, and hepatic surgeries.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>The first antifibrinolytic agent was aprotinin but was finally stopped in 2007, due to its reported complications such as renal failure, myocardial infarction (MI), cerebrovascular accidents, and deaths.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Although theoretically possible, but data are lacking about the effectiveness of two other antifibrinolytic agents, tranexamic acid (TA), and epsilon-aminocaproic acid in preventing blood loss in preoperative administration.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>TA has been used in nonsurgical situations such as bleedings due to leukemia, ocular bleedings, recurrent hemoptysis and hereditary angioneurotic edema, and cardiac ischemia in recent years.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>TA (trans-4-aminomethyl-cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid) is a synthetic lysine analog and competitive inhibitor of plasminogen and plasmin. Its half-life with normal renal function is about 80 min. It acts by saturating lysine binding sites on plasminogen and detaching plasminogen of fibrin, which lead to inhibition of fibrinolysis. TA like other antifibrinolytics inhibits the photolytic effect of plasmin.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>The adverse effects of TA include headache, weakness, confusion, blurred color vision, and allergic reactions.

In this study, TA reduced intraoperative, 1<sup>st</sup> postoperative day, and total blood loss although one of the confounding factors including age, gender, number of operated levels, length of the operation, and fusion did not have statistically significant difference. This study according to the results of other similar studies and small numbers of our statistical population is considerable.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source
