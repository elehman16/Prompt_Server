In certain situations like septic shock, hip surgery, coronary disease or gastrointestinal hemorrhage, a restrictive transfusion strategy is associated with a reduction of infection and death. A transfusion strategy using a single PRBC unit has been retrospectively investigated and showed a safe reduction of PRBC consumption and costs. We therefore designed a study to prospectively demonstrate that the transfusion of a single PRBC unit is safe and not inferior to standard care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The 1versus2 trial is a randomized trial which will determine if a single-unit transfusion policy is not inferior to a double-unit transfusion policy. The primary endpoint is the incidence of severe complication (grade&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;3) defined as stroke, transient ischemic attack, acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, elevated troponin level, intensive care unit transfer, death, new pulmonary infiltrates, and transfusion-related infections during hospital stays. The secondary endpoint is the number of PRBC units transfused per patient per hospital stay. Two hundred and thirty patients will be randomized to receive a single unit or double unit every time the hemoglobin level is less than 8 g/dL. All patients admitted for induction remission chemotherapy, auto-HSCT or allo-HSCT in hematology intensive care units will be eligible for inclusion. Sample size calculation has determined that a patient population of 230 will be required to prove that the 1-unit PRBC strategy is non-inferior to the 2-unit PRBC strategy. Hemoglobin threshold for transfusion is below 8 g/dL. Estimated percentage of complication-free hospital stays is 93 %. In a non-inferiority hypothesis, the number of patients to include is 230 with a power of 90 % and an alpha risk of 5 %.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>14<bold>&#x02013;</bold>128; Clinicaltrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02461264">NCT02461264</ext-link> (registered on 3 June 2015)</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Blood transfusion</kwd><kwd>Acute leukemia</kwd><kwd>Bone marrow transplantation</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Transient anemia is a common complication of hematological malignancy treatment or following hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). Red blood cells and platelet supports remain a significant part of the treatment of patients receiving chemotherapy for acute leukemia or HSCT conditioning. Historically, two packed red blood cell (PRBC) units are transfused at once. Transfusion triggers are either prophylactic, with a hemoglobin threshold varying between 7 and 8 g/dL according to the country in question, or therapeutic in case of symptomatic anemia. In different situations, like septic shock, hip surgery, chronic coronary disease or gastrointestinal bleeding, several trials have demonstrated that a less restrictive strategy, using a lower prophylactic transfusion trigger was better than a more liberal one. This strategy significantly reduced transfusion-related infections, cardiac complications and the number of PRBC units used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In patients with induced hematological toxicities, no prospective randomized trial supports the restrictive strategy. In the context of HSCT, a randomized controlled trial comparing 2 hemoglobin thresholds as trigger for red blood cell transfusion (12 g/dL in the experimental arm and 7 g/dL in the standard arm) has been prematurely closed because of an excess of veno-occlusive disease in the experimental group supporting the restrictive strategy arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Berger et al<italic>.</italic> have demonstrated in a retrospective study that the transfusion of 1 unit instead of 2 units in hematological malignancy patients resulted in a significant reduction of about 25 % of PRBC units transfused without increasing symptomatic anemia or side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In a retrospective pilot study, we also demonstrated the feasibility of this restrictive strategy with a reduction of PRBC units transfused [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>To date, there is no high-level evidence to support the use of one-unit transfusion in hematological practice, even if a single-unit transfusion is recommended, and could be now considered as a standard of care in a number of clinical situations as in cases of chronic heart failure, in older-aged and in critically ill patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>We also need a trial with high-level evidence to reduce the number of transfusions and the cost of hospitalization. If the single-unit policy proves to be non-inferior compared to the standard of care, it would change decennials&#x02019; years of practice for a large number of patients. If it reduces the cost of hospitalization, the economic impact would be very important for the wider society.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objective</title><p>The aim of the study is to demonstrate, in a prospective non-inferiority randomized study in a selective population of patients receiving chemotherapy in an intensive hematological unit, that a strategy using a single-unit transfusion is non-inferior to a two-unit transfusion in terms of severe complications and also leads to a cost reduction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p>This is a prospective, multicenter, two-arm randomized study.

Several meta-analysis have been performed in the context of hemorrhagic syndrome, surgery, coronary syndrome, and septic shock. These studies demonstrated that a restrictive transfusion strategy was associated with a reduction of the number of PRBC transfused, as compared to a liberal strategy. This restrictive transfusion strategy was not inferior to the liberal one in terms of mortality, overall morbidity and myocardial infarction. In hematological malignancies, one pilot prospective randomized trial and one retrospective study have compared bleeding events and the number of blood units used with liberal (trigger 12 g/dL) and restrictive ones (8 g/dL). These studies evidenced a reduction of PRBC units transfused in the restrictive arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Another way to reduce transfusion side effects and the number of transfusions is to reduce the number of RBP transfused at each transfusion in patients with a potential hematological recovery. The single-unit transfusion strategy is not suitable for patients with chronic anemia due to bone marrow failure or myelodysplastic syndrome without therapy. In a retrospective study, Berger et al. demonstrated a 25 % PRBC unit reduction with a substantial cost saving in the intensive care hematology area with a single-unit transfusion strategy compared to historical two units per transfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, no prospective randomized trials have ever been conducted to compare these two strategies (single-unit versus double-unit transfusion), based on the volume transfused rather than on a hemoglobin level trigger. Another question that arises is the duration of the lower hemoglobin level experienced by the group receiving a single PRBC unit. Here, one can argue that patients may experience greater fatigue in this group with a consequent negative impact on quality of life. Therefore, among secondary endpoints of the study, quality of life will be assessed to compare fatigue between the two arms. The aim of this study is to provide a high level of evidence as to whether a single-unit transfusion in patients with transient bone marrow failure is feasible, safe and reduces patient care costs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Trial status</title><p>Enrollment will start in September 2015 and is expected to be completed in September 2017.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CMV</term><def><p>cytomegalovirus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GMP</term><def><p>Good Manufacturing practice</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQ-5D</term><def><p>EuroQol 5 dimensions</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HAS</term><def><p>Haute Autorit&#x000e9; de Sant&#x000e9;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FACT</term><def><p>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HSCT</term><def><p>hematopoietic stem cell transplantation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PRBC</term><def><p>packed red blood cells</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QALY</term><def><p>quality-adjusted life year</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QLC30</term><def><p>Quality of Life in Cancer Patients-30</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>'The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>SPC and OR conceived the study and participated in its design and coordination and helped to draft the manuscript.
