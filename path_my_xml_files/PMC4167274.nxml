At three participating clinics, 60 patients at least 6 months after stroke onset will be randomly allocated to an experimental virtual reality group (EG) or to a control group that will receive conventional physiotherapy or occupational therapy (16 sessions, 45 minutes each, over the course of 4 weeks). Using custom data gloves, patients&#x02019; finger and arm movements will be displayed in real time on a monitor, and they will move and manipulate objects in various virtual environments. A blinded assessor will test patients&#x02019; motor and cognitive performance twice before, once during, and twice after the 4-week intervention. The primary outcome measure is the Box and Block Test. Secondary outcome measures are the Chedoke-McMaster Stroke Assessments (hand, arm and shoulder pain subscales), the Chedoke-McMaster Arm and Hand Activity Inventory, the Line Bisection Test, the Stroke Impact Scale, the MiniMentalState Examination and the Extended Barthel Index. Semistructured face-to-face interviews will be conducted with patients in the EG after intervention finalization with a focus on the patients&#x02019; expectations and experiences regarding the virtual reality training.

In recent years, VR has been introduced into neurorehabilitation with the intention of improving upper-limb training options and facilitating motor function recovery. <italic>Virtual reality</italic> is defined as the &#x02018;use of interactive simulations created with computer hardware and software to present users with opportunities to engage in environments that appear and feel similar to real-world objects and events&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>So far, few studies have evaluated the efficacy of VR training in chronic stroke rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In 2011, Laver <italic>et al</italic>. analysed 19 randomised controlled trials in their systematic literature review, which included only seven RCTs that focused on upper-limb motor function recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A meta-analysis of five trials revealed a moderate effect (Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.53) of VR compared to conventional therapy. However, six different commercial or customised VR training systems were used in the analysed trials. No conclusion could be reached regarding the effect of VR training on grip strength. Furthermore, no recommendations could be suggested regarding dosage, type or programme of the VR training.</p><p>Over the past few decades, VR technology and its applications have changed. Besides its potential to trigger external stimulation, it is hypothesized that VR induces use-dependent plastic changes in response to internal stimulation of higher motor cortical areas that recruit the motor memory system, which consists of stored motor programs. This so-called VR-based interactive cognitive intervention is based on the idea that stimulation of the action-processing system in turn activates downstream cortical areas involved in movement execution. There a population of neurons&#x02014;&#x02018;mirror neurons&#x02019;&#x02014;is purported to play a key role, as these neurons discharge during both action execution and action observation or imagery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. With the recruitment of a widespread movement network normally involved in movement execution, VR-based cognitive therapy offers a potential to specifically promote and/or enhance functional movement recovery. You <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated important neuroplasticity changes in the primary sensorimotor cortex after VR training in stroke patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The observed changes were associated with improved locomotion.</p><p>Other researchers have shown mirror-like visuomotor activity in the posterior parietal lobe in humans during object-related hand actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Because task-oriented rehabilitation is known to be beneficial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], this finding suggests that VR-based cognitive therapy may induce cortical plasticity and promote recovery by using goal-directed arm- and hand movements.</p><p>It is hypothesized that a system combining two elements&#x02014;movement observation with intent to imitate and visualization of mirrored movements of the nonparetic limb&#x02014;may optimally induce cortical plasticity and functional recovery in both acute and chronic stroke patients. The first element is based on the observation that mirror neurons discharge during goal-directed hand actions and also during observation of another individual performing a similar action. It has been proposed that mirror neurons constitute a vocabulary of hand actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Their activation leads to recruitment of functionally interconnected cortical structures coupling action execution and observation. The execution&#x02013;observation system has also been found in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Moreover, there is evidence that action observation may facilitate motor activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and induce cortical plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition to action execution and observation, mirror neurons and motor-planning areas are known to be activated during voluntary motor imagery, which selectively modulates muscle excitability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>In the evaluation of novel technologies developed for neurorehabilitation, it is important to evaluate efficacy and the user&#x02019;s perspective to enhance successful implementation of the technology. In their literature review, Laver <italic>et al</italic>. suggested assessing patients&#x02019; motivation, engagement in the therapy and level of enjoyment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Therefore, a mixed-methods approach will be used in the study proposed here. Together with the randomised efficacy trial it is intended to conduct semistructured patient interviews and focus group interviews with the treating therapists. The interviews will help to provide more information and a deeper understanding of the phenomena under investigation to be used in developing sound recommendations for the implementation of the VR training system for routine use in neurorehabilitation.</p><p>The current study includes two parts: (1) a quantitative investigation of the efficacy of virtual reality training compared to conventional therapy in upper-limb motor function are investigated, (2a) a qualitative investigation of patients&#x02019; experiences and expectations of virtual reality training and (2b) a qualitative investigation of therapists&#x02019; experiences using the virtual reality training system in the therapy setting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods and design</title><p>This phase III study consists of two parts and envisages a mixed-methods design comprising quantitative and qualitative research methods.

A change of five or six cubes before and after an intervention seems to be the smallest real difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Secondary outcomes: upper-limb activities of daily living and motor and cognitive function</title><p>Upper-limb ADL and motor and cognitive function are secondary outcomes. They will be assessed objectively with the Chedoke-McMaster Stroke Assessment (CMSA), the Chedoke Arm and Hand Activity Inventory (CAHAI) and the Line Bisection Test (LBT) and subjectively with the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS).</p><p>The CMSA was developed by Gowland <italic>et al</italic>. in 1995 for the evaluation of physical impairment and activity level of stroke patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In the present study, we will use the impairment subscales for hand and arm function. Patients will be scored on a seven-point scale (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;hypoactive or absent muscle reflexes, 7&#x02009;=&#x02009;no functional impairment detectable anymore, prestroke status) according to seven stages of motor recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Additionally, shoulder pain of the affected body side will be evaluated on the same seven-point scale using another subscale.

It contains 13 real-life items scored from 1 to 7 (highest score). For example, one item is putting toothpaste on a toothbrush. Scores represent the patient&#x02019;s relative ability to independently perform stabilisation or manipulation in ADL with the affected upper limb. A score of 1 represents total dependence on another person, and a score of 7 indicates patient independence without time or safety concerns or necessary splints or devices. The test&#x02019;s reliability and validity have been evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>The LBT is a paper-and-pencil test used to evaluate the presence of unilateral spatial neglect (USN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Patients are asked to mark the centre of a drawn line on paper with a pencil. This is repeated for 18 lines on a sheet of paper. A deviation of more than 6 mm from the centre in the upper and lower 9 lines indicates the presence of USN.</p><p>The SIS is a questionnaire comprising questions regarding the impact of stroke on physical function, emotion, memory, communication and social participation. The SIS was developed by Duncan and colleagues in 2001 and has been modified in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The current version, 3.0, consists of eight subscales (strength, hand function, mobility, ADL, emotion, memory, communication and participation) comprising a total of 59 questions that should be administered in a one-to-one interview. Patients can rate the level of their stroke&#x02019;s impact on a 5-point Likert scale. The reliability, validity and sensitivity to change of this instrument have been evaluated for version 2.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Official translations have been produced for 14 languages. The higher the score, the less affected the patient perceives his or her current status to be. A clinically important difference is indicated by changes of 9.2, 5.9, 4.5 and 17.8 points for the strength, ADL, mobility and hand function subscales, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Further assessments and evaluations</title><p>At study entry, the MiniMental State Examination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and the Extended Barthel Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] will be used for patient evaluation and descriptive purposes at BL only. Furthermore, patients&#x02019; personal information regarding age, gender, marital status, education and profession will be recorded.
