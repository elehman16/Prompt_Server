Adenophorum</italic> in relation to the cell cycle and apoptosis of splenocytes in Saanen goats remains unclear. In the present study, 16 Saanen goats were randomly divided into four groups, which were fed on 0%, 40%, 60% and 80% <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> diets. The results of TUNEL, DAPI and AO/EB staining, flow cytometry analysis and DNA fragmentation assays showed that <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> induced typical apoptotic features in splenocytes, suppressed splenocyte viability, and caused cell cycle arrest in a dose-dependent manner. However, westernblot, ELISA, qRT-PCR and caspase activity analyses showed that <italic>E. adenophorum</italic>inhibited Bcl-2 expression, promoted Bax translocation to the mitochondria, triggered the release of Cyt<italic>c</italic> from the mitochondria into the cytosol, and activated caspase-9 and -3 and the subsequent cleavage of PARP. Moreover, in <italic>E. adenophorum</italic>-induced apoptosis, the protein levels of Fas, Bid, FasL and caspase-8 showed no significant changes. <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> treatment induced the collapse of <italic>&#x00394;&#x003a8;</italic>m. Moreover, these data suggested that <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> induces splenocyte apoptosis via the activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in splenocytes.

In the present study, we investigated the cytotoxic effects of <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> on splenocytesin Saanen goats and detected apoptosis-inducing effects at both the cell andtissue levels, in addition to examining effects on cell cycle progression, to illuminate the potential mechanisms involved in <italic>E. adenophorum</italic>-induced spleen toxicity in goats.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cell cycle of splenocytes</title><p>The distribution of splenocytes in different phases of the cell cycle was analyzed through flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). After feeding Saanen goats on the <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> diets, the proportion of splenocytes in G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> phase was substantially increased in the experimental groups. The percentages of splenocytes in S, G<sub>2</sub>&#x02009;+&#x02009;M and PI phases were significantly decreased in the 600 and 800&#x02009;g/kg groups and were markedly decreased in group I compared with the control, indicating the occurrence of G0/G1 phase arrest compared with the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>). These data suggested that <italic>E.adenophorum</italic> inhibited splenocyte growth in Saanen goats through inhibition of the G0/G1 to S phase transition in the cell cycle.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Detection of apoptotic splenocytes</title><p>The apoptosis of splenocytes was further examined. The rate of apoptosis in the splenocytes was assessed through TUNEL stainingand flow cytometry using Annexin V/PI staining. The results indicated that the percentage of normal splenocytes was markedly decreased compared withthe control. The percentages of apoptotic splenocytes in groups II and II were significantly increased with an increasing percentage of <italic>E. adenophorum</italic>. Moreover, the proportion of apoptotic splenocytes was positively correlated with the dose of <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) has emerged as the key cellular component in programmed necrotic cell death. To determine whether programmed necrotic cell death was associated with <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> administration, MLKL phosphorylation was analyzed through western blotting. The results indicated that <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> failed to increase the protein levels of p-MLKL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>). The TUNEL assay was used to detect DNA strand breaks occurring prior to nuclear fragmentation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, and TUNEL-positive cells were quantified through manual counting. In the present study, significant apoptosis was observed through the TUNEL assay. However, significant numbers of TUNEL-positive cells were not observed in the control group. The quantification results indicated the occurrence of 15.78% and 20.82% TUNEL-positive cells at doses of 600 and 800 g/d <italic>E. adenophorum</italic>, respectively. DAPI and AO/EB staining, which were used to examine nuclear morphology, showed that the splenocytes of the control group did not presentsignificant changes in cell nuclei and cell membrane integrity (white arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>). However, typical apoptotic nuclei were observed in the splenocytes of the experimental groups, including the occurrence of chromatin condensation (red arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>), nuclear fragmentation and cell membrane destruction (yellow arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Moreover, the DNA fragmentation assay revealed characteristic ladder patterns in splenocytes, and the DNA ladder was more evident in <italic>E. adenophorum</italic>&#x02013;treated splenocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D</xref>). These results demonstrated that <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> induced splenocyte apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner but did not induce programmed necrotic cell death.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Activation of caspases-9 and -3, but not caspase-8, is involved in apoptosis</title><p>Caspases are the central components in the execution of apoptosis. Caspase-8 and -9 are initiator caspases in the death receptor and mitochondrial pathways, respectively. Caspase-3, the downstream caspase of caspases-8 and -9, is the key executioner caspase in the apoptosis pathway. The contributions of caspases-8, -9 and -3 to <italic>E. adenophorum</italic>-induced apoptosis were measured through qRT-PCR, caspase activity assays, ELISA and western blot assays. Western blot analysis showed that the levels of full-length procaspase-9 and procaspase-3 were decreased, and their cleaved forms were increased with increasing levels of <italic>E. adenophorum</italic>. However, the full-length and cleaved forms of procaspase-8 did not show any differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Released Cyt<italic>c</italic> typically combines with Apaf-1 and procaspase-9 to form the apoptosome in the presence of ATP in the cytoplasm, resulting in the activation of caspase-9. To determine whether <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> promoted the formation of the apoptosome, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Apaf-1 antibody and subsequently subjected to western blot analysis with anti-caspase-9 and anti-Cyt<italic>c</italic>antibodies. The results showed that Apaf-1 interacted with caspase-9 and Cyt<italic>c</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Moreover, qRT-PCR revealed that the activation of caspases-3 and -9 was evidently inducedby<italic>E. adenophorum</italic>, whereas the activation of caspase-8 was not induced in groups I and II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>). The caspase molecules involved in <italic>E. adenophorum</italic>-induced apoptosis were analyzed to measure the activities of caspases-8, -9, and -3 using colorimetric assay kits. Here, we showed that <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> significantly induced the activation of caspases-9 and -3 but failed to induce the activation of caspase-8, except at a dose of 800&#x02009;g/kg/d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Compared with the control, the concentrations of caspase-3 and -9, but not that of caspase-8, showed a significant increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3E</xref>). These results suggested that <italic>E. adenophorum</italic>-induced apoptosis primarily depends on the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, but not caspase-8.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The mitochondrial apoptotic pathway is activated in <italic>E. adenophorum</italic>-induced apoptosis</title><p>The two distinct signaling pathways, the death receptor pathway and the mitochondrial pathway, are involved in apoptosis. The death receptor pathway is typically triggered through the ligation of death receptors, such as Fas or Fas ligand (FasL), which recruits fas-associated proteins with a death domain and procaspase-8 to form a death-inducing signaling complex, leading to the proteolytic activation of caspase-8. Studies have known that activated caspase-8 cleaves Bid to form truncated Bid, which activates the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Mitochondria play a vital role in apoptosis induced by chemical agents<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. The pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, such as Bcl-2 and Bax, regulate mitochondrial membrane integrity. Bcl-2 protects cells from the induction of apoptosis through interacting with Bax, blocking the release of Cyt<italic>c</italic> from the mitochondria to the cytosol. The expression levels of Cyt<italic>c</italic>,Fas, FasL, Bcl-2, Bid and Bax were examined to explore the effects of <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> on splenocytes through western blot, qRT-PCR and ELISA analyses. The results showed that <italic>E. adenophorum</italic>increased the protein levels of Bax and Cyt<italic>c</italic> and decreased the protein level of Bcl-2 in a dose-dependent manner in splenocytes. However, the level of Bid did not show significant variations, consistent with the results for caspase-8, suggesting that the activation of the mitochondrial pathway was independent of the activation of caspase-8 and Bid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>). qRT-PCR indicated that the relative mRNA level of Bax increased, while that of Bcl-2 decreased, resulting in a change in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, which subsequently activated the mitochondrial pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Consistent with the results for caspase-8, the protein levels of Fas and FasL were not affected by <italic>E. adenophorum</italic>, as detected through western blotting, suggesting that the Fas-mediated death receptor pathway was not activated in thesplenocytesby <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>). PARP is an indicator of caspase-3 activation during apoptosis. Western blotting showed that PARP was cleaved from a 116&#x02009;kDa fragment to an 85&#x02009;kDa fragment during <italic>E. adenophorum</italic>-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D</xref>). The protein extracts of both the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were used to determine the location of Bax and Cyt<italic>c</italic> in splenocytes. A dose-dependent decrease in mitochondrial Cyt<italic>c</italic> and a concomitant increase in the cytosolic fraction were also observed. Accordingly, translocation of Bax from the cytosol to mitochondria was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4E</xref>). <italic>&#x00394;&#x003a8;m</italic> is determined by the balance of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, such as Bax and Bcl-2. To determine whether <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> treatment activates mitochondriamediated apoptotic pathway, we used JC-1 as fluorescence probe to evaluate changes in <italic>&#x00394;&#x003a8;m</italic> by flow cytometry. The result showed that <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> treatment significantly induced the collapse of <italic>&#x00394;&#x003a8;m</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4F</xref>). These results suggested that <italic>E. adenophorum</italic>-induced apoptosis primarily occurred through activation of the mitochondrial pathway.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p><italic>E. adenophorum</italic> is a noxious invasive weed that is found worldwide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. According to previous studies, the ingestion of freeze-dried <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> leaf powder as a diet supplement induces hepatotoxicity in mice as well as anorexia, rumination suspension and photosensitization in cattle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> and chronic pulmonary disease in horses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. These observations provide a rationale for exploring <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> as a cause of splenic toxicity and an inducer of apoptosis in the splenocytes of Saanen goats.</p><p>Flow cytometry is frequently used to monitor early apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, and the flow cytometry results of the present study showed that the <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> increased the numbers of apoptotic splenocytes, indicating that <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> reduced the survival and inhibited the growth of the splenocytes through the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, suggesting that the splenocytes of Saanen goats are sensitive to <italic>E. adenophorum</italic>. Our results also showed that <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> induced splenocyte apoptosis with typical morphological characteristics, including cellular shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation. The mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway requires the translocation of Cyt<italic>c</italic> from the mitochondria to the cytosol and the formation of a large multiprotein complex comprising Cyt<italic>c</italic>, Apaf-1 and procaspase-9. In the present study, we observed that <italic>E. adenophorum</italic>-induced apoptosis involved the activation of caspase-9 and -3. However, <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> did not activate Fas and FasL and the downstream protein capase-8. Thus, these results demonstrate that apoptosis is dependent on the activation of caspases-9 and -3, and <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> failed to activate the death receptor-mediated caspase-8 pathway in the present study. In splenocytes, Cyt<italic>c</italic> released from dysfunctional mitochondria into the cytosol forms apoptosomes together with Apaf-1 and procaspase-9, followed by the activation of caspases-9 and -3 and the cleavage of PARP. In the present study, <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> failed to activate Fas, FasL and Bid, suggesting that the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway is activated through <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> administration and that <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> induces apoptosis through Cyt<italic>c</italic>-mediated and caspase-dependent pathways. Both the protein and mRNA levels of <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> decreased the levels of Bcl-2, while those of Bax increased. Additionally, <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> promoted the translocation of Bax from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria and Cyt<italic>c</italic> from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, indicating that the mitochondrial pathway was activated. The down-regulation of Bcl-2 and up-regulation of Bax demonstrated the dysregulation of the associated molecules Bcl-2 and Bax and the activation of caspases-3 and -9<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. The dysregulation of the mitochondria integrity-associated molecules Bcl-2 and Bax suggested that activation of the mitochondrial pathway is the main event during apoptosis. Furthermore, In response to apoptotic stimuli, Bax translocates to the mitochondria and inserts into the outer mitochondrial membrane, resulting in the collapse of <italic>&#x00394;&#x003a8;m</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Here we showed that <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> induced the collapse of <italic>&#x00394;&#x003a8;m</italic>, so the translocation of Bax may be associated to the collapse of <italic>&#x00394;&#x003a8;m</italic> and release of mitochondrial pro-apoptotic proteins. The degree of apoptosis mediated through the mitochondria could reflect cell cycle regulation, which is a key regulatory mechanism underlying cell growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. The cell cycle analysis and PI values showed that <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> intake could effectively inhibit the growth of splenocytes through cell cycle arrest, similar to injury of the spleen, as previously reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>.</p><p>The results of the present study demonstrated that <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> significantly inhibits the growth of splenocytes through G0/G1-phase cell cycle arrest and the induction of apoptosis. <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> down-regulated Bcl-2, promoted Bax translocation into the mitochondria, and activated the mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway, resulting in Cyt <italic>c</italic> release into the cytosol, followed by caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage. Moreover, <italic>E. adenophorum</italic> induced apoptosis and spleen impairment through the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction in splenocytes. Additionally, mitochondrial dysfunction was considered to be responsible for the apoptosis observed in splenocytes.
