This deontic constraint forbids the causing of one patient&#x02019;s death in order to benefit others, even if the patient is unconscious, debilitated, or very near death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It serves to protect vulnerable patients from exploitation, to maintain public trust in the transplantation enterprise, and has been described as &#x0201c;a centerpiece of the social order&#x02019;s commitment to respect for persons and human life&#x0201d; ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], p. 6). The majority of transplant organs are procured from patients who have been declared dead by neurologic criteria, or, &#x0201c;brain dead&#x0201d;, and thus the removal of organs from these patients is believed to accord with the dead donor rule. Furthermore, the prevailing view holds that from a biomedical perspective, neurological and circulatory criteria for the determination of death are simply two different ways of identifying the same underlying state of human death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. According to this view, neurological criteria for death are based on sound biomedical science and philosophical reasoning, and are justified independently of other concerns, including organ transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Although mostly accepted in the medical and legal communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], neurological criteria for death are controversial. Scholars have argued that brain death is insufficient for the death of a human organism in a biological sense, since patients who meet diagnostic criteria for brain death retain the capacity to function as an integrated whole in the maintenance of homeostasis and resistance of entropy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, some argue that rather than reflecting an advance in the scientific understanding of death, the concept of brain death embodies or reflects an implicit moral evaluation, specifically, that it is permissible to remove vital organs in the condition of devastating neurological injury known as brain death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Thus, rather than concluding that organ removal is permissible <italic>because the donor is dead</italic>, perhaps people believe that the donor is dead <italic>because they believe organ removal to be permissible</italic>.</p><p>In this article, we describe two experiments designed to ascertain whether people&#x02019;s moral evaluations of organ transplantation influence their judgments of death and causation in an organ removal scenario. We situate the results within the framework of motivated reasoning, in which motivation influences the selection of cognitive representations applied to a given domain. In the discussion section, we also consider an alternative theoretical framework for interpreting the results, similar to Knobe&#x02019;s person-as-moralist model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], in which the concepts of death and causation are treated as partially moral concepts, rather than value-neutral factual concepts (cf. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]). Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for the bioethical debate on death and organ transplantation.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Motivated Reasoning and Organ Transplantation</title><p>Motivated reasoning is an empirically well-validated framework that explains people&#x02019;s reasoning processes in terms of an interaction of motivational and cognitive processes. Motivation &#x02013; that is, any wish, desire, or preference to reach a particular conclusion &#x02013; impacts the reasoning process by influencing the selection of cognitive processes and representations applied to a given reasoning problem in such a way that the outcome of the reasoning process is biased towards the preferred conclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Motivated reasoning has been found in a variety of domains, including beliefs about the self and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and in moral cognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Particularly relevant to the present context, there are a series of findings of motivated reasoning involving blame, causation, and harm. Alicke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] found that people tend to interpret relevant facts about a given situation in a way that validates a prior assessment of blame. For example, people were more likely to blame the driver of a car for being involved in an accident when he was speeding home to hide a vial of cocaine from his parents, than when he was speeding home to hide an anniversary present. In accordance with motivated reasoning, people were also more likely to judge the driver as the <italic>cause</italic> of the accident when he was speeding home to hide cocaine (vs. an anniversary present), thus validating their prior assessment of blame, even though all other factors were the same between the two cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In a legal context, Sood and Darley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] found motivated reasoning about the concept of harm. Participants were more likely to assert that harm is caused by some distasteful action (such as washing a sidewalk with the flag) when they believed that the law requires showing the occurrence of harm in order to criminalize the behavior they found distasteful. However, when not constrained by demonstrable harm as a requirement of criminalization, participants who found the action distasteful and wished to see it criminalized did not assert that it caused harm, thus demonstrating that judgments of harm were recruited in a motivated fashion in order to justify their preference for criminalization. Similarly, Miller et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] have argued that much of what is taken as received wisdom in medical ethics relies on a series of moral fictions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] or moral bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], which involve the motivated misinterpretation of facts about causation and intention in order to allow accepted medical practices at the end of life, such as withdrawing life-sustaining treatment, to appear consistent with traditional norms, such as that doctors must not cause death. Although plausible, they do not present experimental evidence for motivated reasoning in this specific context.</p><p>The theoretical framework of motivated reasoning is useful for investigating beliefs about death and organ transplantation. If an observer were to judge organ removal from a given donor as morally good or as not blameworthy, then according to the motivated reasoning model, that observer would be motivated to interpret the scenario in a way that validates the observer&#x02019;s ethical judgment, for example, by concluding that the act of removing organs did not cause death, and that the donor was already dead before organs were removed. On the other hand, were an observer to judge organ removal as morally bad or as blameworthy, then this would create a motivation to interpret the scenario differently, by concluding that the donor was still alive when organs were removed, and that organ removal was the cause of death.</p><p>In light of this background, we predicted that people&#x02019;s beliefs about whether an unconscious organ donor was dead and whether organ removal caused death in a hypothetical vignette would vary depending on whether the vignette was framed as morally good or bad. Participants presented with the good scenario would be more likely to judge that the unconscious donor was already dead prior to organ removal and that organ removal did not cause death, as compared to the bad scenario. Further, we expected that individual differences in attitudes toward organ transplantation and euthanasia would predict participants&#x02019; beliefs about whether the organ donor was dead, and whether organ removal caused death, regardless of experimental condition. That is, participants with more favorable attitudes toward organ donation in general would be more likely to believe that the donor was dead and organ removal did not cause death than those with less favorable attitudes, regardless of whether they read the morally good or bad scenario. Conversely, participants with less favorable attitudes toward euthanasia would be more likely to believe that the donor was alive and that organ removal caused death than those with more favorable attitudes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study 1</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants and Recruitment</title><p>Participants were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online crowdsourcing platform that has been successfully used in experimental psychological research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Recruitment was limited to individuals 18&#x000a0;years of age or older who resided in the United States.

After providing informed consent, participants completed an approximately 10-min online survey for which they received a small payment. To account for possible order effects, the study used a 2 (moral valence: good vs. bad) X 2 (order: read vignette first vs. completed attitudes scales first) between-subjects factorial design. Participants were randomly assigned to read a vignette about an organ transplant scenario that was framed to occur under circumstances that differed in moral valence (details below). Participants completed all outcome measures immediately after reading the vignette regardless of order. Instructions made clear that there are no right or wrong answers for these questions and that we were interested in participants&#x02019; personal opinions. Finally, participants answered demographic and background questions. At the end of the study, we emphasized to participants that the vignettes were fictional.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Vignette</title><p>The aim of the vignette was to describe a patient in an irreversible apneic coma (using lay terms) who might be a candidate for organ donation, though without using potentially confounding terms such as &#x0201c;death&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;brain death&#x0201d;. Furthermore, the two conditions were constructed to be the same in every relevant way except for the experimental manipulation of moral valence. While we have labeled the conditions as &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;bad&#x0201d;, the key aspect of the design is the <italic>contrast</italic> between the two conditions, with the bad condition being of more obviously negative moral valence than the good condition. If our hypothesis is correct, we would expect that the difference in moral valence between the conditions would influence participants&#x02019; judgments of death and causation.</p><p>The scenario began the same way for all participants, where they read about a man named John who had been severely injured in a car accident.<disp-quote><p>John has been in a very bad car accident. He suffered a severe head injury and is now in the hospital. As a result of the injury, John is completely unconscious. He cannot hear or feel anything, cannot remember or think about anything, and his condition is irreversible. John will never wake up. He also cannot breathe without mechanical support, but he is on a breathing machine that keeps his lungs working. Without the machine, John&#x02019;s heart and all of his other organs would stop within minutes.</p></disp-quote></p><p>Then participants read about the circumstances under which John&#x02019;s organs had been removed. Approximately half of participants read the morally good scenario and half read the morally bad scenario.<disp-quote><p>[Good condition:] John has a signed organ donor card, and his family has agreed to organ donation. They know that he wanted to donate his organs, and they believe that by giving the gift of life and saving up to 6 other people&#x02019;s lives with his organs, at least they can find some meaning from this senseless tragedy. With the family&#x02019;s permission, the hospital staff take John to the operating room while he is still on the breathing machine, and the surgeon removes John&#x02019;s liver, pancreas, both kidneys, heart, and lungs, and transplants them into other patients.</p><p>[Bad condition:] John has a signed living will stating that he does not want to donate any organs for religious reasons, and his family, who share his religion, are opposed to organ donation. They know that he did not want to donate his organs, and they believe that by violating his wishes they would only make this senseless tragedy worse. The transplant surgeon knows that John and his family have refused organ donation, but thinks to himself, &#x0201c;I don&#x02019;t care at all what this bum wanted or what his family wants. I hate them because of their race, and because of their religion. I&#x02019;m going to take his organs because it will let them know that they are not welcome in this hospital.&#x0201d; In the middle of the night when his family went home to get some much needed rest, the hospital staff take John to the operating room while he is still on the breathing machine, and the surgeon removes John&#x02019;s liver, pancreas, both kidneys, heart, and lungs, and transplants them into other patients.</p></disp-quote></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Measures</title><sec id="FPar2"><title>Outcome Measures</title><p>Immediately after reading the vignette participants were asked to rate their agreement with the following statements using a 5-point Likert scale (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;strongly disagree; 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;disagree; 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;unsure; 4&#x02009;=&#x02009;agree; 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;strongly agree): &#x0201c;John was already dead before his organs were removed.&#x0201d; &#x0201c;The surgeon caused John&#x02019;s death.&#x0201d; &#x0201c;The surgeon is responsible for John&#x02019;s death.&#x0201d; Afterward, participants rated the same three items using a forced-choice &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;no&#x0201d; scale with the following instructions: &#x0201c;If you had to choose just one, would you say that: John was already dead&#x02026;&#x0201d; Responses of yes were coded as 1 and responses of no were coded as 0.

One possible explanation is that attitudes toward organ donation create a weaker motivation to reach conclusions about death and causation with respect to a particular scenario, than do moral evaluations specifically of that same scenario. For example, when participants read the morally bad scenario, this likely triggered an immediate negative moral evaluation of the actors involved, creating the motivation to reach blame-validating conclusions about death and causation, which then biased cognitive processes toward reaching the preferred conclusions. Although general attitudes toward organ transplantation can trigger the same process, it is possible that their effects are less strong. However, given that attitudes toward euthanasia were statistically significant predictors of judgments of death and causation for all outcome variables, a second possibility is that the construct validity of the ODAS could be improved.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Study 2</title><p>The goal of Study 2 was to replicate findings from Study 1 using a different sample of participants and a different scenario.</p><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited through Mechanical Turk.

Second, individual differences in attitudes toward organ donation and toward euthanasia both independently predicted people&#x02019;s beliefs about death and causation in an organ removal scenario, regardless of experimental condition. Thus, the results of the experimental manipulation of moral valence, and the associations between the attitude scales and judgments of death and causation (regardless of experimental condition) mutually reinforce each other. These results were replicated in a second sample of participants, using different vignettes in which the contrast in moral valence between the good and bad conditions was less pronounced. Taken together, our findings support our hypothesis that moral evaluations of organ transplantation affect judgments of death and causation.</p><p>Although we have posed our hypotheses and interpreted our results in light of the motivated reasoning framework, these results are also relevant to a competing theoretical framework, Knobe&#x02019;s <italic>person-as-moralist</italic> model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. We will address both the motivated reasoning and the person-as-moralist models below as potential explanations of these results, and then discuss their relevance to bioethical debates about death and organ transplantation.</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Death and Motivated Reasoning</title><p>Our findings can be conceptualized in terms of motivated reasoning, in which any preference, wish, or desire to reach a particular conclusion impacts cognition in a way that biases the observer toward reaching the preferred conclusion. Participants differed in their general attitudes toward organ transplantation and euthanasia, as reflected in scores on the ODAS and ATE scales. Their favorable or unfavorable opinions toward these practices created the motivation to interpret relevant aspects of the vignette in a way that would validate their prior attitudes. Specifically, those who were more favorable to organ transplantation were more likely to believe that the comatose patient was already dead and that organ removal was not the cause of death, while those who were less favorable to euthanasia were motivated to reach the opposite conclusions. Similarly, the experimental manipulation of moral valence likely triggered spontaneous moral evaluations of organ removal in that specific scenario. Those participants who were randomized to read the morally bad versions of the stories likely judged the surgeon&#x02019;s actions to be morally blameworthy, reflected in their higher agreement that the surgeon is responsible for the patient&#x02019;s death (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This moral assessment created the motivation to interpret the scenario in a way that would validate that assessment, specifically by concluding that the patient was alive prior to organ removal and that the surgeon caused the patient&#x02019;s death by removing organs. A parallel process occurred in the good condition, where participants were motivated to reach different conclusions about death and causation that would validate their different moral evaluations.</p><p>The effect sizes across experimental condition in Study 1 were consistently larger than those in Study 2 (reported above; see also Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> to compare means and percentages across conditions). This is consistent with and predicted by the model of motivated reasoning. In Study 1, the good condition was presumably more obviously good than in Study 2, because the patient wanted to be a donor and the family consented to donation, whereas in Study 2 the good condition was presumably more ambiguous, because there was no information about the donor&#x02019;s prior wishes. Thus, in the good condition of Study 1 there was a stronger positive moral evaluation that organ removal was permissible (compared to the good condition of Study 2), creating a stronger motivation to reach conclusions about death and causation that would validate that moral evaluation. This stronger motivation in Study 1 (vs. Study 2), in turn, resulted in a larger difference in judgments of death and causation across condition, reflected in larger effect sizes in Study 1. In other words, the greater contrast in moral valence between the two conditions in Study 1 (vs. Study 2) yielded a greater contrast in motivations to interpret the scenario differently in the two conditions, which in turn is reflected in the larger differences in judgments of death and causation, and hence the larger effect sizes in Study 1.</p><p>Finally, blame-validation is a particular manifestation of the more general phenomenon of motivated cognition. In the specific experimental contexts reported here, it is likely that participants were motivated to blame an agent, thus influencing the outcome of judgments of death and causation. However, it is also plausible that the phenomenon under investigation is not specifically tied to blame-validation, but is part of a more general pattern of motivated cognition in which people (mis) interpret a variety of relevant facts about death, causation, and intention so as to allow desired practices (such as organ removal) to appear consistent with traditional norms (such as the prohibition against intentionally causing death; cf. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]). We aim to explore these questions in future research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Moral Concept of Death and the Person-as-Moralist Model</title><p>Although the motivated reasoning framework is well-suited for explaining our results, an alternative explanation must also be considered. Veatch has argued [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] that the meaning of the word &#x0201c;dead&#x0201d; has evolved in such a way that it now embodies a moral concept. Although &#x0201c;dead&#x0201d; retains its biological connotation in most contexts, when used in the context of organ donation, &#x0201c;the new and different meaning [has] little to do with biology&#x02026; The word <italic>dead</italic> has come to mean &#x02013; for legal, ethical, and public policy purposes &#x02013; &#x02018;having lost full moral standing as a member of the human community&#x02019;&#x0201d; ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], p. 10). Full membership in the human moral community affords certain protections, such as the right not to be killed or to not have one&#x02019;s organs removed. Therefore, to assert that a person is dead within this context is simply to assert &#x0201c;that it is morally, legally, and socially acceptable to remove organs &#x02026; and that those who do so are not guilty of murder&#x0201d; ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], p. 11).</p><p>In a similar vein, Knobe has argued that people&#x02019;s basic competencies in making sense of the world, particularly in making sense of other people and their causal interactions with the world, are suffused with moral considerations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. That is, certain key concepts involved in the explanation of behavior, such as intention and causation, are partially moral concepts, rather than value-neutral factual concepts. Importantly, Knobe argues that the role of moral judgments in shaping people&#x02019;s intuitions about intentionality, causation, and related concepts, should not be considered bias or an interfering factor as on the motivated reasoning model. Rather, those moral judgments are part of the normal and proper functioning of our competencies, and indeed, Knobe writes, &#x0201c;It seems that we are moralizing creatures through and through&#x0201d; ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], p. 328). Hence he describes his view as the <italic>person-as-moralist</italic> model, in contrast with what he calls the <italic>person-as-scientist</italic> model, according to which these concepts are interpreted as value-neutral, factual concepts.</p><p>Knobe&#x02019;s person-as-moralist model states that moral considerations are properly embedded within the concepts of causation, freedom, intention, and other basic concepts, though not including death. Assuming that it is generalized to include the concept of death much as Veatch has described it, this model would explain our results as follows. In the good condition, participants presumably considered organ removal to be &#x0201c;morally, legally, and socially acceptable&#x0201d; ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], 11). In so doing, they <italic>thereby</italic> judged that the donor is no longer a full member of the human moral community; therefore, they appropriately judged the donor to be dead, in accordance with Veatch&#x02019;s proposed new definition. In the bad condition, the surgeon&#x02019;s reprehensible motives and the lack of consent would lead most people to believe that organ removal is not &#x0201c;morally, legally, and socially acceptable&#x0201d;, hence, most people would not judge that the donor in this specific context is dead. Similar explanations may be offered for the relations between the attitude scales and judgments of death. For example, those participants who had more favorable attitudes toward organ donation, in general, were presumably more likely to consider the specific instance of organ removal to be morally permissible (perhaps even in the bad condition), and hence, thereby judged that the donor is dead.</p><p>The person-as-moralist model&#x02019;s explanation of our results is very different than the motivated reasoning model, which posits a reasoning process that biases participants&#x02019; judgments toward validating a moral evaluation they have already made. In essence, the motivated reasoning model posits a performance error, whereas on the person-as-moralist model, our participants were not engaged in biased processing at all, but were correctly performing basic competencies and correctly applying core concepts. The results of our studies extend the application of the motivated reasoning and the person-as-moralist models into a new domain, that of judgments about death, but it is not possible to tease apart the two explanations from our experimental evidence alone. Further theoretical and empirical research will be needed to distinguish the explanatory power of the two models.</p><p>Although this is an important theoretical question for moral psychology, it is essential to understand that regardless of whether the best explanation is the motivated reasoning or person-as-moralist framework (or some combination of them), on both theoretical frameworks, <italic>moral evaluations of organ transplantation influence judgments of death</italic>. This has significant implications for the bioethical debate about death and organ transplantation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Death and Organ Transplantation</title><p>According to the dominant interpretation of these issues, neurological criteria for death do not reflect a social construction or a legal fiction designed for the purpose of facilitating organ transplantation. Rather, the determination of death by neurological criteria is grounded in sound biomedical science and philosophical reasoning, and is justified independently of ethical concerns about organ transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Because brain dead donors are in fact <italic>dead</italic> &#x02013; as a matter of biology &#x02013; it follows that the removal of organs while the donor remains on the ventilator and with a spontaneously beating heart does not violate the dead donor rule.</p><p>However, this interpretation is inconsistent with a body of empirical evidence showing that patients meeting diagnostic standards for brain death retain the capacity for the integrated functioning of the organism as a whole in its maintenance of physiologic stability and resistance of entropy; thus, they are biologically alive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These functions include gas exchange at the alveoli, cellular respiration, nutrition, wound healing, febrile responses to infection, hypertensive, tachycardic, and endocrine responses to incision, neurohormonal regulation of free water homeostasis, growth and sexual maturation in children, and the gestation of healthy fetuses in pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Rather than being a scientifically justified claim about biology, several scholars have argued that the brain death doctrine embodies or reflects moral evaluations, in particular, that it is permissible to remove vital organs from patients in this devastating condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Our results provide experimental evidence in support of the assertion that moral evaluations of organ transplantation influence judgments about death and causation, casting doubt on the psychological legitimacy of the mainstream view which holds that neurological criteria for death are justified independently of ethical concerns about organ transplantation. Indeed, there is a long-standing criticism that criteria for death have been redefined in order to allow vital organ procurement to appear consistent with the dead donor rule (cf. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]). Our experimental results support this interpretation of the literature: Rather than concluding that organ removal is permissible because the donor is dead, people may believe that the donor is dead because they believe organ removal to be permissible.</p><p>On the motivated reasoning model, the influence of moral evaluations on judgments of death is an error in reasoning (something like a reverse naturalistic fallacy), whereas on the person-as-moralist model, the embedding of moral evaluations within judgments of death does not reflect an error, since death and causation are partly moral concepts. However, both explanatory models reinforce an important challenge to the mainstream view; namely, scientific or technical expertise grants no particular epistemic, moral, or democratic authority in resolving moral questions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Regardless of whether moral evaluations are appropriately embedded within the concept of death, or if current neurological criteria for death reflect motivated reasoning in which the concept of death is reinterpreted to allow organ procurement to appear consistent with the dead donor rule, our current policies embody or reflect implicit moral evaluations that are not explicitly acknowledged as such. Instead, brain death is treated as if it were an established &#x0201c;scientific fact.&#x0201d; But in so doing, the underlying moral judgments are hidden from view, precluding explicit moral and democratic discourse regarding <italic>why</italic> the removal of vital organs from patients in this devastating condition is ethically permissible, if it is, and if not, then why not.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Limitations and Future Directions</title><p>Limitations of this research include possible concerns about generalizability of the sample due to use of Mechanical Turk, and an online survey environment that may result in potential problems with participant attention. With respect to the first potential limitation, our samples reflected a broad demographic array by age, ethnicity, education, religious beliefs, and other characteristics. Furthermore, numerous traditional psychological findings regarding judgment and decision making have been replicated on Mechanical Turk, suggesting its reliability and utility as a data source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Regarding attention in an online survey environment, we used attention-checks to control for this factor, however, we cannot rule out whether some participants were multi-tasking and perhaps not completely engaged with the survey.</p><p>An additional potential limitation of this research is that the bad versions of the vignettes are unrealistic, which might be perceived to limit the application of the findings. However, the aim was not to describe realistic scenarios in order to gauge people&#x02019;s opinions about organ donation. Rather, the aim was to manipulate the independent variable of moral valence in order to experimentally test the hypothesis that moral valence influences judgments of death and causation. By manipulating this independent variable while holding all other relevant variables constant (and by replicating the findings with different vignettes), we can conclude that differences in judgments of death and causation were caused by the difference in moral valence across the scenarios. Furthermore, the experimental results must be interpreted in conjunction with the correlational findings in which attitudes toward organ donation and euthanasia independently predicted judgments of death and causation, regardless of experimental condition. When taken together, these results establish the basic effect, that moral evaluations influence and predict judgments of death and causation in an organ procurement scenario. In future research we aim to clarify the parameters that moderate and constrain this basic effect.</p><p>Finally, there are several differences between the good and bad versions of the vignettes in both studies which are bound up in what we have collectively described as &#x0201c;moral valence&#x0201d;, such as prejudice, consent, and the surgeon&#x02019;s moral character. In future research we also aim to clarify the role that these distinct components play in thinking about death and causation in the organ procurement context.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>To our knowledge, the studies reported here are the first to experimentally explore the effects of moral evaluations of organ transplantation on beliefs about death and causation.
