So far, trials of self&#x02010;management courses have not included in&#x02010;depth qualitative evaluations of how the learning method influences participants&#x02019; perceptions and behaviour. We aimed to interview participants who had attended a course, as part of a randomized controlled trial, to examine: (i) their perceptions of what they valued and negative aspects of the intervention, and (ii) whether and in what ways they continued to make use of the training.</p></sec><sec id="ene13253-sec-0002"><title>Methods</title><p>Twenty participants were selected within 6 months of undertaking a course from the larger randomized controlled trial conducted in England. Semi&#x02010;structured interviews were based on a topic guide.</p></sec><sec id="ene13253-sec-0003"><title>Results</title><p>Participants&#x02019; characteristics were representative of the clinical and demographic characteristics of the trial group. Their mean age was 44 years, half were male, and three&#x02010;quarters had had epilepsy for over 10 years and had experienced one or more seizures in the previous month. Participants valued the opportunity to meet &#x02018;people like them&#x02019;. Structured learning methods encouraged them to share and compare feelings and experience. Specific benefits included: overcoming the sense of &#x02018;being alone&#x02019; and improving self&#x02010;acceptance through meeting people with similar experience. Over half reported that this, and comparison of attitudes and experience, helped them to improve their confidence to talk openly, and make changes in health behaviours.</p></sec><sec id="ene13253-sec-0004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>People feel socially isolated in long&#x02010;term poorly controlled epilepsy. They gain confidence and self&#x02010;acceptance from interactive groups. Expert&#x02010;facilitated courses that encourage experiential learning can help people learn from each other, and this may enhance self&#x02010;efficacy and behaviour change.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-generated"><kwd id="ene13253-kwd-0001">epilepsy</kwd><kwd id="ene13253-kwd-0002">experiential learning</kwd><kwd id="ene13253-kwd-0003">patient education</kwd><kwd id="ene13253-kwd-0004">self&#x02010;management</kwd><kwd id="ene13253-kwd-0005">social stigma</kwd><kwd id="ene13253-kwd-0006">social support</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>National Institute for Health Research</funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Health Technology Assessment</funding-source><award-id>09/165/01</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>King's College Hospital National Health Service Foundation Trust</funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="8"/><word-count count="6199"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>source-schema-version-number</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>component-id</meta-name><meta-value>ene13253</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>April 2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>details-of-publishers-convertor</meta-name><meta-value>Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_NLMPMC version:5.0.9 mode:remove_FC converted:19.04.2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><fn-group id="ene13253-ntgp-0001"><fn id="ene13253-note-1001"><p>Trial registration Current Controlled Trials: ISRCTN57937389.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec id="ene13253-sec-0005"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epilepsy is similar to type 1 diabetes in being a long&#x02010;term condition that is episodically difficult to control, resulting in medical emergencies and risk of premature death <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, but epilepsy is twice as common <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>. Clinicians provide a diagnosis, and advice on medication, but day&#x02010;to&#x02010;day management requires attention to lifestyle, which must be undertaken by individuals themselves. People with epilepsy (PWE) would like more information <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>. However, self&#x02010;management is influenced by personal and social attitudes <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, as well as being a cognitive process. Courses have been tested in long&#x02010;term conditions, such as diabetes <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, and they are publicly funded in the UK <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>.

Group interaction may provide additional benefits in reducing social isolation and increasing confidence <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>. PWE tend not to disclose their condition, which is linked to their perception of stigma <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, and this can lead to them being socially isolated <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>.

This has economic as well as social implications. PWE who perceive their condition as being stigmatized are more likely to attend and reattend Emergency Departments for seizures <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>. For every one planned hospital admission for epilepsy, six are unplanned via Emergency Departments <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, some of which might be avoided with better ambulatory services <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>. Therefore, providing support that improves self&#x02010;confidence may be cost&#x02010;saving <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>, <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>.</p><p>In this context, we are undertaking a trial of self&#x02010;management education in groups focusing on people with &#x02018;poorly controlled epilepsy&#x02019;, defined as having two or more seizures in the past year while on medication <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>, <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>. This group makes up approximately 40% of PWE <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>.</p><p>In chronic conditions for which there is an evidence base, the relationship between providing education and achieving change in self&#x02010;management remains largely unexplained both in terms of theory and evidence <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>. Qualitative studies are therefore recommended as an essential component of the evaluation of non&#x02010;pharmacological, so&#x02010;called &#x02018;complex&#x02019; interventions with the aim of supplementing quantitative measures. They help to explain why and how an intervention &#x02018;works&#x02019;, or fails to do so, from the perspective of participants, thus contributing to the design and wider implementation of healthcare interventions <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>, <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>, <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref>. The present study therefore aimed to provide an in&#x02010;depth account of: (i) participants&#x02019; perceptions of what they valued and any negative aspects of the intervention and (ii) whether and in what ways participants continued to make use of the training received.</p><sec id="ene13253-sec-0006"><title>The intervention</title><p>We adapted the German Modular Service Package Epilepsy (MOSES) course for English speakers <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>, <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> to form the basis of the UK course called &#x02018;Self&#x02010;Management education for adults with poorly controlled epILEpsy&#x02019; [SMILE (UK)]. The course is purposefully interactive, recognizing that knowledge is necessary but not sufficient for behavioural change <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>. Therefore, it aims to promote participants as &#x02018;experts&#x02019; and to enable them to gain self&#x02010;confidence <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>. The course includes a facilitator's manual and a participant's manual handed out at the start of the course. The nine chapters in the manuals match the nine modules in the course (Table <xref rid="ene13253-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap">1</xref>). The UK course facilitators were Nurse Specialists and electroencephalography technicians who were trained by the German developers of MOSES. The courses ran on two consecutive days at an education centre adjacent to a hospital. Two facilitators ran groups with 6&#x02013;12 participants, and learning was interactive, with feelings and self&#x02010;esteem discussed, as well as facts about the prevalence of epilepsy, triggers, structured diaries and medication management. Participants began most modules by putting stickers on a flip&#x02010;chart, representing their position on a spectrum of feelings, attitudes and behaviours (Fig. <xref rid="ene13253-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Facilitators then encouraged participants to ask questions, and to share and compare their experience and coping strategies. The feasibility and acceptability of the course in the UK was initially tested in an external pilot with members of a national user group as volunteers <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="ene13253-tbl-0001" xml:lang="en" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Course modules</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><thead valign="top"><tr style="border-bottom:solid 1px #000000"><th align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Title</th><th align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Description of contents</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">1.

</p></sec><sec id="ene13253-sec-0014"><title>Being able to ask questions, share stories, feelings and experience</title><p>Another advantage described by 13 participants was the learning method used by course facilitators, as this allowed participants to ask questions, share their stories and open up about their negative feelings.

Thus, nine out of 22 people approached for interviews (about 40%) experienced language or memory problems, which limited the impact of the group course. Five found the course either started too early or went on too long. Suggestions included breaking down the 2&#x02010;day course into shorter sessions and/or running it over 3 days, although not everyone agreed with this. Another suggestion was that the course should be offered to people younger than themselves or those with new&#x02010;onset epilepsy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="ene13253-sec-0019"><title>Discussion</title><p>We recruited participants attending epilepsy clinics who responded to the doctor's invitation to a trial of a structured, expert&#x02010;led course, facilitated in groups.

Participants valued the course particularly for helping them overcome a sense of isolation by meeting other people like themselves. Interactive learning methods enabled them to discuss their mostly negative feelings, and compare their attitudes and practice in a room with other people with experience of epilepsy. Many participants reassessed and changed specific aspects of their self&#x02010;management.</p><sec id="ene13253-sec-0020"><title>Strengths and weaknesses of this evaluation</title><p>This is the first study to report in&#x02010;depth interviews with people with persistent seizures about their experience of learning to self&#x02010;manage epilepsy in groups, with participants recruited from patients attending epilepsy clinics. In this study, nested within an RCT, the number interviewed was small, but in line with guidelines on qualitative methods that focus on eliciting detailed views <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref>. New evidence emerged about how the group learning method, in which facilitators encouraged sharing of feelings and comparison of attitudes and practice, met participants&#x02019; unmet needs for social peer support, and can promote behaviour change. Such evidence may explain why and how different courses vary in their effect on participants&#x02019; attitudes and behaviour. A potential weakness of the evaluation is that it taps into perceptions of PWE in the short&#x02010;term of up to 6 months post&#x02010;intervention. Even with this short interval six participants reported memory problems. Three had language problems that reduced their understanding in a group course. Baseline one&#x02010;to&#x02010;one assessments during the consenting process had not identified that group discussion requires greater language proficiency.</p></sec><sec id="ene13253-sec-0021"><title>Interpretation of results</title><p>Our evidence suggests that participants valued facilitated, interactive learning that allowed them to share their stories and feelings with others who were experiencing and managing epilepsy. This group process reduced their sense of isolation, and increased their self&#x02010;acceptance and confidence. In other stigmatized conditions, it has been shown that social contact and first&#x02010;person narratives help reduce self&#x02010;stigma <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref>, <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref>, <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref>, and increase self&#x02010;confidence. Self&#x02010;confidence is posited as a key prerequisite for people to initiate and maintain changes in their self&#x02010;management behaviour <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref>.</p><p>For some participants, insufficient understanding of English was a barrier to learning in a group. It may be that one&#x02010;to&#x02010;one advice would be better understood. For several others, their recall of what they learned was impaired, and memory problems have been well&#x02010;described in epilepsy <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref>. This is particularly likely in those with persistent seizures, who may require ways to reinforce their learning and practice over time.</p></sec><sec id="ene13253-sec-0022"><title>Implications for clinical practice and research</title><p>Clinicians work one&#x02010;to&#x02010;one and focus on medication management. This does not help PWE to overcome social isolation, improve their self&#x02010;confidence and learn about self&#x02010;management by talking with other people who have similar experience, in a supportive and safe space. This can be redressed by group interactive courses. In this study, physicians invited participants to a course that would be led by healthcare staff. There is heterogeneity in the courses described so far in the design and outcome measures used to test them <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref>. This is a first attempt to understand the process of why and how group epilepsy self&#x02010;management education works, or fails to do so, from the patients&#x02019; perspective. From the point of view of PWE with persistent seizures, participating in expert&#x02010;facilitated interactive groups provided social support and the opportunity to express negative emotions. This reduced their sense of isolation and improved their confidence to talk about their condition.</p><p>In future, group interventions could be developed and tested specifically to prevent isolation and loss of confidence, early after diagnosis, as has been done in other chronic and stigmatized conditions <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref>, <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref>, <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref>. Epilepsy courses could also be evaluated in the UK for a mixture of all PWE as in Germany <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>.</p><p>We know that this interactive course was appreciated by participants in terms of social and emotional support. However, participants had had epilepsy for a median of 18 years, with persistent seizures, and language or memory problems affected over 40%. In this context, an increase in confidence and reported behaviour change may or may not translate into measurable benefit in the medium term. Interventions that are further integrated with usual primary and secondary care, and reinforced by nurses or pharmacists over time, are more expensive and complicated to evaluate. However, there is evidence that they are likely to be more effective in promoting self&#x02010;management in the medium term <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref>, <xref rid="ene13253-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref>. Although integrated monitoring and advice are important in all chronic conditions, this may be particularly important for chronic epilepsy that is difficult to control.</p></sec></sec><sec id="ene13253-sec-0024"><title>Disclosure of conflicts of interest</title><p>Printing costs of the course manual were funded by Sanofi UK, which had no influence on content.
