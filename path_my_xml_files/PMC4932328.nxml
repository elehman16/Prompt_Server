The primary objectives are to determine the feasibility and sample size of a full-scale RCT in this population. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of study interventions on analgesia, persistence of neuropathic pain, psychological and physical function, quality of life and participants' global impression of change at 1 and 3&#x02005;months after the interventions.

This suggests that the population prevalence of neuropathic pain (NP) is about 5&#x02013;8%<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> but some studies have reported higher estimates (17.9%).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> NP can be central or peripheral or a combination of both. Peripheral NP (PNP) is defined as pain caused by a lesion or disease affecting the peripheral somatosensory nervous system.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> PNP is present in more than 50% of patients with NP, with prevalence reported in the range of 2.5&#x02013;4% in the general population.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> PNP is often severely debilitating; it is largely resistant to treatment,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and its management and sequelae are a significant burden on healthcare resources and society.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>PNP has multiple aetiologies but trauma is an important cause in the working-age population.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Trauma to the hand and foot (crush injuries, fractures, ligament tears or sprains, surgery) is common in work-related injuries<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and can result in chronic pain (ie, pain persisting for more than 3&#x02005;months) of moderate-to-severe intensity that may be predominantly neuropathic or with mixed neuropathic and nociceptive characteristics. Nerve fibres in lower limbs are often involved in traumatic injuries. The sensory fibres of these nerves display enhanced or aberrant neuronal activity from injured primary afferents and this mechanism contributes to the development of PNP.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><sec id="s1a"><title>Treatment options for PNP</title><p>Current treatment strategies for post-traumatic PNP include pharmacological options, physical therapy and cognitive behavioural interventions. However, a significant number of patients have inadequate pain relief (only one participant has analgesic benefit for every three who receive these treatments) and/or experience adverse effects (cognitive impairment, gastrointestinal problems) from existing oral pharmacological treatments.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Lack of effective therapies necessitate exploration of new strategies to treat chronic PNP. Injections of local anaesthetics (LA) and/or steroids around affected nerves (ie, perineurally), neuromodulation and intrathecal therapies are interventional treatments recommended for managing refractory PNP, but perineural injections are the most cost-effective of these options while being associated with the lowest incidence and severity of adverse effects.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Role of perineural steroids in treatment of peripheral NP</title><p>Nerve injury has been shown to activate secretion of inflammatory mediators and increase ectopic discharge from the injured nerve,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> thereby contributing to the development of NP<italic>.</italic><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Corticosteroids, through their anti-inflammatory and membrane-stabilising actions, have the potential to reduce post-traumatic PNP. However, systemic administration of steroids is associated with significant adverse effects (AE) and this has led to exploration of the perineural route to maximise therapeutic efficacy while minimising adverse effects. Application of steroids to injured nerve fibres suppresses inflammation and ectopic discharge,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> thereby alleviating oedema and providing analgesia. Local/perineural delivery of long-acting steroids (duration of action is around 3&#x02005;months) for treatment of post-traumatic/compression PNP has been studied with inconclusive results. However, in many studies, the nature of pain syndromes was unclear, the injections may not have been accurate because of the lack of image-guidance and the dose of steroids was not clearly specified.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Perineural injections of steroids have been used to treat pain from Morton's neuroma (a PNP condition in the foot that is non-traumatic in origin) for 3&#x02005;months in a randomised controlled trial<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and for 9&#x02005;months in a case series<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> with significant analgesic benefit in 30&#x02013;40% of patients. A combination of steroids and LA agents was found to be more effective than LA alone in decreasing pain intensity, neuropathic symptoms and signs, and analgesic requirements in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) that enrolled patients with post-traumatic PNP following injuries to various peripheral nerves.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> However, this trial included patients with a wide spectrum of pain syndromes, factors relevant to pain outcomes (eg, physical and psychological function) were not reported and image guidance was not used during injections. Ultrasound-guided injections of LA around the nerves at the ankle have been used successfully for providing analgesia for operative interventions,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> but there is no published literature on the role of ultrasound-guided delivery of perineural LA or steroids (or a combination) in the management of post-traumatic PNP in the ankle and foot. Finally, it also appears that perineural steroids are more effective in subsets of patients when this intervention is provided within 3&#x02005;years of onset of symptoms, possibly because levels of anxiety or depression are lower and opioid doses are low in the earlier period.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Importance of assessing outcome domains of PNP</title><p>The Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) recommendations for evaluation of outcomes in trials of interventions for relieving pain include assessment of intensity of pain, physical and psychological functioning, participant ratings of global improvement and satisfaction with treatment, symptoms and adverse effects.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> However, very few trials that evaluated interventions for relieving chronic PNP have included all the relevant outcome domains in their methodology. Further, administration of steroids can result in potentially harmful sequelae that include hyperglycaemia, hypertension, osteoporosis, myopathy, increased susceptibility to infections, psychosis, cataracts and necrosis of the skin; none of the existing trials evaluated these adverse effects as an outcome.</p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Rationale for this pilot trial</title><p>Knowledge gaps exist for healthcare providers caring for patients with chronic post-traumatic PNP. High-quality evidence is required to compare analgesic efficacy of perineural steroids compared to perineural LA and steroids in this population, while ensuring standardisation in terms of medication doses and injection techniques. Adverse effects following the interventions also need to be systematically evaluated. Finally, subsets of patients who are more likely to respond to this approach need to be identified. We have addressed some of these gaps through our previous research efforts&#x02014;a systematic review and meta-analysis<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02014;and a retrospective observational study of efficacy of perineural steroids and LA in peripheral compression-related or trauma-related neuropathic pain.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> An adequately powered RCT that compares placebo or saline injections against LA or steroid injections is appropriate to address the issue of efficacy of perineural steroids for post-traumatic NP, but there is insufficient evidence to support a large, potentially expensive, full-scale RCT at present; nor are there data that would allow estimation of analgesic efficacy or sample size. Therefore, we propose a pilot RCT that will yield information to support planning of a full-scale RCT in this population.</p></sec><sec id="s1e"><title>Hypothesis</title><p>There is no hypothesis because this is a pilot RCT to assess the feasibility of a full-scale RCT.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1f"><title>Specific aims and objectives</title><p>This project will be a pilot RCT with the aim of facilitating planning of a full-scale RCT to compare efficacy of image (ultrasound)-guided administration of perineural combination of steroids and LA against perineural LA or 0.9% sodium chloride (this third arm will help negate the potential placebo analgesic effect of injections) in providing sustained analgesic benefit in participants with chronic NP of the foot and ankle.

Duration of pain in months, documentation of name and number of injured nerves, and administration of questionnaires to assess outcomes will also be performed at this visit. Data will be collected for nature of injury (open fracture, closed fracture, soft tissue trauma) and participants' employment status (employed or not). Average intensity of pain in the foot and the ankle will be measured using the numerical rating score (NRS) for pain. The questionnaires will include screening for neuropathic pain with the Doleur Neuropathique 4 (DN4)<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and assessment of its severity by the patient-reported Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI). Psychological function will be assessed through use of the Pain Catastrophizing Score (PCS),<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> anxiety component of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A), and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depression; all three are patient-reported outcomes. Physical function will be assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory subscale for Interference with activities (BPI-I), and Lower Extremity Function Score (LEFS), both of which are patient-reported, as is the Short Form-12 (SF-12) questionnaire, a measure of quality of health. Data will also be collected on daily opioid intake measured in oral morphine equivalents (OME), daily doses of gabapentin and amitriptyline or nortriptyline. Cross-sectional area (CSA) and circumference of the tibial nerve will be measured using ultrasound in patients at 3&#x02005;cm proximal to the medial malleolus<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> in whom this nerve is involved in generating neuropathic pain. Change in CSA and circumference of the tibial nerve (if any) (as measured by the differences between baseline values and measurements at 1&#x02005;month following the third procedure) will be correlated with analgesic response to perineural injections because a decrease in these parameters may indicate a reduction in oedema of the nerve.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Procedure visits 1, 2 and 3</title><p>Periprocedure management will be identical to that received by all patients having a perineural injection in the ankle or foot at our clinic. This includes obtaining peripheral intravenous access and application of routine electrocardiogram, non-invasive blood pressure and pulse oximeter monitors. Intravenous midazolam or propofol will be given intravenously for anxiolysis and sedation.</p><p>Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the following three groups to receive US-guided injections of the study injectates around one or more of the five nerves innervating the foot and ankle. The study injectates will be 0.9% saline, or local anaesthetic (0.25% bupivacaine, or local anaesthetic (0.25% bupivacaine) with steroids (methylprednisolone (Depo-Medrol])4&#x02005;mg/mLs). Two to 6&#x02005;mLs of the study injectate will be injected under ultrasound guidance to surround each of the affected nerves (maximum total injected volume will be 20&#x02005;mLs). Nerves to be targeted by the injections will be decided by the treating physician on the basis of the area of the foot and ankle that displays features of neuropathic pain. Each injection of study medications will be preceded by subcutaneous injections of 0.5&#x02005;mL of the local anaesthetic (2% lidocaine) at each of the injection sites. This will reduce the discomfort of the study participants from the injections. In addition, the subcutaneous local anaesthetic will cause numbness of the skin and this will ensure blinding of the participants and outcome assessors regarding group allocation.

Apparent block failure is not an indication for withdrawal. Reasons for withdrawal will be documented.

Steroids injected around nerves can be absorbed systemically and cause hypertension, hyperglycaemia, myopathy, osteoporosis, psychosis, cataracts and reduced immunity. In the present study, the doses of injected steroids are low and severe adverse effects are unlikely to be seen. Adverse effects will be assessed on the basis of changes in measured values and qualified as significant based on predefined cut-off values (elevation of systolic blood pressure by 30% or more compared to baseline and elevation of capillary blood glucose measurements by 50% or more at 1&#x02005;month after the third procedure).
