This literature review presents available data on the use of bromfenac 0.07% or 0.09% to prevent and treat CME following cataract surgery. Bromfenac is an NSAID approved to treat postoperative inflammation and reduce ocular pain following cataract surgery. Few cases of clinical CME were observed with bromfenac use in a total of 19 reviewed studies. There were no significant differences in CME incidence between bromfenac and corticosteroid-treated patients or between bromfenac- and bromfenac plus corticosteroid-treated patients. Bromfenac demonstrated comparable efficacy to other NSAIDs in preventing CME. Compared with corticosteroids, bromfenac alone or plus a corticosteroid showed similar or better efficacy in minimizing changes in retinal thickness and macular volume. In diabetic cataract surgery patients, bromfenac was comparable or superior to corticosteroids for minimizing changes in retinal thickness; also, combination therapy with bromfenac and corticosteroids may be associated with smaller changes in foveal thickness, macular thickness, and macular volume versus monotherapy with either treatment alone in this patient population. In two randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical trials with bromfenac 0.07%, CME was reported as an adverse event in 0.5% and 1.5% of patients receiving bromfenac and placebo, respectively. In an analysis of four placebo-controlled trials with bromfenac 0.09%, macular edema was reported in 0.7% and 1.4% of patients receiving bromfenac and placebo, respectively. When evaluated as treatment for acute or chronic CME, bromfenac was associated with improvement in visual acuity and reduction in retinal thickness, but few studies are available. Overall, published data suggest that bromfenac is safe and effective when used to prevent or treat CME. Large-scale placebo-controlled trials and greater standardization of CME measures are needed to establish optimal bromfenac regimens for the prophylaxis and treatment of CME following cataract surgery.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>anti-inflammatory agents</kwd><kwd>nonsteroidal</kwd><kwd>NSAID</kwd><kwd>bromfenac</kwd><kwd>cystoid macular edema</kwd><kwd>Irvine&#x02013;Gass syndrome</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cystoid macular edema (CME) following cataract surgery (Irvine&#x02013;Gass syndrome) was originally described by Irvine<xref rid="b1-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> in 1953 and demonstrated angiographically in 1966 by Gass and Norton.<xref rid="b2-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> This condition involves accumulation of excess fluid within the macula due to leakage from dilated peri-foveal capillaries.<xref rid="b3-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Cystoid spaces consisting of clear fluid are often detectable in the macula and appear to represent areas of the retina in which cells have been displaced.<xref rid="b4-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> As one of the most common complications of otherwise uncomplicated cataract surgery,<xref rid="b5-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> CME remains a leading cause of unexpected vision loss following cataract surgery,<xref rid="b7-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> even while improvements in surgical techniques such as phacoemulsification and small-incision surgery have lessened the overall risk.<xref rid="b9-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Following cataract surgery, CME typically develops within 3 months postoperatively, peaking in incidence between 4 and 6 weeks.<xref rid="b8-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b11-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The reported incidence rates of CME following phacoemulsification vary widely depending on how CME is diagnosed and defined and on the patient population studied.

In a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of prophylactic anti-inflammatory medication, topical NSAIDs were found to better reduce the risk of developing CME within 3 months after surgery compared to topical corticosteroids in patients without diabetes and in mixed (diabetic/nondiabetic) populations.<xref rid="b7-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Compared to topical corticosteroids alone, combination therapy with topical NSAIDs and corticosteroids significantly reduced the risk of developing CME in patients with and without diabetes. Similarly, a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials comparing topical NSAIDs with topical steroids in preventing CME following phacoemulsification concluded that the prevalence of CME within 1 month after surgery was significantly lower among patients treated with NSAIDs (3.8%) compared with those treated with corticosteroids (25.3%).<xref rid="b34-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Both potent and weaker corticosteroids were less effective than NSAIDs in reducing the risk of CME. In addition, a large retrospective cohort study found that adding an NSAID to postoperative topical prednisolone acetate was associated with a lower risk of clinical CME compared with prednisolone therapy alone (odds ratio 0.45; 95% confidence interval 0.21&#x02013;0.95).<xref rid="b24-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Clinical CME was defined as evidence of macular thickening on OCT and VA of 20/40 or worse, ascertained between 5 and 120 days after cataract surgery. A recent systematic review of 12 randomized, controlled studies, which specifically evaluated the effectiveness of topical NSAIDs at 3 months and beyond for prevention of visual loss postcataract surgery, concluded that there was no level I evidence of such benefit, although the authors acknowledged that there was evidence that topical NSAIDs reduced the risk of CME detected by angiography or OCT and promoted short-term (&#x0003c;3 months) recovery of visual function.<xref rid="b35-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Notably, the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (ASCRS) did not endorse the conclusions of this analysis, arguing that focusing on VA at 3 months ignored the benefit of NSAIDs in improving visual recovery before that time. The ASCRS further highlighted that a delay in visual rehabilitation could result in patient anxiety, reduced productivity, dependence on others, and costs associated with additional diagnostic testing.<xref rid="b36-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p><p>The benefits of topical NSAIDs in treating CME are less well established than their prophylactic effects. A meta-analysis of randomized, controlled studies that examined the effects of NSAIDs (topical fenoprofen, topical ketorolac, topical diclofenac, and oral indomethacin) as treatment of acute (three studies) or chronic (four studies) CME reported that studies in acute CME were underpowered and had inconsistent results, although two of the three studies demonstrated efficacy of topical ketorolac 0.5%, alone or combined with topical corticosteroids.<xref rid="b37-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> In studies of NSAIDs as treatment for chronic CME, only topical ketorolac 0.5% showed a benefit (two of two studies of ketorolac).<xref rid="b37-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></p><p>The current clinical guidelines on the management of cataract in adults acknowledge evidence suggesting that NSAIDs, either alone or in combination with corticosteroids, are more effective than corticosteroids alone for preventing acute CME.<xref rid="b16-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> However, there is no established protocol for prophylaxis of CME in patients undergoing cataract surgery. In addition, consideration of the efficacy of individual topical NSAIDs is of interest since differences between topical NSAIDs in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics may potentially result in different efficacy profiles. Bromfenac is an NSAID that has been used in the treatment of postoperative pain and inflammation since 2000. However, to date, there are no reviews of studies specifically of bromfenac versus other NSAIDS or corticosteroids for CME prophylaxis/treatment. The objective of this review was to summarize available data to date on the use of bromfenac to prevent and treat CME following cataract surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Overview of bromfenac</title><p>Bromfenac sodium is designated chemically as sodium (2-amino-3-[4-bromobenzoyl] phenyl) acetate sesquihydrate.<xref rid="b38-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> The addition of a bromine atom to the chemical structure increases the molecule&#x02019;s lipophilicity, enhances penetration into ocular tissues, and increases the potency against COX-1 and COX-2 relative to other NSAIDs.<xref rid="b39-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b42-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Following a single ocular dose of bromfenac 0.09% in rabbits, bromfenac was detected within all ocular tissues, with the exception of the vitreous humor, after 24 hours.<xref rid="b43-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> However, two studies of patients scheduled to undergo vitrectomy and who did not have vitreous hemorrhage found that bromfenac 0.09% and other assessed NSAIDs (ketorolac, nepafenac, indomethacin) penetrated into the vitreous cavity.<xref rid="b44-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="b45-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> In one of these studies,<xref rid="b45-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> but not the other,<xref rid="b44-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> bromfenac achieved vitreous levels sufficient to significantly reduce vitreous prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) concentrations.

Few studies of bromfenac for the prevention or treatment of CME directly reported safety outcomes, although the studies that did so found bromfenac to be safe and well tolerated, with minimal risk of increased IOP.<xref rid="b57-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="b58-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="b61-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="b65-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="b66-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="b68-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="b69-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="b77-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">77</xref> In the placebo-controlled studies cited in this review,<xref rid="b55-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="b56-opth-10-2099" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> the incidence of AEs was significantly lower in bromfenac-treated groups compared with placebo groups.</p><p>There remains a need for well-designed studies in this therapeutic area to establish optimal treatment regimens for bromfenac and other therapies for the prophylaxis and treatment of CME following cataract surgery. Future initiatives should consider the standardization of CME definitions and the inclusion of clinically relevant measures of visual function beyond Snellen VA, including OCT, contrast sensitivity, and quality-of-life metrics. With the societal burden of cataract surgery burgeoning, cost-effective preventive therapeutic recommendations for routine and at-risk patients can best be formulated using evidence-based medicine derived from sound prospective trial design, adequate cohort size, and valid statistical analysis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Writing and editing assistance was provided by Churchill Communications (Maplewood, NJ, USA) and funded by Bausch &#x00026; Lomb, Inc.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>Dr Sheppard is an advisory board member, speakers bureau participant, and clinical research investigator for Bausch &#x00026; Lomb, Inc., and also reports receiving consulting fees from Bausch &#x00026; Lomb, Inc.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-opth-10-2099"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Irvine</surname><given-names>SR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A newly defined vitreous syndrome following cataract surgery; interpreted according to recent concepts of the structure of the vitreous; the Seventh Francis I.
