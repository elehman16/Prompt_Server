This open-label, randomized clinical trial was performed in patients in a tertiary-care center medical intensive care unit (MICU) in Korea. Patients (<italic>n </italic>= 54) randomized to the DE group received initial imipenem/cilastatin plus vancomycin with subsequent de-escalation according to culture results, whereas patients randomized to the NDE group (<italic>n </italic>= 55) received noncarbapenem, nonvancomycin empiric antimicrobials.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Between November 2004 and October 2006, 109 MICU patients with HAP were enrolled. Initial antimicrobial adequacy was significantly higher in the DE than in the NDE group for Gram-positive organisms (100% versus 14.3%; <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001), but not for Gram-negative organisms (64.3% versus 85.7%; <italic>P </italic>= 0.190). Mean intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and 14-day, 28-day, and overall mortality rates did not differ in the two groups. Among culture-positive patients, mortality from methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus </italic>(MRSA) pneumonia was higher in the DE group, even after early administration of vancomycin. Multidrug-resistant organisms, especially MRSA, were more likely to emerge in the DE group (adjusted hazard ratio for emergence of MRSA, 3.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 13.91).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The therapeutic advantage of early administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials, especially with vancomycin, was not evident in this study.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Early use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials and subsequent de-escalation (DE) after microbiologic culture results may minimize the emergence of drug-resistant organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] during the treatment of patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). This strategy may reduce the overall duration of antimicrobial treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and mortality rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. These studies, however, were observational, with successful DE indicating less-resistant pathogens and/or less severity of infection.</p><p>The combination of carbapenem and vancomycin is frequently prescribed for the treatment of HAP, in which the prevalence of infection by multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms is high. Although inadequate initial therapy may increase mortality rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], the frequent use of carbapenem plus vancomycin predisposes to the emergence of MDR organisms. Vancomycin may select for resistant pathogens once colonization takes place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and vancomycin use has been associated with increases in vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and vancomycin-intermediate and -resistant <italic>S. aureus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Treatment with carbapenems has also been reported to increase the overall risk for emergence of MDR organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Moreover, the efficacy of vancomycin as empiric therapy for HAP in hospitals with a high prevalence of methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus </italic>(MRSA) has not been completely addressed. Vancomycin is a relatively large molecule, with poor penetration into the alveolar lining and alveolar macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In addition, the cure rate for vancomycin in patients with MRSA pneumonia has been disappointing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. A study of febrile neutropenic patients with MRSA infection showed that these patients did not experience worse outcomes when vancomycin therapy was delayed until definitive diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The use of carbapenem, which has the broadest spectrum of activity against Gram-negative organisms, must also be controlled to limit the selection and spread of MDR pathogens.</p><p>To examine these concerns, we conducted a randomized clinical trial in a large tertiary care center in Korea, where the methicillin resistance rate of <italic>S. aureus </italic>isolated from blood has been reported to be 72% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In this trial, we compared the effects of early treatment with broad-spectrum antimicrobials followed by subsequent DE, with conventional antimicrobial regimens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This prospective, open-label, randomized clinical trial was performed in the 28-bed medical ICU of a 2,200-bed tertiary care hospital in Seoul, Korea (Asan Medical Center). Written informed consent was obtained from each patient or his or her legal guardian. This study was approved by the institutional review board at Asan Medical Center and was performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. From November 2004 to October 2006, patients were randomly assigned to receive either initial treatment with imipenem/cilastatin plus vancomycin, with de-escalation starting 3 to 5 days later, based on initial culture results (de-escalation group, DE), or conventional empiric noncarbapenem antimicrobial therapy (non-de-escalation group, NDE).

To detect this difference, we calculated that inclusion of 60 patients per group was required (two-tailed &#x003b1; = 0.05; 80% power), allowing for 10% dropout. Recruitment period of 2 years was planned. We analyzed a modified intention-to-treat population. Categoric variables were compared by using the &#x003c7;<sup>2 </sup>test or the Fisher Exact test, and continuous variables were compared by using the Student <italic>t </italic>test. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the emergence of MDR organisms with and without de-escalation. To determine whether the proportional hazards assumptions held, we performed tests based on Schoenfeld residuals. All tests of significance were two-tailed, with <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05 regarded as significant. Data were analyzed by using Stata version 11.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).</p></sec><sec><title>Antimicrobial therapy and de-escalation policy</title><p>DE patients were treated with imipenem/cilastatin (0.5 g every 6 hours) and vancomycin (15 mg/kg every 12 hours), with dosages adjusted in patients with renal or hepatic functional impairment. After 3 to 5 days, imipenem/cilastatin and/or vancomycin were de-escalated individually, based on culture results and clinical status (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). If the organism(s) could not be identified (culture negative), the treatment was adjusted according to the day 3 to 5 clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) results. In culture-negative patients with a CPIS &#x0003e; 6 on day 3 of antimicrobial treatment, the initial antimicrobial treatment was not de-escalated, and the patient was re-evaluated for possible etiologic organisms. In culture-negative patients with CPIS of 6 or less, the initial antimicrobial treatment was either discontinued (vancomycin) or de-escalated (imipenem/cilastatin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Flow algorithm of treatment for patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia in this study</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cc11197-1"/></fig><p>NDE patients received initial antimicrobials empirically according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for the management of adults with hospital-acquired, ventilator-associated, and healthcare-associated pneumonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], except that none received carbapenem antimicrobials or vancomycin, and no de-escalation was used.

The higher antimicrobial adequacy observed in the DE group was mainly due to MRSA coverage by early administration of vancomycin. However, no significant between-group differences were noted in overall duration of antimicrobial therapy and mortality rates, with the DE group showing a higher rate of MRSA acquisition. Although vancomycin was administered early, the mortality associated with MRSA infections was higher among DE patients. Thus, early administration of vancomycin failed to show therapeutic benefits in our study, and early MRSA coverage before microbiologic documentation seems to be unnecessary.</p><p>Early use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials with subsequent de-escalation is considered a promising strategy for optimizing the responsible use of antimicrobials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. An observational study of 398 ICU patients with suspected VAP reported that the mortality rate was significantly (<italic>P </italic>= 0.001) lower in patients with DE (17%) than in those with no change in therapy (23.7%) or escalation (42.6%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. That study, however, was observational, with no randomization, and other factors, such as baseline disease severity, may have influenced treatment outcomes, rather than the DE itself.</p><p>Previous studies, however, have reported that DE was associated with higher antimicrobial adequacy and more favorable outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The difference between these results and ours may be attributable to various factors. First, our strategy may have improved antimicrobial adequacy for Gram-positive organisms, most of which were MRSA. Despite increased antimicrobial adequacy of vancomycin against Gram-positive organisms in the DE group, vancomycin had only limited overall efficacy in the treatment of HAP, with no difference in treatment outcomes. Moreover, the mortality rate was higher in our DE than in our NDE group. Vancomycin has been the only antimicrobial available for the treatment of MRSA pneumonia for years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], but its cure rate has been disappointing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Also, despite the broad antimicrobial spectrum of imipenem, its adequacy for Gram-negative organisms was similar in our DE and NDE groups (64.3% versus 85.7%; <italic>P </italic>= 0.19). In a previous study, the adequacy of treatment for Gram-negative organisms was found to be higher in patients treated with a DE regimen, in which the major comparison was between cefotaxime and imipenem, which were used in 39% and 100% of NDE and DE patients, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In contrast, piperacillin/tazobactam (87.3%) and ciprofloxacin (61.8%) were the most frequently used initial antimicrobials in our NDE group. Previous studies have suggested that piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem/cilastatin have similar efficacy and safety profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Only one patient had ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and broad-spectrum antimicrobials may have different sensitivity patterns at other centers. In addition, the definition of "de-escalation" differed among studies, in that most defined DE with regard to Gram-negative organisms. For example, the activity spectrum of antimicrobials was ranked against Gram-negative bacteria, with DE defined as a switch to or discontinuation of a drug class with a less-broad spectrum of coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Others have defined de-escalation similarly, by ranking the antimicrobial spectra of these agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In contrast, imipenem/cilastatin and vancomycin were de-escalated individually, with the former de-escalated only in patients with Gram-negative organisms. Categorizing all these definitions by using the single term "de-escalation" is confusing and may result in divergent findings.</p><p>The strengths of our study include its prospective design, high initial prevalence of MDR organisms, and relatively high severity of infection. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized clinical trial comparing the DE of imipenem plus vancomycin with that of non-carbapenem, non-vancomycin in a medical ICU. This study, however, had several limitations. First, it was performed in a single center MICU, which may have biased patient selection. The proportion of patients with VAP was relatively small, and carbapenems other than imipenem, such as doripenem, may yield different results. Therefore, the generalizability of this study may be limited. Furthermore, the baseline prevalence of MDR organisms was higher in the DE than in the NDE group, which may have influenced treatment outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. However, we sought to minimize this effect by excluding these patients from subsequent analyses for emergence of MDR organisms. Moreover, this study was not double-blinded. Indeed, the attending physicians showed a tendency not to de-escalate. Nevertheless, the DE rates were relatively high (83.3% for vancomycin and 84.8% for imipenem/cilastatin). Another limitation was our inability to identify pathogens in 50% of our study patients. The percentage of patients who underwent bronchoalveolar lavage at the time of enrollment was relatively low; thus, our rate of obtaining adequate specimens was not high. A possibility of cross-contamination exists as a source of MDR organisms. We also used the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) standards, rather than the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) standards to define antimicrobial susceptibility, which may have resulted in a small difference in the incidence of MDR organisms. In addition, our secondary end points, including mortality rates and emergence of MDR organisms, may not have been sufficiently powered to detect significant differences. Also, rectal swabs to identify carriers were not routinely checked. Finally, the dosage of imipenem (2 g/day) may have been insufficient for patients with Pseudomonas pneumonia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Although early use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials significantly increased initial antimicrobial adequacy, treatment outcomes were not improved.
