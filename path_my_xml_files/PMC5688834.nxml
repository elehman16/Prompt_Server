Type-1 diabetes is due to the destruction of pancreatic islet beta cells predominantly by an autoimmune process and these patients are prone to ketoacidosis. Type-2 diabetes is the more prevalent form and results from insulin resistance with a defect in compensatory insulin secretion. Many patients with type-2 diabetes have an insidious onset of hyperglycemia and remain asymptomatic for longer period. Hence, many individuals with type-2 diabetes mellitus have complications at the time of presentation. Diabetes is now the leading cause of blindness, neuropathy, end-stage renal disease, and nontraumatic leg amputation. In addition, morbidity and mortality due to adverse cardiac events and stroke are also very common in diabetes.</p><p>Currently, a number of antidiabetic agents such as oral hypoglycemic agents and various insulin preparations are available for the management of diabetes, but their long-term applications cause various adverse effects. Therefore, the search for effective and safer drugs to manage hyperglycemia is one of the important areas of research. In Ayurveda, many plants and plant-based medications have been advocated for the management of diabetes since time immemorial. In the present study, the classical herbomineral drug, <italic>Shilajatu</italic> (<italic>Asphaltumpunjabinum</italic>) and <italic>Asanadi Gana Dravya</italic>, has been selected for the management of <italic>Madhumeha</italic> (type-2 diabetes mellitus).
