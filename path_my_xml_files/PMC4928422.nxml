Hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage with high disability and fatality rate seriusly threatens lives of patients.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> A study demonstrates that, annual incidence of hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage was (1 ~ 35)/100 thousand, which accounts for 20% ~ 30% of all stroke patients in Asia.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Mortality and fatality of hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage both rank the first among all stroke types. One-month mortality is between 35% and 52%; most of them die in the early stage; more than 30% survivors still have function impairment; what is worse, its incidence continues to increase with aged tendency of population. Traditional treatment for hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage includes craniotomy evacuation of hematoma and conservative treatment.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> However, conservative treatment and craniotomy evacuation of hematoma cannot achieve ideal curative effect. Thus it is of great importance to treat patient with hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage with effective treatment method.</p><p>With the development of imaging technique in recent years, minimally invasive intracranial hematoma has been applied more and more in clinical treatment. Minimally invasive intracranial hematoma as a new technology used for treating cerebral hemorrhage can eliminate hematoma by setting up effective channels for hematoma clearance, without damaging adjacent tissue.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Compared to traditional craniotomy, minimally invasive intracranial hematoma which can reach hematoma region has little damage to cerebral tissue and can effectively relieve hematoma compression; it is also applicable for patient and even can be used for treating intracranial deep hematoma; moreover, injection of urokinase can accelerate removal of hematoma.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In this study, we selected 156 patients with hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage who received treatment in our hospital between July 2012 and July 2014 as research objects, aiming to discuss our clinical effect of minimally invasive intracranial hematoma in treating hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>General data</title><p>Research object of this study was 156 patients with hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage who received treatment from July 2012 to July 2014.

Patients in control group underwent conventional craniotomy evacuation of hematoma. Hematoma was removed in direct view after cranium was opened; drainage tube was placed in cavity after surgery was over. Patients in observation group were treated with minimally invasive intracranial hematoma. First, position of hematoma in cranium was confirmed using cranial CT; then position of patient was determined according to haematoma location; site that had the largest area of hematoma and moreover was closest to skull was selected as puncture point; after disinfection, covering with surgical drape and local anaesthesia, skull was punctured; silicone tube was inserted into skull until reaching hematoma region; 10 mL injector was used to slowly absorb hematoma and absorption stopped when there was negative pressure; then drainage tube was inserted; cerebral CT scanning was done in the 1<sup>st</sup> day after surgery; urokinase (2 ~ 3 thousand units) and 5 mL normal saline were injected, twice each day, and the tube was clamped for once hour after injection; the drainage tube could be removed if patients had no adverse reaction in the 3<sup>rd</sup> to 7<sup>th</sup> day after surgery.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Main observation index and evaluation criteria</title><p>Neurological impairment score: neurological impairment was scored before treatment and in the 5<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> day after treatment according to clinical neurological impairment scoring criteria of stroke patients formulated by the 4<sup>th</sup> Cerebrovascular Disease Conference.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> If neurological impairment score lowered for 91% ~ 100% and disability was level 0, then patient could be determined as cured.

Hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage as one of the severe complications of patients with high blood pressure is more likely to induce disability and death; about 35% ~ 52% patients with hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage die within 30 days after onset and only 20% patients can take care of themselves in 6 months after onset.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Previous studies demonstrate that, main causes for hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage include micro-aneurysm formed in cerebral arteriole at basal ganglion, weakened structure of external membrane and middle-layer membrane of cerebral arterial wall, spasm of cerebral arteriole induced by high blood pressure and fibrinoid necrosis of cerebral arteriole induced by high blood pressure.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Therefore treatment timeliness of hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage is required high. In previous studies, drug treatment is used for treating hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage, but with poor curative effect. Before application of CT, mortality of medicinal treatment was between 70% and 80%.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Traditional craniotomy which can remove hematoma relatively thoroughly is applied afterwards.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> But it has several disadvantages including big trauma, obvious impairment on cerebral tissue, long operation time, multiple complications and poor prognosis and its curative effect is difficult to be improved even when indications are strictly limited. It has been reported that, mortality of patients with hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage who undergo traditional craniotomy is about 50%, which is close to drug treatment.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> It is seldom used now except for some special situations.</p><p>Now small bone window hematoma evacuation is frequently used. Small bone window hematoma evacuation, an improvement of conventional craniotomy evacuation of hematoma, removes hematoma by cutting incision in site with hematoma in the shallowest site and smallest damage and removing bone window. It is suitable for cerebral hemorrhage in cortex or closing to cortex and is a good operation method currently. But it is not applicable for removing hemorrhage in deep site. Thus it is necessary to find out a new method which is effective and safe for hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage.</p><p>In recent years, studies on application of minimally invasive intracranial hematoma in hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage has increased.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Most are positive, but some show low level of recognition. Hence it is great value to research application of minimally invasive intracranial hematoma in hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage. Minimally invasive intracranial hematoma with advantages of simple operation, small trauma and short operation time is an effective method for treating hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In this study, we observed clinical effect of minimally invasive intracranial hematoma in treating hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage and compared it with conventional craniotomy evacuation of hematoma. Results suggested that, overall efficacy in observation group (94.87%) had a significant difference with control group (80.77%), and moreover average operation time, hematoma disappearance time and amount of hematoma clearance for the first time in observation group were all superior to control group, indicating minimally invasive intracranial hematoma is effective in treating hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage.</p><p>In addition, we also found that, improvement of neurological function of patients receiving minimally invasive intracranial hematoma was much obvious than those who received conventional craniotomy evacuation of hematoma, which confirms the short-term effect of minimally invasive intracranial hematoma; Barthel index of patients in observation group showed continuous improvement at different time points, which also confirms continuous improvement effect of minimally invasive intracranial hematoma. These are all associated with rapid and effective hematoma clearance of minimally invasive intracranial hematoma. As removing hematoma with puncture suction is rapid, minimally invasive and safe, neurological impairment induced by hematoma can be relieved rapidly and effectively, which is an important basis and improves prognosis of patients. What is more, improvement of neurological function can lay a basis for improvement of living capability of patients in the future. Therefore, its comprehensive advantage is outstanding.</p><p>In the perspective of neurological impairment score, observation group had a rapid decline compared to control group, suggesting patients&#x02019; benefits from minimally invasive treatment. That is because timely removal of hematoma eliminates space occupying effect of hematoma, blocks initial factors that can induce edema and prevents secondary injury, thereby protecting survived cerebral tissue to the largest extent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>To sum up, minimally invasive intracranial hematoma with advantages of simple operation, small trauma and high efficiency can effectively improve neurological function of patients with hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage. It is safe and reliable, thus can be promoted and practiced clinically.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold><italic>Grant Support &#x00026; Financial
