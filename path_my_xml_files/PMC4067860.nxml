These symptoms impact on health-related quality of life, result in excess service utilisation and are a significant burden to healthcare systems. Certain mechanisms which underpin IBS can be explained by a biopsychosocial model which is amenable to psychological treatment using techniques such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). While current evidence supports CBT interventions for this group of patients, access to these treatments within the UK healthcare system remains problematic.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A mixed methods feasibility randomised controlled trial will be used to assess the feasibility of a low-intensity, nurse-delivered guided self-help intervention within secondary care gastrointestinal clinics. A total of 60 participants will be allocated across four treatment conditions consisting of: high-intensity CBT delivered by a fully qualified cognitive behavioural therapist, low-intensity guided self-help delivered by a registered nurse, self-help only without therapist support and a treatment as usual control condition. Participants from each of the intervention arms of the study will be interviewed in order to identify potential barriers and facilitators to the implementation of CBT interventions within clinical practice settings. Quantitative data will be analysed using descriptive statistics only. Qualitative data will be analysed using a group thematic analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This study will provide essential information regarding the feasibility of nurse-delivered CBT interventions within secondary care gastrointestinal clinics. The data gathered during this study would also provide useful information when planning a substantive trial and will assist funding bodies when considering investment in substantive trial funding.

<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Research has also established that food intolerance, the balance of gut microflora and certain changes within the immune system might be underlying mechanisms in IBS.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> However, routine investigations fail to identify abnormal pathology for IBS and patients are left with a range of symptoms which are managed empirically by antispasmodics, low-dose antidepressants and other medications. The daily activities of patients with IBS are often adversely affected and patients may be troubled by concerns related to the cause and the effects of their condition.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Patients with IBS tend to report a poor quality of life (QOL) and often experience absenteeism.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Moreover, IBS places a significant strain on healthcare resources and service utilisation, with patients with IBS consuming over 50% more resources than carefully matched controls.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Health professionals may also find themselves challenged with the management of such a complex and persistent disorder.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><sec id="s1a"><title>Psychological aspects of IBS</title><p>Psychosocial factors and stress are related to the maintenance and manifestation of IBS symptoms in many patients.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Indeed, historically, clinicians felt that IBS was purely a physical manifestation of emotional problems.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In recent years, the association IBS has with psychological issues has been supported with experimental data. For example, Guthrie <italic>et al</italic>'s<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> study involving 107 participants demonstrates that the perception of bowel sensations may relate directly to psychological distress. The literature reports a prevalence of psychological comorbidity ranging anywhere between 50% and 90% for common mental health problems such as anxiety and depression.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Traumatic events or stressful experiences which shape an individual's life experiences may also play a fundamental role in IBS. Indeed, it is not uncommon for patients with IBS to report some history of physical or sexual abuse.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Stressful life events, in general, are associated with symptom onset and severity.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> These psychological factors and the complex manifestation of IBS symptoms are widely acknowledged as a disease process which involves an individual's social environment, physiology and psychology.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> These elements form part of the &#x02018;biopsychosocial model&#x02019; which offers a holistic and rational explanation for the presentation and persistence of IBS symptoms in many individuals.</p><p>Because the mechanisms of IBS can be explained by a biopsychosocial model, effective treatment approaches may include psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Best practice guidelines suggest that CBT, hypnotherapy and psychotherapy are useful interventions for patients with IBS.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> CBT is particularly useful for addressing negative thought patterns<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and catastrophising cognitions and avoidant behaviours.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> CBT can also be used to target maladaptive thought processes<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and help patients understand the interactions between their thoughts and their symptoms.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> CBT is well supported empirically as an effective intervention for patients with IBS.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Although the results of many of these investigations are promising, a recent systematic review identified issues regarding the methodological quality and power of trials which support these interventions.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Rationale</title><p>There is a need for CBT to be further evaluated using robust methods.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Furthermore, there is a need for future research to evaluate psychological therapies which address concerns regarding treatment provision and accessibility.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Many patients within the National Health Service (NHS) healthcare system have no routine access to psychological interventions for the treatment of their IBS symptoms. Notwithstanding these concerns, there is encouraging activity within the wider UK healthcare system to suggest that the government and policymakers are beginning to recognise the impact that psychological therapies such as CBT have on improving health and reducing loss of productivity.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> This study will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a novel, nurse-delivered, low-intensity CBT, guided self-help intervention for the treatment of IBS. It is hoped that the nursing intervention will provide a feasible mechanism for the delivery of CBT which may be economically viable, more accessible to patients and implementable within the UK healthcare system. Qualitative research performed during the course of this study will provide researchers and funding bodies with essential information on the acceptability and practical application of CBT interventions in patients with IBS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study aim</title><p>To carry out a feasibility study to explore the use of various CBT treatment delivery mechanisms for patients with IBS within secondary care GI clinics.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study objectives</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>To develop a tailored, nurse-delivered CBT treatment for patients with IBS.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To examine the number of patients needed to screen in relation to the numbers successfully randomised into the study.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To gather reasons for patients not wishing to take part in CBT treatment approaches for their IBS.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To explore the experience of participants undergoing the study's treatment conditions.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To identify barriers and facilitators to the implementation of the trial interventions within real clinical settings.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To measure the follow-up and response rates to study questionnaires.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To describe the range of data with relevant descriptive statistics.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To test the data collection procedures and time required to collect study data.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study design</title><p>The randomised controlled trial (RCT) is considered one of the most powerful tools used in research to establish new knowledge claims.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The proposed RCT will establish the cause and effect relationship between CBT and patient outcomes. A mixed methods research (MMR) approach, underpinned by a pragmatic philosophy, will draw from the strengths of qualitative and quantitative approaches.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> MMR is defined as &#x0201c;collecting, analysing and mixing both quantitative and qualitative data in a single study or series of studies.&#x0201d;<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> The growing popularity of MMR approaches would suggest that many researchers now recognise the value of this pragmatic approach.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> MMR provides robust and rigorous approaches to research<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and creates a richer understanding of phenomena.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Many of the RCTs which have investigated the use of CBT for patients with IBS lack a qualitative research component.

Some researchers have experimented with much lower intensity treatment methods and have altered delivery mechanisms in order to improve the provision of CBT interventions such as internet CBT.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> However, there is concern regarding the delivery of online interventions relating to confidentiality, a loss of visual and auditory clues during therapy and a lack of suitability for managing crisis situations.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> A recent survey of 658 patients suggests that internet-delivered CBT would be unacceptable to over 40% of those surveyed.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Other delivery mechanisms include group-based treatments,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> although some authors suggest that individual contact is better suited to tailoring therapy to the needs of the client.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> CBT has been effective when delivered by trained nurses within primary care settings.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> It is therefore possible that similar effects might be achievable if therapy were to be delivered by GI nurses within secondary care utilising a lower intensity, guided self-help treatment approach which could be less time consuming to deliver and further increase access to evidence-based interventions for patients.</p><p>Registered nurses working within gastroenterology are well placed to deliver psychotherapeutic interventions to these groups of patients as they are familiar with the complexity of chronic GI symptoms and the impact they have on patients and their daily activities.

The structure and content of the interviews was initially developed as a result of the researcher's prior knowledge of GI research and the subject area as a result of a literature review.

Five participants from each of the intervention arms of the study will be recruited to qualitative interviews. This study has also received ethical permission to make enquiries into the reasons patients may have for not taking part in the research. It will be made clear that patients are under no obligation to provide this information to the research team.

The emphasis within our study is to focus on helping patients to live with the impact of their IBS symptoms rather than specifically targeting those only with psychological comorbidity (such as underlying anxiety or depression). It will be made clear when writing to the participant's doctor that participation in our study does not necessarily suggest or confirm that participants are psychologically unwell. This may be particularly important where a diagnosis of psychological illness may have negative implications for the participant, that is, those with rigorous occupational requirements. However, levels of psychological illness will be recorded during a participant's journey through the study as we are interested in the effects that treatment may have on these underlying issues. We will ensure that participants are made fully aware of these issues during recruitment and selection and that these details are included within the study information sheets. A participant's hospital care team and general practitioner will be notified where a moderate-to-severe level of anxiety or depression is detected during measurement, as per current practice within our GI clinics.</p><p>Host organisation approval was sought from the Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust prior to the start of any research-related activity.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e270" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-005262.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e271" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-005262.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>An adapted version of the irritable bowel syndrome self-help intervention originally developed by Dr Melissa Hunt at the University of Pennsylvania is being used within this study, as permitted under a research license issued by the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> ADD developed the initial protocol draft.
