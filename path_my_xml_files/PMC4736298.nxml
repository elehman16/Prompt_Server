The primary efficacy measure was change in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score, analyzed using a last observation carried forward approach. Other efficacy measures included the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (secondary) and PANSS subscales (additional). There were no significant differences between the two doses of cariprazine and placebo in PANSS total score change or any other efficacy parameter after multiplicity adjustment. However, low-dose cariprazine versus placebo showed significantly greater reductions in PANSS total (<italic>P</italic>=0.033) and PANSS negative (<italic>P</italic>=0.027) scores without multiplicity adjustment. Common treatment-emergent adverse events (incidence&#x02265;5% and twice that in the placebo group in either cariprazine dose group) were akathisia, restlessness, tremor, back pain, and extrapyramidal disorder. In this study, the overall cariprazine treatment effect was not statistically significant, but patients treated with low-dose cariprazine showed significantly greater improvement in schizophrenia symptoms relative to placebo-treated patients. Cariprazine was generally well tolerated. Results of this study suggest that cariprazine may be effective in treating schizophrenia and future research is warranted.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords:</title><kwd>antipsychotic</kwd><kwd>cariprazine</kwd><kwd>dopamine D<sub>3</sub></kwd><kwd>schizophrenia</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>OPEN-ACCESS</meta-name><meta-value>TRUE</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since their introduction in the 1990s, second-generation atypical antipsychotics have been considered the first-line treatment for schizophrenia. Atypical antipsychotics have similar efficacy to their first-generation predecessors and are thought to be associated with a lower propensity to induce extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), including tardive dyskinesia (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Ban, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Kane and Correll, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Nasrallah <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Despite these advantages, their use is encumbered by metabolic issues, sedation, hypotension, weight gain, and limited efficacy, particularly negative symptoms and cognitive impairment (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Kapur and Mamo, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Lieberman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Kirkpatrick <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Stroup <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Keefe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Crossley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Tandon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). During phase I of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness study (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Lieberman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), antipsychotic discontinuation rates of 64&#x02013;82% were reported because of the lack of efficacy, intolerable side effects, and other reasons. Therefore, new treatments with novel mechanisms of action may aid in improving the pharmacotherapeutic management of schizophrenia.</p><p>Cariprazine, a potent dopamine D<sub>3</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptor partial agonist with preferential binding to D<sub>3</sub> receptors, is approved by the FDA for the treatment of schizophrenia and manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder; it is also in development for the treatment of bipolar depression and the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder. The pharmacological profile of cariprazine is distinct from that of other antipsychotics in that it has an almost 10-fold greater affinity for D<sub>3</sub> than D<sub>2</sub> receptors <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Kiss <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), and has high and balanced in-vivo occupancy of both D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> receptors in rats (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Kiss <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>) and humans (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Slifstein <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Although blockade of the dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor is thought to be necessary for antipsychotic activity (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Nord and Farde, 2011</xref>), affinity for additional neuroreceptors may enhance antipsychotic effects and further differentiate antipsychotics in terms of efficacy and tolerability. The dopamine D<sub>3</sub> receptor is thought to be important in modulating mood and cognition and has emerged as a potential target for antipsychotic drug treatment (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Gurevich and Joyce, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Joyce and Millan, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Laszy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Sokoloff <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Studies in animal models have shown that cariprazine confers dopamine D<sub>3</sub> receptor-mediated cognitive-enhancing and antidepressant-like effects (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Duman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Zimnisky <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).

Patients were enrolled at 34 US study centers; the study protocol was approved by Institutional Review Boards at each study center. ICH-E6 Good Clinical Practice guidelines were followed, and all patients provided written informed consent.</p><p>The study consisted of a no drug washout/screening period of up to 7 days, followed by 6 weeks of double-bind treatment and a 4-week safety follow-up period. Eligible patients were randomized (1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1) to receive placebo, low-dose cariprazine (1.5&#x02013;4.5&#x02009;mg/day), or high-dose cariprazine (6&#x02013;12&#x02009;mg/day) for the 6-week double-blind treatment period. Cariprazine dosing was once daily and was initiated at 1.5&#x02009;mg/day for all patients. Dose adjustments were based on investigator judgment of response and tolerability. In the low-dose group, cariprazine could be uptitrated to 3&#x02009;mg starting on Day 3, and to a maximum dose of 4.5&#x02009;mg starting on Day 5.

In patients with tolerability issues, reduction to a previous dose or a drug holiday of 1&#x02013;2 days was allowed.</p><p>Patients were hospitalized during washout/screening and remained hospitalized for a minimum of 21 days after randomization to double-blind treatment; after 21 days, patients with a Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S; <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Guy, 1976b</xref>) score of 3 or lower and no significant risk for suicide or violent behavior could be discharged.

To control overall type I error rate, a sequential, stepwise multiple-comparison procedure was used. First, an overall <italic>F</italic>-test comparing the three treatment groups was performed at the 5% level of significance, followed by pairwise comparisons between each cariprazine dose group and placebo. A pairwise comparison was considered statistically significant with multiplicity adjustment only if both the overall and the respective pairwise comparisons were statistically significant. Two sensitivity analyses based on observed cases were performed using an analysis of covariance model and a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM). For MMRM, treatment group, study center, visit, and the treatment group-by-visit interaction were fixed effects and baseline value was a covariate.

No patient met Hy&#x02019;s Law criteria [alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase at least three times the upper limit of normal (ULN), concurrent with total bilirubin at least two times the ULN and alkaline phosphatase less than two times the ULN].</p><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Mean changes in safety parameters during the double-blind treatment period (safety population)<sup>a</sup></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="yic-31-061-g006"/></table-wrap><p>Slightly greater mean increases in blood pressure and body weight occurred in the cariprazine groups compared with placebo, with greater increases in blood pressure and weight in the high-dose group versus the low-dose cariprazine group.

Akathisia was the most common EPS-related TEAE (placebo, 2.3%; 1.5&#x02013;4.5&#x02009;mg/day cariprazine, 13.4%; 6&#x02013;12&#x02009;mg/day cariprazine, 15%). Most (&#x0003e;95%) EPS-related TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity, and no patient experienced tardive dyskinesia or neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Movement disorder-related TEAEs resulted in five discontinuations (one patient in the 1.5&#x02013;4.5&#x02009;mg/day cariprazine group and four in the 6&#x02013;12&#x02009;mg/day cariprazine group).</p><p>The incidence of treatment-emergent parkinsonism (SAS score&#x0003e;3) was 3.9% in the placebo group, 9.4% in the 1.5&#x02013;4.5&#x02009;mg/day cariprazine group, and 9.8% in the 6&#x02013;12&#x02009;mg/day cariprazine group. Use of antiparkinson medications was higher in cariprazine-treated patients (22 and 28.6% in the low-dose and high-dose cariprazine groups, respectively) than in placebo (15.5%), as was use of &#x003b2;-blocking agents (9.4 and 9.8% in 1.5&#x02013;4.5 and 6&#x02013;12&#x02009;mg cariprazine groups, respectively, and 1.6% in placebo). The use of lorazepam for agitation and restlessness was &#x0223c;84, 92, and 91% in the placebo, and low-dose and high-dose cariprazine groups, respectively.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this proof-of-concept study, there was no significant difference in the overall comparison between cariprazine and placebo in the mean change from baseline to Week 6 in PANSS total score (the primary efficacy assessment), or in any of the other efficacy parameters tested.</p><p>Using pairwise comparisons (without multiplicity adjustment), it was found that PANSS total and PANSS negative scores significantly improved in the 1.5&#x02013;4.5&#x02009;mg/day cariprazine group relative to the placebo group; improvement relative to placebo in PANSS negative scores occurred by Week 1 and persisted to the end of the study. There were no significant differences on pairwise comparisons between high-dose (6&#x02013;12&#x02009;mg/day) cariprazine and placebo groups in the PANSS total, positive, or negative score, or in any other efficacy parameter tested.</p><p>Cariprazine was generally well tolerated in this study at doses of up to 12&#x02009;mg/day, with no apparent dose&#x02013;response relationship between the cariprazine groups in safety parameters, with the possible exception of blood pressure, sedation, EPS, headache, and insomnia. Cariprazine treatment was not associated with clinically meaningful changes in metabolic parameters, elevated prolactin levels, or prolonged QTc intervals. Most TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity, and there were no apparent differences in severity among cariprazine doses. Movement disorder-related TEAEs (e.g. extrapyramidal disorder, akathisia, dystonia, and tremor) were reported more frequently in the cariprazine groups, but most events were mild to moderate in severity and discontinuations because of EPS symptoms were infrequent.</p><p>Although this study did not meet the primary efficacy objective, the significant advantage in the low-dose group relative to the placebo group suggested that further cariprazine studies for the treatment of schizophrenia are warranted. Therefore, three subsequent phase II and III trials followed this proof-of-concept study to further evaluate cariprazine in the treatment of schizophrenia (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Durgam <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Kane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). In the three studies, cariprazine showed significantly greater improvement compared with placebo on most efficacy measures, including PANSS total, PANSS positive, and PANSS negative scores, at doses of 1.5, 3, 4.5, and 6&#x02009;mg/day in the fixed-dose studies (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Durgam <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"> 2015</xref>), and 3&#x02013;6 and 6&#x02013;9&#x02009;mg/day in the flexible-dose study (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Kane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). The lack of a statistically significant improvement in this study in the high-dose cariprazine group is surprising in light of the efficacy seen in the low-dose cariprazine group. Robust improvement was observed in patients treated with higher doses of cariprazine (6&#x02013;9&#x02009;mg/day) in later studies (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Durgam <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Kane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), but comparisons between these studies and the high-dose group in this study are difficult as most (84%) patients in this group were taking 12&#x02009;mg/day cariprazine by the end of the study, a higher dose than was permitted in any of the subsequent studies.</p><p>The incongruity between the results of this trial and the subsequent phase 3 studies is perplexing given the similarity in their designs. The inclusion/exclusion criteria were almost identical, with similar baseline characteristics, demographics, and disease histories across the patient populations. The mean baseline PANSS and CGI-S scores were also indicative of similar levels of illness. One notable exception was that this study was conducted only at study centers in the USA, whereas subsequent trials were conducted at both US and non-US study centers. Increasing placebo response and decreasing treatment effect over time have been observed in schizophrenia trials conducted in the USA (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Khin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>); however, without an active comparator, we have no way of knowing whether this study failed because of a high placebo response.</p><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this proof-of-concept, dose-range study, the overall cariprazine treatment effect did not meet statistical significance, although the 1.5&#x02013;4.5&#x02009;mg/day cariprazine group demonstrated significant improvements over placebo on the primary efficacy parameter without multiplicity adjustment; differences in the 6&#x02013;12&#x02009;mg/day cariprazine group did not reach statistical significance relative to placebo. Cariprazine was generally well tolerated across the dose range tested.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Writing assistance and editorial support for the preparation of this manuscript was provided by Jennifer Kaiser, PhD, and Paul Ferguson, MS, of Prescott Medical Communications Group, Chicago, Illinois, a contractor for Forest Research Institute (an Allergan affiliate).</p><p>This study was supported by funding from Forest Laboratories, LLC (an Allergan affiliate) and Gedeon Richter Plc.
