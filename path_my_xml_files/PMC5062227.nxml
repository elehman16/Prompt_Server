The administration of IV fluids is nearly a universal practice for the patients undergoing major surgeries, where they fulfill the requirement to maintain intravascular volume at a time when that volume may be depleted due to preoperative fasting, surgical blood loss, evaporation, urinary excretion, vasodilatation caused by anesthesia, loss of fluid into the third space, and transcapillary leak of albumin caused by inflammatory mediators.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The concept of fluid resuscitation aiming for supranormal hemodynamic parameters was introduced by Shoemaker <italic>et al</italic>. in the 1970s and 1980s.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>The aim of perioperative fluid therapy is to maintain the circulating plasma volume and thus ensure organ perfusion and oxygen delivery to the tissues.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] This has traditionally been achieved by infusion of large volumes of fluids,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] resulting in a positive intraoperative fluid balance, which can, however, be associated with significant morbidity postoperatively.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Generally, fluid therapy includes replacement of basal fluid requirement and fluid losses such as by perspiration, blood loss, and exudation through the surgical wound, as well as maintenance of physiological functions and to avoid hypotension.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Surgeries are considered to be the combination of multiple factors including tissue damage, fasting, blood loss, effects of medication, and temperature changes from a metabolic point of view.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Combinations of all these factors gives rise to stress response. The stress response to surgery is characterized by increased secretion of pituitary hormones and activation of the sympathetic nervous system.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Stress response to surgery includes a wide range of hormonal and metabolic changes, among which two main systemic effects the neuroendocrine and the hemato-immunological effects can be distinguished.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>The ultimate effect of these various endocrine changes is increased catabolic activity by increased secretion of catabolic hormones such as cortisol and glucagon. The effect of these endocrine and metabolic changes ultimately leads to increased neoglucogenesis and hyperglycemia. Hence, this stress response may be quantified by the incidence of hyperglycemia. The metabolic changes appear to be proportional to the severity of the surgical trauma with plasma cortisol and blood glucose concentration rising slightly during minor surgical procedures but significantly during major intra-abdominal operations.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Acute hyperglycemia has many harmful effects such as impaired endothelial nitric oxide generation with decreased vasodilatation, increased expression of endothelial and leukocyte adhesion molecules, reduced complement function, impaired neutrophil function, and increased cytokine synthesis.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Together these changes enhance the inflammatory response to injury and likelihood of infection. Many of these responses are shown at glucose concentrations of 180&#x02013;200 mg/dl. The use of insulin to reduce hyperglycemia has been shown to decrease endothelial activation, stimulate glucose uptake, protect hepatic mitochondria, improve the circulating lipid profile, and decrease circulatory inflammatory markers.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Tight perioperative glucose control is associated with a reduction in renal impairment and renal failure in nondiabetic cardiac surgical patients.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>The type of anesthesia may influence the hyperglycemic response during surgery. General anesthesia has been shown to result in higher blood glucose concentration than local and epidural analgesia.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Circulating catecholamines, cortisol and glucagon concentration are higher in patients undergoing general anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Intraoperative glycemic control has an important role in improving surgical outcomes even in nondiabetic patients. Patient outcomes including length of stay, stroke, renal insufficiency, and mortality have been shown to improve with tight glycemic control, so it has an economic impact. There were many studies on intraoperative blood glucose levels in diabetics, and studies on nondiabetic patients were conspicuously lacking especially noncardiac surgeries.</p><p>In this context, we have studied the effect of various maintenance fluids on glucose concentration in nondiabetic patients undergoing major surgeries under general anesthesia.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aims and objectives of the study</title><p>This study was conducted to observe the effect of Ringer lactate (RL) and 0.45% normal saline in 5% dextrose with 20 mmol/L potassium on intraoperative blood glucose levels in nondiabetic patients undergoing elective major noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia.</p><p>Intraoperative blood glucose levels and incidence of perioperative hyperglycemia (capillary blood glucose [CBG] &#x02265;150 mg%) in two groups of patients receiving different maintenance fluids was studied.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>One hundred nondiabetic patients (50 in each group) of American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) physical status I and II of either sex, aged between 18 and 60 years undergoing elective major abdominal (duration of surgery &#x0003e;90 min) surgery were enrolled for this prospective, randomized, double-blind study. The sample size was based on the power analysis calculated by the previous study so that 50 patients in each group would provide a power of &#x0003e;0.8 (&#x003b1; =0.05) to detect an increase of intraoperative and postoperative blood glucose levels. The patients were randomized into the two study groups. Method of blinding was done by covering the fluid bottles with a paper. Group I patients received RL solution as maintenance fluid and Group II patients received 0.45% sodium chloride with 5% dextrose and 20 mmol/L potassium chloride, as per calculated hourly infusion rate according to their body weight. Fluid deficit arising from overnight fasting was corrected by the maintenance fluid according to 4-2-1 formula (Holliday&#x02013;Segar's formula) Fifty percent of the total deficit was corrected in the 1<sup>st</sup> h, and the remaining 50% was corrected in next 2 h. Blood loss and other plasma losses were approximately calculated from mops and suction drain bottle. These losses up to the transfusion threshold (blood loss up to 15% of body weight) were replaced volume per volume with haemaccel (3.5% gelatin-based colloidal IV solution). We targeted a urine output of at least 1 ml/kg/h intraoperatively, and urine output was measured after every 30 min. If urine output was found to be below desired target, 200 ml bolus of 3.5% gelatin-based colloidal solution was given over 10 min. We also maintained systolic blood pressure between 100 and 130 mm Hg. If at any point during surgery patients became hypotensive (systolic blood pressure &#x0003c;100 mm Hg), additional bolus of 200 ml colloid was administered. When the hypotension was not corrected by fluid bolus alone, 5 mg of ephedrine was administered IV.</p><p>All patients were premedicated with 0.2 mg glycopyrrolate IV, 1 mg midazolam IV, pantoprazole 8 mg IV, butorphanol 1 mg IV, and ondansetron 4 mg IV 5 min before induction of anesthesia. Following preoxygenation, induction of anesthesia was done with 2 mg/kg propofol IV and tracheal intubation was facilitated by 1 mg/kg IV succinylcholine. Anesthesia was maintained with 66% nitrous oxide and sevoflurane in 33% oxygen, on controlled ventilation. Vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg followed by 0.05 mg/kg at 30 min intervals or as clinically judged. Patients were on controlled ventilation.</p><p>All patients had baseline CBG measured immediately before the start of IV infusion of any fluid. Thereafter, CBG levels were measured half-hourly until the end of surgery. Glucose concentration was determined in fresh capillary blood by reflectance photometry using an Accu-Chek<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> active blood glucose monitor. If at any time during the study, CBG was found to be more than or equal to 150 mg/dl, calculated dose of human soluble insulin (=CBG/100 units) was given as IV bolus.</p><p>We considered CBG value of 150 mg/dl as treatment initiating point because a recent analysis of the cohort found a positive correlation between the average postoperative glucose level and mortality, with the lowest mortality in patients with an average postoperative blood glucose of 150 mg/dl.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>All the data were compiled and statistically analyzed using SPSS software version 22.0, Chi-square test and paired <italic>t</italic>-test.

The baseline blood glucose levels in both the groups were nonsignificant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). In Group I, a persistent 10&#x02013;15% decline (but nonsignificant) in value of CBG levels was noted at 15 min and thereafter there was a persistent increase in levels at all intervals while in Group II, there was increase in CBG levels at all intervals as the surgery progressed and found to be highly significant. These findings were in concordance with a study conducted in October 2015 by Rao and Indra[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] to compare blood glucose levels under general anesthesia in nondiabetic and controlled diabetics. There was a decline in blood sugar level at 5 min postintubation; in our study, we noted blood sugar level at 15 min. In their study, postintubation blood sugar levels showed a decrease of 1.064% (nonsignificant) that was attributed to suppression of stress response of intubation by fentanyl and propofol. A study conducted by Saringcarinkul and Kotrawera[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] in 2009 found a progressive increase in blood glucose levels in patients receiving 5% dextrose during surgery. They considered blood glucose levels of more than 150 mg/dl as significant. A prospective, randomized, parallel study was conducted in 2013 by Maitra <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] on 200 nondiabetic patients to study intraoperative blood glucose levels in patients undergoing elective major surgery receiving different crystalloid solutions, as maintenance fluids. It was found that CBG levels increased with progression of surgery and mean CBG values at 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, and 3<sup>rd</sup> h were significantly higher in patients receiving 0.45% sodium chloride with 5% dextrose. We also observed that patients receiving RL remained normoglycemic throughout the study period, whereas patients who received 0.45% dextrose saline had significantly elevated plasma glucose levels; similar findings were observed by Chin <italic>et al</italic>. in 2006.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] They conducted randomized controlled trial in 50 nondiabetic adult patients undergoing elective surgery and infused 500 ml of either 5% dextrose in 0.9% normal saline, lactated Ringer's solution, or 0.9% normal saline over 45&#x02013;60 min. Plasma glucose, electrolytes, and osmolarity were measured before infusion and at 15 min and 1 h after completion of infusion. None of the patients had preoperative hypoglycemia despite average fasting times of almost 13 h. Patients receiving lactated Ringer's and normal saline remained normoglycemic throughout the study period. Patients receiving dextrose normal saline had significantly elevated plasma glucose 15 min after completion of infusion (11.1 [9.9&#x02013;12.2, 95% confidence interval] mmol/L). They concluded that initiation of IV fluid replacement with dextrose-containing solutions was not required to prevent hypoglycemia in elective surgery. On the contrary, a relatively small volume of 500 ml causes significant, albeit transient, hyperglycemia, even in nondiabetic patients.</p><p>The postoperative blood glucose levels in Group I was 138 &#x000b1; 9.34 mg/dl and in Group II as 145.00 &#x000b1; 8.42 mg/dl which was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Pili-Floury <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] in 2010 conducted a study on glycemic dysregulation in nondiabetic patients after major lower limb prosthetic surgery. They assessed blood glucose from preoperative period to the end of the postoperative period day 2 and considered blood glucose levels 126 mg% as hyperglycemia. They observed a significant increase in blood sugar levels (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) in 74% of patients.</p><p>In our study, there was no incidence of hyperglycemia, i.e., CBG &#x02265;150 mg% in Group I (patients receiving RL as maintenance fluid), while 60% of patients of Group II had hyperglycemic event.

A study was conducted by Azarfarin and Alizadeh Asl[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] to know the prevalence of hyperglycemia in nondiabetic patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting which concluded that 54.6% patients had hyperglycemia. We also observed the similar finding in our study where CBG was found to be higher than 150 mg%, and calculated dose of human soluble insulin was given as IV bolus and found that requirement of rescue insulin was significantly higher in a group of patients receiving 0.45% dextrose normal saline than patients receiving RL infusion.
