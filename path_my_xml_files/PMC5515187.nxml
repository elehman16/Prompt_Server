On the other hand, the importance of participatory care and high effectiveness of self-management programs have been confirmed. This study was aimed to examine the effect of an educational intervention on self-efficacy, self-care behaviors and blood pressure (BP) of hypertensive obese or overweight women in the primary health-care setting in Isfahan, Iran.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This randomized controlled trial was an educational intervention program. It was performed among 146 hypertensive women of 30-65 age range who referred to 6 health care centers of Isfahan that randomly assigned to a control and intervention groups. The interventional group participated in the 6 weekly sessions including exercises, weight control, medication adherence, and home self-monitoring based on goal setting, and promotion of self-efficacy. The control group received routine care from health-care center and any special intervention has been done for the control group. Output variables were analyzed after intervention, and 6-month follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There are no significant differences between age, weight, body mass index and BP and biochemical variables except lipids as well as behavioral factors at the baseline. After 6 months intervention self-efficacy (&#x0003c; 0.001) and physical activity (&#x0003c; 0.001) improvement of in the intervention group was significantly different in comparison with the control group. After 6 months, there was a significant reduction in systolic (P &#x0003c; 0.001) and diastolic BP (P = 0.010) in the intervention group.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Participatory method of education could help us to convince patients to have better self-care to control disease. Furthermore, since adherence to the treatment of hypertensive patients in our society is low, organizing such courses can teach essential knowledge and skills to lifestyle change and prevention of complications. Performing these courses is recommended for other chronic disease patients in health-care centers to assess self-management programs on self-care behavior.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Hypertension</kwd><kwd>Self-Care</kwd><kwd>Education</kwd><kwd>Women</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hypertension is the important risk factor for premature death, stroke, and heart disease universal.<xref rid="b1-ARYA-13-020" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Hypertension is responsible for half of cardiovascular deaths.<xref rid="b2-ARYA-13-020" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-ARYA-13-020" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The prevalence of hypertension among 30-55 and &#x0003e; 55-year-old population were approximately 23% and 50%, respectively, in Iran,<xref rid="b4-ARYA-13-020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and this prevalence in women is higher than men.<xref rid="b5-ARYA-13-020" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>The previous studies have shown that lifestyle changes such as weight loss, reduction of sodium intake, the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH), regular exercise, reduction of stress, quitting smoking, and drinking in addition to medication affect the control of hypertension.<xref rid="b6-ARYA-13-020" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-ARYA-13-020" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In spite of these recommendations, the majority of hypertension cases remain uncontrolled.<xref rid="b8-ARYA-13-020" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> According to Esteghamati et al.,5 only 6% of Iranian hypertensive patients had controlled blood pressure (BP).

The study population was selected by random cluster sampling from March 2015 to December 2015 in Isfahan. The methodology of the study approved by Isfahan University of Medical Sciences and after obtaining the ethical approval; informed consent form was obtained from each participant and registered in Iranian Randomized Control Trial (IRCT2014061218076N1).</p><p>After coordinating to the authorities, in the first step, six health-care centers considered randomly from 10 health-care centers in Isfahan. All obese or overweight hypertensive patients which registered in the health-care system were invited by telephone. In the introductory session, a subject who was eligible and signed the consent form was participated in the study. In the second step, we used the method of randomized binary blocks so that the national code of the subjects has been sorted decently and each binary block randomly assigned to one of the intervention or control groups. So from each of these health-care centers, between 20-30 hypertensive women (depending on the under covered in every health care center) were selected randomly. The selection of the blocks was done by randomly.</p><p>In the introductory session, obese or overweight hypertensive women enrolled. The inclusion criteria were being hypertensive (BP &#x02265; 140/90 mm Hg)<xref rid="b18-ARYA-13-020" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> at least in recent 6 months, being on medication, having a body mass index (BMI) &#x02265; 25 kg/m2, being in the 30-65 age range, willing to take part in the survey, lacking the ability to walk, having no serious diseases such as diabetes or hypothyroidism or severe complications.

The number of attendants was 8-15 to provide a dynamic group; the length of the session was 2-2.5 hours. One psychologist, a nutritionist and a sports coach (totally three trainers) administered the sessions in all of the health-care centers attended by the researcher. The bases of education were goal setting, promotion of self-efficacy<xref rid="b20-ARYA-13-020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and home self-monitoring. Goal setting principal based on SMART goal (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-related) was explained to them. Then, they set out a reasonable action-specific plan regarding to training topics in every week. Those included physical activity, positive thinking and relaxation, salt restriction and DASH diet, weight control. Furthermore, measurement of BP by a calibrated digital barometer and stretching exercise were trained practically too. According to this method, they were asked to perform and record the trained self-care behaviors on a specific card in home during the week. The following session they attempted to define and show their action plan. The group discussed about the ways to overcome the challenges. They were encouraged by coaches and other attendants. During the follow-up periods, the subjects received text messages (SMS) of the mentioned topics twice a week. One cardiologist-supervised the study and visited them if they had a problem such as medication side effects.</p><p>The patients of the control group did not receive any intervention by the researcher. Although, necessary routine care, according to the national protocol for management of hypertension was taken for them in the health-care centers.<xref rid="b21-ARYA-13-020" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Screening of patients, measurement of BP, patient education and referral to the physician by the nurse on the certain time are headline of it.</p><p>These assessments (weight, BP, physical activity, self-efficacy, healthy nutrition) were done during the baseline before and after intervention and follow-up time. Biochemical tests were measured at baseline too. Conducting assessments and filling out the questionnaires performed by a trained nurse to minimize the possible observer-expectancy effect.</p><p>A standard mercury sphygmomanometer was used to measure BP according to international protocols.<xref rid="b22-ARYA-13-020" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The weight was recorded in kilogram and measured using a weight capacity pre-calibrated digital scale without shoes or a heavy cover. The height was obtained by calculating the average of two readings in meters using a portable audiometer. The BMI was determined by dividing weight (kg) by height squared (m2). After at least 12 hours of overnight fasting, the venous blood specimen was collected at a certain laboratory for the measurement of blood-lipid. The participants were asked to complete a 24-hour urine sample. They were said to void their bladder at the first time in the morning. After that, all urine passed during the 24-hour period (day and night) must be collected and stored in a plastic container without any preservatives matter. Then, the samples were delivered to the referral lab to sodium measurement.</p><p>The general questionnaire was created for the collection of basic demographic and clinical data. The English translated questionnaire (Stanford self-management questionnaire in chronic disease patients) that will be described in the following lines contains self-efficacy and physical activity.<xref rid="b23-ARYA-13-020" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> It was done through the translation-back-translation process. Nine experts were invited to assess the face and content validity index. The Persian version of the questionnaire was revised according to their comments. After the pilot test, the reliability coefficient of total scale was &#x003b1; = 0.79 with the internal reliability of 0.76.</p><p>The scale of self-efficacy consists of six questions scored on a Likert scale from 1 to 10 (&#x0201c;not at all confident&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;totally confident).&#x0201d; The score was the mean of the six items. The higher numbers indicate higher self-efficacy. This scale was defined as one scale to study self-efficacy in arthritis patients for the first time by Lorig et al.<xref rid="b23-ARYA-13-020" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> It evaluates the several domains that are common across lots of chronic diseases, such as the level of confidence in the symptom control, role function, and emotional functioning in control disease. The internal consistency reliability of this questionnaire was 0.91.<xref rid="b24-ARYA-13-020" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>Physical activity scale contains 6 items about the stretching exercise, walking, swimming, use of sports equipment, and other aerobic exercise in the past week (that explained to participants) and minutes of exercise during one week included; never, &#x0003c; 30, 30-60, 60-180, more than 180 minutes with 0-4 scores, respectively. Participants who scored 3-4 coded as adhering to walking recommendations. The test-retest correlation for the physical activities scale was 0.42-0.92.<xref rid="b23-ARYA-13-020" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>The DASH diet questionnaire is a research administrative scale based on DASH foundation. It consists of a diet rich in fruit and vegetables (8-10 servings/day), rich in low-fat dairy products (2-3 servings/day), and low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and salt (sodium chloride).<xref rid="b25-ARYA-13-020" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>13 questions concerning the participants&#x02019; diet in the week before the completing of the questionnaire were addressed: 2 about the intake of cooking and table salt; 4 about the consumption of fast food, canned food, and sausage; 3 about the type and amount of meat being consumed (red, chicken, or fish); 2 about the cooking fat (hydrogenate or unsaturated fat); 1 about the way of cooking (fried or boiled); and 1 about fresh fruit and vegetables. Answers were scored on a 5-point Likert scale, from &#x0201c;never&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;always.&#x0201d; (0-5). The reliability coefficient of total scale was &#x003b1; = 0.84. Higher score means healthier nutrition and reverse. The internal reliability obtained 0.79 after completion by 30 patients.</p><p>Analyst, cardiologist, and assessor were blinded to the group allocation. Patients were assured that the questionnaires were anonymous so that number and type of disease would be held confidential. Blindness: one of the staffs was unaware to participants.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software (version 17.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess the normality of variables. Continuous data were reported based on mean &#x000b1; standard deviation and discrete data such as educational level and marital status were calculated with number and (percent). T-test and chi-square test were used for continues and no continues demographic variables. Therefore, the repeated-measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) after adjusting for age, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and cholesterol before, after intervention, and 6 months later was used to test group and time effects and group-by-time. Before repeated-measures, the assumption of ANCOVA test (Boxes test, Leven and Spherocity were checked. Friedman test was used to compare the rate of physical activity before, after intervention, and after 6 months later. The Wilcoxon test for paired samples was used to compare physical activity before intervention, immediately after intervention and 6-month follow-up. P &#x0003c; 0.050 was considered significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="result"><title>Results</title><p>About 146 remained in the study. 10 of the control group left the study because of moving or not attending at the follow-up time.
