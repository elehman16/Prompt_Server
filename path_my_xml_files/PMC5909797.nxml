A recommended 20 L/min flow rate was decided upon after an unpublished pilot test determined that this was comfortable and allowed high compliance during sleep. Starting at 15 L, flow was titrated over 30 minutes at the baseline visit.

As such, data were included on patients who discontinued the study or paused treatment and those who discontinued HFNC but stayed in the study, in the HFNC group (intention-to-treat).</p><p>Background and pretreatment information is provided as mean and SD.</p><p>Normally distributed data were analyzed in the general linear model framework with the simplest model of treatment group augmented by covariates of age and sex and, where available, baseline value of the dependent variable. Poisson regression modeling of both AECOPD and hospital admissions per patient was completed with the length of time in the study used to give estimated rates per year per treatment group with the same explanatory model as mentioned earlier. Analyses using the 2 groups as randomized are akin to intention to treat. The extra analyses where the 2 groups of treatment were replaced by 1 continuous explanatory variable of actual days of the use of HFNC are akin to per protocol.

AECOPD is known to be the strongest predictor for future exacerbations,<xref rid="b29-copd-13-1195" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b30-copd-13-1195" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and patients with chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure are known to be even more susceptible to AECOPD than normoxic patients,<xref rid="b29-copd-13-1195" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b31-copd-13-1195" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> consistent with the control group in this study where the number of AECOPD events increases over time. However, HFNC significantly reduced the risk of AECOPD, with the risk reducing with increasing with HFNC treatment time. In our opinion, this strongly supports the preventive effect of HFNC treatment on exacerbations, even in very severe COPD patients. HFNC may therefore prove to be a novel and an effective non-pharmacological treatment adjunct for this group of very severely ill patients.</p><p>Second, in Rea et al&#x02019;s study, HFNC was only used 1&#x02013;2 hours/day, compared to the current study with an average use of 6&#x02013;7 hours/day. While Rea et al&#x02019;s study did not find a significant reduction in exacerbations, this study did. This indicates that the duration of the use of HFNC is important for the reduction in AECOPD. However, this needs further scientific substantiation.</p><p>In this study, mMRC score improved significantly throughout the study period in HFNC-treated patients in contrast to controls, where a deterioration was observed. Even when following recommended medical treatment, dyspnea is one of the most common symptoms of severe COPD with a large impact on patient lives.<xref rid="b32-copd-13-1195" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="b33-copd-13-1195" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The most effective treatment of dyspnea is rehabilitation,<xref rid="b34-copd-13-1195" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> yet adherence is difficult in more severely ill patients.<xref rid="b35-copd-13-1195" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> In a recent Cochrane review, the effect of oxygen treatment on dyspnea proved to be modest.<xref rid="b36-copd-13-1195" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> The observed effect of HFNC on symptoms is therefore notable and substantiates the role of HFNC treatment in COPD chronic care.</p><p>This study provides a rare and thorough description of the development in clinical features and pathophysiological findings in advanced COPD patients with hypoxic failure. Despite the control group receiving the recommended treatment for this patient group, they still experienced increased hypercapnia, decreased lung function, walking distance and QoL. This is consistent with previous findings and is associated with poor prognosis.<xref rid="b37-copd-13-1195" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> This study demonstrates that the long-term HFNC treatment decelerates disease progression, as seen with 6MWD, QoL and PaCO<sub>2</sub>. The significant difference in PaCO<sub>2</sub> between the HFNC-treated and controls after 12 months is consistent with a recent study by Nagata et al,<xref rid="b38-copd-13-1195" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> despite only half the patients being hypercapnic at inclusion. In comparison, in a recent meta-analysis on nocturnal NIV, an alternative add-on treatment for severe COPD patients with hypercapnic failure, there were no significant differences between the treatment and control groups in 6MWD, QoL or PaCO<sub>2</sub> after 12 months of treatment.<xref rid="b39-copd-13-1195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> This suggests that HFNC may be superior to NIV in slowing disease progression, although further investigation is required to substantiate this. The physiologic mechanism behind these improvements is as follows: as a flow of 20 L/min provides a positive expiratory pressure (PEP) of less than 2 cm H<sub>2</sub>O,<xref rid="b17-copd-13-1195" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> the PEP effect is possibly of lesser importance. Despite providing open circuit ventilation, HFNC has been shown to increase inspiratory tidal volume in COPD, especially when used during daytime use,<xref rid="b40-copd-13-1195" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="b41-copd-13-1195" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> whereas nighttime use has been shown to relieve respiratory load.<xref rid="b41-copd-13-1195" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Clearance of anatomical dead space is probably important for the reduction in PaCO<sub>2</sub>.<xref rid="b42-copd-13-1195" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> However, the most important effect in COPD chronic care is most likely improved mucociliary clearance, driven by the humidification of the air delivered by high flow to distal airways.<xref rid="b17-copd-13-1195" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> This may enhance recruitment, improve alveolar ventilation and reduce patients&#x02019; respiratory workload. All these mechanisms together would decrease the patients&#x02019; sensation of dyspnea and thereby increase physical ability and, as previously indicated, reduce exacerbations.<xref rid="b19-copd-13-1195" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b43-copd-13-1195" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> As such, this study suggests that HFNC should be a treatment used in conjunction with LTOT in COPD patients with hypoxic failure to reduce exacerbations and maintain health status in general.</p><p>The daily duration of the use of HFNC increased when patients included nighttime use. Recommended flow was based only on the experience of patients&#x02019; tolerability; therefore, further investigation is needed. However, based on this study, we recommend that the use should preferably be during sleep, with a flow of at least 20 L/min.</p><p>This study has some limitations. A randomized blinded study could have been wished for, however, blinding the patients against the flow, the heat and the humidity is not realistic. Data on active hours of use of LTOT may have been interesting; however, oxygen delivery device actual use is not currently available, and patients&#x02019; self-report usage is inaccurate.</p><p>Recall bias is possible for AECOPD, and patients&#x02019; activities, such as rehabilitation, could influence results if not evenly distributed within the 2 groups. Differences in prescribed medicine and participation in rehabilitation could also potentially influence results. However, as patients were randomly allocated to the HFNC and control groups, were all treated according to guidelines, including referral to vaccination and rehabilitation according to national guidelines<xref rid="b44-copd-13-1195" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> and received the same standard of care and visits from the LTOT homecare company, we expect this to be similar between the 2 groups.</p><p>The recommendation of 8 hours of the use of HFNC has no real scientific background. The only previous long-term study recommended 2 hours of use per day, resulting in 1.6 hours of use on average. Studies on LTOT compliance have showed that mobility is important to obtain compliance, and this study shows that daytime users use HNFC significantly less than nighttime users. An average use of HFNC in patients including nighttime use close to the recommended 8 hours does tell us that this is applicable. However, further studies are needed to decide the duration of optimal use. Furthermore, this study allowed both day- and nighttime use of HFNC. The physiological mechanisms of HFNC have previously been suggested to be different at day- and nighttime, however, this study was performed in healthy individuals and the population therefore not necessarily comparable to our study population.<xref rid="b41-copd-13-1195" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> A comparison of the effect of day- and nighttime use would be ideal, but was not performed in this study as differences in duration of use also occur between day- and nighttime use.</p><p>One-seventh of the HFNC group ceased treatment within the first month, although only 3% left the study population completely, while 44% of the study population discontinued the use of HFNC during the observation period. However, more than one-quarter of those who discontinued died during the study. This is substantial, but consistent with prospective studies of NIV on comparable patient populations with similar treatment durations in the home.<xref rid="b45-copd-13-1195" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="b46-copd-13-1195" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> There is of course a risk that those who were non-adherent were patients who did not feel any physical amelioration, or even felt worse, using HFNC. However, as results from the treatment group also included those who discontinued use of HFNC but stayed in study and as overall study time was similar between the treatment groups and controls this is not a likely explanation. Retention rates on this study were similar, but by definition, patients remained in the control arm longer than in the HFNC arm. Therefore, group comparisons were as randomized and more in line with an intent-to-treat paradigm. The analyses of exacerbations and admissions using actual days of the use of HFNC (eg, zero for the control group) were closer to a per-protocol paradigm.</p><p>The choice of included variables is always contentious. As such, the use of other established symptom scores, eg, the COPD assessment test, could have substantiated and elaborated description of patients&#x02019; symptoms. In addition, the clinical relevance of some of the changes, ie, PaCO<sub>2</sub>, is arguable. The changes did not lead to significant changes of pH; perhaps patients were able to compensate. However, PaCO<sub>2</sub> levels have previously been shown to affect the outcome of AECOPD in patients with chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure,<xref rid="b47-copd-13-1195" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> even when the PaCO<sub>2</sub> values were lower than those demonstrated in this study. Therefore, the reduction in PaCO<sub>2</sub> could have clinical benefit.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows that in COPD with hypoxic failure treated with LTOT, adjunct HFNC therapy reduces exacerbations, admissions and symptoms. In addition, HFNC stabilizes the clinical condition of advanced COPD patients, but does not improve all-cause mortality. In future, HFNC should therefore be considered a beneficial adjunct to the recommended treatment of COPD patients with chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Jens Kure, Sales Manager at Home Care, Linde Healthcare, Denmark, and employees for technical support and supportive care of our study population.
