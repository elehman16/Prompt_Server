Both animal studies and clinical trials have shown beneficial effects of polyphenol-rich foods on cardiovascular health.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Among them, berries are rich sources of flavonoids (anthocyanins), some minerals (sodium, potassium, calcium, selenium, zinc, and phosphorus), Vitamins (A, B, C, and E), phenolic acids (gallic, P-coumaric, caffeic, and fluoric), and phenolic polymers (alajik acid).[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Blackberry (<italic>Morus nigra</italic> L., Persian mulberry, and black mulberry), a native fruit to Iran, contains high levels of anthocyanins.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Interestingly, berries lack interfering compounds such as ethanol, fat and caffeine,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and their flavonoids can be effective on cardiovascular health by several mechanisms. For instance, they may inhibit LDL-C oxidation, reduce inflammation associated with atherosclerosis and also affect reverse cholesterol transport by reducing TC and LDL-C.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Evidences show adding berries to the diet can positively affect cardiovascular risk factors through inhibition of inflammation, free radical scavenging, regulating eicosanoid metabolism, improving endothelial function, reducing blood pressure, inhibition of platelet aggregation, increasing circulating HDL-C, and increasing resistance of LDL-C oxidation.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Studies on the effects of berries on lipid profile and inflammatory markers reveal contradictory results.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] In some previous studies, significant changes in lipid profile and some inflammatory markers have been observed whereas other studies did not report any significant changes which may be contributed to limitations including lack of control group,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] the form of consumed berries (capsules or powder),[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and consuming the combination of different berries,[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] berry consumption along with a special diet,[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] the small sample size, and short intervention period.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Therefore, according to the importance of antioxidant role of phenolic compounds in protection of many diseases, it seems that adding berries to diet can affect the heart diseases risk factors, such as lipid profile, blood pressure, and inflammatory markers.</p><p>Thus, in this study we hypothesised that blackberry consumption can improve apo A-I and B, high-sensitivity-C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and blood pressure in dyslipidemic patients in a larger sample size and a control group, to determine the effects of the blackberry itself, and in the form of the juice with pulp.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study population and design</title><p>This study was a randomized clinical trial evaluating the effects of blackberry consumption on serum apo A-I, apo B, hs-CRP, and blood pressure on dyslipidemic patients.</p><p>Of patients who referred to social security and Bu-Ali Sina clinics of Qazvin, 72 volunteers aged 25-65 years, were recruited with a diagnosis of hyperlipidemia[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].

In that study, since participants were diabetic and according to evidences, lipid abnormalities exist in diabetic patients,[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] this issue may disturb the results and prevent HDL-C from being affected. Similarly, in a study by Basu <italic>et al</italic>., no significant changes were shown in HDL-C after taking 50 g of dried strawberries for 4 weeks[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] which may be due to the berries consumed in dried powder form or small size and short duration of the intervention compared to this study in which blackberries were consumed in juice form with pulp. Skoczy&#x000f1;ska <italic>et al</italic>. did not detect any significant changes in the HDL-C after consuming 250 mL/day of chokeberry extract during a two 6-week period.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Polyphenols administered in that study were approximately 1060 mg but in our study were 948 mg. Regarding equal amounts of polyphenols consumed in these two studies, we believe that HDL-C did not differ because that experiment was conducted on healthy men with mild hyperlipidemia. According to the current study, 8-week consumption of blackberries did not have significant effects on other lipid parameters including TC, LDL-C, and TG, which were in line with previous similar studies.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] In contrast, in the study by Skoczy&#x000f1;ska <italic>et al</italic>., daily intake of 250cc of chokeberry extract for two 6-week periods decreased serum TC and LDL-C, significantly[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] which supports the observations by Lee <italic>et al</italic>. in which LDL-C decreased significantly, and HDL-C did not change significantly following consumption of cranberry (three capsules of 500 mg for 12 weeks), in diabetic patients.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] These findings could result from longer duration of treatments in both studies in contrast to our study. In Basu's study in 2009, a reduction in TC and LDL-C and no changes in HDL-C, very low-density lipoprotein, and TG were reported following ingesting 50 g of dried strawberries for 4 weeks. This result may be explained by different groups of women suffered from metabolic syndrome, compared with our study.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] In another study, supplementation with anthocyanins (two capsules of 80 mg for 12 weeks) reduced serum LDL-C whereas no changes in TC and TG were observed.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Anthocyanin consumed in that study was 160 mg, however, in our study it was equal to 948 mg of polyphenols thus, the reduction in LDL-C in contrast to our study, may result from a longer period of intervention. Also, in studies by Ruel <italic>et al</italic>., in 2006 and Burton-Freeman <italic>et al</italic>., in 2010 that were performed to evaluate the effects of cranberry and strawberry respectively, the only observed reduction was in serum concentration of TG.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</p><p>Further, there were a significant increase in serum apo A-I and a significant decrease of apo B concentration after consumption of blackberry compared to the baseline. In Ruel <italic>et al</italic>. study, increasing the dose of cranberry extract during 12 weeks (125, 250, and 500 mL) did not alter apo B although it increased apo A-I.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In contrast to our findings, in a study by Qin <italic>et al</italic>. on the effects of anthocyanin supplementation in dyslipidemic people, daily consumption of two capsules of 80 mg anthocyanins for 12 weeks did not affect apo A-I and apo B.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] This issue could be as a result of lower contents of anthocyanin compared with our study which was 160 mg/day (two capsules of 80 mg) versus intaking 948 mg/day polyphenols. Regarding the fact that apo B and apo A-I are the major apolipoproteins of LDL and HDL-C respectively, the reduction of apo B and increase of apo A-I in the intervention group, could be attributed to a nonsignificant reduction in serum LDL-C and a significant increase in serum HDL-C.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] By these two significant changes, apo B/apo A-I, an important risk factor for CVD, was significantly decreased in the intervention group. Another finding of this study was a significant reduction in hs-CRP in the intervention group compared to control group and baseline. Contrary to our results, in the study by Skoczy&#x000f1;ska <italic>et al</italic>., daily drinking of 250 mL chokeberry extract caused no significant changes in CRP levels which may be due to the hyperlipidemia in subjects although they were healthy individuals.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] In another study, 3 weeks of taking two 500 mg capsules of cranberry did not alter CRP significantly[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] which might be as a result of taking cranberries in capsule forms. Additionally, Basu <italic>et al</italic>. did not report a significant change in concentration of hs-CRP after 4 weeks of consuming 50 g of dried strawberries in 16 women with metabolic syndrome,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] which a small sample size, short-term intervention, and lack of control group could affect the results. On the other hand, Lehtonen <italic>et al</italic>. in 2010 and Udani <italic>et al</italic>. in 2011 failed to find significant changes in serum concentrations of CRP, interleukin, and adiponectin following the consumption of other types of berries.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] This could be due to low dose of strawberries (163 g for 20 weeks) or consuming a combination of berries in the first study and the small sample size and short duration of the intervention (<italic>n</italic> = 10, 1-month) in the second one.</p><p>The beneficial effects observed can be attributed to phenolic compounds, anthocyanins, and other features existing in blackberry.[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] Anthocyanins represent a wide range of biological activities including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and anticancer activities as well as, improving eyesight, induction of apoptosis and neuroprotection. Antioxidant activities of anthocyanins, (clearing free radicals, chelating metal-binding protein), including protecting LDL against oxidation, has been demonstrated in a number of different experimental systems. It has been shown that pelargonidin, cyanidin, defidin, peonidin, and malvidin (common types of anthocyanins) have inhibitory effects on NO production in macrophages.[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] Accordingly, berry anthocyanins may play protective roles in the cardiovascular system through reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, which is mediated by affecting NO activity, modifying dyslipidemia, and modulating the expression of eNO and thus maintaining normal vascular function and blood pressure.[<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</p><p>Current study revealed a significant reduction in SBP after consumption of cranberry in the compared to baseline, while no significant changes were observed in DBP although at the end of the study these parameters and their mean changes were not significant between the groups. These results were similar to previous findings.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] In contrast, Skoczy&#x000f1;ska <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Basu <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and also Lehtonen <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] revealed significant reductions in both SBP and DBP. Unlike our study, the resulting changes in DBP in these studies could be attributed to the differences in the two studies&#x02019; groups as well as longer-term of intervention in the second study. However, contrary to these results, Jenkins <italic>et al</italic>. and Udani <italic>et al</italic>. did not detect any significant changes in either SBP or DBP after taking 454 g of strawberry and 200 g, respectively of Acai berry for 1-month.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] In both studies, treatment duration was 1-month, and it can be assumed that the lack of impact on blood pressure in these interventions was due to short-term of the interventions.</p><p>According to conducted studies and to our knowledge, this study is the first study on the effects of blackberry fruit, native to Iran, on lipid profile, apolipoproteins, hs-CRP, and blood pressure in patients with lipid disorders. A limitation of the present study was that it was not double blind and had no placebo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Overall, this study showed that blackberry consumption has the potential to improve concentrations of HDL-C, apo A-I, apo B, and hs-CRP which in turn can modify the cardiovascular risk factors. Further research to investigate other inflammatory and oxidative stress markers with regard to longer duration and administrating different doses of blackberry is recommended.</p><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Tehran University of Medical Sciences.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHOR's CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>SKA contributed in the conception of the work, designing the study, drafting the draft, approval of the final version of the manuscript, and agreed for all aspects of the work.
