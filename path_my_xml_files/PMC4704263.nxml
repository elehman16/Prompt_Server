Currently, it is unknown whether vein bypass surgery or the best endovascular treatment (angioplasty or stenting) represents the optimal revascularisation strategy in terms of amputation-free survival, overall survival, relief of symptoms, quality of life and cost-effective use of health care resources.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The Bypass vs. Angioplasty in Severe Ischaemia of the Leg - 2 Trial is a UK National Institute of Health Research, Health Technology Assessment funded, multi-centre randomised controlled trial that compares, at the point of clinical equipoise, the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a &#x02018;vein bypass first&#x02019; and a &#x02018;best endovascular treatment first&#x02019; revascularisation strategy for severe limb ischaemia due to infra-popliteal disease. The primary clinical outcome is amputation-free survival defined as the time to major (above the ankle) amputation of the trial limb or death from any cause. The primary outcome for the cost-effectiveness analysis is cost per quality-adjusted life year. Secondary outcomes include overall survival, quality of life, in-hospital mortality and morbidity, repeat and crossover interventions, healing of tissue loss and haemodynamic changes following revascularisation. Sample size is estimated at 600 patients. An economic evaluation will be conducted from the perspective of the National Health Service and comprise a &#x02018;within-study&#x02019; analysis, based on prospectively collected trial data and a &#x02018;model-based&#x02019; analysis, which will extrapolate and compare costs and effects beyond the study follow-up period.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The BASIL-2 trial is designed to be pragmatic and represent current practice within the United Kingdom. Patients with severe limb ischaemia can only be randomised into the trial where clinical equipose exists.

The economic analysis will consist of two components: a &#x02018;within-study&#x02019; analysis which will be based on study end-points and a &#x02018;model-based&#x02019; analysis which will extrapolate and compare costs and effects likely to accrue beyond the study follow-up period. The analysis will be presented in terms of cost per additional quality-adjusted life year gained and cost per year of amputation-free survival. In line with existing recommendations, the base-case analysis will adopt a health care system (payer&#x02019;s) perspective by considering costs incurred by the NHS and personal social services. Costs will be calculated on the basis of patient-level data related to (a) the procedures under assessment; (b) hospital stay and re-admissions, and (c) post-discharge use of National Health Service and social services. Procedure-related costs will be estimated in a separate micro-costing study. If plausible, additional analyses will be undertaken from a wider societal perspective. Quality of life will be derived from patients&#x02019; responses to the EuroQol EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] instrument and will be translated into preference-based quality of life indices using a UK-specific valuation set [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition to the trial-based evaluation, a model-based analysis will be conducted to consider the costs and benefits likely to accrue over a lifetime time horizon. Both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses will be undertaken to explore the robustness of the obtained results to sample variability and plausible variations in key assumptions and employed analytic methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Interim analyses</title><p>Interim analyses will be performed on an annual basis.

Primary analysis will use Kaplan-Meier plots and test the difference between two arms using the log-rank test. Data will be censored when individuals reach the end of follow-up or are lost to follow-up before incurring the primary outcome.</p><p>Further analysis of the primary outcome will involve the fitting of flexible parametric survival models to estimate both relative and absolute differences in hazard of the primary outcome to model the underlying differences in hazard and to allow for non-proportional hazards. The addition of covariates to the model, derived from the minimisation variables (age, sex, presence or absence of chronic kidney disease, diabetes and tissue loss) will allow baseline adjustments and the ability to test for further subgroup effects. The primary analysis will be performed on an intention to treat basis taking into consideration the first allocated method of revascularisation, regardless of cross-over or repeat interventions.</p><p>Secondary outcome measures that are based on continuous scales will be examined using a repeated measures multi-level model to examine the effects over time. Treatment effects will be reported from these measures at 1 and 12&#x000a0;months from randomisation and at the end of the study. Other outcomes will be measured using standard statistical methods, such as Fisher&#x02019;s exact test for categorical data and log-rank for time to event data.

Many of these patients will have multi-level disease including &#x02018;inflow&#x02019; or aorto-iliac disease, which may need to be corrected prior to randomisation. With the evolution of hybrid operating it would be permissible to perform an on-table inflow procedure (to popliteal, knee, level) at the same time as the randomised infra-popliteal intervention. Alternatively, an inflow procedure to popliteal (knee) level can be performed first and the patient then randomised if further infra-popliteal intervention is considered necessary.</p><p>Data from the original BASIL-1 trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] suggests that up to 25&#x000a0;% of patients may present with bilateral severe limb ischaemia. Bilateral simultaneous revascularisation is rare. It is usually clinically obvious which leg requires revascularisation first. Only one leg can be randomised in BASIL-2.</p><p>Patients can only be randomised if clinical equipoise exists. Local variations in practice may influence such decisions with some centres likely to favour an endovascular intervention strategy and others preferring surgical bypass. Current evidence does not support either an endovascular first or bypass first strategy and unless an obvious clinical reason is evident (such as lack of vein conduit, unsuitability for a surgical intervention due to comorbid state) all patients who are suitable for both arms could, theoretically be randomised into the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Trial status</title><p>The BASIL-2 trial is currently open for recruitment in multiple UK-based centres and has randomised more than 100 patients at the time of publication.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BASIL</term><def><p>Bypass versus Angioplasty in Severe Ischaemia of the Leg</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CG</term><def><p>clinical guideline</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L</term><def><p>European Quality of Life-5 dimensions-5 levels</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HR</term><def><p>Hazard Ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICECAP-O</term><def><p>ICEpop CAPability measure for Older people</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ISRCTN</term><def><p>International Standard Randomised Control Trial Number</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NHS</term><def><p>National Health Service</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PEDIS</term><def><p>Perfusion, Extent, Depth, Infection, Sensation foot score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF-12</term><def><p>Short Form 12 QoL questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UK</term><def><p>United Kingdom</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VascuQoL</term><def><p>Vascular QoL Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WIFI</term><def><p>Wound Ischaemia Foot Infection score</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors have no competing interests to declare.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contribution</bold></p><p>All authors have read and approved the final version of this manuscript.
