Thirty-six players were randomized into four groups, each performing either Nordic hamstring, flywheel leg-curl, Russian belt or the hip-extension conic-pulley exercise. The transverse relaxation time (T<sub>2</sub>) shift from pre- to post-MRI were calculated for the biceps femoris long (BFl) and short (BFs) heads, semitendinosus (ST) and semimembranosus (SM) muscles at proximal, middle and distal areas of the muscle length. T<sub>2</sub> values increased substantially after flywheel leg-curl in all regions of the BFl (from 9&#x000b1;8 to 16&#x000b1;8%), BFs (41&#x000b1;6&#x02013;71&#x000b1;11%), and ST (60&#x000b1;1&#x02013;69&#x000b1;7%). Nordic hamstring induced a substantial T<sub>2</sub> increase in all regions of the BFs (13&#x000b1;8&#x02013;16&#x000b1;5%) and ST (15&#x000b1;7&#x02013;17&#x000b1;5%). T<sub>2</sub> values after the Russian belt deadlift substantially increased in all regions of the BFl (6&#x000b1;4&#x02013;7&#x000b1;5%), ST (8&#x000b1;3&#x02013;11&#x000b1;2%), SM (6&#x000b1;4&#x02013;10&#x000b1;4%), and proximal and distal regions of BFs (6&#x000b1;6&#x02013;8&#x000b1;5%). T<sub>2</sub> values substantially increased after hip-extension conic-pulley only in proximal and middle regions of BFl (11&#x000b1;5&#x02013;7&#x000b1;5%) and ST (7&#x000b1;3&#x02013;12&#x000b1;4%).

Thus, adequate prevention and rehabilitation processes are of major importance in this cohort group.</p><p>The predominant hamstring injury mechanisms in football occur during high-speed running and/or acceleration efforts [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161356.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], or during movements with large joint excursions (i.e., stretching-type injury) such as high-kicking, split positions and glide tackling [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Hamstring injuries in football most commonly involve the proximal muscle-tendon unit junction (MTJ) of the BFl, accounting for approximately 60&#x02013;85% of all hamstrings injuries [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The occurrence of hamstring muscle strains in football is generally believed to be related with the presence of repetitive high force eccentric actions [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], such as the ones observed during high-speed running [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], where the lengthening demands placed on the muscle could exceed the mechanical limits of the tissue. Increasing the eccentric strength of the hamstring muscles has therefore been proposed as a method to prevent hamstring injuries [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Studies have reported that changes in morphology (e.g., anatomical cross-sectional area, muscle thickness) and architecture (e.g., fascicle length, pennation angles) in response to resistance training occurs non-uniformly along the length of the muscle [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161356.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This non-uniform muscle adaptation to resistance exercise is particular true for eccentric training [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The non-uniform change in muscle morphology and architecture after a training intervention has been attributed to the region-specific muscle activation assessed by the transverse relaxation time (T<sub>2</sub>) of functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI) during the training session [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161356.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have reported inhomogeneous muscle use within [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and among [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161356.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] the four muscles of the hamstring complex during resistance exercises commonly employed in the prevention and rehabilitation of hamstring muscle strains in football players. For example, Mendiguchia et al. (2013b) examined 15 different MR sections during the forward lunge and the eccentric leg curl showing that the leg curl preferentially targeted the ST, whereas the lunge preferentially targeted the proximal portion of the BFl [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The same authors [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reported a non-uniform MR-derived muscle use in the Nordic hamstring exercise, with a preferential use of the ST and BF. Kubota et al. (2007) found a greater usage of the proximal and middle regions than the distal region of the ST following an eccentric prone leg curl exercise. Overall, those between exercise region-specific muscle use differences suggest that specific morphological and architectural adaptations might be elicited with the combination of different hamstring exercises [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, those previous studies did not investigate muscle use in elite, professional soccer players performing contemporary strengthening exercises currently employed to enhance hamstring muscle function and/or prevent and rehabilitate hamstring muscle tears. The high injury rate for hamstring muscles injuries in contemporary football players [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and the fact that hip extensors and knee flexors eccentric strength [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] have been considered a risk factor for hamstring strain, support the rationale that hamstrings strength should be considered an important component of any training program for football players. Determining the region-specific muscle use of commonly used prophylactic and therapeutic exercises in elite soccer players is relevant for designing the type of resistance training that may be most effective for enhancing hamstring muscle quality and hence preventing initial or recurrent hamstring injuries within this cohort. Specifically, resistance training programs aiming at injury prevention would ideally incorporate regional muscle use aspects that are most similar to the conditions associated with injury, such that the athlete can optimize the gains in functional strength and minimize the risk of future injury. Therefore, the propose of the present study was to examine regional differences in exercise-induced shifts in T<sub>2</sub> in selected eccentric-biased strengthening exercises commonly used to prevent and/or rehabilitate hamstring injuries in elite soccer players.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants</title><p>The study examined 36 healthy elite, male professional football players (age 18.4 &#x000b1; 1.6 yr; height 177.5 &#x000b1; 1.0 cm; weight 71.0 &#x000b1; 6.2 kg) belonging to two of the reserve squads of a Spanish La Liga Club.

The fMRI included all the thigh in 12 images, and the analysis was performed at different length sections of muscle&#x000b4;s biceps femoris long head (BFl), biceps femoris short head (BFs), semitendinosus (ST) and semimembranosus (SM) before and immediately following 4 exercises [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>On the experiment day and 30 min before the exercise, players underwent fMRI of both thighs at rest.

This was followed by one submaximal set of 8 repetitions of the hamstring exercise the player had to perform later. Lastly, players performed the strength training protocol.

Players were instructed to apply maximal effort from a straight knee position until full knee flexion, then start braking upon passing the 90&#x000b0; position on the way back and continue braking with maximal effort until the knees were straight (without reaching a full extension).

For the fMRI scans, the subjects were positioned supine with their knees extended. All the scans were performed 30 min before and within 3&#x02013;5 min after the exercise. Once the subject was positioned inside the magnet, the thighs of both legs were kept parallel to the fMRI table, and a custom-made foot-restrain device was used to standardize and fix limb position and to avoid any compression of thigh muscles. Subjects were supine on the MR-gurney with thighs covered with one 32- and 2 flexible 4-channel coils, respectively in the proximal and distal segments. 12 cross-sectional images of the thigh of both legs were obtained, starting at the very distal margin of the ischial tuberosity, and using the following scan sequences: (a) axial fat-suppressed proton density, TR 3000 ms, TE 30&#x02013;33, echo train 4, slice thickness 3.5 mm, gap 28 mm, FOV 400 &#x000d7; 290 mm, matrix 320 &#x000d7; 180 and ipat 2; (b) axial T<sub>2</sub> mapping, TR 1000 ms, TE (18, 36, 54, 72, 90, 108), echo train 6, FOV 400 &#x000d7; 400 mm, matrix 256 &#x000d7; 256, slice thickness 3.5 mm and gap 28 mm.

The present study expands upon the existing knowledge by providing a comprehensive regional muscle use responses, assessed as the T<sub>2</sub> of MR images, of the hamstring muscles during selected eccentric-oriented strengthening exercises, commonly used to prevent and/or rehabilitate hamstring injuries in elite soccer players. Mechanically, the four exercises evaluated in the present study are clearly different. Thus, rather to compare the four exercises, we will focus on the specific muscle use features of each exercise and how each exercise might be used for appropriated muscle conditioning in soccer players.</p><p>Observations of fMRI-derived non-uniform inter- and intra-muscle use during different hamstring strengthening exercises support preceding literature [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161356.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Only the T<sub>2</sub> regional muscle use of one of the four exercises investigated in the present study, the Nordic hamstring exercise, has been has been previously examined [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A non-uniform hamstring muscles response with intensified post-exercise T<sub>2</sub> signal intensity in the ST and BFs muscles was reported [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. While the authors reported some regional differences in MRI activity immediately after the exercise (e.g., greater T<sub>2</sub> increase in the distal region of the BFs), our results showed a rather homogeneous regional muscle (i.e., ST and BFs) use. Moreover, in line with previous data [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161356.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], we found a limited involvement of the BFl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161356.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Despite the BFl contributes to knee flexion [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161356.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], research has shown that changes in muscle (fascicle) length are more sensitive to hip movement compared to knee movement [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This difference might be related to the larger muscle moment arm at the hip resulting in greater excursion of the muscle with changing hip position [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Overall, the current study supports previous findings and suggests that the Nordic hamstring exercise can be recommended when the goal is to target ST and BFs.</p><p>The conventional leg curl weight-stack machine exercise is widely used in both soccer performance enhancement and injury prevention/rehabilitation settings. Previous studies have investigated the inter-muscle [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and intra-muscular [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] regional differences in T<sub>2</sub> changes after this exercise mode. Following a purely eccentric isotonic leg curl exercise [i.e., 120% of the 1 repetition maximum (RM)], Kubota et al. (2007) reported a significant muscle use increase of ST, BFs and to a lesser degree the BFl. Similarly, Ono et al. (2010) found a two- to three -fold greater ST compared to BFl muscle use immediately after a purely eccentric isotonic exercise at 120% of 1RM and isotonic combined concentric and eccentric exercise at 50% of 1RM. In the present study, despite the different contraction mode employed (i.e., inertial flywheel leg curl), the T<sub>2</sub> increases in ST and BFs were also substantially higher than the observed in BFl in all the three muscle regions (4- to 6-fold and 2.5- to 11-fold, respectively, depending of the muscle region analyzed; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161356.g002">Fig 2</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Similar to the Nordic hamstring, the fact the hip position is fixed and unchanged during the execution of the exercise can limit the involvement of the BFl [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Indeed, the low to moderate (compared with the other CV values presented here) T<sub>2</sub> between-player CV (7.6 to 20.1%) obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161356.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>) seems to indicate quite homogenous individual responses in ST and BFs muscle use during the flywheel leg curl exercise. Of note is the relatively low CV (7.6%) observed in the proximal region of the ST, which in comparison with the CV observed in the same (proximal) muscle region of the BFl (87.1%), appears to confirm previous findings on the ST and BFs muscle dominance of the prone leg curl exercise [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161356.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161356.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the present study, muscle use regional differences in ST and BFl were in line with previous data [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; the proximal T<sub>2</sub> changes of the ST were substantially lower than the middle with no substantial BFl between-region muscle use differences. On the contrary, Kubota and co-workers reported greater T<sub>2</sub> changes in the BFs distal region [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] while in the present study BFs proximal T<sub>2</sub> changes were substantially greater than both middle and distal regions. Overall, the flywheel leg curl exercise appears to impose a high, quite homogenous (i.e., all muscle regions) and reproducible (i.e., expected low between-players differences) ST and BFs muscle use in soccer players.</p><p>The stiff-leg deadlift and other deadlift variations are commonly used exercises aimed at developing hip extension strength and power. In addition, due to the hip and knee joint kinematics (i.e., large excursions combined with full knee extension), that are believed to impose a substantial lengthening of the hamstring muscle-tendon unit resulting in an eccentric overload at long muscle lengths [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], the inclusion of different deadlift variations have been recommended in several hamstring injury prevention and rehabilitation programs [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161356.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In the current investigation, we employed a modified stiff-leg deadlift with the use of the &#x0201c;Russian belt&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This device allows the player to bend forward in an explosive fashion, to emphasize the eccentric phase. While this is the first time that regional responses during the Russian belt deadlift are investigated, the global muscle use (i.e., fMRI) of the Russian belt deadlift has to date being examined only once, in the same group of trained soccer players [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, the global muscle use of a &#x0201c;classical&#x0201d; stiff-leg deadlift was previously assessed in a group of untrained subjects [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. After 5 sets of 10 repetitions with a load of 60% of each subject body weight, T2 increased in SM (~12%), BFl (~8%) and to a lesser degree the ST (~5%). In the present study, T2 increases in the same range (4% to 12%) [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] were observed among all the regions of the ST, SM and BFl. Moreover, and in line with previous data [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161356.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], the Russian belt deadlift was the only exercise examined here that displayed a substantial and consistent SM increases in T<sub>2</sub> in all regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161356.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Despite that the displayed T<sub>2</sub> shifts are quite modest, it is worth noting that the Russian belt deadlift was performed with no additional external load but the player&#x02019;s body weight. Moreover, the large hip excursion (i.e., hip flexion) due to the bending forward trunk movement, combined with a full knee extension is likely to result in the hamstring muscles undergoing a lengthening contraction, as both of these motions contribute to hamstring stretch [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161356.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Albeit speculative, this substantial hamstrings lengthening might reduce muscle fiber work and being hamstring muscle-tendon unit compliance the main responsible for the force generation, which likely reduced muscle fiber work and metabolic energy expenditure [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>The hip extension kick conic-pulley exercise is an open chain exercise, where by combining full knee extension with hip flexion-extension movements, a lengthening (eccentric) contraction under an inertial load (generated by the cone) is ensured. During this exercise, hip extensor muscles undergo fast stretch-shortening contractions (i.e., concentric hip extension is done during the descending phase and eccentric hip extension to counteract hip flexion is done during the recovering phase). Only the proximal and middle regions of the BFl and ST showed substantial increases in T<sub>2</sub> while the other muscles and/or regions remained unchanged after the exercise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161356.g006">Fig 6</xref>). The ability of the hip extension kick conic pulley exercise to selectively recruit the proximal region of the BFl with a very limited involvement of other hamstring muscles may yield important consequences for current rehabilitation and injury prevention practices. The proximal region of the BFl has been reported to be the most frequently injured area in football players [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Moreover, BFl atrophy, often accompanied by hypertrophy of the BFs [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and altered muscle architecture (i.e., shorter muscle fascicle and greater pennation angles) [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] have been observed in previously injured BFl compared to the uninjured contralateral limb. Thus, exercise interventions aimed at strengthening and reactivating the proximal BFl during eccentric contractions can benefit for the inclusion of the hip extension conic-pulley exercise.</p><sec id="sec014"><title>Limitations</title><p>Despite T<sub>2</sub> relaxation time has been widely used for evaluating muscle recruitment during a wide range of exercises involving the hamstring muscles [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161356.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], functional MRI has its own limitations. First, T<sub>2</sub> changes do not reflect muscle use <italic>per se</italic>, but rather the metabolic response to muscle activation. Metabolic responses to strengthening exercises can vary greatly depending on the participation of the elastic structures, which can have a powerful effect on muscle force, power and work [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In this regard, work done by tendons and/or other elastic structures does not have to be performed by muscles; thus, tendons reduce muscle work and therefore metabolic cost, during stretch-shortening exercises [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, albeit speculative, the relatively modest changes in T<sub>2</sub> values observed in some of the exercises investigated here (e.g., conic pulley exercise; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0161356.s004">S4 Video</xref>) might be related with the stretch-shortening behavior of the hamstring muscle complex as a result of the combined knee and hip joint kinematics, with the elastic series elements stretching to absorb the energy associated with decelerating the leg. Tendon compliance, therefore, could have acted as a mechanical buffer that reduces the stretch of muscle fibers and minimizes metabolic energy expenditure [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Thus, in exercises in which the participation of tendinous tissues can substantially contribute to joint performance the muscle use information provided by the fMRI T<sub>2</sub> changes, where only contractile tissue (i.e., muscle fibers) is examined, needs to be interpreted with caution. Future studies should quantify the possible roles that elastic structures might play in regulation force, power and work production during strength exercises. In addition, it should be acknowledged that high T2 vales (around 40 ms) were found at rest in the present study and elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0161356.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161356.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161356.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161356.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which could due to the imaging technique employed. However, as the outcome measure was the T2 changes (i.e., pre-post, within individual design), rather than absolute T2 values, our main conclusions would remain fundamentally unaltered.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Perspectives</title><p>Different hamstring muscles and specific-regions within each muscle are likely to be selectively activated during different functional task that soccer players are required to do. Moreover, different muscles get injured at different locations, which might be the result of these differences in hamstring muscle involvement during soccer practices. Thus, knowledge of the differential muscle use of commonly employed strength exercises in soccer players appear relevant in deciding the exact strength exercises selection in order to prepare the player for a functional activity. From the results of this study and previous findings, it can be suggested that when the goal of the exercise intervention is to target the contractile elements of the BFs and ST and general hamstrings strengthening the flywheel leg curl and to a lesser extent the Nordic hamstring might be indicated. In contrast, for certain conditions that require the use of more functional, hip-dominant, stretch-shortening cycle muscle actions that promote the selective use of the proximal region of the BFl while minimizing recruitment of the other hamstring muscles, the hip extension conic-pulley would appear appropriate.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0161356.s001"><label>S1 Video</label><caption><title>Flywheel leg-curl exercise.</title><p>(MP4)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0161356.s001.mp4"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0161356.s002"><label>S2 Video</label><caption><title>Nordic hamsting exercise.</title><p>(MP4)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0161356.s002.mp4"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0161356.s003"><label>S3 Video</label><caption><title>Russian belt deadlift exercise.</title><p>(MP4)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0161356.s003.mp4"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0161356.s004"><label>S4 Video</label><caption><title>Hip extension conic-pulley exercise.</title><p>(MP4)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0161356.s004.mp4"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge Dr. Xabier Alomar and Ms. Elena Ferre Gim&#x000e9;nez (Department of Radiology, Centres Medics Creu Blanca, Barcelona, Spain) for their technical support to this research during the experiments.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0161356.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Woods</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hawkins</surname><given-names>RD</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Maltby</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hulse</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hodson</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>. <article-title>The Football Association Medical Research Programme: an audit of injuries in professional football&#x02014;analysis of hamstring injuries</article-title>. <source>Br J Sports Med</source>. <year>2004</year>;<volume>38</volume>(<issue>1</issue>):<fpage>36</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>41</lpage>.
