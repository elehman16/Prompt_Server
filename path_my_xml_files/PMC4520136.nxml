orthodontic procedure. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been reported to have
local analgesic effect. </p></sec><sec><title>OBJECTIVE:</title><p> The aim of this single-blind study was to investigate the perception of pain
caused by orthodontic elastomeric separators with and without a single LLLT
application (6J). </p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p> The sample comprised 79 individuals aged between 13 and 34 years old at
orthodontic treatment onset. Elastomeric separators were placed in first maxillary
molars at mesial and distal surfaces and kept in place for three days. The
volunteers scored pain intensity on a visual analogue scale (VAS) after 6 and 12
hours, and after the first, second and third days. One third of patients received
laser applications, whereas another third received placebo applications and the
remaining ones were controls. Applications were performed in a split-mouth design.
Thus, three groups (laser, placebo and control) were assessed. </p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p> No differences were found among groups considering pain perception in all periods
observed. </p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION:</title><p> The use of a single-dose of LLLT did not cause significant reduction in
orthodontic pain perception. Overall pain perception due to orthodontic separator
placement varied widely and was usually mild.</p></sec></abstract><trans-abstract xml:lang="pt"><sec><title>INTRODU&#x000c7;&#x000c3;O:</title><p> alguns pacientes referem-se &#x000e0; separa&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o ortod&#x000f4;ntica pr&#x000e9;-bandagem como um

It has been reported that 28% of
orthodontic patients consider discontinuing treatment due to fear of pain, while 39% of
them claim it is the worst feature of orthodontic appliances.<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> After placement of orthodontic accessories, such as elastomeric
separators, archwires or activation loops, the affected areas undergo a painful process
triggered by pressure and stress.<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>

<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Although pain is subjective and may vary among
individuals, studies show that all patients, regardless of age, have reported some
degree of pain during treatment.<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>

<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</p><p>It has been observed that, due to being mild to moderate and often transient pain,<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> medications are not routinely prescribed in
orthodontic practice, unless discomfort becomes intolerable.<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5 </xref>Moreover, medications can produce side effects and are

<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7 </xref>Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been
reported to reduce inflammation and pain by reducing prostaglandin and interleucine

<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, few clinical LLLT trials<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> have been performed with clear methods,
significant samples, homogeneous groups and a placebo group. Furthermore, it is not
clear to what extent the use of pre-banding elastomeric orthodontic separators is
perceived by patients as painful.</p><p>In light of the above, the aim of this study was to assess pain perception associated
with elastomeric separators with and without a single application of 808-nm LLLT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><p>This study was approved by Universidade Estadual de Maring&#x000e1; Institutional Review Board
(0315.0.093.000-09) and all volunteers and legal guardians signed an informed consent
form.</p><p>Sample size calculation was performed with a confidence level of 95%, 5-mm margin of
error, 8.1 mm standard deviation, and an infinite population.<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Although the results showed that each group should comprise 11
individuals, 25 subjects were initially assigned to each group, given the inclusion of
the placebo group and the clinical nature of the research.</p><p>The following inclusion criteria were applied: complete permanent dentition in the
maxillary arch, except for third molars, and good systemic health. Patients who had
undergone prior oral LLLT; those who presented with systemic problems, such as diabetes
or metabolic diseases, which may interfere in the inflammatory process; pregnant or
lactating patients; those who were using painkillers or anti-inflammatory medications
and/or presented with clear signs of periodontal disease, such as bleeding or signs of
inflammation (pain, heat, swelling and redness) were excluded from the study.</p><p>The initial sample comprised 100 patients and all of them had the following maxillary
teeth separated with elastomeric separators (Morelli - Sorocaba, SP, Brazil): between
the second premolar and first molar (mesial of first molar), and between the first molar
and second molar (distal of first molar).<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>

</p><p>Patients were randomly divided into four initial groups in which maxillary molars on
both sides received elastomeric separators. Each group was approached differently, as
follows: Group 1, LLLT applied on the left side and placebo on the right side (blind)
(SOLce); Group 2, LLLT applied on the left side and control on the right side (aware)
(SOLci); Group 3, control on the right side and placebo on the left side (blind) (SOce);
Group 4, control on both sides (aware) (SOci). The term "blind" refers to the fact that
patients were not aware of the procedure (placebo).</p><p>In the group "orthodontic separation with laser application (blind)" (SOLce), LLLT was
applied immediately after elastomeric separators placement in the maxillary left first
molars. On the right side, placebo applications were performed, with the LLLT device
producing beeps without firing the laser. Since the infrared laser used is not visible
and protection glasses were on, patients could not detect any differences between the
two applications.</p><p>In the group "orthodontic separation with laser application (aware)" (SOLci), laser
therapy was performed only on the left side, as in group 1; but this time, patients were
aware that the laser would be applied on one side, only. On the other side, no placebo
applications were performed.</p><p>In the group "orthodontic separation (blind)" (SOce), recorded as group 3, no LLLT was
applied. However, on the left side, placebo applications were performed as previously
described. Patients did not receive laser applications on the other side. Thus, the
psychological factor was assessed in terms of what extent to which it interferes in the
pain process, inducing the patient into thinking that the side supposedly treated with
some sort of therapy would hurt less.</p><p>In the group "orthodontic separation (aware)" (SOci), recorded as group 4, the
volunteers received neither placebo nor laser applications, thus fully characterizing it
as the control group.</p><p>Twenty-one subjects dropped out of the study or provided incorrect data: five of them
reported severe pain (two from the SOLce group, one from the SOce group and two from the
SOci group); and sixteen lacked complete data in one of the study periods (three from
the SOce group and 13 from the SOci group). Therefore, final data distribution (n = 79)
was as follows: SOLce (n = 23), SOLci (n = 25), SOce (n = 21) and SOci (n = 10).</p><p>Considering the sample in terms of the sides assessed (n = 158), distribution was as
follows: laser = 30.37% (n = 48), placebo = 27.48% (n = 44), control = 41.77% (n =
66).</p><p>Applications were performed with a Whitening Lase II device (DMC Equipment Ltda., S&#x000e3;o
Carlos, Brazil) which has two laser probes with distinct functions: a smaller laser
probe for LLLT and a curved laser probe for teeth bleaching. The laser therapy probe in
infrared mode (AsGaAl) was used.</p><p>A standard guide was used for all patients (after disinfection with 70% alcohol and
protection with film paper in the foam area) based on the average size (13 mm) of the
buccal roots of the maxillary first molar.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The
device was placed on the occlusal surface of teeth and supported between the marginal
ridges of the teeth involved. The guide was fabricated so that the first application was
performed 5 mm above the gingival papilla, approaching patient's bone crest region. The
total length of the guide was 12 mm, allowing three applications, 4 mm apart from each
other, to be performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig 1</xref>).</p><p>

application in the mesio-cervical region; B) 10-second application in the
mesio-medial region; C) 10-second application in the mesio-apical region. The
three regions (cervical, medial and apical) also received laser applications
distally, thereby totaling 60 seconds per tooth (6 J / tooth).</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="dpjo-20-03-00037-gf01"/></fig>
</p><p>The wavelength used was 808 nm, with a fluency of 80 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, as recommended by
the manufacturer (DMC Equipment Ltda., S&#x000e3;o Carlos, Brazil), thereby totaling
approximately 6 J of energy per tooth (1 x 60 s x 100 mW).The probe of the device
remained in contact with the gingival tissue during applications. Elastomeric separators
were placed and laser applications performed by the same previously trained and
calibrated operator.</p><p>Subsequently, all patients were instructed to rate their level of spontaneous pain on a
visual analogue scale (VAS). Initial scores were assigned as soon as the patient arrived
at the office and before any procedure was carried out. This initial score made it
possible to judge whether or not the patient already felt some pain, which was not
related to the separation procedure, in the teeth involved in the study. After
separation, patients' pain levels were recorded 6 hours, 12 hours and 1, 2 and 3 days
following separation. The scores assigned by the patient on the visual analogue scales
were measured with a caliper (Mitutoyo, Japan). A zero score, located on the left side
of the scale, suggested no pain; while a 100 (100 mm) score, at the right end of the
scale, suggested maximum pain. The center of the scale corresponded to a score equal to
50 and suggested moderate pain. This information was provided to the subjects before
they started assigning scores on their dental history cards, which patients took
home.</p><p>Data were tested for normality of distribution by means of the Shapiro-Wilk test. Should
normal distribution not be found, data were presented using median and their quartiles
(1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd)</sup>. Pain perception was assessed by analysis of
variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures. Mauchly's sphericity test was also applied and,
whenever violated, technical corrections were performed by Greenhouse-Geisser test.
Statistical significance was set at 5% and analyses were carried out by means of SPSS
version 15.0.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Patients' mean age was 23.4 &#x000b1; 6.3 years for group SOLce (9 men and 14 women); 22.3 &#x000b1; 4.1

<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> the pain caused by orthodontic procedures
(separators or leveling archwires) reaches its peak 12 and 24 hours after placement
(<xref ref-type="table" rid="t03">Table 3</xref>). However, in this study, pain
perception, as shown in VAS scores, was highly variable, with a relatively low median.
It is a known fact that separators cause pain. Despite reports by some people who do not
feel any pain whatsoever,<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> most authors report
that, although pain intensity or location may vary, all patients eventually complain,
which indicates that the procedures performed in orthodontic practice are always a
nuisance.<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>

<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In the present study, 12.65% (n = 10) did not
report any pain and only 15.18% (n = 12) reported pain levels equal to or greater than
40. If the five volunteers who dropped out of the study after reporting too much pain
were to be included, this percentage would rise to 18% of the initial sample. Those
distributions related to pain were similar among groups. Therefore, patients who claimed
that the pain caused by orthodontic separation was relevant represented a minority of
the sample. It is worth noting that the effects of LLLT could only be noted if the
majority of subjects had perceived increased pain. Nevertheless, a detailed assessment
of patients reporting pain greater than or equal to 40 on VAS, in at least one of the
periods, revealed that six of them reported feeling greater pain on the laser side,
compared to placebo or control, while six of them assigned lower scores to the laser
side.</p><p>Although pain is seen as a subjective and, therefore, hard-to-assess variable, the use
of visual analogue scales, as it was the case in this study, has been widely reviewed
and is nowadays regarded as a reliable method.<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>

<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In comparison to other investigations on

Fujiyama et al<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> reported higher scores that
reached 80, 12 and 24 hours after placing separators and when no laser was applied; and
40 when it was applied; however, no placebo group was used. Our study corroborates that
pain registered in VAS scores varies from mild to moderate.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>

</p><p>In the present study, a split-mouth, single-blind model was adopted and a placebo side
was included, which allowed the authors to compare intrasubject pain perception with and
without LLLT. Lim et al<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> conducted a similar
study with separators and found no difference between the placebo and laser sides.
Additionally, their scores were similar to those found in the present study, which also
shows considerable variability.<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6 </xref>Those data also
corroborate a recent study performed by Abtahi et al.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>

applied laser in patients undergoing orthodontic treatment. The authors assessed pain
during alignment and leveling or when performing canine retraction. Given that these
procedures involve a higher number of teeth, they may enhance pain perception and
underscore LLLT effects. Thus, it does not seem reasonable to compare these results with
the present study which assessed pain perception in the presence of elastomeric
separators.</p><p>A wide range of laser types, with different wavelengths and energy doses, can be found
in the literature. AsGaAl diode laser, used in studies by Youssef et al,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Tortamano et al<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and Lim et al,<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> was also used in
the present study. Moreover, Harazaki et al<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7 </xref>used
HeNe laser whereas Fujiyama et al<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> used
CO<sub>2</sub> laser. At lower wavelengths, for instance, 632.8 nm<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and 670 nm<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, no difference, in terms of pain intensity, was reported between groups
with or without laser applications. Nevertheless, the use of high-level laser, with
wavelength of 808 nm, revealed statistically significant pain reduction in some
studies.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> This was the wavelength used in the present
study, following the manufacturer's recommendations. However, even the use of laser with
wavelength at 830 nm has yielded discrepant results, with LLLT producing some analgesic
effect,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14 </xref>despite not being significant.<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</p><p>According to the manufacturer's instructions, we used, in this study, 6 J of energy in a
single dose. Other similar studies used from 5 to 12 J of energy in single or daily
applications. One single application seems more practical, as it does not rely on
further appointments and patient cooperation.<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>.
Although the amount of energy probably influences the analgesic effect, some studies
report LLLT efficacy<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>

<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> or not<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>

<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18 </xref>with similar energy and frequency levels.
Further studies can clarify this point.</p><p>A systematic review has recently reported that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs), such as COX-2 selective inhibitor, are still the best choice to reduce pain
during orthodontic treatment, despite potential side effects.<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Another recent study revealed that a single dose of Piroxicam,
taken 60 minutes before separator placement, reduces pain.<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
</p><p>Since patients generally perceive pain as mild and transient, an analgesic regimen
should only be adopted for less tolerant patients. However, should such regimen prove
necessary, a single application of LLLT does not seem to provide a fully effective
protocol for this purpose.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>A single application (6 J) of LLLT (808 nm) did not produce significant effects on the
