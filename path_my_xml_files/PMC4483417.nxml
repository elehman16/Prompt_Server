function and activities of daily living of patients with hemiplegia. [Subjects] The
experimental group and control group comprised 15 hemiplegia patients each. [Methods] This
study was performed from June 4 to December 22, 2012, involving 30 hemiplegia patients.
The experimental and controls groups performed task practices for 30 minutes, 3 times per
week for 28 weeks with and without taping, respectively. [Results] After treatment, there
were significant differences in every outcome measures within each group except for the
Brunnstrom recovery stage of the hand. However, there was a significant difference in
functional independence movements between the groups. [Conclusion] Task practice has the
same effectiveness regardless of the taping of the upper extremities. Nevertheless, taping
is helpful for improving both the functions and activities of daily living in patients
with hemiplegia.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Activities of daily living</kwd><kwd>Upper limb function</kwd><kwd>Taping</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Lack of functional ability in the upper extremities after stroke restricts usage, and
causes asymmetric posture and contracture in daily life, thus exacerbating functional
limitations of the upper limbs<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
functional recovery period of the upper limbs in patients with hemiplegia is estimated to be
11 weeks after stroke. However, if there is no functional improvement with intensive
treatment in this period, it is difficult to expect better prognosis or improvement<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies demonstrate that applying
kinesiology tape in the same direction as the muscle fibers facilitates muscle function<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, while perpendicular application inhibits
muscle function<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, the underlying
mechanism of the effect of therapeutic taping remains controversial. However, there is no
report on the influence of taping with respect to a neurophysiologic background. Thus,
additional in-depth quantitative studies about the effects of taping on balance, gait,
injury prevention, strength, range of motion, and proprioception are required to confirm its
clinical efficacy. Therefore, this study determined the effects of kinesiology taping on
upper-extremity function and activities of daily living (ADL) in patients with hemiplegia.
This study involved an alternative medicine intervention in order to demonstrate whether
taping improves movement dysfunction after stroke. Thus, the results will provide
fundamental data for the application of this technique in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted from June 4 to December 22, 2012 on 30 post-stroke patients who
were hospitalized in a rehabilitation hospital in Chungcheong province, South Korea. The
patients were randomly divided into 2 groups. The patients in the experimental group (EG,
<italic>n</italic> = 15) and control group (CG, <italic>n</italic> = 15) performed task
practice with and without 3NS kinesiology taping, respectively. The inclusion criteria were
as follows: post-stroke hemiplegia, at least 6 months since onset, and ability to
communicate and understand instructions. Meanwhile, patients with peripheral neuropathy,
musculoskeletal disease, or dementia were excluded. All patients provided written informed
consent to participate in the study prior to its commencement. This study followed the
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The intervention was performed for 30 minutes, 3
times per week for 28 weeks for a total of 84 sessions. Patients rested 2 minutes between
each practice. The patients practiced tasks as per the researcher&#x02019;s instructions, while
sitting on a comfortable chair. The task practices included wiping a table with a towel,
putting a block into a box, and stacking cups.</p><p>The taping was applied as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Figs. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Taping of the deltoid muscle</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-1455-g001"/></fig> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Taping of the quadratus lumborum muscle</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-1455-g002"/></fig>.</p><p>For the anterior aspect of the middle deltoid, the patient extended their arm and performed
slight external rotation; then, the therapist placed the tape on the region from the humerus
prominence to the coracoid process. For the posterior aspect of the middle deltoid, the
patient placed the affected side of the hand on the opposite side of the acromion process,
and the tape was placed on the region from the humerus prominence to the lateral third of
the scapular spine. For the lateral portion of the quadratus lumborum, the tape was applied
from the posterior superior iliac spine to the 12th rib while the trunk was bent laterally
to the unaffected side. For the medial portion of the quadratus lumborum, the tape was
placed from the posterior superior iliac spine along the transverse processes of the lumbar
vertebrae while the trunk was bent forward. Upper-extremity function and ADL were assessed
by using the manual function test (MFT)<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>,
modified motor assessment scale (MMAS)<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>,
Brunnstrom recovery stage<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, and functional
independence measure (FIM)<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>All data were analyzed by using SPSS version 18 (SPSS lnc., Chicago, lL, USA). The
&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was used to analyze the general characteristics of the patients.
Because the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test indicated the data were not normallydistributed, the
Wilcoxon signed-ranked test and Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test were used to determine
intra- and intergroup differences, respectively. All data are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard
deviation (SD). The &#x003b1; level was set at = 0.05, and the level of significance was set at p
&#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The EG comprised 8 women and 7; 8 and 7 patients had right and left hemiplegia,
respectively. Meanwhile, the CG comprised 9 women and 6 men; similar to the EG, 8 and 7
patients had right and left hemiplegia, respectively. The mean ages of the EG and CG were
69.20 &#x000b1; 7.07 and 67.33 &#x000b1; 9.50&#x02005;years respectively. There were no significant differences in
the general characteristics between groups. However, the MFT and MMAS results differed
significantly after the intervention in both groups (EG: 22.47 &#x000b1; 6.55 and, 13.87 &#x000b1; 5.06; CG:
21.33 &#x000b1; 6.23 and, 13.80 &#x000b1; 5.25, respectively). However, there were no significant
differences between groups pre- or post-intervention. There was no significant change in the
Brunnstrom recovery stage of the hand after the intervention in either group, but the meanof
post-intervention score tended to be higher in the EG. However, post-intervention, the FIM
changed significantly within each group and differed significantly between groups (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Changes in upper-limb function and activities of daily living (<italic>N</italic>

to the affected upper limbs of post-stroke patients reduces spasms, resulting in improved
range of motion, strength, and function<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Another study reports that muscle recruitment patterns can be altered because of better
proprioception by stimulating mechanoreceptors<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, both groups showed significant improvements
in the MFT and MMAS results. This indicates that task practice positively influenced
upper-extremity function, regardless of taping. However, an additional benefit was observed
in the EG. This suggests that applying tape can improve the restricted coordinated movement
of joints in the upper extremities because of dysfunction of normal movement reflex,
diminished coordination, and integration of motor control and disconnection between the
muscles in the upper extremities and trunk; this results in improved upper-limb movement.
Because ADL involve interactions among several elements such as joints, muscles, sensory
inputs, and nerves, the assessment of ADL is crucial to determine the condition of patients
with a brain injury<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present
study, post-intervention, both groups showed significant improvements in the FIM. However,
there was a significant difference post-intervention between the groups. This indicates that
applying tape to the shoulder and lumbar region improves postural control and shoulder
girdle stability. In other words, mobility improved because of better stability. However,
there was no significant difference in the Brunnstrom recovery stage of the hand either
within each group or between the groups. This demonstrates that taping does not affect the
control of muscle tone or coordination in the distal part of the upper extremities.
Furthermore, limited ability in manipulation did not improve prior to the recovery of the
movement and stability in the proximal part of the upper limbs. Even if patients with
hemiplegia can reach with their arm to grasp an object, they cannot do so because of an
inability to manipulate the object using their hands. Thus, they have more restrictions for
using the affected upper limb and will therefore have fewer opportunities to use it<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. This may be why patients with hemiplegia
use support for their disabled hand or are unable to use it at all. Consequently, such
patients experience many life difficulties after their stroke, because the functions of the
upper limbs and hands are vital for ADL. Future studies should perform surface
electromyography to verify that muscles affected by taping regain strength after the
intervention.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Ryerson</surname><given-names>SD</given-names></name></person-group>: Hemiplegia.
