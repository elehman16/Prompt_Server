used in clinical care, and to verify the difference between the utility of tablet survey
methods and paper questionnaire methods with elderly people. [Subjects and Methods] A
tablet app was developed in the Java language. A questionnaire was provided to 30
community-dwelling elderly people. The subjects were randomly allocated to the group
responding on the tablet (tablet group) or that responding to a paper-based questionnaire
(questionnaire group). Assessed items included response time to questions, whether or not
they had queries regarding the survey, and data input time. For the tablet group, a
questionnaire was conducted regarding the operability of the tablet. [Results] There was
no difference in response time between the two groups. Significantly more people in the
tablet group had queries regarding the survey. Data input time was 426 seconds for the
tablet group and 1268 seconds for the questionnaire group. In the survey regarding tablet
operability, there were no negative opinions about the visibility of the screen.
[Conclusion] Tablets can be used with elderly people to shorten the data input time. The
present findings suggested that tablet surveys could be effective for a large-scale
investigation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Tablet survey</kwd><kwd>Paper questionnaire</kwd><kwd>Elderly</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Questionnaires are used in several clinical arenas<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. When paper-based

to use a tablet app for elderly people. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a tablet app
that emulates paper questionnaires used in clinical care, and to verify the difference
between the utility of tablet survey methods and paper questionnaire methods with elderly
people.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>A tablet app was developed in the Java language. The researchers held several meetings and
preliminary experiments with research collaborators and completed the final version of the
tablet app. The built-in survey items included a basic health check list for those over
65&#x02005;years old, as well as items related to frailty, 15 items of the Geriatric Depression
Scale, nutrition, and disease history. By starting the app, users can select the assessment
items following each question. After responding to the selected assessment items, CSV data
can be output onto the desktop screen automatically. The tablet used for the survey was
10.1-type Lenovo MIX3. The letter size displayed on the screen ranged from 8&#x02005;mm to
20&#x02005;mm.</p><p>Subsequently, a survey was conducted to verify tablet app operability. A questionnaire was
provided to 30 community-dwelling elderly people living in Ohota-ku, Tokyo prefecture,
Japan. It comprised a basic health check list for those over 65&#x02005;years old and items related
to frailty. The subjects were randomly allocated to the group responding on the tablet
(tablet group) or that responding to a paper-based questionnaire (questionnaire group), and
one assessor was assigned to each group.

Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-J) scores, which is a cognitive function test, and the basic
check list score between the two groups. All subjects provided written informed consent, and
this study was approved by Tokyo University of Technology of Health Sciences Ethical Review
Board (Authorization Number: E15HS-025). Informed consent was obtained from all
participants.</p><p>Assessed items included response time to questions by subjects, whether or not they had
queries regarding the survey, number of queries, and data input time taken by one assessor.
The survey was completed by three participants at a time, and three separate tablets were
used for the tablet group. In this study, data input time was defined as the time taken
until the data could be statistically analyzed. For the tablet group, the hours were
measured until the data on the tablet were compiled onto an Excel sheet from three tablets.
For the questionnaire group, the hours were measured until the data were input to the Excel
sheet. The assessors were not provided any explanation regarding this study. Instead, the
following instruction was provided: &#x0201c;Please input data as quickly as possible.&#x0201d;</p><p>In addition, for the tablet group, a questionnaire survey was conducted regarding the
operability of the tablet. In order to investigate the visibility of the screen and
simplicity of data input, six items on the following aspects were rated on a five-point
Likert scale: 1) size of the screen, 2) size of the letters, 3) color of the letters, 4)
operability of the touch panel, 5) whether tablet survey was more bothersome than a paper
survey, and 6) whether it took more time to respond to the survey using the tablet as
compared to a paper-based survey.</p><p>An independent t-test was used to compare intergroup age, height, weight, MoCA-J, the basic
check list, items related to frailty, number of taking medicine, response time, and number
of queries. A &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests was used to compare male-female ratio, family
configuration, and whether or not they had queries regarding the survey. All analyses were
conducted using the SPSS statistical package for Windows, version 21.0. P values of &#x0003c;0.05
were considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The results of each assessed item have been shown in <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>The results of assessed item for the tablet group and questionnaire group</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tablet group </th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Questionnaire group</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Response time to questions by subjects, sec (range) </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">155.2 &#x000b1; 41.7 (88&#x02013;221)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">144.4 &#x000b1; 42.7 (78&#x02013;221)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Whether or not they had queries regarding the survey (presence,

There was no difference in response time between the two groups.
Significantly more people in the tablet group had queries regarding the survey. Data input
time was 426 seconds for the tablet group and 1,268 seconds for the questionnaire group. In
the survey regarding tablet operability, there were no negative opinions about the
visibility of the screen. However, two people thought that the tablet was more bothersome as
compared with paper-based questionnaires.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Since the subjects of this study showed scores lower than 26 points on the MoCA-J (which is
the cut-off for this scale)<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, the
respondents may have included a subject or subjects who had mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
There was no difference in response time between the two groups in the basic check list
score and in items related to frailty. Therefore, it can be presumed that two groups had a
similar attribute.</p><p>For both groups, the data input time for the 15 respondents was measured. However, the
input time for the tablet group was 1/3 of the time required for the questionnaire group. In
future, when a large-scale survey is conducted, the use of tablets may be an effective way
to alleviate the burden of the researchers.</p><p>In general, since elderly people have different abilities related to digital devices as
compared with younger people, it is expected that they may not know what to do when they see
the display on the screen<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. There was no
negative opinion regarding the visibility of the screen in this study, but some people
consider the use of a tablet more bothersome as compared with paper questionnaires, and more
people in the tablet group had queries about the survey. Specifically, their queries were
related to operation procedures, for instance, &#x0201c;Is it okay to press this display screen?&#x0201d; or
&#x0201c;Is this the next operation?&#x0201d;. Accordingly, the operation methods of the tablets need to be
fully explained in advance when conducting a survey using tablets with elderly people. If
the method of operating tablets is demonstrated before conducting a survey, tablets can be
used with elderly people to shorten the data input time for a large-scale investigation. A
previous study has showed that information collected via a computer is valid as compared to
paper-pencil surveys<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, the present
findings suggested that tablet surveys could be effective for a large-scale
investigation.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Tsutsumimoto</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Doi</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Shimada</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Self-reported exhaustion is associated with small life
