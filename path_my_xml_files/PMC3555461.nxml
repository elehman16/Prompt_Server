In the present paper we present the 10-year results.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p> 44 patients were originally randomized to receive total hip replacement with a Lubinus SPII titanium-aluminum-vanadium stem cemented either with the new Cemex Rx bone cement or with control bone cement, Palacos R. Patients were examined using RSA, Harris hip score, and conventional radiographs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p> At 10 years, 33 hips could be evaluated clinically and 30 hips could be evaluated with RSA (16 Cemex and 14 Palacos). 9 patients had died and 4 patients were too old or infirm to be investigated. Except for 1 hip that was revised for infection after less than 5 years, no further hips were revised before the 10-year follow-up. There were no statistically significant clinical differences between the groups. The Cemex cement had magnitudes of migration similar to or sometimes lower than those of Palacos cement. In both groups, most hips showed extensive radiolucent lines, probably due to the use of titanium alloy stems.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p> At 10 years, the Cemex bone cement tested performed just as well as the control (Palacos bone cement).</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>One important&#x02014;and perhaps even the most important&#x02014;component in modern cemented total hip arthroplasty is the cement-bone interface. Enhanced cementing techniques have improved the outcome in terms of reduced incidence of early loosening and prolonged time until revision in the long term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">Britton et al. 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">Mulroy and Harris 1996</xref>).</p><p>One problem in the cementing process is the curing temperature. This is believed to cause bone and cell necrosis, leading to membrane formation and (in the longer term) aseptic loosening&#x02014;a cause for revision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">Mj&#x000f6;berg 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">Leeson and Lippitt 1993</xref>). To deal with this problem, Cemex bone cement (Tecres S.p.A., Italy) was developed in the late 1980s. Cemex bone cement was designed to reduce the curing temperature by removal of the smallest sizes of particles in the polymer powder. This would lead to a smaller surface area reacting with monomer. A laboratory test, however, did not show any decrease in curing temperature compared to conventional Palacos (Schering Plough, Labo n.v., Belgium) bone cement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">Nivbrant et al. 2001</xref>).</p><p>To examine the clinical properties of this cement and to compare the results with those of Palacos bone cement, a randomized controlled radiostereometric (RSA) trial was initiated. The 5-year results have already been published, and they showed good overall results with little or no differences between the 2 types of cement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">Nivbrant et al. 2001</xref>).</p><p>Since it is theoretically possible that different cements may deteriorate differently in the long term, we extended the follow-up and we now report the 10-year results of this study.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="ss1"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>In the original study, 47 hips in 44 patients with osteoarthritis of the hip were randomized to fixation with either Cemex Rx (study) or Palacos R (control) cement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">Nivbrant et al. 2001</xref>). The Cemex Rx cement uses barium sulfate as contrast medium and Palacos uses zirconium oxide. In this study, the Cemex cement was kept at room temperature and mixed in a closed disposable system (Cemex System). The Palacos was kept in a refrigerator before use and mixed in a vacuum system (Optivac; Biomet Cementing Technologies, Sj&#x000f6;bo, Sweden). All operations were performed by 2 experienced surgeons using a posterior approach and third-generation cementing technique.</p><p>The components used were a Lubinus SP2 stem made of titanium-aluminum-vanadium alloy and with a CCD angle of 135&#x000b0; (Waldemar Link, Germany), and an all-polyethylene Lubinus cup, gamma-sterilized in air. A 28-mm ceramic femoral head made of aluminum oxide was used in all cases.</p><p>For the radiostereometric measurements, tantalum spheres (0.8 mm) were inserted into both the proximal femur and the cement mantle by the surgeon. In order to measure both femoral stem translations and rotations, the femoral stems were equipped with 6 tantalum spheres by the manufacturer. This procedure necessitated the stems being made of titanium-aluminum-vanadium alloy which, at the time when this study was planned, was not seen as negative. By today&#x02019;s standards, this was obviously a suboptimal decision. However, since the study was designed to compare 2 types of cements, this decision may not necessarily have biased the results and it might instead be regarded as a worst-case scenario.</p><p>The RSA examinations were done postoperatively, after 6 months, and at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years with the patient supine. Uniplanar technique was used, with the calibration cage positioned under the patient. The RSA analysis was performed using UmRSA Digital Measure software (RSA Biomedical, Ume&#x000e5;, Sweden).</p><p>The migration of the femoral stem was measured both in relation to the femur and in relation to the cement mantle. Rotations of the femoral stem were determined using the 6 stem markers and the center of the femoral head as a segment. Translations of the stem were measured using the gravitational center of the femoral segment. To maintain the precision of the measurements, analysis of stem subsidence in relation to the cement mantle was done only if at least 3 well-defined markers with acceptable configuration and stability could be identified in the cement. Vertical translation (i.e. subsidence) and rotations of the femoral component in relation to the femur and the cement mantle, respectively, are the movements deemed most clinically interesting and they are the ones presented.</p><p>The precision of the measurements was evaluated from 30 double examinations where the absolute mean values + 2.7 SD of the differences between 2 subsequent radiostereometric examinations were calculated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Precision of RSA based on 30 and 16 double examinations.

It is not controversial to assume that a cement will have different properties when examined under other conditions than those applied in the preclinical testing environment. It has, for example, been described that bone cement shows reduced strength and elastic modulus with the passage of time when tested under wet conditions, in contrast to the situation with standard preclinical testing, which is performed in a dry environment and where there is an increase in these properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">Nottrott et al. 2008</xref>).</p><p>Small-scale clinical studies are of value before large-scale introduction to help avoid unnecessary revisions due to material failure&#x02014;as with the Boneloc disaster, where preclinical tests did not predict clinical failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">Nimb et al. 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">St&#x000fc;rup et al. 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">Kindt-Larsen et al. 1995</xref>).

Migration was similar, and in some parameters (anterior-posterior rotation and retroversion) it was even lower than for Palacos (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). Also, as can be seen in the box plots, the dispersion around the median was usually smaller for Cemex. Palacos bone cement has a very good track record, even with long follow-up, and we do cannot infer that Cemex is a better bone cement based on these measured differences, since they were too small to be clinically significant. Clinically also, there were no differences between the 2 groups. Similar resuts were found in the 5-year follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">Nivbrant et al. 2001</xref>).</p><p>As seen in other RSA studies, in both groups most of the migration of the stem occurred between the stem and the cement mantle, with little movement between the cement and bone.</p><p>According to the manufacturer of Cemex bone cement, this cement was designed to have a lower curing temperature than conventional cement, therefore improving the fixation.

(2001)</xref>, the curing temperature was no different from that of Palacos and this may explain the findings of fairly similar migratory patterns of the two cements in the present study.</p><p>The amount and extent of radiolucent lines was high in both groups. We consider this to be related to the fact that a titanium stem was used, since this has been shown to induce high degrees of osteolysis in cemented hip arthroplasty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">Scholl et al. 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">Thomas et al. 2004</xref>). Since most of the migration occurred between the stem and the cement mantle, this movement may have rubbed off titanium particles in large amounts, inducing or enhancing osteolysis. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">Nivbrant et al. (2001)</xref> found elevated levels of titanium and aluminum in the serum of these patients at 5 years, thus corroborating this statement.</p><p>In conclusion, Cemex performed as well as Palacos, and in some respects even better than Palacos. However, we regard these differences in the cements to be too small to be of any clinical importance. Based on these results, we conclude that Cemex bone cement can be safely used in total hip arthroplasty.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>PS: RSA analysis, statistics, data interpretation, initial manuscript draft.
