Each 5 mmHg increase in seated cuff systolic blood pressure (SeSBP) or seated cuff diastolic blood pressure (SeDBP) increases the risk of cardiovascular disease by 20&#x02013;30%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] Moreover, data from observational studies have shown that patients with both hypertension and diabetes have an approximately 2-fold greater risk of developing cardiovascular disease than patients with hypertension and no diabetes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) was the first large-scale study to demonstrate a direct relationship between systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the complications of diabetes over time, and that intensive blood pressure (BP) lowering was associated with clinically important reductions in both diabetes-related, and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] Consequently, BP reduction was suggested to be at least as important as blood glucose control in patients with both hypertension and diabetes.</p><p>The assessment of BP control typically employs the seated cuff BP (SeBP) method, which has demonstrated both good practicality and clinical utility. The American Diabetes Association (ADA), the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7), and the European Societies of Hypertension (ESH) and Cardiology (ESC) recommend that patients with diabetes should be treated to an SeBP goal of &#x0003c;130/80 mmHg, measured using an office cuff BP device.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] In recent years, the use of ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) has increased. The ability to continuously assess BP over a 24-hour period during both normal daily activities as well at night-time can improve the prediction of cardiovascular risk and analyze BP loads as well as identify the presence of white coat and masked hypertension.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]</p><p>The BENIFICIARY (BENIcar safety and efFICacy evaluatIon: An open-label, single-ARm, titration study in patients with hypertension and tYpe 2 diabetes) study assessed change from baseline in mean 24-hour ambulatory BP and achievement of ambulatory BP prespecified study targets in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension receiving an olmesartan medoxomil-based treatment algorithm.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] In addition, efficacy of the olmesartan medoxomil-based therapy on SeBP levels was measured. We report herein the secondary efficacy endpoints from the BENIFICIARY study, which include the change from baseline in mean SeBP, the achievement of SeBP goals, and the distribution of SeSBP reductions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The methodology for the BENIFICIARY study has been described previously[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and is summarized here.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design</title><p>BENIFICIARY was a prospective, open-label, multicenter, single-arm titration study. Patients underwent a 12-week, open-label, active treatment period beginning with olmesartan medoxomil 20 mg/day following a 3- to 4-week placebo run-in phase.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] During the active treatment period, patients received olmesartan medoxomil alone or as a fixed-dose combination with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and were uptitrated if BP remained &#x02265;120/70 mmHg according to the following schedule: olmesartan medoxomil 20 mg (weeks 1&#x02013;3); olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg (weeks 4&#x02013;6); olmesartan medoxomil/HCTZ 40/12.5 mg (weeks 7&#x02013;9); olmesartan medoxomil/HCTZ 40/25 mg (weeks 10&#x02013;12). If SeBP was &#x0003c;120/70 mmHg, patients entered a maintenance phase continuing on the same dosage. If SeBP was &#x02265;130/80 mmHg in patients in the maintenance phase during subsequent visits, the titration schedule was resumed, and patients continued to be uptitrated at 3-week intervals, as necessary, if SeBP remained &#x02265;120/70 mmHg.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Patients</title><p>Main inclusion criteria included the patient having hypertension (mean SeSBP of 140&#x02013;199 mmHg and mean SeDBP &#x02264;114 mmHg at two consecutive study visits during the placebo run-in phase, with a difference in SeSBP of &#x02264;10 mmHg) and type 2 diabetes (current regular use of oral antidiabetes agents; documented diabetes according to the ADA and/or WHO criteria; or diagnosis of diabetes after 40 years of age [non-insulin-dependent]). Patients were also included in the study if they were stable on oral antidiabetes agents for &#x02265;4 weeks or if they had newly diagnosed or existing hypertension (&#x0003e;130/80 mmHg) that was uncontrolled on current antihypertensive therapy. Finally, patients needed to have a mean daytime (8am to 4pm) ambulatory SBP &#x0003e;130 and &#x02264;199 mmHg, and mean daytime ambulatory diastolic BP (DBP).&#x02264;114 mmHg, as assessed by mean 24-hour ABPM during the placebo run-in phase for inclusion in the active treatment phase of the study.</p><p>The presence of any serious disorder, including cardiovascular, renal, pulmonary, hepatic, gastrointestinal, endocrine/metabolic (note: patients with non-insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes were allowed in the study), hematologic, oncologic, neurologic, and psychiatric diseases, overt proteinuria, or non-dominant arm circumference &#x0003c;24 cm or &#x0003e;42 cm, was exclusionary. Patients were removed from the study and treated with appropriate antihypertensive therapy at the discretion of the investigator if at any time SeBP either became &#x0003e;199/114 or &#x0003c;120/70 mmHg with symptomatic hypotension. Also, patients with a fasting serum glucose level of &#x0003e;300 mg/dL or a serum creatinine level of &#x0003e;1.7 mg/dL at screening were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Cuff Blood Pressure Protocol</title><p>Following a 5-minute rest period, three separate measurements were taken using an automatic Omron BP-monitoring device (HEM-705CPII; Omron Healthcare, Inc., Bannockburn, IL, USA), with a full 2-minute interval between SeBP measurements and with the cuff fully deflated between measurements.

For comparison, the most recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey showed that between 1999 and 2004, 42% of patients in the US who were diagnosed with diabetes and hypertension achieved an SeBP goal of &#x0003c;130/80 mmHg.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]</p><p>The present study demonstrated a trend for dose response-related SeBP reductions with higher doses of olmesartan medoxomil and HCTZ when administered either alone or in combination. SeBP reductions were significantly greater following dose increments with the single exception of the SeSBP reduction observed following titration of olmesartan medoxomil 20 mg to olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg. More than one-half of these patients with diabetes and hypertension experienced a &#x0003e;15 mmHg SeSBP reduction in the olmesartan medoxomil/HCTZ 40/12.5 mg and 40/25 mg groups by end of study.</p><p>It has been well documented that tight BP control in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular and renal disease as well as associated mortality rates.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] However, it has also been shown that two or more antihypertensive agents will be needed to achieve the SeBP goal of &#x0003c;130/80 mmHg in the majority of patients with diabetes and hypertension.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] The results reported in the current analysis of the BENIFICIARY study data show that an olmesartan medoxomil-based combination therapy produced significant BP reductions in patients with type 2 diabetes. These results are similar to those of other studies involving angiotensin receptor blockers, which have demonstrated significant BP reductions and higher goal BP achievement with dose titration and concomitant use of HCTZ in this difficult-to-treat patient population.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Olmesartan medoxomil &#x000b1; HCTZ has been shown to effectively reduce BP in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes.
