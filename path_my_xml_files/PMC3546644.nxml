A cumulative approach to measuring the proportion of patients achieving the BP goal was used because BP is a dynamic variable and patients with hypertension achieve the BP goal at different time points during any clinical assessment period just as would be observed in a real-world setting.

The majority of patients achieved the primary endpoint of a cuff SBP of less than 140 mmHg (or &#x0003c;130 mmHg in patients with diabetes) at week 12 on an AML/OM-based combination therapy regimen. Combined SeBP goal rates (&#x0003c;140/90 or &#x0003c;130/80 mmHg) were also achieved in a majority of patients at weeks 12 and 20. SeBP goal rates at both time points were slightly lower in Hispanic patients (69.0% and 81.0%) <italic>versus</italic> non-Hispanic patients (71.5% and 85.2%).</p><p>An effective antihypertensive agent should not only reduce BP but should also provide BP control throughout the dosing interval. Data have shown that the morning surge in BP resulting from variations in the circadian rhythm of BP is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, particularly during the first 2 h after awakening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753944712452190">Gosse <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>]. Thus, agents that provide 24 h BP control play an important role in potentially reducing cardiovascular events and improving outcomes. Although there are no guideline-approved ABP targets, the suggested AHA 24 h, daytime, and nighttime ABP targets (&#x0003c;130/80 mmHg, &#x0003c;135/85 mmHg, and &#x0003c;120/70 mmHg, respectively) were achieved at weeks 12 and 20 in a majority of Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients in this subgroup analysis. Mean 24 h, daytime, and nighttime ABP target rates achieved at week 12 were similar in Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients, with higher proportions of Hispanic patients achieving these same targets; however, greater proportions of non-Hispanic patients had achieved these ABP targets compared with the Hispanic subgroup at week 20. It should be noted that the number of Hispanic patients who underwent ABPM was small at 44. This may be one possible explanation for the discrepancy observed in week 12 and week 20 ABP target achievement rates in Hispanic patients. Overall, mean SeBP and mean 24 h, daytime, and nighttime ABP, and ABP measured in the last 2, 4, and 6 h of the dosing interval were all significantly reduced from baseline at weeks 12 and 20 in all patients.</p><p>Fixed-dose combination therapy with AML/OM, with or without HCTZ, was well tolerated in this patient population; no new safety issues were observed. The incidence of peripheral edema that has been previously associated with CCB therapy was expectedly highest in both the Hispanic and non-Hispanic groups for the AML/OM combination. The addition of HCTZ decreased its incidence in both cohorts, which was also reflected in the decreased incidence of drug-related TEAEs reported for the AML/OM + HCTZ treatment group. Thus, these data support previous observations that the incorporation of a thiazide diuretic into a high-dose AML regimen can help to reduce the incidence of edema. Although not subject to statistical analysis, the incidence of drug-related TEAEs appeared to be lower in Hispanic patients compared with the non-Hispanic population. Taken together, these data support the utility of an AML/OM-based titration regimen in providing well tolerated, 24 h BP control in Hispanic patients with hypertension uncontrolled on previous monotherapy.</p><p>Although guidelines advise that the use of at least two antihypertensive agents will be necessary for most patients to achieve BP goals in the seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure and in European guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753944712452190">Chobanian <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753944712452190">Mancia <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753944712452190">2009</xref>], this aspect of the guidelines is often not well translated into clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753944712452190">Spranger <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>].

For the ABP data analysis, the number of patients in the Hispanic subgroup was relatively small, and thus these results need to be assessed with caution if extrapolating to similar populations seen in the clinical setting due to low statistical power. In addition, potential gender effects on antihypertensive efficacy were not assessed in this study and it would be interesting to evaluate the effect of gender in combination with ethnicity in future studies. The strengths of this subgroup analysis were that it was prespecified in the study protocol and that it provides efficacy and safety data in a subgroup of patients that is often under-reported in the literature.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section19-1753944712452190"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This prespecified subgroup analysis showed that switching to a fixed-dose combination of AML/OM &#x000b1; HCTZ provided significant BP lowering and effectively controlled BP to achieve SeSBP and SeBP targets, as well as mean 24 h, daytime, and nighttime ABP targets in a large proportion of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients with hypertension whose condition was previously uncontrolled on antihypertensive monotherapy. In addition to achieving SeBP goals and 24 h ABP targets, the AML/OM &#x000b1; HCTZ combination therapy regimen was well tolerated in both Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Medical writing and editorial services were provided by Mary Hines and Alan J.
