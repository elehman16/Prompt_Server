The study medication will be administrated as an adjuvant treatment to standard anti-emetic therapy and will be divided into four capsules per day, to be consumed approximately every 4&#x000a0;hours (300&#x000a0;mg per capsule administered q.i.d) for five days during the first three cycles of chemotherapy. Acute, delayed, and anticipatory symptoms of nausea and vomiting will be assessed over this time frame using a valid and reliable questionnaire, with nausea symptoms being the primary outcome. Quality of life, nutritional status, adverse effects, patient adherence, cancer-related fatigue, and CINV-specific prognostic factors will also be assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Previous trials in this area have noted limitations. These include the inconsistent use of standardized ginger formulations and valid questionnaires, lack of control for anticipatory nausea and prognostic factors that may influence individual CINV response, and the use of suboptimal dosing regimens. This trial is the first to address these issues by incorporating multiple unique additions to the study design including controlling for CINV-specific prognostic factors by recruiting only chemotherapy-na&#x000ef;ve patients, implementing a dosing schedule consistent with the pharmacokinetics of oral ginger supplements, and independently analysing ginger supplements before and after recruitment to ensure potency. Our trial will also be the first to assess the effect of ginger supplementation on cancer-related fatigue and nutritional status. Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting are distressing symptoms experienced by oncology patients; this trial will address the significant limitations within the current literature and in doing so, will investigate the effect of ginger supplementation as an adjuvant treatment in modulating nausea and vomiting symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ANZCTR.org.au Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=363377">ACTRN12613000120774</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Ginger</kwd><kwd>CINV</kwd><kwd>Nausea</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><sec><title>Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting places a significant burden on the patient</title><p>Despite the efficacy of cytotoxic interventions in the treatment of cancer, these treatments are often accompanied by a variety of adverse effects. Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is a relatively common side effect of this treatment and has been repeatedly rated as one of the most distressing symptoms in this setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. While there have been multiple classes of medications developed to treat this symptom, nausea and vomiting persists in a large number of patients. The incidence of vomiting has been significantly reduced through combinations of anti-emetic medications, but efforts to control nausea have been less successful. Affecting upwards of 60% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], CINV has also been shown to significantly impact on patient quality of life (QoL). Moreover, although it happens rarely, CINV can be so severe that it can lead to dose reduction or treatment discontinuation, and subsequently increase the risk of disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Ginger extract appears beneficial in treating chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting</title><p>Ginger (<italic>Zingiber officinale</italic>) has been used for centuries by many cultures as a folk-remedy for gastrointestinal-related conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Previous clinical trials have provided support for its use in the treatment of nausea in multiple settings including CINV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and two previous clinical trials have found ginger supplementation to be as effective as metoclopramide in reducing symptoms of CINV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, animal and cell culture data have demonstrated a viable mechanism of action for its anti-nausea effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The rhizome of ginger possesses an array of bioactive compounds (i.e. gingerols, shogaols, zingiberene, zingerone, and paradol) that may be responsible for the reported beneficial effects of ginger use. Cell culture and animal studies suggest that these constituents stimulate oral and gastric secretions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], regulate gastrointestinal motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], interact with the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> and NK-1 receptors implicated in the CINV reflex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and assist in rescuing intracellular redox metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Of note, the interaction of ginger with 5-HT<sub>3</sub> and NK-1 receptors is particularly promising as the success of modern anti-emetic medications (i.e. 5-HT<sub>3</sub> and NK-1 antagonists) are due to similar interactions with these same receptors. Furthermore, animal studies provide preliminary support for the role of ginger supplementation in the prevention of cisplatin-induced emesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>A recent review found seven clinical studies have investigated ginger supplementation in this setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. These studies present a contentious picture of the efficacy of ginger as an anti-CINV treatment in patients administered chemotherapy, with three demonstrating a positive effect, two in favour but with caveats, and two reporting no effect on measures of CINV. However, multiple limitations were identified within the existing literature that need to be resolved before clinical recommendations can be made.</p></sec><sec><title>Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting poses a significant risk to patients&#x02019; nutritional status and treatment outcomes</title><p>Previous studies report that approximately 50% of patients in the oncology setting are malnourished [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Malnutrition is a serious concern for oncology patients as it can significantly and severely affect QoL and treatment-related outcomes. Malnutrition can result in compromised immune function, reduced functional status, decreased performance status, and impaired treatment response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Nausea and vomiting in this setting are of significant concern in patients diagnosed with cancer, as these symptoms can adversely affect dietary intake, increasing the risk of malnutrition during treatment.</p><p>It is feasible then to suggest that interventions that improve nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy may consequentially aid in improving and maintaining nutritional status. However, to date, there are no studies that have investigated the influence of ginger on patient nutritional status in this setting. Therefore, this protocol assesses nutritional status after each cycle using the validated questionnaire, the Patient Generated- Subjective Global Assessment, performed by an accredited dietitian.</p></sec><sec><title>Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting might exacerbate or be physiologically related to chemotherapy-related fatigue</title><p>Like nausea and vomiting, chemotherapy-related fatigue (CRF) is both highly prevalent in this population and can significantly influence the patient&#x02019;s quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The results from a number of studies that have investigated CRF have found nausea and vomiting to be a strongly associated set of symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The reason for this is not fully elucidated but due to this significant correlation, treatment options that have been traditionally targeted at treating CINV should be further investigated as these modalities may also provide benefit to patients experiencing CRF. Using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapies- Fatigue (FACIT-F) subscale, our study will be the first to investigate the effect of adjuvant ginger supplementation on self-reported measures of fatigue.</p></sec><sec><title>Comprehensive, validated questionnaires are required to assess chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting</title><p>In order to assess CINV, the instrument used needs to be able to accurately capture the relevant aspects of CINV. Nausea, vomiting and retching, while temporally related, are distinct phenomena and therefore, are required to be measured as separate entities. In addition to this, a well-developed questionnaire should be able to provide a detailed picture of each phenomena. Widely used questionnaires in this setting include questions that measure multiple domains of CINV such as the severity, the perceived intensity of CINV; frequency, the amount of times CINV occurred over a time period; duration, the length of time that these symptoms persisted; and distress, the perceived burden that these symptoms place on the patients daily function and QoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>There have been several questionnaires developed for the use of measuring nausea and vomiting, not only in the chemotherapy setting but also in other areas. A recent review identified 25 instruments that have been developed to measure nausea and vomiting in the clinical setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The authors used a list of criteria to determine the scope of nausea and vomiting that each questionnaire was able to capture. Of all questionnaires reviewed, no one tool fulfilled all criteria; however, the Index of Nausea, Vomiting, and Retching (INVR) tool was found to best meet this criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>A recent review found that only one previous study that investigated the effect of ginger on CINV used the INVR questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This poses a significant limitation to the current literature as it is plausible that in these previous studies, ginger may have provided some benefit to domains of CINV that were not captured by the questionnaires employed in these respective studies.</p><p>Therefore, in order to ensure that our study is able to capture all relevant factors involved in CINV, it is important to use a questionnaire that is both validated and comprehensive and so it was decided that this study will incorporate the INVR questionnaire.</p></sec><sec><title>Predisposing factors influence individual susceptibility to chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting</title><p>Multiple factors are reported to influence the individual risk of a patient developing CINV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. These factors relate not only to the treatment protocol but also the patient&#x02019;s lifestyle, mental state, and previous experience with nausea and vomiting in other settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Consequently, while the emetogenicity of the treatment protocol is the major determinant of CINV risk, a patient with multiple predisposing factors can experience significant levels of CINV despite being prescribed a low emetogenic chemotherapy regimen. Of particular concern is the development of anticipatory nausea and vomiting, a conditioned response that is difficult to treat, and the gradual resistance to anti-emetic therapy after multiple chemotherapy cycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>These factors represent a significant set of potential confounding variables for RCTs in this setting. To date, all trials in this area have recruited patients that have already experienced nausea and vomiting in previous chemotherapy cycles. This allows for the potential recruitment of patients with an already established resistance to additional anti-emetic therapies. Furthermore, if lifestyle factors such as alcohol intake and previous experience of motion sickness, which have been shown to influence CINV risk, are not screened for, this may result in a study comprised of two groups with a predisposed heterogeneous response to CINV. To date, this has not been thoroughly controlled for and therefore, may account for some of the difference in the results between previous trials. We have developed a short questionnaire that aims to assess these factors and will be the first study to factor this into our post-study statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Previous dosing regimens and formulations of ginger may not have been optimal</title><p>In two recent studies that investigated the pharmacokinetics of multiple ginger compounds, it was found that these compounds have a relatively short half-life of approximately 1.5-3&#x000a0;hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In order to ensure that there are sufficient plasma levels of the active compounds throughout the day, the dosage in this study is divided between 4 capsules that will be consumed approximately every 4&#x000a0;hours.</p><p>The dosage of 1.2&#x000a0;g was selected for the following reasons: 1) it is within the typical dosage utilised in previous literature; 2) a lower dose, divided into multiple capsules, might not reach adequate concentrations to be effective; and 3) concerns that higher doses would reduce CINV control. Previous studies indicated higher doses were either less effective or possibly interfered with standard anti-emetic medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>An additional limitation in the existing literature is the inconsistent use of standardized ginger extracts. Of the seven studies included in a recent review, only two studies used a ginger formulation that had been standardised to the relevant bioactive compounds while the remaining five used a crude ginger powder in capsule form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The concentration of active compounds found within preparations of ginger has been found to be highly variable and can be influenced by the storage, location, and type of processing involved in the manufacturing of a specific ginger product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Due to the majority of previous studies using unstandardized formulations, the inconsistent results reported in the literature may be attributed to the differences in compounds the formulations used in each study.</p><p>To control for this limitation, we are using a ginger extract that has been standardised to contain 5% gingerols. We have also arranged for a sample of our ginger capsules to be independently analysed at the commencement and completion of our study to ensure the potency of the formulation.</p><p>Incorporating the results of these studies, we are expanding on the current literature as the majority of previous trials have used dosing regimens that are inconsistent with these findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Purpose of study and objectives</title><sec><title>Purpose of study</title><p>Despite advances in anti-emetic medication, CINV continues to be a significant problem for many patients undergoing chemotherapy and is often rated as one of the most deleterious side-effects of cancer chemotherapeutic treatments. There is evidence from international trials that ginger formulations, in conjunction with standard anti-emetic medication, can be effective in the treatment of CINV. However, this therapy is not routinely used in oncology clinics due to its novelty and the lack of information about how patients will tolerate ginger in the clinical setting.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Hypothesis</title><p>It is hypothesised that in chemotherapy-na&#x000ef;ve medical oncology patients about to commence treatment of any emetogenicity, adjuvant ginger supplementation compared with placebo will:</p><p>1.

It has 9 items in each of the nausea and vomiting scales, the first item of which rates the extent of nausea or vomiting experienced in the previous 5&#x000a0;days. The remaining items examine patients&#x02019; social, recreational and leisure activities, ability to do normal tasks, their enjoyment of eating and drinking, and the hardship caused by their nausea and vomiting on themselves and their carers. Each response is ranked on a seven point scale. The FLIE score is determined by summing the responses to the 9 questions in each scale. Therefore, the range of total scores possible per scale is 9 to 63, with a higher score responding to less hardship and less impact of nausea or vomiting on daily life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. No or minimal impact on daily life is defined as an average FLIE item score of no more than 6 on the 7 point scale or a total FLIE score of more than 54 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The FLIE has excellent internal reliability, with a Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; &#x0003e; 0.90 for both sub-scales on all assessment points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The FLIE takes less than 2&#x000a0;minutes to complete.</p></sec><sec><title>CINV susceptibility questionnaire</title><p>This questionnaire has been developed for use in this trial to determine participants&#x02019; predisposition to CINV. Previous research has reported several factors correlated with susceptibility to CINV. These include lifestyle factors (e.g. alcohol intake); previous experience of nausea and/or vomiting from causes other than chemotherapy (e.g. motion sickness, pregnancy); and participant characteristics (e.g. age, gender). It is estimated that the questionnaire takes approximately 5&#x000a0;minutes to complete.</p></sec><sec><title>Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS)</title><p>The ESAS is a validated and reliable tool used to assess the severity of common symptoms experienced by cancer patients including pain, anxiety and drowsiness. It includes 10 items that are self-assessed by the patient using individual 10-point scales. This tool has been validated in this population and has reported a Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; of 0.79 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The tool will be administrated at -1&#x000a0;day and at 4&#x000a0;days post-chemotherapy for each cycle in order to determine treatment related side-effects. The tool should take approximately 5&#x000a0;minutes to complete.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient Generated - Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA)</title><p>Nutritional status will be measured using the valid and reliable scored PG-SGA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Using the data gained from this tool, statistical analysis will be conducted to determine the impact of CINV on the participants&#x02019; nutritional status. The PG-SGA will be conducted by a dietitian who has undergone training and testing for inter-rater reliability on nutritional status measures. The PG-SGA is specifically designed to assess the nutritional status of cancer patients. This tool provides a global rating of either A (well nourished), B (suspected or moderately malnourished) or C (severely malnourished). This global rating is based upon weight change, dietary intake, GI symptoms, a physical examination and the patient&#x02019;s functional capacity. A total PG-SGA score is also calculated. A higher score reflects a higher risk of malnutrition and an increased need for nutrition intervention and symptom management.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- General (FACT-G) and Fatigue (FACIT-F) subscale</title><p>The participants&#x02019; self-assessed QoL will be measured using the FACT-G questionnaire, a validated tool that has been widely used in this setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. It contains 27 questions with a 5-point scale, which assesses four domains of patient QoL: physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional wellbeing, and functional well-being. Strong concurrent validity with the Functional Living Index-Cancer tool was demonstrated with a Pearson coefficient of 0.79 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Additionally, we have included the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy- Fatigue (FACIT-F) subscale, a 13 item Likert scale, to assess self-reported symptoms of fatigue before and after each chemotherapy cycle. It is estimated to take between 5-10&#x000a0;minutes to complete.</p></sec><sec><title>Adherence questionnaire</title><p>To assess the level of adherence to the study protocol, a questionnaire was developed for patients to record if and when they consumed the ginger/placebo doses per day. This is achieved by either recording the time or marking an X, depending on whether they consumed each dose, in the box corresponding to the dose in question. This is to be completed each day and is expected to take less than 2&#x000a0;minutes to complete.</p></sec><sec><title>Timeline</title><p>The details of the study procedure are detailed below in chronological order.

Recommendations for the use of ginger in the oncology setting are premature, as previous reviews have shown inconsistent results and have possessed several limitations. Primary concerns identified in the literature include the lack of control of anticipatory nausea, the inconsistent use of standardised ginger extracts and validated assessments tools, and a lack of assessment for prognostic factors that may influence individual CINV response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Additionally, recent pharmacokinetic studies demonstrate that the half-life of the active compounds within ginger are relatively short-lived, which suggests that the dosing regimens employed by previous studies may be suboptimal. Furthermore, multiple studies included in these reviews have used anti-emetic therapies that are not congruent with current best practice and anti-emetic guidelines and therefore, the application of these previous findings to current practise are further diminished [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p><p>In designing our trial, we aimed to address these limitations while incorporating elements of rigorous study methodology that have been incorporated in previous trials in this area. For example, our trial will be using multiple, validated assessment tools along with a standardised ginger extract, both of which have been utilised in at least two previous trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. We will, however, expand on this by independently analysing our extracts at both the beginning and end of our recruitment phase to ensure consistent potency.</p><p>It should also be noted that one study by Ryan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] found ginger to reduce CINV when ginger supplementation was commenced three days before chemotherapy. We, however, decided against using this methodology and opted for ginger supplementation commencing on the day of chemotherapy due to the following reasons. Firstly, there have been multiple previous trials using ginger for CINV as well as other forms of nausea that did not use the regimen used by Ryan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] but rather a timeframe and dosage more closely resembling the regimen in our protocol that yielded beneficial results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. In addition to this, to date, there has been no research that has investigated the regimen used in the Ryan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] study compared to the more typical dosing regimen that has been employed in our study, which restricts one from determining the superiority of said regimen. Lastly, the basis for said regimen, from our research and from the discussion in the Ryan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] paper, seems to have been implemented largely on a theoretical basis and therefore, until more evidence arises, we have decided to instead opt for the more patient-convenient regimen described in this manuscript.</p><p>Our trial will also be the first to introduce multiple novel study design elements. Primarily, our study will be the first to recruit only chemotherapy-naive patients. This strategy should mitigate the significant limitation of anticipatory nausea. It is a response to previous research reporting that CINV control progressively deteriorates with each subsequent chemotherapy cycle, if not adequately controlled during the initial cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Due to the association between fatigue and nausea in this setting, we will also investigate the effect that ginger has on this association in order to determine if ginger may be of benefit to patients also experiencing cancer-related fatigue. Finally, our study will also implement a dosing regimen that is consistent with the findings of the previously mentioned pharmacokinetic studies that will likely improve the CINV protection of this therapy. If successful, this trial will provide support for the efficacy of ginger as a viable adjuvant anti-emetic therapy and in doing so, help manage chemotherapy symptoms and assist in improving patient QoL.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CINV: Chemotherapy-induced Nausea and vomiting; QoL: Quality of life; PG-SGA: Patient generated - subjective global assessment; FACT-G: Functional assessment of cancer therapy- general; FACIT-F: Functional assessment of chronic illness therapy-fatigue; INVR: Rhodes inventory of Nausea vomiting and retching; ESAS: Edmonton Symptom Assessment System; FLIE-5DR: The functional living Index &#x02013; Emesis &#x02013; 5&#x000a0;day recall.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Luis Vitetta has received National Institute of Complementary Medicine and National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia competitive funding and Industry support for research into nutraceuticals.
