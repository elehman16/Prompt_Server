However, large perforations often fail to do so.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Hence, controversy continues regarding the treatment of large traumatic TMPs. A majority of otolaryngologists suggest that early myringoplasty should be performed to improve the healing rate.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Nevertheless, this procedure requires general anaesthesia and expensive equipment, resulting in a patients' high cost. Although some authors have suggested that patch treatment could shorten the healing time of large traumatic TMPs, it has little benefits in improving the overall healing rate.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In addition, most large traumatic TMPs have curled edges, and the necessity to manipulate curled edges is also controversial. Some authors believe that curled edges may result in abnormal epithelium migration and failure of closure; in particular, inverted edges could migrate into the tympanum and develop middle ear cholesteatoma; ideal management should be to restore the original position.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>In one of our recent publications,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> we compared edge approximation plus gelfoam patch, gelfoam patch and spontaneous healing on the outcome of traumatic TMPs with inverted or everted edges. The results showed that gelfoam patch plus edge approximation only shortened the healing time, but did not improve the healing rate. This was in agreement with other reports.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In addition, in another recent study of ours,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> we compared direct application of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) alone and topical bFGF application plus gelfoam patching on the healing outcome of large traumatic TMPs. We observed that bFGF significantly improved the healing rate and shortened the closure time as compared to spontaneous healing. Some clinical and experimental studies have also demonstrated that topical application of exogenous fibroblast growth factor (FGF) facilitates the healing of experimental eardrum perforations and human chronic eardrum perforations and has no toxic side effects on the inner or middle ear.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The present study was conducted to compare the effects of bFGF application and perforation edge approximation each alone on the healing of large traumatic TMPs with inverted edges.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>The study was reviewed and approved by the institutional ethical review board of Wenzhou Medical College-Affiliated Yiwu Hospital, China, and conducted in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration.

Of these patients, six refused to participate, 71 failed to fulfil the inclusion criteria and 58 were recruited. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) traumatic TMP involving &#x0003e;50% of the surface area with inverted edges or brown crusts derived from inverted edges and (ii) presentation within 7&#x000a0;days of the injury. All perforations were caused by blows to the ear. Patients were excluded if physical examinations revelled any of the following conditions: granulation tissue or purulent otorrhoea within the ear, severe vertigo, profound hearing loss or ossicular disruption to minimise the possible confounding effects of these condition on the treatment outcome.</p><p>Before treatment, the tympanic membrane (TM) was examined with an endoscope after cerumen or blood clots were carefully cleaned from the external auditory canal (EAC) with a cotton bud and the EAC was simultaneously photographed with a digital video camera, and the size of the perforation was analysed using I<sc>magej</sc> software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) and expressed as a percentage of the whole TM surface area. A large perforation was defined as a perforation estimated to comprise 50% or more of the entire TM. Patient age and sex, date and cause of traumatic injury, TMP size, presence or absence of otorrhoea, presence of ossicular disruption and associated clinical findings such as vertigo, tinnitus and perilymph leakage were all recorded. As it has been well established that healing of the perforation was always associated with successful closure of the air&#x02013;bone gap,<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> audiometric examination was not performed in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment allocation</title><p>The 56 subjects were allocated into three groups: no intervention control (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;&#x00026;&#x000a0;18); edge approximation (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;&#x00026;&#x000a0;20); and bFGF application (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;&#x00026;&#x000a0;20). This was performed by the principal investigator with the help of a registered nurse using a sequential allocation method. Specifically, consecutive subjects who both met the inclusion criteria and signed the consent form were alternatively allocated to the three groups based on the order of their initial hospital visit and date of returning the signed consent form.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatments</title><sec><title>No intervention group</title><p>Patients in this group received no intervention, but underwent regular follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Perforation edge-approximation group</title><p>Under an otomicroscope, lidocaine (2%) and epinephrine (1&#x000a0;:&#x000a0;100&#x000a0;000 diluted) were injected into the bony cartilaginous junction of the EAC.

Approximately 0.25&#x000a0;mL (4&#x02013;5 drops) of a recombinant bovine bFGF (21&#x000a0;000&#x000a0;IU/5&#x000a0;mL) solution (Yi Sheng, Zhuhai City, China) was applied directly onto the TM, and no scaffolding material was used. The first application of bFGF drops was carried out by the doctor at the initial hospital visit. Afterwards, bFGF drops were applied daily by patients themselves at home as instructed until complete perforation closure was confirmed by the physician. The first follow-up examination was performed 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;days after the initial hospital visit, and the doctor determined whether the self-application of bFGF by patients at home was correct and whether purulent otorrhoea developed. Incorrect application of bFGF was corrected.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Follow-up</title><p>Oral amoxicillin was given to all subjects for 1&#x000a0;week. After the first follow-up visit, patients were followed up at least once per week until complete closure of the perforation or up to 6&#x000a0;months. The TM was examined repeatedly by endoscopy at all follow-up visits. To reduce clinician bias, clinical events such as TM closure or the presence of otorrhoea were photo-documented using colour slides. If the patient had severe vertigo, signs of perilymph leakage were evaluated and patients were excluded from the study. Perforation closure was confirmed by endoscopic examination. Demographic data and outcome measures were expressed as mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;<sc>sd</sc> and analysed using a paired chi-squared test or <italic>t</italic>-test with the <sc>spss</sc> software (ver.11.0 for Windows; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

Over time, the amount of centripetal migratory epithelium gradually increased, and the perforation closed in nine patients. In other seven patients of this group, centripetal migratory epithelium was not seen along the edge of the malleus. Instead, yellow epithelialisation of the leading edge of centripetal migratory epithelium was seen at the annulus edge within 8&#x02013;12&#x000a0;weeks, and the perforation failed to close completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The spontaneous healing process at various time points: 3&#x000a0;days (a), 6&#x000a0;days (b), 8&#x000a0;days (c), 12&#x000a0;days (d), 16&#x000a0;days (e), 4&#x000a0;weeks (f), 12&#x000a0;weeks (g) and 16&#x000a0;weeks (h).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="coa0038-0289-f1"/></fig><p>Of the 20 patients in the edge-approximation group, the perforation obviously became smaller after edge approximation.

Otoscopic examinations showed that the approximated curled edges on the side of the malleus handle returned to their original positions. The underlying mechanisms were not clear, but contraction of the tympanic muscles and sustained vibration of the malleus handle might be involved. Otoscopic examinations also showed that the approximated perforation edges did not show any signs of healing and instead the perforation closure started on the non-curled edge side where centripetal migration of epithelial cells was evident. Nevertheless, in four cases of edge approximation, a needlepoint hole remained unclosed between the newly regenerated membrane and the approximated membrane by the end of the 6-month follow-up.

Histological assess-ment of the healing process in large traumatic TMPs following perforation edge approximation or direct FGF appli-cation in a large sample size is warranted in further studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical implications</title><p>Approximation of curled edges seems not to be an ideal treatment option for large TMPs; it neither improves the closure rate nor reduces the closure time, and it requires local or general anaesthesia. In a sharp contrast, topical application of bFGF, which can be simply carried out by patients themselves at home, is able to improve the closure rate and shorten the closure time without significant adverse effects. As a result, bFGF drops may be considered as an ideal management option for large traumatic TMPs.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors have no funding, financial relationships or conflict of interest to disclose.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Orji</surname><given-names>FT</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Agu</surname><given-names>CC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Determinants of spontaneous healing in traumatic perforations of the tympanic membrane</article-title><source>Clin.
