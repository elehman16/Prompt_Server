Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations and inflammatory cytokines were measured as well as hepatic nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-&#x003ba;B) binding. Lutein concentrations were greater in eyes (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) and liver (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) in the Lutein group. All guinea pigs had high concentrations of hepatic cholesterol as well as high plasma ALT and AST levels indicative of liver injury. However, the Lutein group had 43% lower hepatic free cholesterol than the Controls (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Hepatic MDA and MDA in the eye were lower in the Lutein compared to the Control group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Hepatic tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; was 32% lower in the Lutein group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Lastly, the Lutein group presented lower NF-&#x003ba;B DNA binding activity than the Control group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). These results suggest that in the presence of high cholesterol, lutein exerts both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, which can be explained by attenuated NF-&#x003ba;B DNA binding activity. Furthermore, results also suggest that lutein accumulates in the eyes of guinea pigs to protect against oxidative stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Lutein</kwd><kwd>lipid peroxidation</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>guinea pigs</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The carotenoid lutein is preferentially accumulated in the macular region of the human retina where it is known to protect the eyes against light damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], preventing the development of degenerative conditions in the eye including age-related macular degeneration (AMD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Retinal inflammatory reaction is suggested as a pathogenic factor in most retinal diseases including AMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, oxidative stress is known to contribute to retinal inflammatory reactions. In an experimental animal model, oxidative damage in the outer retina and induction of inflammation contribute to the development of AMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, whether the administration of lutein reduces the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in eyes and has a protective effect during inflammatory states remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Recent studies have also suggested that lutein can reduce atherosclerosis and exert cardiac protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, there are not sufficient reports on the effects of lutein on other degenerative conditions, such as liver injury, and its underlying mechanisms. A small number of <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have suggested that this carotenoid may protect the liver against oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In the aspect of anti-inflammatory effects, previous studies have shown that lutein inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced systemic inflammation in animal models and in RAW 264.7 macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A recent study also reported that dietary lutein decreased interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2; mRNA levels in the liver of F-line turkeys challenged with LPS injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The mechanism by which lutein down-regulates inflammatory responses in the liver has not been fully investigated. However, several studies have suggested an association between nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-&#x003ba;B) signaling pathway and a wide variety of pathological conditions in the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Based on these observations, it is possible that the mechanism by which lutein attenuates the inflammatory state in the liver may be mediated through NF-&#x003ba;B pathways.</p><p>The guinea pig is a suitable animal model to study hepatic cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism because of similar responses to humans in regards to dietary interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. High cholesterol diets (0.25%) have been shown to increase hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride accumulation compared to low cholesterol diets (0.04%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This excess lipid accumulation in the liver may lead to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. We have previously demonstrated that lutein decreases cholesterol accumulation, oxidative damage and inflammation in aortas of guinea pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that lutein accumulation in the eyes of guinea pigs could protect against oxidative stress and inflammation. Further we tested the hypothesis that lutein could prevent degenerative conditions in the liver of guinea pigs fed with high cholesterol diet by reducing lipid peroxidation and attenuating pro-inflammatory cytokine production.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Nineteen male Hartley guinea pigs (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Wilmington MA) were randomly assigned into either the Lutein group or the Control group.

In addition, lutein exerts antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, lutein treatment protects against degenerative conditions in the liver of guinea pigs fed with high cholesterol diet by reducing hepatic free cholesterol, decreasing lipid peroxidation and attenuating the inflammatory responses known to contribute to the development of NAFLD. Data also indicate that the attenuated inflammatory response with lutein treatment was due to the decreased NF-&#x003ba;B p65 DNA binding activity. However, interestingly, there were no differences in ALT and AST concentrations between groups, two major indicators of liver injury.</p><p>A previous study conducted with guinea pigs identified lutein in both eyes and liver after feeding the animals lutein at the supplemental level of 7.97 mg/kg diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Based on this result, we decided to use 0.1 g/100 g lutein to ensure not only the presence of this carotenoid in eye and liver but also to prove its protective effects on these tissues. Consistent with this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], we successfully detected lutein in both eyes and liver.</p><p>Hepatic lipid overloading has been considered the first hit in NAFLD development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and high cholesterol diet treated guinea pigs present greater hepatic total cholesterol and triglyceride accumulation than those fed a low cholesterol diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In this study, we observed greater lipid accumulation in guinea pig liver compared to those treated with low concentrations of dietary cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. It is important to note that there were no differences in hepatic total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations between the two groups in the present study. Consistent with these results, it is reported that fat content of liver was independent of amounts of dietary lutein in Japanese quail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However the Lutein group presented significantly lower percent distribution of free cholesterol in hepatic total cholesterol compared to the Control group. Additionally, percent distribution of free cholesterol presented strong positive correlations with both plasma ALT and AST levels. Therefore, the larger portion of free cholesterol in the Control group may increase the risk of liver injury. Lipid composition of human liver demonstrated almost 2-fold increase in free cholesterol content in subjects with NAFLD or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) compared to normal subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. It is suggested that several abnormalities that can be observed in NAFLD including mitochondrial abnormalities and impaired adenosine triphosphate synthesis may potentially contribute to the increase in hepatic free cholesterol contents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Oxidative stress also has been considered as an important etiological factor in many progressive liver diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The excessive lipid peroxidation caused by free radicals leads to oxidative stress, which results in the accumulation of MDA. MDA is one of the end products of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. It is well known that lutein is a beneficial antioxidant due to its structural characteristics consisting in centrally localized conjugated C = C double bonds, which can readily quench reactive oxygen species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Additionally, hydroxyl groups attached to each of the 2 terminal &#x003b2;, &#x003b5;-ionone rings make lutein scavenge free radicals more efficiently than other carotenoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Collectively, the antioxidant effects of lutein may attenuate the oxidative stress and the production of MDA. In the present study, the lutein treated guinea pigs presented lower MDA production in liver compared to the control guinea pigs. In addition, hepatic lutein concentrations were negatively correlated with hepatic MDA concentrations, which clearly indicates that lutein may inhibit lipid peroxidation.</p><p>Liver injury by pro-inflammatory cytokines is another major factor to induce liver disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In particular, NF-&#x003ba;B, a major transcriptional factor involved in cell survival, immunity and inflammation, is activated during liver injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway and subsequent pro-inflammatory cytokine production regulate the maintenance of liver homoeostasis as well as the pathogenesis of a wide variety of liver diseases, including viral hepatitis, steatohepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It has been shown that lutein directly decreases NF-&#x003ba;B activation and suppresses both mRNA and protein levels of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), TNF-&#x003b1;, and IL-1&#x003b2;. Peroxisome proliferator X receptor (PPAR) and retinoic acid X receptor (RXR) are members of nuclear hormone receptors and they regulate NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway and inflammatory cytokine production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. One recent study suggested that LPS-induced PPAR&#x003b1; and RXR&#x003b1; down-regulation was partially reversed by increasing the dietary lutein content to 50 mg/kg in chickens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Therefore, based on these studies, an anti-inflammatory effect of lutein may be explained by direct inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B activation or PPAR&#x003b1;/RXR&#x003b1;-mediated regulation. Consistent to these studies, we found that guinea pigs from the Lutein group presented significantly lower hepatic TNF-&#x003b1; concentration than guinea pigs from the Control group. In agreement with our study, mice with D-galactose-induced liver injury also showed that 40 mg/kg/day of lutein treatment lowers iNOS content in the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Although lutein treatment inhibited lipid peroxidation and the inflammatory state in guinea pigs fed a high cholesterol diet, there were no differences on liver enzyme concentrations in the plasma between two groups. Serum ALT concentrations have been associated with decreased serum antioxidant concentrations, particularly carotenoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Additionally, Several animal studies suggest that lutein lowers ALT and AST concentrations due to scavenging of reactive oxygen radicals in rats with paracetamol-, carbon tetrachloride- and ethanol-induced hepatic injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. However, these studies used higher amount of lutein (50, 100, 250 mg/day) than in the current investigation (30 mg/day).</p><p>The retina in the eyes is extremely rich in membranes with polyunsaturated fatty acids and this characteristic makes the eye susceptible to lipid peroxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Not only by filtering the blue light, which is the most damaging wavelength of light that reaches the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] but also by readily quenching singlet oxygen species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], lutein protects the eye from oxidative stress. In the current study, lutein was successfully detected in the eyes of guinea pigs with lutein treatment and they presented lower concentrations of MDA compared to guinea pigs without lutein treatment. We also observed lower pro-inflammatory cytokine productions with lutein treatment in the eye and consistent with our study, pro-inflammatory cytokine productions in the aqueous humor of rats with endotoxin-induced uveitis were reduced with 100 mg/kg lutein administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This result was explained by suppression of NF-&#x003ba;B activation with lutein, therefore lutein might be involved in the regulation NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway in the eye as well.</p><p>In summary, our findings suggest that lutein might have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions in the eye. Additionally, this carotenoid could prevent degenerative conditions of the liver by reducing the free cholesterol pool and attenuating lipid peroxidation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Further, attenuated inflammatory state in the liver could be explained by decreased NF-&#x003ba;B p65 binding activity.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation
