Pain reaches its peak at 6 h post-operatively and swelling reaches its maximum on the first post-operative evening and remains at a high level until the fourth day.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Extending a surgical procedure more than 10 min results in more post-operative sequelae.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] An ideal drug for administration after the surgical removal of an impacted lower third molar should alleviate pain, reduce inflammation, trismus, facilitate healing and cause no undesirable side-effects.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>It is now universal knowledge that steroids reduce post-operative complications. In spite of their obvious numerous benefits, their use is mostly limited by most surgeons due to their association with a host of potential side-effects, most of which are relative to mineralocorticoid activity and and/or chronic dosing regimens.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Hypothalmic&#x02013;pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, which is a significant phenomenon only with chronic dosing, should not, however, be a contraindication to the use of steroids in third molar surgery.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Corticosteroid doses for less than 5-7 days result in insignificant HPA suppression and cortisol levels return to the normal value in 5-7 days.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Such short-term steroid therapy is safe in the absence of contraindications to its use, as listed by Pederson <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In this study, glucocorticosteroids for only 3 days were given to minimize potential side-effects and true contraindications.</p><p>Methylprednisolone is five times more potent than hydrocortisone and has non-existent mineral-corticoid action.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Al-Khateeb <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a randomized study to determine the efficacy of dexamethasone versus methylprednisolone, and concluded that pain and trismus was more reduced in the methylprednisolone group.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Several other research articles have also shown that swelling and pain that developed after third molar removal were significantly reduced by methylprednisolone,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Therefore, methylprednisolone was the drug of choice among steroids.</p><p>For steroids, different modes of administration have been conducted and recommended in different studies. The IV route offers instantaneous blood levels, but while high-dosing IV studies have demonstrated significant short-term improvements, the effects were not sustained. Rebound swelling can occur if the duration of use is inadequate; therefore, it is important to maintain the levels of short-duration steroid formulations for more than 1 day.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] The IM route provides an anti-inflammatory effect for long, but it may cause a higher risk of adrenaline suppression. Other hindrances to percutaneous routes include necessary operator experience, armamentarium and patient discomfort.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The convenience of oral dosing, in contrast, has general appeal,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] With the oral route, glucocorticosteroids are rapidly and almost completely absorbed, making them as effective as parenteral avenues.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Post-operative dosing was also found to be successfully effective.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Therefore, in the present study, the oral route and post-operative dosing were selected.</p><p>Methyprednisolone has an intermediate half-life of 18-36 h.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] When glucocorticosteroids are orally administered, repeated dosing is required to maintain adequate blood levels throughout the immediate post-operative period.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] There is a need to continue corticosteroid therapy for a minimum of 3 days because swelling in patients treated with steroids does not appear to peak until the third day after surgery.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Previous investigations, however, are not convincing regarding clinical improvement following oral administration because of low dosing schedules and short observation periods.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Corticosteroid doses to be significantly effective should range from 80 to 625 mg hydrocortisone equivalent anti-inflammatory dosage, which in case of methylprednisolone is 16&#x02013;125 mg.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] It has also been corroborated that a dosage of methylprednisolone of less than or equal to 40 mg does not produce any adverse systemic effects.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Therefore, in the present study, 24 mg of methylprednisolone was given in three divided doses for three days and no side-effects were observed following administration of the steroid. It has been established that tapering off doses is not mandatory in short-term dosing.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In this research too, steroid was terminated without tapering dose.</p><p>A few authors believe that corticosteroids are the drug of choice in preventing edema; however, NSAIDs may be required for better pain relief.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Diclofenac is known to possess both analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. Previous studies have proven that diclofenac sodium reduces pain and swelling more, if not equally effective, when compared with other single anti-inflammatory drugs and/or fixed drug combinations after impacted third molar removal.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] It can therefore be used as an agent to control post-operative sequelae and was the NSAID of choice for this study. Of its three dispensable forms, namely intravenous infusion, soft gel and tablets, per-oral tablets were favored because of the limited duration of action and higher cost of treatment with infusions and gel.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] Further, pre-operative use of NSAIDs may not offer a pre-emptive analgesic effect in patients who have had adequate analgesia during the surgery.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] Continued use of analgesic drugs during the post-operative period is therefore recommended by most authors, and was followed in the present study too.</p><p>While the sample size for this study is not large by any means, it was nevertheless adequate for statistical purposes, given the implied limitation of time period in a dissertation. A placebo group comprising of patients not being given NSAIDs was thought implausible and corrupt on moral and ethical grounds, because pain follows this kind of surgery, even if the severe post-operative pain is of a short duration.</p><p>Calibrating and measuring pain is always a difficult proposition. Of the various pain scales available for adults, namely, VAS, verbal numerical rating scale and verbal descriptor scale, the VAS was chosen for this study. It is a pain scale where each patient indicates his/her perceived pain intensity along a 100 mm horizontal line.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] Whether it is a linear scale or not, or whether the data are ratio or ordinal, is still debatable. But, it is undoubtedly the most widely used and popular pain scale, which correlates well with acute pain and with minimal error, and easily lends itself to statistical analysis as well.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</p><p>Simultaneous administration of glucocorticosteroid may synergize the anti-inflammatory effect of NSAIDs and contribute to the reduction of inflammatory exudates as well as edema and pain.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Therefore, the co-administration of diclofenac and methylprednisolone may be expected to reduce post-operative pain more than that achieved with either of them alone. Evidence supporting this postulation was provided by Bamgbose <italic>et al</italic>., Buyukkurt <italic>et al</italic>., Hyrkas <italic>et al</italic>., Schultze-Mosgau <italic>et al</italic>. (1995) and others, who found the NSAID&#x02013;steroid combination to be better than NSAID alone in the treatment of post-operative pain, trismus and swelling after dental surgical procedures.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] Our results corroborate this theory.</p><p>It is well known that steroids suppress immune function, increasing the potential risk of infection. However, use of usual dosages of corticosteroids over 3-4 days has no significant adverse effects on wound healing, as further emphasized by our study.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] We did not encounter any cases of infection, especially in the combination group, because glucocorticosteroids were used only for 3 days and also because antibiotics were administered to both the groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>It was concluded that a single class of drugs is not maximally effective in controlling both post-operative pain and swelling and trismus. The combination of diclofenac sodium (a NSAID) and methylprednisolone (a corticosteroid) is more effective than diclofenac sodium alone in the sequelae of oral surgical procedures.
