These have been found to improve COPD patients&#x02019; dyspnoea and health related quality of life.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2&#x02013;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> Furthermore, programmes adhering to the principles of structured education are more effective in promoting self-management in chronic conditions than unstructured programmes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> Structured education programmes differ from conventional educational programmes in that they are underpinned by key criteria (online supplementary file 1). However, few PRPs adhere to the key criteria of structured education. Furthermore, PRPs are predominantly hospital based with long waiting lists<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> with limited access for general practitioners (GPs) and their patients. There is a lack of research to support the effectiveness of PRPs and in particular the effectiveness of structured education PRPs (SEPRP). We carried out a single-blind, cluster randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a SEPRP, delivered at the level of the general practice, on the health status of people with COPD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The trial methods have been reported previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> GP practices were eligible to participate if they used a computerised medication recording system, employed a practice nurse and had a client population&#x000a0;&#x0003e;2500 people. Participants were identified from the patient's medical records using a patient eligibility identification algorithm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="THORAXJNL2012203103F1">figure 1</xref>). Potential participants were invited for spirometry testing and those with moderate to severe COPD, as defined by Global Initiative for Chronic Lung Disease (GOLD),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> were invited to participate.</p><fig id="THORAXJNL2012203103F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Patient eligibility identification algorithm.

Higher scores represent less impairment in quality of life domains. Secondary outcomes were the incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) and the self-efficacy for managing chronic disease 6-Item scale.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> EuroQol EQ-5D<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> and utilisation of healthcare services data were also collected which will be reported separately.</p><p>We chose a cluster randomised design to minimise the risk that the SEPRP delivered by the practice team to the experimental group might influence the care they provided to control group participants. Group allocation concealment was achieved by giving responsibility for computerised allocation sequence generation and group allocation to a researcher independent of the research team and blinded to baseline outcome data. To minimise time delay and patient attrition, practices were randomised to control or intervention groups in four groups of eligible practices on a 1:1 ratio. Due to the participative nature of the SEPRP, it was not possible to blind either participants or practices to their group allocation. Participants allocated to the intervention received the SEPRP while those allocated to the control group received usual care. The development of SEPRP is described in detail elsewhere<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> and the contents of SEPRP are outlined in the online supplementary file 2.</p><p>We undertook a descriptive qualitative study interviewing GPs, practice nurses and participants allocated to the control group to describe &#x02018;usual care&#x02019;. This revealed that participants with COPD attended their GP when they felt unwell and were prescribed medications. Most did not receive advice on exercising or breathing techniques and few had any real understanding of COPD.</p><p>Research assistants trained in outcome assessment, blinded to group allocation, collected data 12&#x02013;14&#x02005;weeks after the programme. The research assistants entering and performing data analyses were blinded to group allocation. We used single data entry with visual verification on a predetermined random sample of records from the data set determined using a continuous sampling plan (CSP-1).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> We reviewed full data entry records for 81 participants (23.1%) consisting of 40&#x02005;720 items of which 42 were inaccurate for an outgoing accuracy rate of 99.9%.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Sample size calculations</title><p>We used methods for standard sample size estimates for trials that randomised at the level of the individual and adjusted for clustering by inflating sample size estimates by the design effect of 1+(m<italic>&#x02009;</italic>&#x02212;&#x02009;1)&#x003c1; (m average cluster size, and &#x003c1; estimated intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> The sample size was based on the mean difference (MD) between intervention and control groups in the total CRQ (primary outcome) for which the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) had been identified in the literature as 0.5<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> with an estimated SD of 1.145.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> Using the above values and an ICC of 0.05 based on studies involving older persons in primary care,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> 32 practices each with a minimum of 10 participants were required for power of at least 80% with an &#x003b1; level of 0.05.

Due to lack of staff, which was exacerbated by a H1N1 outbreak, one cluster with 10 participants assigned to the intervention withdrew prior to participants receiving the SEPRP. Of the remaining 168 participants, 23 (14%) did not attend any education session, 28 (17%) attended 1&#x02013;3 sessions, 21 (12%) attended 4&#x02013;5 sessions and 96 (57%) attended 6&#x02013;8 sessions.

Other reasons included working (n=16, 10%), holidays (n=7, 4%), family illness (n=7, 4%) and disinterest (n=14, 8%). In all, 35 of the 178 participants (19.7%) allocated to the intervention and 38 of the 172 allocated to the control groups (22.1%) did not complete the CRQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="THORAXJNL2012203103F2">figure 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="THORAXJNL2012203103TB2">Table&#x000a0;2</xref> presents data on outcomes prior to the intervention and at 12&#x02013;14&#x02005;weeks after completion of the SEPRP.

However, the CIs for the total CRQ change scores and the CRQ Dyspnoea and CRQ Physical subscale change scores do not exclude a smaller difference than the one that was prespecified as clinically important. The NNT for an additional beneficial outcome in the Total CRQ is 7 and for CRQ Dyspnoea the NNT is 5.5. These NNT values could be attractive to clinicians, people with COPD and funders. Importantly, referring seven patients per year to PRP such as that offered in this study can be expected to yield, on average, additional improvement at 12&#x02013;14&#x02005;weeks.</p><p>In contrast with most of the trials included in the Cochrane systematic review,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> most participants in our study had moderate COPD (forced expiratory volume in 1&#x02005;s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) around 55%&#x02013;60% predicted). This might be an important factor determining the absence of a clinically significant treatment effect.</p><p>Although the changes in the ISWT and self-efficacy measures in the intervention demonstrate improvements there was no statistically significant difference between groups. This lack of change in the ISWT appears to be consistent with more recent literature, which queries the responsiveness of ISWT to capture improvements in exercise tolerance following exercise interventions in persons with COPD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> The lack of change in self-efficacy is unclear, but it may be that receiving a diagnosis of COPD and learning more about the condition as participants progressed through the SEPRP may have inadvertently led to lower scores in self-efficacy, not because behaviour change had not occurred but because participants were more aware of the condition and how it impacted on their lives relative to baseline.</p><p>This is one of the largest trials evaluating the effects of PRPs for people with COPD. The Cochrane review of PR versus standard care by Lacasse <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> includes 31 trials of which the largest includes 200 randomised participants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> while the smallest includes 14.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> Furthermore, the majority of PRPs in the Cochrane review were conducted in outpatient departments (n=15), home based (n=9), inpatient (n=3), house bound (n=1) or involved a combination of inpatient and home based (n=1) or outpatient and home based (n=1). Only one programme was delivered in the community.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> This study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> reported statistically significant improvements in exercise and quality of life outcomes for PRP, which included drug therapy compared with drug therapy alone. This was a small cross over trial conducted in eight physiotherapy practices and study participants were patients with asthma (n=43) and COPD (n=23). Waterhouse <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> randomised 240 patients to community or hospital based PRP and found that community based PRP has similar efficacy to hospital based programmes. However, unlike our study there was no usual care arm and the intervention was delivered in both settings by the same hospital physiotherapy team.</p><p>Accessibility to PRPs is a well recognised international problem<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> and until recently most programmes were hospital based. Exploring the potential effectiveness therefore of PRPs delivered in alternative clinical settings as we have done is crucial.</p><p>Many of the hospital based PRPs use expensive equipment and are delivered by respiratory specialists. We used inexpensive equipment and trained practice nurses and physiotherapists with no prior COPD expertise to facilitate a PRP in primary care.</p><p>In line with recent recommendations,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> we updated the current Cochrane systematic review by Lacasse <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> on the effectiveness of PR for COPD to include the findings of the PRINCE trial. We did this by including unadjusted changes in mean scores (and SDs) for dyspnoea, fatigue, emotional function and mastery domains of the CRQ in RevMan with the currently included data set available in the Cochrane review. Our findings for fatigue, emotional function and mastery domains are consistent with four, eight and four of the 11 trials included in the meta-analyses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> for these outcomes, respectively. Our finding of a statistically significant improvement in CRQ Dyspnoea is consistent with the summary meta-analysis estimate and with the findings of each of the 11 trials included in the meta-analysis. The reasons for differences between our findings and those of the Cochrane review might be that, in contrast to most of the trials included in the Cochrane review, the majority of patients in our study had moderate COPD (FEV<sub>1</sub> between 55% and 60% predicted). Therefore, the severity of COPD might be an important factor in determining treatment effect. Further, unlike the trials included in the Cochrane review, we examined the impact of PR 12&#x02013;14&#x02005;weeks after the programme. Our results may confirm that in routine practice the effects of PRPs tend to disappear rapidly.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></p><p>The inclusion of PRINCE in the Cochrane review strengthens the findings of the review and increases its power but does not result in changing the direction or statistical significance of CRQ domain outcomes. However, as most trials included in the review<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> were hospital or home based, the inclusion of our findings might best be considered in the update of the review by Lacasse <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> (currently underway by some of the authors) and also that subgroup analyses by programme setting (ie, community based vs acute/hospital based) be considered within this review.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Limitations</title><p>We randomised participants to control and intervention following the collection of baseline data and the demographic data indicated that both groups were well matched. There was no feasible way to blind the intervention group to participants or to those facilitating the programme and our study is open to a risk of performance bias. Nevertheless, outcome assessment was blinded thus minimising risks to detection bias.</p><p>Rehabilitation studies usually perform assessment measures immediately after completion of the intervention in addition to longer term outcomes to differentiate between the effect of the intervention and the impact of maintenance. Unfortunately, budgetary constraints only allowed one round of postoutcome data collection after completion of the intervention.</p><p>There were 16 different teams (a practice nurse and a physiotherapist from each intervention practice) delivering the SEPRP. Although we provided intensive training, created a detailed programme manual and implemented quality control measures (see online supplementary file 3), it is not known if the intervention was always delivered consistently. However, we felt that this approach ensured that the knowledge gained remained within primary care potentially having a more lasting impact.</p><p>We excluded participants with very severe COPD due to concerns for their safety and health risks. Of the 1146 patients screened for eligibility, 350 were randomised. This is not unusual for trials, in which obtaining a homogenous sample is prioritised and in general practice where disease coding may be pragmatic. Indeed, Waterhouse <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> eventually randomised 326 patients from 1041 potentially eligible patients. Further work is also needed to delineate the factors that contribute or hinder the ability of people to maintain improvements over time.</p><p>In conclusion, physiotherapists and practice nurses who have no prior COPD expertise can be trained to deliver a SEPRP to people with moderate and severe COPD, thereby increasing local accessibility. However, the CIs for the total CRQ change scores and the CRQ Dyspnoea and CRQ Physical subscale change scores do not exclude a smaller difference than the one that was prespecified as clinically important.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="loca-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="thoraxjnl-2012-203103-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1247" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="loca-data" id="SD2"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="thoraxjnl-2012-203103-s2.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1255" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="loca-data" id="SD3"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="thoraxjnl-2012-203103-s3.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1263" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Correction notice:</bold> This article has been corrected since it was published Online First.
