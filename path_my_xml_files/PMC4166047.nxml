Antibiotics play a pivotal role in treatment.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Dapsone (4, 4&#x02032;-diaminodiphenylsulfone) is a drug of the sulfone class and was discovered in 1908.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Oral dapsone has demonstrated efficacy in acne, but was associated with severe side-effects such as anemia, which was particularly serious in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Topical dapsone was developed to overcome this limitation.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] A unique property of dapsone is that it has dual therapeutic activity and demonstrates antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Dapsone 5% gel (Aczone) was developed to treat acne vulgaris and today has Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] There are a very limited number of studies on the topical use of anti-inflammatory agent in combination with other systemic medications such as isotretinoin in acne vulgaris. Due to a delay in starting of isotretinoin response, it will be helpful to add a topical anti-inflammatory agent to treatment regime to fasten the onset of clinical response and control initial exacerbation of symptoms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to combine topical dapsone gel as an anti-inflammatory agent with oral isotretinoin in treatment of moderate to severe acne in order to enhance the efficacy. Hence this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of 5% dapsone gel with systemic isotretinoin in facial acne vulgaris in Iranian patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted at Al-Zahra General Hospital, a referral clinic of dermatology in Isfahan, Iran. 58 young adults (age range: 18-25 years) with moderate to severe facial acne vulgaris according to the Global Acne Assessment Score (GAAS) were recruited from September 2012 through July 2013. Reasons for exclusion were: Acne being secondary to other problems; pregnancy or intention of pregnancy; breastfeeding; other dermatological diseases of the face; G6PD deficiency; taking any other acne treatment; history of having taken any medication that could interact with dapsone (e.g. Trimetoprim-sulfametoxazol) or isotretinoin (e.g. tetracyclines, methotrexate and vitamin A supplements) within the previous 3 months; and known hypersensitivity to the study medication. The patients were divided into groups randomly: (group A: 5% dapsone gel and group B vehicle neutral gel). The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran (NO: 392090). All patients provided written informed consent before participation.</p><p>All patients were administered oral isotretinoin (Roaccutane<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.), 20 mg once a day for 8 weeks. The 5% dapsone gel was prepared in Isfahan University's Department of Pharmacy. Dapsone gel was prepared from its powder solved in a little ethanol and mixed with lubricant non-comedogenic gel up to 5% concentration. The dapsone gel and vehicle non-comedogenic neutral gel were filled in similar tubes that were marked &#x02018;A&#x02019; or &#x02018;B,&#x02019; indicating the side on which they should be applied. Topical 5% dapsone gel and non-comedogenic vehicle gel was applied on the face twice daily for 8 weeks in our patients (group A: 5% dapsone gel and group B vehicle gel). During the study period, only a caregiver who was not involved in the experiment was aware of the contents of the tubes; the patients and the examiner were blind to the topical compounds. The patients came for follow-up examinations on day 2 and weeks 4, 8 and 12. Photographic imaging was performed using a camera (Canon power shot G12, Cannon components Inc. Japan) in the same physical condition, by one person at base line and on each follow-up visit. The numbers of acne lesions were counted manually by the investigator for both the treatment site and control site at baseline and on each follow-up visit. The counting was assessed by marking each counted lesion with a pen to ensure that each lesion was only registered once. The global severity of acne was assessed by the investigator using the 5-point scale at base line and the end of the study[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. All patients completed the study period. Presence of any possible complications/side effects was assessed and documented on each visit by a skilled dermatologist.

There are only a limited number of studies that have similarly examined the effect of the combination of isotretinoin and topical application on acne vulgaris and the results are incongruous. Dhir <italic>et al</italic>. found no significant benefit in the combination of topical anti-acne and isotretinoin over isotretinoin alone in improving nodulocystic acne vulgaris.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] However, in our study, the significant efficacy observed in the use of topical 5% dapsone in a similar setting in reducing the count of lesions in weeks 4, 8 and 12, is probably due to the additional anti-inflammatory effect of dapsone. In a study by Tanghetti <italic>et al</italic>. compared the efficacy and tolerability of dapsone 5% gel in female versus male patients with facial acne vulgaris and reported that the response to dapsone 5% gel appears to be influenced by gender, with female patients experiencing a significantly greater reduction in acne lesion counts and a significantly higher clinical success rate following 12 weeks of treatment.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Our findings are in concordance with the results of Tanghetti's study. The high efficacy of 5% dapsone gel in female patients suggests that gender is an important predictor of the therapeutic outcome in acne treatment and should be considered in acne clinical trial design and analysis. Our findings show significant reduction in both &#x0201c;inflammatory&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;non-inflammatory&#x0201d; (comedonal) lesions in all weeks. Draelos <italic>et al</italic>. documented efficacy of topical 5% dapsone gel for the reduction of both inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne lesions, so the anti-inflammatory dapsone is effective in treatment of both &#x0201c;inflammatory&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;non-inflammatory&#x0201d; lesions.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Mechanisms other than bactericidal action may underlie the therapeutic effect of dapsone, such as anti-inflammatory and anti-interleukin 8 actions, as well as the inhibition of neutrophil adherence. Dapsone has multiple anti-inflammatory properties.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Although a topical formulation of dapsone (Aczone, Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of acne vulgaris but the risks of serious side effects have made it an undesirable drug for use in the relatively healthy acne population.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In our study, there is no significant difference between before and after hemoglobin level. Draelos <italic>et al</italic>. showed no clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters, including hemoglobin, even among G6PD-deficient patients, as was the case in our study. Other adverse events were comparable between the treatment groups and rarely led to discontinuation of the topical drug.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The results suggest that anti-inflammatory agents such as dapsone can effectively reduce the count of lesions but do not alter the final
