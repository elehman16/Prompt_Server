and active motion exercise on functional fitness in elderly nursing home residents.
[Subjects and Methods] Twenty-three (female 22 and male 1) nursing home residents
(84.8&#x000b1;4.3 yr) volunteered for this study. They were divided into a passive motion exercise
group (n=12) and an active motion exercise group (n=11) and performed 30-min sessions of
training twice a week for 12 weeks. Functional fitness (Arm Curl, Chair Stand, Up &#x00026;
Go, Sit &#x00026; Reach, Back Scratch, functional Reach, and 12-min Walk tests) was evaluated
before and after the intervention. [Results] No significant baseline difference was noted
between the groups in measured variables. Following the 12 week intervention, no
significant interaction (group &#x000d7; time) was noted in functional fitness variables between
the groups, except for the functional reach scores (active motion exercise 40%, passive
motion exercise 9%). Significant improvement over time was noted in passive motion
exercise group in Arm Curl (19%), Chair Stand (15%), Up &#x00026; Go (6%), and 12-min Walk
(12%) scores; and in the active motion exercise group in Arm Curl (14%), Chair Stand
(19%), Up &#x00026; Go (11%), functional Reach (40%) and 12-min Walk (13%) scores. The
adherence rates in the passive and active motion exercise groups were 95.8% and 93.1%
respectively. [Conclusion] Passive motion exercise and active motion exercise were found
to be similarly effective for improving the functional fitness of elderly nursing home
residents.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Nursing home-dwelling older adults</kwd><kwd>Active motion exercise</kwd><kwd>Passive motion exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>It is well documented that an inactive lifestyle, such as bed rest, in otherwise healthy
individuals is associated with decreased physical function exacerbated by changes in body
composition, that is, decreased muscle mass and increased fat mass<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. A nursing home-based lifestyle is often sedentary, and it
has been reported that frail older women residing in a nursing home experienced a
significant progressive loss of muscle mass<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>On the other hand, research over the past two decades clearly shows that regular exercise,
that is, active motion exercise (AME), is effective for maintaining and promoting health,
physical fitness, and functional independence in older adults, especially in terms of
endurance, muscular strength, flexibility, and balance<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there are many older adults who have limitations in
performing active exercises, especially weight-bearing exercises due to orthopedic
conditions, poor musculoskeletal conditions, excess adiposity, poor balance, or simply
age-associated sarcopenia<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Passive motion
exercise (PME) may be an alternative mode of exercise for those elderly who cannot perform
AME.</p><p>Machine-based PME was found to be beneficial in frail elderly users of a day care
service<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> as well as in
community-dwelling chronic stroke patients with spastic paralysis<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, little information is available about PME in
nursing home residents, and its efficacy has not been compared with that of AME. Therefore,
the purpose of the current study was to compare the efficacy of PME with that of AME in a
group of nursing home-dwelling elderly people.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>In response to a public call for participation (leaflets and oral) through proper channels,

nursing home-dwelling elderly people. In general, passive physical exercises have been
reported to be less effective compared with voluntary exercises in young adults<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, in the current study, PME was
found to have a similar effect on functional fitness, except functional reach, for these
very old people.</p><p>A grave change associated with aging is the progressive decline in skeletal muscle mass, a
downward spiral that may lead to decreased strength and functionality<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in
Older People has developed a definition and algorithm for sarcopenia, with sarcopenia being
defined as the loss of muscle mass and strength that occurs with advancing age<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The current study did not measure muscle
mass, but improvements in AC (19% in PME and 14% in AME) and CS (15% in PME and 19% in AME)
scores in very old nursing home-dwelling people may be useful in preventing or at least
controlling sarcopenia in these people. The improvements in the AC and CS scores in the
current study were similar to, or better than the findings from other studies of
community-dwelling and apparently healthy older adults, but the improvements in the current
study were achieved with much lower exercise intensities, especially in the PME group.
Takeshima et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> found a 23%
improvement in AC score and 21% improvement in CS score following a 30-min elastic
band-based resistance exercise program performed on land twice a week for 12 weeks. The
average age of the exercisers (68.0&#x000b1;5.4 yr) in their study was much lower than those of the
participants in the current study (PME 83.7&#x000b1;4.2 yr; AME 86.0&#x000b1;4.2 yr). Yamauchi et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> found an 18% improvement in AC score and
6% improvement in CS score following a 26-min home-based exercise program performed 3
days/week for 12 weeks. The average age of the exercisers (69.2 &#x000b1; 5.2 yr) in their study was
much lower than those of the participants in the current study (PME 83.7&#x000b1;4.2 yr; AME
86.0&#x000b1;4.2 yr).</p><p>Fried et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> developed a phenotypic
definition of frailty based on readily identifiable physical aspects; three or more of the
following characteristics support a frailty diagnosis: unintended weight loss, exhaustion,
weakness, slow gait speed, and low physical activity. Based on the above frailty definition,
not all of the nursing home residents were frail, but there was no doubt that all of them
need assistance to complete their ADL. However, it is obvious that they had slower gait
speeds and performed fewer ADL, as represented by their UG and 12-MW performances (<xref rid="tbl_004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).</p><p>Following a 26-min home-based exercise program (age 69.2&#x000b1;5.2 yr) performed 3 days a week
for 12 weeks<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>, the UG score improved by
14%, which is similar to the improvement in AME group (11%) in the current study and higher
than the improvement in the PME group (6%) in the current study indicating that
low-intensity AME and low-intensity PME are able to improve UG score in very old, frail
elderly people.</p><p>The 12-MW score improved by 12% in the PME group and 13% in the AME group in the current
study, which is similar to the improvement (16%) in 12-MW score following a 90-min aerobic
training program consisting of walking outdoors 3 days per week for 12 weeks<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although the participants of that study
worked at higher intensity (70&#x02013;80% of the participants&#x02019; maximal heart rate) and were
apparently healthy, their mean age of 71.6 &#x000b1; 7.1 yr was quite lower than those of the
participants in the current study (PME 83.7 &#x000b1; 4.2 yr; AME 86.0 &#x000b1; 4.2 yr). Thus, the gained
benefit in 12-MW score in the current study might be due to the participants having a poor
initial level of physical fitness.</p><p>Improvement in lower body flexibility (20% in the PME group and 62% in the AME group) and
upper body flexibility (11% in the PME group and 10% in the AME group) was satisfactory.
However, it has been reported that there is large individual variation in the age-related
changes in flexibility<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another
study<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup> reported similar results; in
that study, older adults showed significant improvement in several functional fitness
parameters but no improvement in trunk flexibility, which was measured by trunk
anteroflexion in a sitting position with the knee extended after completion of a 12-week
training program (twice a week).</p><p>Significant interaction (group &#x000d7; group) was noted only in the FR score, a measure of
dynamic balance, in the current study. Therefore, effect of AME on dynamic balance seems to
be superior to that of PME. The passive mode of training might be responsible for lesser
improvement of balance. Further study is needed to overcome this limitation.</p><p>The improvements in all other measured variables except the FR score were similar in the
two groups, with no significant difference. At present there is no specific recommendation
for exercise volume (e.g., kcal expenditure per week, step rate, etc.) for frail and/or
nursing home residents<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, and as the
improvements in most of the measured variables in the current study were similar for PME and
AME, thus the PME could be an alternative preferred mode of exercise for very old people who
cannot adhere to an AME program due to various reasons. Future studies should compare the
dose-response relationship for muscle strength, especially for PME programs in elderly
people.</p><p>Reports are available that describe the clinical benefits of passive exercises, for
instance, passive exercise using a horseback riding machine improved insulin sensitivity and
resting metabolism in diabetic patients<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>, and passive leg movements enhanced the tissue oxygenation level in
paretic muscles of chronic stroke patients<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. From these reports, PME seems to be effective in clinical
settings, but the mechanisms of how exercise produced these benefits were not clearly
described in those studies. Therefore, further study is needed to explore the underlying
mechanisms of these benefits.</p><p>The PME machines used in the current study were designed in such a way that passive
exercise could be performed automatically while maintaining adequate physiological safety
for the exerciser. They automatically stop moving when the user wishes to stop exercise;
that is, they do not contract the target muscle group at all. All exercises were performed
in a sitting position, which further ensured the training related safety of the PME.</p><p>Regular physical activity and/or exercises are recommended for all elderly people, but many
of them do not like to do exercise on a regular basis. Thus, it is very important to develop
a suitable exercise menu for very old people so that they will be able to adhere to the
program safely. Recently, whole body vibration exercise was found to significantly improve
balance and reduce fear of falling in older adults<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. Attention should be given to ensuring safety, an easy mode of
performing training, and a higher intensity when designing an exercise protocol for older
adults. Indeed, an important aspect in performance of exercise is to have fun, and the mode
of training should be enjoyable. Tarakci et al.<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested that Wii-based balance therapy is effective for improving
balance and walking function in children with cerebral palsy. Furthermore, studies are
needed to identify adverse effects of training as well as how to increase motivation to
perform exercises in frail older adults as well as in children. In conclusion, PME and AME
were similarly effective in improving FF in very old people, and PME could be an alternative
preferred mode of exercise for very old people who cannot adhere to an AME program due to
various reasons.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge the participants for their voluntary involvement in this study. The
