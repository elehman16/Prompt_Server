Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based practice that has been found to be very effective in treating anxiety in various community settings, including schools. Friends for Life (FRIENDS) is an efficacious group CBT protocol for anxiety. Unfortunately, evidence-based practices for anxiety are seldom employed in under-resourced urban schools, because many treatment protocols are not a good fit for the urban school context or the population, existing behavioral health staff do not receive adequate training or support to allow them to implement the treatment with fidelity, or school districts do not have the resources to contract with external consultants. In our prior work, we adapted FRIENDS to create a more culturally sensitive, focused, and feasible CBT protocol for anxiety disorders (CBT for Anxiety Treatment in Schools (CATS)).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">The aim of this 5-year study is to evaluate both the effectiveness of CATS for urban public schools compared to the original FRIENDS as well as compare the implementation strategies (train-the-trainer vs. train-the-trainer&#x02009;+&#x02009;ongoing consultation) by conducting a three-arm, parallel group, type 2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial in 18 K-8 urban public schools. We will also assess the cost-effectiveness and the mediators and moderators of fidelity. Ninety therapists, 18 agency supervisors, and 360 children will participate. The interactive systems framework for dissemination and implementation guides the training and support procedures for therapists and supervisors.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This study has the potential to demonstrate that agency therapists and supervisors who have had little to no prior exposure to evidence-based practices (EBPs) can implement an anxiety disorder EBP with fidelity.

Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent among inner city school children and often go unidentified and untreated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Children with these disorders are more likely than their peers to have problems with social, peer and parent-child relations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], academic achievement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], school refusal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and future socio-emotional adjustment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. School factors, such as peer problems, academic pressures, and school violence, can contribute to and exacerbate symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The purpose of this study is to (a) test the effectiveness of two versions of a treatment protocol for anxiety disorders in urban schools, (b) test the effectiveness of two implementation strategies (train-the-trainer and an enhanced version of train-the-trainer), and (c) assess mediators and moderators of the type of support on implementation fidelity.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Mental health services in urban schools</title><p id="Par6">Public schools have become a common setting for the delivery of mental health services to children and may be the ideal context through which to narrow service disparities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The school is a convenient location where services can often be provided at little or no cost to families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Benefits of providing evidence-based practices (EBPs) in schools include the ability to implement interventions in the very environment in which most symptoms are triggered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and to incorporate protocol-specific interventions, with peer and teacher involvement, as needed for generalizability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>EBPs for anxiety disorders</title><p id="Par7">Individual and group cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs) have been shown to be highly effective for the treatment of anxiety in youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Group cognitive behavioral therapy (GCBT) requires fewer resources than individual CBT because a single therapist can treat several children at once, thus making it less expensive for use in under-resourced settings such as urban schools. Friends for Life (FRIENDS), a GCBT program, is an effective program for the prevention and treatment of anxiety disorders in children as evidenced by a meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] on school-based interventions for at risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and clinically anxious youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We have used this program in a prior research study and found it to be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, we also found a number of implementation problems (e.g., poor cultural fit, low feasibility for under-resourced school settings) that could impede widespread adoption in the urban school context.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>The critical implementation problems</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Program adaptation</title><p id="Par8">Treatments that are developed and tested for efficacy in highly controlled research settings often do not fit into <italic>real-world</italic> contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. As a result, most effective treatments in health and mental health settings need to be adapted for new contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Lee and colleagues developed a planned adaptation (PA) to address the tension between &#x0201c;implementing programs with fidelity and the need to tailor programs to fit the target population&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, p. 290]. PA orients the provider to the program and its theoretical orientation. A central tenet of PA is that adaptation must be conducted without altering the program&#x02019;s core components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. PA helps the provider identify components of the program that can be modified and provides a process for conducting adaptations and a direction on how to develop evaluation strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We applied PA to FRIENDS in order to make it more feasible for implementation in co-location settings with low-income urban children. We made changes to the language, cultural fit, methods, number of sessions, and activities in the treatment manual, which resulted in additions and substitutions in these areas. This resulted in a briefer, more engaging, and culturally sensitive protocol (CBT for Anxiety Treatment in Schools (CATS)) while still maintaining the five essential components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] of CBT for anxiety treatment, with emphasis on exposure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Training support</title><p id="Par9">Substantial resources have been dedicated to the dissemination and implementation (D&#x00026;I) of mental health EBPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Key to that effort has been the identification of strategies for improving internal capacity (i.e., ability to train and supervise therapists using internal resources) of community-based agencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Studies have shown that effective training models include initial workshops for therapists that are followed up with supervision, which often includes coaching and performance feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. An important challenge facing publicly funded mental health agencies is finding cost-effective strategies for supporting supervisors. Most community mental health agencies, where low-income urban children receive services, do not have the resources to pay for ongoing expert direct consultation for therapists who implement EBPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. As such, finding time- and cost-effective alternative strategies for supporting therapists would have a substantial public health impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. An important feasibility question is &#x0201c;Can internal clinical supervisors who are not familiar with EBPs provide effective supervision to therapists after participating in training workshops or do they need more extensive support?&#x0201d; A mostly self-sustaining system as previously described would likely be more practical and less expensive but perhaps lead to fewer positive child outcomes compared to a system where supervisors are provided extended expert consultation.</p><p id="Par10">Two alternative, and potentially cost-effective, strategies are the <italic>cascade</italic> or <italic>train-the-trainer</italic> (TT) approaches, by which agency supervisors are trained to conduct effective supervision, and then go on to train therapists; and a modified train-the-trainer approach by which supervisors receive training <italic>plus</italic> extended consultation (TT+) on conducting effective supervision. TT has been used with adult mental health populations. Two pilot studies using this approach have reported improved therapist knowledge and improved client behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], but it is not known whether these findings could generalize other settings or populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. TT+ has been used by Bruce Chorpita and colleagues with agency supervisors who support therapists in the implementation of modular individual CBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Highlights of this approach include initial training, biweekly or monthly phone consultations with supervisors, and a supervisor promotion review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This modified train-the-trainer approach has been found to lead to moderate outcome effect sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Our study would extend this approach by (a) measuring clinical and implementation outcomes (fidelity and cost), (b) testing the support strategies in a co-location school context, (c) using GCBT instead of individual CBT, and (d) assessing mediators and moderators of fidelity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Implementation framework</title><p id="Par11">Our implementation framework is the interactive systems framework (ISF; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]). ISF was developed to bridge the research-to-practice delay in health and mental health care. It is intended to be a &#x0201c;heuristic for understanding key systems, key functions, and key relationships relevant to the dissemination and implementation process&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, p. 179]. ISF is composed of three interrelated systems: the synthesis and translation system, the support system, and the delivery system. The function of the synthesis and translation system is to distill information innovations and prepare them for implementation by service providers. The support system supports the work of those who put the innovation into practice. The primary function of the delivery system is the implementation of innovations in real-world settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. We will use the support system and the delivery system because they provide a roadmap for the guiding implementation of EBPs by therapists and supervisors with the support of researchers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Mediators and moderators of implementation support</title><p id="Par12">We recognize that the implementation of EBPs, specifically fidelity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], can be altered by the characteristics of the organization implementing the innovation and the characteristics of the providers (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]). We will assess the role of intentions because this construct has been shown to be a proximal determinant of treatment fidelity when practitioners have the ability to act on their intentions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Empirically successful theories of behavior change (including the theory of reasoned action, theory of planned behavior, the integrated model, and others) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] posit that intention is a proximal determinant of behavior, where intentions influence behavior to the extent that one has the ability (i.e., an enabling environment/service context) to act on them. It is also important to study the role of intentions and the service context environment because these constructs are modifiable. Regardless of the specific results, by testing the hypothesized relationships, these findings will directly inform the design of future, targeted interventions. In particular, the findings will indicate whether interventions should focus on strengthening intentions and/or helping therapists act on them. One or both approaches may be appropriate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Service context</title><p id="Par13">Currently, 104,803 children in grades K-8 attend school in the School District of Philadelphia. The Department of Behavioral Health and Intellectual Disability Services (DBHIDS) for the city of Philadelphia oversees the community mental health agencies that provide services to Medicaid recipients. Approximately 20 of these agencies provide school therapeutic services (STS) using a co-location model (i.e., agencies provide services in the schools). Community Behavioral Health, a non-profit corporation that manages Medicaid funds for the city of Philadelphia, is the payer for these services. Community Behavioral Health encourages agencies to use group-based EBPs to serve more children and reduce costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, EBPs are rarely used in the school setting, in part, because agencies often do not have the expertise to train and supervise therapists in the delivery of EBPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Reportedly, 55&#x000a0;% of school districts in the USA use the co-location model, and it is estimated that this number is much higher in large urban settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].

<italic>Aim 2</italic>. To compare two implementation strategies, TT and TT+, for the implementation of CATS.</p><p id="Par43">(2a) Our primary hypothesis is that TT+ will yield higher therapist content fidelity scores compared to TT. (2b) TT+ will also show better process fidelity and higher perceived acceptability compared to TT. We also expect that (2c) the TT strategy will lead to acceptable levels of therapist fidelity (content fidelity &#x02265;80&#x000a0;%; process fidelity &#x02265;4 on a 1&#x02013;5 scale, 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;not at all, 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;very often) and (2d) TT+ will be more cost effective than TT because TT+ will yield better child outcomes (i.e., lower CGI-S scores) with the same number of treatment weeks (i.e., 8&#x000a0;weeks). In addressing this aim, comparison between the TT and TT+ will be done using a two-sided two-sample <italic>t</italic> test. Therapist content fidelity means will be calculated with its 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval. Similar analysis will be done regarding process fidelity. For hypothesis (2d), we will compare the difference in the average cost per therapist and the difference in average content fidelity (i.e., difference in the percentage of checklist components covered by the therapist). Measures of effectiveness will be derived from the <italic>clinical</italic> analysis of the trial data. Standard errors will be derived from a nonparametric bootstrap. Point estimates for the cost-effectiveness ratios will be based on the point estimates for the difference in costs and outcomes. Standard errors and the correlation of the difference in cost and QALYs will be derived from a nonparametric bootstrap. Confidence intervals for the cost-effectiveness ratio as well as an acceptability curve will be derived using the point estimates of the differences, their standard errors, and the correlation between the differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Acceptability curves will allow agency administrators to judge whether the gains in children&#x02019;s outcomes/fidelity are sufficient to justify any increases in cost.</p><p id="Par44">Secondary outcomes for therapists will include process fidelity (i.e., difference in the five-point rating of therapist competence). One set of these comparisons will be made for FRIENDS with TT vs. CATS with TT arms (i.e., is CATS cost-effective compared to FRIENDS); a second set will be made for CATS with TT+ vs. CATS with TT (i.e., is CATS with TT+ cost-effective compared to CATS with TT). The numerator of the cost-effectiveness ratio will be the difference in costs between the groups (e.g., the costs of CATS with TT+ minus the costs of CATS with TT); the denominator will be the difference in outcome (e.g., the change in CSR for CATS with TT+ minus the change for CATS with TT).</p><p id="Par45">To test the second part of hypothesis (2b), we will conduct a structured content analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] for perceived acceptability and appropriateness. The unit of analysis is each interview. We will create a case-by-variable matrix from the codes. The matrix will have an interviewee identifier number, type of support (i.e., TT, TT+), school, agency, subject demographic information, and codes. The code cells will contain the number of times the participant emitted words or phrases pertaining to perceived acceptability and appropriateness of the support they received. Once acceptability and appropriateness are defined for each interview, percentages for acceptability (percentage acceptance) and appropriateness (percentage appropriate) out of the total number of words will be calculated.

<italic>Aim 3</italic>. To test mediators and moderators of the type of support on therapist fidelity.</p><p id="Par47">We hypothesize that therapists&#x02019; strength of intentions to conduct groups with children and take part in supervision will moderate the relationship between actual level of treatment fidelity and the type of implementation support they receive (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). We are studying the role of intentions because this construct has been shown to be a proximal determinant of treatment fidelity when practitioners have the ability to act on their intentions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Moderators and mediators of intervention effects on implementation fidelity</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13012_2016_453_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par48">In the current study, moderation occurs when the strength of the association between a predictor, type of support (TT or TT+), and fidelity (dependent variable) is influenced by a therapist intention (moderator). Moderation will be assessed using multiple regression analysis as described by Preacher et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], for analyzing moderation effects. In a regression model setting, in step 1, type of support and therapist will be entered first to predict fidelity. In step 2, the interaction term of therapist intention with type of support will be entered into the regression model. If the slope of the interaction terms is found to be significantly predicting fidelity, then we will conclude that the therapist intention moderates the effect of type of support on fidelity.</p><p id="Par49">We also expect that the service context (including interdisciplinary collaboration and service disruptions) will mediate the relationship between the therapists&#x02019; fidelity and their intentions to perform the EBPs. We are studying the role of service context (i.e., frequency of interdisciplinary collaboration, environmental intrusions affecting the ability of therapists to fully participate in supervision and conduct treatment groups) because it may facilitate or impede the therapists&#x02019; ability to act on their intentions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].

In planning and performing the analyses related to moderation and mediation, we will utilize PROCESS, a modeling tool freely available for SPSS and SAS. The many features of PROCESS integrate many existing functions and published statistical tools for analyzing mediation and moderation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].

Assessment of such differences will be examined using <italic>t</italic> tests or the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test for two independent groups. Confirmed baseline differences between study arms regarding baseline student&#x02019;s measurements will be included as covariates in the proposed pertinent statistical analysis. It is understood that outcomes related to a student in a school/class may be correlated with outcomes for other student within the same school/class (nested effects). As such, the correlation (intraclass correlation) among students in a school/class will be calculated and the expected nested effects will be considered within the scope of addressing the proposed aims. We will conduct analyses using SAS Proc mixed (the mixed effect approach) (or the Proc GENMOD for the GEE approach), in which students are considered to be nested within schools/classes. The mixed effects model or the GEE approach will be used in the analysis of pre-/post-changes between the groups. Time (pre/post), interventions (or implementation), and the interaction term of time*intervention (or implementation) are the effects of interest. We may consider simplifying the analysis when it is appropriate by calculating the change scores between pre and post and testing for means differences using <italic>t</italic> tests for two independent groups (or the Mann-Whitney test). Also, if needed, the analysis of variance and covariance might be utilized to compare pre-/post-measurements between groups adjusting for pre-measures and any other potential covariates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Power analyses</title><sec id="Sec21"><title>Children</title><p id="Par52">It is anticipated that a sample size of 240 evaluable children are available to address aim 1 (120 per treatment protocol).

In a pilot study, we found that the change in symptom level had an effect size of 0.63. Therefore, in testing for equivalence of FRIENDS and CATS, using two one-sided tests with sample sizes of 120 in FRIENDS and 120 in CATS achieves 81&#x000a0;% power at a 5&#x000a0;% significance level when the true difference between the means is 0 (null hypothesis), the standard deviation of the differences in means is assumed to be 11, and the equivalence limits are &#x02212;4.20 and 4.20.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Therapists</title><p id="Par53">To compare TT to TT+ for the implementation of CATS (aim 2), 30 therapists in TT and 30 in TT+ achieve 86&#x000a0;% power to detect a difference of 8&#x000a0;% between the null hypothesis that both group means are 80&#x000a0;% (content fidelity) and the alternative hypothesis that the mean of group TT is 80&#x000a0;% with the estimated group standard deviations of 10 and 10 (an estimated effect size&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.8) and with a significance level (alpha) of 0.05 using a two-sided two-sample <italic>t</italic> test.

The justification for the concurrent implementation portion of the trial (group B vs. C) rests on the fact that publicly funded agencies need cost-effective, research-based implementation strategies to justify widespread adoption of EBPs. The use of the hybrid trial approach is justified by the fact that the hybrid approach shortens the translation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec24"><title>Public health impact</title><p id="Par55">This study has the potential to demonstrate that agency therapists and supervisors who have had little to no prior exposure to EBPs can implement an anxiety disorder EBP with fidelity. The use of group therapy can contribute to lowering service disparities in urban schools. Comparisons of the two implementation strategies (internal supervision with or without consultation for supervisors) would provide large urban mental health systems with data to make decisions about adoption of EBPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].

This is the first study, that we are aware of, that conducts a hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial of GCBT in nontraditional settings. Comparing both the effectiveness of an adapted treatment to its original and the implementation outcomes of train-the-trainer from those of an adapted version in the same trial is innovative. The assessment of mediators and moderators of the two implementation strategies on therapist fidelity as well as the assessment of comparative cost and cost-effectiveness of implementation strategies in the co-location service context is highly innovative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].

First, some of the measures in the proposed work are investigator created, which is often the case in implementation science trials given the nascence of the field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Second, because of the effectiveness nature of the trial, there were some decisions that had to be made to ensure that youth participants met criteria for an anxiety disorder. Specifically, we are using the ADIS-5-P for diagnostic purposes which is likely not feasible in community settings outside of the context of a grant. Additionally, the therapists will likely engage in more intensive attendance monitoring to ensure youth attendance than would occur outside the context of a research study. Finally, although creating internal capacity is a worthwhile avenue for research, there are still indicators that supervisor turnover is an issue to be grappled with (see Beidas et al., in press).</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par58">This study has the potential to show that masters-level therapists from public mental health agencies providing services in schools can implement EBPs with high levels of fidelity, provided that they receive ongoing evidence-based supervision from their own clinical supervisors. The implications of this project are generalizable to other evidence-based practices and have the potential to significantly move the field forward. Gathering information about the cost-effectiveness of the two implementation strategies (TT vs. TT+) will provide important data for future implementation efforts when policymakers and administrators are deciding between paying for external consultation and creating internal capacity from within to support implementation of EBPs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par59">ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02651402.
