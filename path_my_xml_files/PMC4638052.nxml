We aimed to compare the antiemetic efficacy of ondansetron and dexamethasone combination with that of the use of each agent alone to decrease the incidence of postdelivery intra- and post-operative nausea and vomiting during CS under spinal anesthesia.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>A randomized, prospective, double-blind study was performed on 90 patients undergoing planned CS under spinal anesthesia. The patients received 4 mg ondansetron in Group O, 8 mg dexamethasone in Group D, and 4 mg ondansetron +8 mg dexamethasone in Group OD intravenously within 1&#x02013;2 min after the umbilical cord was clamped. Frequency of postdelivery intra- and post-operative nausea and vomiting episodes was recorded.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 90 eligible patients were included in the study. There were 30 patients in Group O, 30 patients in Group D, and 30 patients in Group OD. Intraoperative nausea in Group D was more than the other two groups. Postoperative nausea in group OD was lesser than the other two groups. Intraoperative vomiting in Group OD was lesser than the other two groups.

After obtaining verification and informed consent from Research Ethic Committee and understudied units, 96 female patients in Class 1 and 2 of American Statistical Association with the age range of 20&#x02013;40 years who experienced cesarean with spinal anesthesia were selected. Patients with history of gastrointestinal disorders, motion disorders, drug hypersensitivity, glaucoma, preeclampsia, eclampsia, mental illness, and also patients, who took antiemetic medicines 24 h before section, were excluded from the research.

All patients received between 15 and 20 ml for each 1 kg (up to 1500 ml) normal saline before any treatment. Spinal anesthesia was injected via a 25-gauge needle, in a sitting position, and through a space between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae, 12.5 mg hyperbaric marcaine was injected in subarachnoid space. Patients were placed in backward sleeping position and they were prevented from hypotension. Patient's bed was rotated to the left between 15&#x000b0; and 20&#x000b0; to prevent from aortocaval compression by the uterus. The patient received 2&#x02013;3 L oxygen/min through a face mask. Every 1&#x02013;3 min, patient's pressure was measured and it was used from 5 to 10 mg intravenous ephedrine or increasing the speed of infusion of normal saline to prevent from hypotension, if systolic blood pressure is below 100 mm Hg or more than 20% decrease in initial systolic blood pressure. Nausea and vomiting cases were analyzed and recorded for intra- and post-operation.
