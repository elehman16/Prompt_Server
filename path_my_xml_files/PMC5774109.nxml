Apathy, which can be defined as a lack of motivation, is one of the most prevalent neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD and typically leads to a worse quality of life and greater burden for caregivers. Treatment options for apathy in AD are limited, but studies have examined the use of the amphetamine, methylphenidate. The Apathy in Dementia Methylphenidate Trial (ADMET) found that treatment of apathy in AD with methylphenidate was associated with significant improvement in apathy in two of three outcome measures, some evidence of improvement in global cognition, and minimal adverse events. However, the trial only enrolled 60 participants who were followed for only 6&#x000a0;weeks. A larger, longer-lasting trial is required to confirm these promising findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The Apathy in Dementia Methylphenidate Trial 2 (ADMET 2) is a phase III, placebo-controlled, masked, 6-month, multi-center, randomized clinical trial targeted to enroll 200 participants with AD and apathy. Participants are randomly assigned 1:1 to 20&#x000a0;mg methylphenidate per day prepared as four over-encapsulated tablets or to matching placebo. The primary outcomes include (1) the mean difference in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Apathy subscale scores measured as change from baseline to 6&#x000a0;months, and (2) the odds of having a given rating or better on the modified AD Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change ratings at month 6 compared with the baseline rating. Other outcomes include change in cognition, safety, and cost-effectiveness measured at monthly follow-up visits up to 6&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Given the prevalence of apathy in AD and its impact on both patients and caregivers, an intervention to alleviate apathy would be of great benefit to society. ADMET 2 follows on the promising results from the original ADMET to evaluate the efficacy of methylphenidate as a treatment for apathy in AD. With a larger sample size and longer follow up, ADMET 2 is poised to confirm or refute the original ADMET findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ClinicalTrials.gov, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02346201?term=nct+02346201&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02346201</ext-link>.

This disease negatively impacts patients and families both emotionally and economically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], with societal costs at about US$236 billion per year in the USA alone in 2016. Although cognitive and functional decline define AD, neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as agitation, delusions, hallucinations, depression, sleep disturbance, and problem behaviors, afflict almost all patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These symptoms lead to worse quality of life, greater disability, accelerated cognitive or functional decline, greater burden on caregivers, earlier institutionalization, and accelerated mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Apathy is one of the most prevalent neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Clinically significant apathy is defined as a loss of will and initiative, lack of interest in activities, lack of productivity, and limited affective response to positive or negative events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and that is present for at least 4&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Apathy has been reported to affect more than half of people with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and has devastating effects on the quality of life for both patients with AD and their caregivers. Patients suffering from apathy experience decreased motivation, relying heavily on caregivers to initiate and oversee daily activities. Those caregivers who lack an understanding of apathy as a syndrome may misinterpret apathetic patients as insensitive and uncaring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and report significant levels of distress and fewer positive experiences associated with caregiving than caregivers of non-apathetic patients with AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Greater caregiver distress is linked with increased service utilization and accelerated institutionalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], which in turn creates a significant financial burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Most notably, of all the neuropsychiatric symptoms apathy is the only symptom with high prevalence and marked persistence over the course of dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Therefore, the management of apathy is a major priority in caring for patients with AD and reducing its public health burden.</p><p id="Par26">There are no proven interventions to treat apathy in AD, but the use of catecholaminergic agents for the treatment of apathy is a promising and feasible approach to repurposing available medications for this purpose. This approach is based on the understanding that motivated behaviors rely not only on the dopaminergic mesolimbic brain reward system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] but on newly evolved prefrontal cortical circuits that degenerate in AD, and where methylphenidate enhances both noradrenergic and dopaminergic signals to strengthen function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Evidence for the use of catechoaminergic agents comes from case reports and small open-label studies in non-demented populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Short-acting methylphenidate has been one of the most studied catecholaminergic compounds in the elderly and presents a good safety profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It is well-tolerated during clinical use for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and young adults, the current indication approved by the Food and Drug Administration.</p><p id="Par27">Data on the use of methylphenidate for the treatment of apathy in AD are sparse, but supported by case reports of methylphenidate for the treatment of apathy among adults and elders with major depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], Parkinson&#x02019;s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and in one instance for AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and an open-label trial of methylphenidate in vascular dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Additional evidence is provided by two pilot randomized clinical trials. The first randomized, placebo-controlled trial of methylphenidate for the treatment of apathy in AD was a small cross-over study that suggested that methylphenidate is modestly effective in most patients with AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The second, larger trial, the Apathy in Dementia Methylphenidate Trial (ADMET) found that methylphenidate treatment of apathy in AD was associated with significant improvement in two of three efficacy outcomes, a suggestion of an improvement in global cognition, and minimal adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. These data suggest that methylphenidate might be a safe and efficacious treatment for apathy in AD, although both randomized trials were small and had short follow up. To clarify the clinical efficacy of methylphenidate for apathy in AD more precisely, we are conducting a larger, longer trial with more robust measures: the Apathy in Dementia Methylphenidate Trial 2 (ADMET 2). ADMET 2 is a phase III, placebo-controlled, masked, 6-month, multicenter randomized clinical trial sponsored by the National Institute of Aging (NIA) involving 200 participants with AD. The trial is designed to examine the efficacy and safety of methylphenidate as treatment for clinically significant apathy in participants with AD, where efficacy will be measured by looking at changes in apathy and cognition. ADMET 2 will enroll participants from real-world settings and examine the effects of methylphenidate on apathy, cognition, cost-utility, and safety.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par28">The primary objective of ADMET 2 is to examine in a masked, placebo-controlled randomized trial the efficacy of methylphenidate for the treatment of clinically significant apathy in participants with AD. Additional objectives are to examine the cognitive effects, safety, and cost-effectiveness by assessing quality of life and economic assessment from baseline to 6&#x000a0;months. These assessments will be administered at baseline and at in-person follow-up visits, held monthly until 6&#x000a0;months after randomization.

Participants will either be outpatients with AD, recruited from clinical settings at the study centers or residents of nursing homes or assisted living facilities. Inclusion criteria include those related to the presence of AD, apathy, mild to moderate cognition, and consent. The allowable range of cognitive impairment is as broad as possible to establish dementia diagnosis, but allow sufficient cognition for quantification of cognitive and apathy symptoms. The need for treatment for apathy is determined by the study physician when a patient has symptoms that are significant enough to require medication and &#x0201c;routine clinical care&#x0201d; has not resulted in improvement. The exclusion criteria were developed primarily to address patient safety, including known contraindications to the use of methylphenidate. Specifically, individuals with conditions that are contraindicated for methylphenidate use will be excluded as will persons with clinically significant agitation, hallucinations, or delusions.

The study physicians will be responsible for fully assessing whether the participant has any of the conditions listed as contraindications for the use of methylphenidate (e.g., closed angle glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, or serious unstable cardiovascular or heart rhythm). The presence of any contraindicated condition or medication will constitute an exclusion criterion for ADMET 2. Laboratory tests for the purpose of qualifying a participant as having AD (e.g., brain imaging, blood and urine test, etc.) may be obtained prior to entry per current clinical standards and guidelines, but will not be required. The baseline visit may take place across more than one day, but must be completed within the 3&#x000a0;weeks preceding randomization.</p><p id="Par33">To allow for generalizability to the usual clinical practice, ADMET 2 will allow concomitant use of a broad range of medications. The only exceptions are the use of medications that would prohibit the safe concurrent use of methylphenidate (any amphetamine product, bupropion, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and tricycle antidepressants) or that function as dopamine receptor antagonists (antipsychotics). Changes in Alzheimer's disease medications during the study will be allowed if the clinician supervising the participant&#x02019;s care determines the change to be clinically required and the clinician believes that the medication will not cause or exacerbate the participant&#x02019;s apathy. For the treatment of sleeping difficulties, trazodone up to 50&#x000a0;mg before sleep or lorazepam up to 0.5&#x000a0;mg before sleep may be used nightly, or as needed. Use of other benzodiazepines or hypnotics will be prohibited.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Interventions</title><p id="Par34">Participants will be assigned to one of two groups: methylphenidate plus a psychosocial intervention for the caregiver, or placebo plus psychosocial intervention for the caregiver. The psychosocial intervention, while administered to both the participant and the study caregiver, is targeted primarily at the caregiver. The target dose of methylphenidate is 20&#x000a0;mg per day, provided as two over-encapsulated tablets of 5&#x000a0;mg administrated orally twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Participants assigned to methylphenidate will start on 10&#x000a0;mg daily (i.e., one over-encapsulated tablet of 5&#x000a0;mg twice a day) for 3&#x000a0;days. The dose is increased to 20&#x000a0;mg per day (i.e., two over-encapsulated 5&#x000a0;mg tablets taken twice a day) on day 4 and continues for 6&#x000a0;months. Participants assigned to placebo will also begin with two capsules per day and on day 4 will also begin taking four capsules a day similar to the methylphenidate group. To aid participants and caregivers, a telephone contact is expected on day 3 or immediately before the dosage increase at day 4, and at any time a dose adjustment is required for clinical purposes. If a participant experiences unacceptable side effects on four capsules per day (20&#x000a0;mg methylphenidate or placebo per day), the study physician may decrease the dosage to two capsules a day (10&#x000a0;mg methylphenidate or placebo per day). Caregivers are asked to monitor and administer treatments for participants unable to do so for themselves.</p><p id="Par35">For participants experiencing onset of significant agitation or delusions during the course of the trial, the study drug dose can be reduced to one capsule twice a day (10&#x000a0;mg per day in the methylphenidate group). If symptoms persist after reducing the dose the study drug can be temporarily discontinued, and can be restarted only when and if symptoms have improved and the participant discontinues any medication(s) used to treat the symptoms. However, study drug may only be restarted once the participant has discontinued that medication for at least 30&#x000a0;days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer. If the participant requires initiation or change in an existing antidepressant (i.e., selective serotonin receptor inhibitor (SSRI)) for treatment of depression any time during the study, the study drug should be temporarily stopped until the participant is on a stable dose of the SSRI for at least 30&#x000a0;days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer. Adherence to the assigned treatment will be monitored via participant and/or caregiver interview at each study visit and via pill counts. Participants and/or caregivers will be asked to return all study bottles with any unused capsules at each visit, including all empty bottles.</p><p id="Par36">Participants will be monitored monthly for signs or symptoms of adverse effects. Methylphenidate is relatively short-acting with a mean half-life of 3.5&#x000a0;hours in adults; thus, if unexpected adverse events emerge, the investigator can simply reduce or discontinue the use of the study medication. If the unexpected adverse events disappear, the participant will re-start the study medication under close clinical supervision, including inpatient care if necessary. If the symptoms continue, it will be concluded that it is unlikely that the symptoms are related to the study medication. In that case, the participant will be treated as deemed clinically appropriate by the treating physician. The continuation or discontinuation of the drug will be decided by the center investigator in conjunction with the treating clinician based on the risk benefit consideration for each individual participant. For this reason, there will be no &#x0201c;rescue medication&#x0201d; used in this study.</p><p id="Par37">Because there is no 5&#x000a0;mg formulation of methylphenidate that is approved and available both in the USA and Canada, the Canadian site will use a different generic methylphenidate formulation than that used at the US sites. The two drugs have similar bioavailability based on information from the drug manufacturers. We chose this solution to allow for similar titration of methylphenidate and to allow for results that are more generalizable than using a formulation that is not approved in one of the countries.</p><p id="Par38">In addition to the drug, a trained study clinician will provide a standardized psychosocial intervention modeled after the counseling strategies employed for all caregivers and participants in the previous AD trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The psychosocial intervention consists of a counseling session, education materials, and 24-hour availability for crises.

The caregiver will also be provided with 24-hour phone access to the study nurse or physician for assistance with crises that may arise after hours. The psychosocial intervention will not be administered when the participant resides in a nursing home or receives care from a paid caregiver, because the content has been developed for supporting dementia home care by family members.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment</title><p id="Par45">Each site will develop their own recruitment plans tailored for potential study candidates from the local AD population. Recruitment activities may include chart review, telephone interviews and screens, discussion with physicians, and recruitment in the clinic waiting areas. Potential sources at each clinical center may include participants from established outpatient clinics at central or satellite locations, residents of assisted living facilities affiliated with the clinics, referrals by local physicians, or potential participants recruited from targeted advertisements in local media. The CO will create a prototype set of recruitment materials (i.e., brochure, poster, press release, and newspaper ad), designed to be appropriate for diverse ethnic and racial groups. Clinical centers may use these materials as part of their recruitment activities, supplementing with additional materials as needed. All recruitment materials will be approved by the local institutional review board (IRB) and be in accordance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations to protect confidentiality.</p><p id="Par46">The CC will regularly monitor recruitment by sending weekly updates to the clinic on the status of recruitment overall and of each clinic. Recruitment efforts will also be regularly reported to the Executive Committee and the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Randomization and masking</title><p id="Par47">The CC generated random treatment assignment schedules using a documented program in SAS 9.2 (Copyright &#x000a9; 2002-2008 by SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The randomization schedule was designed to yield an assignment ratio of one to one for the two treatment groups, stratified by clinical center and using a permuted block design with random block sizes. Study participants and clinical center personnel, but not a restricted set of personnel at the CC, will be masked to treatment assignments,. The CC also generated a list of randomly ordered medication identifiers, which is linked to the assignment schedule. Documentation of the randomization generation processes will be retained at the CC and be accessible only to authorized personnel.</p><p id="Par48">Treatments will be assigned using an online program accessible to the clinical centers through the web-based data system. After the entry of specified pre-randomization data, and confirmation of eligibility, each enrolled participant&#x02019;s ID will be irrevocably linked to the next unassigned treatment for that clinical center. The clinical centers will be directed to issue a coded medication bottle containing the proper assigned treatment from among those available at the center. The data system will check to prevent randomization of the same participant ID. At each subsequent in-person follow-up visit, clinical center personnel will re-enter the participant ID to request a coded medication bottle for the next month&#x02019;s supply of study drug. No study drug will be issued at the 6-month follow-up visit.</p><p id="Par49">Clinical centers may request an emergency unmasking from the ADMET 2 data system and must contact the CC immediately following an emergency unmasking. Optional unmasking may occur for each participant after 6&#x000a0;months of follow up and when all data collection is completed. The treatment assignment will be provided in a sealed envelope to the participant and/or caregiver, but not revealed to the ADMET 2 staff at the clinical centers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Outcomes</title><p id="Par50">The primary outcomes in ADMET 2 will measure the change in apathy from baseline to 6&#x000a0;months and include (1) mean difference in change from baseline to 6&#x000a0;months in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Apathy subscale (NPI apathy) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] scores; and (2) odds of having a given rating or better on the Modified AD Cooperative Study - Clinical Global Impression of Change (mADCS-CGIC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] ratings at month 6. Although the original ADMET trial included the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], we chose not to include this as a primary outcome in ADMET 2. The AES requires a notable degree of clinician judgment while interviewing the caregiver, making it difficult to implement consistently across multiple centers and multiple psychometricians. A secondary apathy outcome measure is the Dementia Apathy Interview and Rating (DAIR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] scale. Other secondary outcomes will include the AD Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADCS-ADL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], Dependence Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], and Information on caregiver distress (NPI caregiver distress score).

The sample size calculations assumed the difference in NPI apathy change scores (1.8 points) and standard deviation (3.2) of the change scores observed in the original ADMET study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

Initial analyses will be descriptive in nature, using means, standard deviations, and proportions to describe baseline characteristics of the sample for all participants combined, and by intervention group. We will assess comparability of all baseline factors among the randomly assigned groups using appropriate statistical methods. Pearson correlation coefficients (or Spearman rank correlation) will be calculated to assess the strength of the associations between covariates and outcome measures; those with potential for confounding will be considered for inclusion in secondary analyses involving regression models. As required by NIH policy, we will conduct valid subgroup analyses of the primary and adverse event outcomes by gender and race/ethnicity to determine if there are possible differences (i.e., interactions) in treatment effects.</p><p id="Par59">The primary outcome of difference in change from baseline to six months in the NPI apathy subscale scores will be analyzed initially by a crude comparison of the difference in mean change scores from baseline to month 6 using the <italic>t</italic> test. Longitudinal analyses of NPI apathy scores to compare treatment groups over time will use a saturated means model (including indicators for each visit and each visit-by-treatment interaction) adjusting for randomization stratification (clinic) by creating a linear mixed-effects model with random intercept for each participant to account for multiple measurements over time. The primary comparison is difference in mean change from baseline to month 6. A transformation of the outcome data will be used, if needed, to meet model assumptions. We will conduct planned subgroup analyses to see if treatment effects differ for (1) The US sites versus the Canadian site to account for the different generic methylphenidate used at these sites, (2) participants who meet the proposed diagnostic criteria for apathy at baseline versus those who do not meet criteria, and (3) apathy severity at baseline. Planned sensitivity analyses include comparison of the rate of change in NPI apathy scores over 6&#x000a0;months using target and actual visit times, using a subset of adherent participants and comparison of the proportion of participants with greater than 30% reduction in NPI apathy scores at 6&#x000a0;months.</p><p id="Par60">The primary outcome of ratio of the odds of being at or better than a given category on the mADCS-CGIC at month 6 will be analyzed using proportional odds logistic regression to compare the mADCS-CGIC ratings of change (ranging from &#x0201c;marked worsening&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;marked improvement&#x0201d;) at month 6 between the treatment groups. The categorical outcome on the mADCS-CGIC of each participant at month 6 measures each participant's overall apathy at the endpoint relative to that at the baseline visit on a 7-point scale (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;marked improvement, 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;moderate improvement, 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;minimal improvement, 4&#x02009;=&#x02009;no change, 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;minimal worsening, 6&#x02009;=&#x02009;moderate worsening and 7&#x02009;=&#x02009;marked worsening) and will be compared by assigned randomization group. If the data do not meet the proportional odds assumption, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be used to compare the mADCS-CGIC ratings. We will perform the same subgroup analyses described for the change in NPI apathy score.</p><p id="Par61">Safety outcomes will be analyzed by assessing the adverse events data collected at each in-person visit, including those identified using systematic, close-ended questions for known or expected side effects of methylphenidate and open-ended questions for unexpected side effects, and abnormal results of electrolyte or ECG results. The proportion of participants experiencing adverse events and SAEs will be compared between treatment groups using logistic regression or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, controlling for baseline imbalances if necessary. To assess the superiority of methylphenidate compared with placebo for effects on cognitive and functional outcomes, we will look at longitudinal change in the DAIR, ADCS-ADL, Dependence Scale, and cognitive sphere scores from baseline to month 6 using a mixed-effects model as described above. For the pharmaco-economic analyses, costs (direct, indirect, and caregiver as reported in the RUD-Lite) will be summed for each treatment arm and compared with nonparametric tests, as cost data are typically skewed. We will conduct a cost-utility analysis by comparing total costs in each treatment arm with summation of utilities derived from the EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L assessment to generate a cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). This will provide an important assessment of the cost-effectiveness of the intervention as we anticipate that treating with methylphenidate versus placebo will be economically attractive (i.e., potentially cost-saving if improved apathy is associated with lower overall costs and superior levels of functioning and quality of life).</p><p id="Par62">For study participants with missing outcomes, multiple imputation will be considered, and analyses will follow the plans described above and the combination rules for multiple imputation.

ADMET 2 is planned as a larger, longer study following ADMET, a randomized trial in which methylphenidate was shown to reduce apathy in the Apathy Evaluation Scale and the mADCS-CGIC, but not in the NPI. In ADMET, methylphenidate was administered only for 6&#x000a0;weeks and had a study population of 60 participants. In contrast, ADMET 2 plans to enroll 200 participants and follow them for 6&#x000a0;months. ADMET 2 is testing the efficacy of methylphenidate in reducing apathy as measured by three different instruments: mADCS-CGIC, NPI and DAIR. In addition, because ADMET study findings suggested the possibility of an improvement in cognition, ADMET 2 will administer a battery of cognitive tests aimed at distinguishing whether the apparent improvement was in fact an increase in cognition or simply an increase in attention during cognitive testing. Given the prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms and especially apathy in AD and its impact on both patients and caregivers, an intervention to alleviate apathy would be of great benefit to society.</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par71">This report describes the protocol, version 1.3, 02 May 2017 and describes the ADMET 2 protocol and adheres to the standard protocol items: recommendation for interventional trials (SPIRIT) reporting guidelines with attached checklist and figure (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Standard protocol items: recommendation for interventional trials (SPIRIT) figure for the Apathy in Dementia Methylphenidate Trial 2.
