There are a variety of approaches available for brachial plexus block, including interscalene, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, and axillary approach. The choice of puncture approach is often according to surgical site, the risk of puncture, and the experience of anesthesiologist.</p><p>Coracoid approach is a new technique for infraclavicular brachial plexus block.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> Coracoid approach brachial plexus block (CABPB) is useful for arm surgery. It is easy positioning and safe.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup></p><p>CABPB is carried out guided by nerve stimulator or ultrasound in general, due to the fact that brachial plexus is rather deep in coracoid plane.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Many trials have proved that ultrasonic guidance can provide more perfect clinical anesthesia effect than nerve stimulator guidance in regional block.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> However, Lecamwasam et al<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> confirmed that stimulating posterior cord coule increased the likelihood of block success. In this research, we hypothesized that positioning posterior cord can enhance the anesthesia effect of CABPB guided by nerve stimulator and can generate similar anesthesia effect to CABPB guided by ultrasound.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This research was approved by the medical ethics committee of the first hospital of Qinhuangdao (IRB no. 201601A013). Eighty patients were enrolled in this study. All patients provided their written informed consent. Inclusion criteria included aged 18 to 60 years; American Society of Anesthesiologists status I-II; scheduled for elbow, forearm, wrist, or hand surgery. Exclusion criteria included history of allergy to local anesthetics; local infection, coagulopathy, neuromuscular disease, or chest or shoulder deformities; and the surgery time would be longer than the local anesthetic action time.</p><p>Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups, 40 in each group. The random number was generated via a computer and sealed in an opaque envelope that was opened immediately before anesthesia. Two groups were assigned to receive either CABPB guided by nerve stimulator (group A) or guided by ultrasound (group B). The procedure was implemented by anesthesiologists who were familiar with both of the 2 technologies.</p><p>Patients received conventional monitor comprised of pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram (ECG), and noninvasive blood pressure measurement at 3&#x0200a;minutes intervals. Low volume oxygen inhalation was supplied to each patient. Midazolam 0.05&#x0200a;mg/kg and fentanyl 1&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg were administered intravenously to every patient. The puncture point was sterilized and infiltration anesthetized with 3.0&#x0200a;mL of 1% lidocaine. Subsequently, CABPB was performed.</p><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Group A</title><p>The puncture point was 2.0&#x0200a;cm medially and 2.0&#x0200a;cm caudally to the coracoid process<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). A 55&#x0200a;mm, 22-gauge needle, attached to the nerve stimulator, pierced the skin vertically. Initially, the nerve stimulator was set at electric current 1.0&#x0200a;mA, frequency 2.0&#x0200a;Hz, and pulse width 0.1&#x0200a;ms.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Three motor responses would be obtained<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>: posterior cord motor response (wrist extension); lateral cord motor response (elbow flexion, finger flexion, or thumb opposition); and medial cord motor response (finger flexion, thumb, or wrist adduction). The needle was adjusted cephalically or caudally in a sagittal plane to elicit 2 different responses. Among the 2 responses, we must get posterior cord motor response (wrist extension). The other response could be either lateral or medial cord motor response. Once the optimal motor response was still achieved when electric current ranged in 0.3 to 0.5&#x0200a;mA, 20&#x0200a;mL of 0.375% ropivacaine was slowly injected with careful discontinuously withdraw.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The puncture point for CABPB.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-96-e8428-g001"/></fig></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Group B</title><p>We used a 6 to 13&#x0200a;MHz linear ultrasound probe (M7 expert; Shenzhen Mindray Biological Medical Electronics Co. Ltd, Shenzhen, China). The ultrasound probe was positioned just in close proximity to the coracoid in a sagittal plane (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A). The angle of the probe was adjusted to capture an unambiguous short-axis image of the axillary vessels and brachial plexus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B). Then, an 8&#x0200a;cm, 22-gauge needle was positioned near the axillary artery, using an in-plane technique. Forty milliliters of 0.375% ropivacaine was slowly injected around axillary artery with careful discontinuously withdraw. The injection of the local anesthetic was visualized under continuous ultrasound to confirm that local anesthetic spread around the brachial plexus.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>(A) The position and orientation of probe for CABPB.

If this did not come into effect, general anesthesia was necessary.</p><p>Primary outcome measure consisted of success rate. Secondary outcome measures consisted of procedure time and onset time of sensory and motor block. Measured outcomes were recorded by an independent observer, who was unconscious of the grouping situation.</p><p>Success rate was defined as the percentage of the patients who received the surgery just relying on brachial plexus block, without local infiltration anesthesia, intravenous fentanyl, or general anesthesia.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup></p><p>Procedure time meant the time required to perform the block.</p><p>Sensory and motor block was evaluated every 5&#x0200a;minutes. Sensory block was evaluated with stabbing the sensory distribution of musculocutaneous, median, ulnar, radial, and the medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm. The degree of sensory block for each nerve was scored as follows: 0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;sharp sensation (no block), 1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;blunt sensation (hypoalgesia), and 2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;no sensation (anesthesia). Sensory block was considered complete when the score reached 2.</p><p>Motor blockade was evaluated with making specific movements dominated by musculocutaneous, median, ulnar, and radial nerves. The tests was performed as follows<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>: flexing the elbow for the musculocutaneous nerve, flexing the wrist and the metacarpophalangeal joints for the median nerve, extending the elbow and the wrist for the radial nerve, and abducting and adducting the fingers for the ulnar nerve. The degree of motor block for each nerve was scored as follows: 0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;normal movement, 1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;decreased movement, and 2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;no movement. Motor block was considered complete when the score reached 2.</p><p>The total test time for sensory or motor block was 30&#x0200a;minutes. If the score for each nerve still did not achieve 2 beyond 30&#x0200a;minutes, the onset time was treated as 30&#x0200a;minutes.</p><p>All complications, varying from nausea to cardiovascular or central neurologic symptom, were taken note in detail.

But the procedure time was longer in patients guided by nerve stimulator.</p><p>Brachial plexus block is an effective technique for upper extremity surgery. This block can be executed using a variety of approaches. Since described by Whiffler in 1981,<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> the coracoid approach has been used extensively for surgeries of the elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand. CABPB provides comprehensive sensory block with a favorable tourniquet tolerance.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study has indicated that the pleura is deeper than brachial plexus in the coracoid plane, so the risk of pneumothorax is minimal.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup></p><p>Traditionally, CABPB is guided by anatomic landmark. But owing to the fact that brachial plexus is deeply covered in coracoid plane,<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> CABPB guided by anatomic landmark is difficult. So, CABPB is carried out guided by nerve stimulator or ultrasound in general.</p><p>In coracoid plane, the brachial plexus includes 3 cords: posterior cord, lateral cord, and medial cord. When using a nerve stimulator, different motor responses would be elicited. Thus, dual or triple stimulation is put into practice, in order to achieve better results. Rodriguez et al<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> and Gaertner et al<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> concluded that the success rate was higher with stimulation of 2 or 3 cords of the brachial plexus. Among the 3 cords, posterior cord was associated with greater effectiveness.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> But no significant difference was found between dual motor responses and triple motor responses.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> So, we selected posterior cord motor response combined with another motor response as our stimulation target.</p><p>On the basis pf our selected motor responses, success rate and onset time of global sensory and motor block are equally encouraging in 2 groups. This is in line with our expectation. In addition, the onset time of sensory and motor block for musculocutaneous nerve is shorter in group A than in group B. It is consistent with the result that motor response evoked from lateral cord is more than from medial cord (61.5% vs 38.5%). This is similar to the conclusion by Sharma et al.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Maybe it is because lateral cord is easy to position. And the onset time may decrease further if dextrose is used as a diluent instead of saline.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup></p><p>In previous studies, ultrasonic guidance could improve the success rate<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> and shorten the onset time<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> and procedure time.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> But in our study, we just saw that procedure time was shortened.</p><p>In this study, posterior cord motor response combined with another motor response is selected as our stimulation target, which guarantees that the local anesthetic can surrounded each branches of brachial plexus, just like what happens under continuous ultrasonic guidance. So, the success rate and the onset time are similar in 2 groups. However, it consumes more time to preform CABPB in group A indeed. But this time gap between the 2 groups might be acceptable in clinical practice. And what is more, nerve stimulation guidance is easy to learn and master. Although the economic cost for ultrasonic unit is higher, it requires longer learning time to master the skills of ultrasonic.</p><p>There are still some limitations in the present study. One shortcoming of this study is that our results are not suitable for all anesthesiologists with different levels. The clinical result is dependent on performer's skill. This point is rather obvious for obtaining specific motor responses or unambiguous ultrasonic image. The second limitation is that the body mass index (BMI) of patients has not been recorded. Obviously, BMI is closely related to the difficulty of CABPB. Another limitation is that the sample size is relatively small, so the above conclusions are representative, yet to be confirmed by further studies in the future.</p><p>We conclude that positioning posterior cord in CABPB under nerve stimulator guidance develops satisfactory clinical effect. The success rate and onset time of sensory or motor block are similar to that of CABPB under ultrasonic guidance. However, the procedure time is shorter under ultrasonic guidance, while the onset time of sensory and motor block for musculocutaneous nerve (representing lateral cord) is shorter under nerve stimulator guidance than ultrasonic guidance.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: BMI = body mass index, CABPB = coracoid approach brachial plexus block, ECG = electrocardiogram.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Whiffler</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group>
