The study was conducted on 2 different days with a minimum washout period of one week between visits. All subjects were scanned prior to the experiment to familiarize them with the scanner environment and to reduce anxiety. The study was carried out in the Department of Radiology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.</p><p>All subjects avoided eating and drinking for 4 hours before the experiment. Female subjects were on contraceptives and pregnancy was excluded by a pregnancy test at each visit. Exclusion criteria were abnormal blood pressure, history of previous addictive behavior, history of allergy to opioids, history of pain disorders or mental illness, and intake of analgesic 24 hours prior to the experiment.</p><p>The study was approved by the local ethics committee (N-20100046) and the Danish Medicines Agency (2612&#x02013;4319).

Adverse effects were monitored during the study and one day after the study by telephone interview. MRS data were recorded during rest and during pain stimulation before and 80 minutes after drug administration (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-7-269">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental acute skin pain stimulation</title><p>Painful skin stimulations were applied 16 cm proximal to the right knee using a contact heat-evoked potential stimulator (Medoc Ltd, Ramat Yishai, Israel) with an activation area of 573 mm<sup>2</sup>. A tonic noxious stimulus was applied for 5 minutes at a fixed stimulation temperature, which was found prior to the scan at the first visit for all subjects, hence using the same stimulation temperature for both visits. The starting temperature was 32&#x000b0;C. To find the stimulation temperature, the stimulus was applied outside the scanner for 30 seconds. The stimulation was stopped if the subject felt medium pain intensity (defined in next section) and the temperature was decreased in steps of 0.5&#x000b0;C from 45.0&#x000b0;C until the subject tolerated the stimulus temperature for 30 seconds.</p><p>During scans, the subjects were able to stop the stimulation in the event of intolerable pain. As the painful stimulation was applied twice, before and during treatment, the thermode was replaced slightly proximal for the second stimulation to avoid repeated stimulation of the same skin area.

Looking at individual trends of N-acetylaspartate/creatine changes from before treatment to during treatment, they mostly decreased (ten decreased, one no change) for morphine treatment and increased (seven increased, two decreased) for placebo treatment. To further investigate the mechanisms underlying the observed effect of morphine on brain metabolites, comparisons of metabolite concentration changes induced by the treatment itself without pain stimulation were performed.

A similar comparison for placebo treatment also showed no differences before and during treatment (glutamate/creatine, myo-inositol/creatine, or N-acetylaspartate/creatine; all <italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.15).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>To our best knowledge, this is the first human explorative study to assess the effect of single-dose oral morphine treatment on the acute pain-induced metabolic response in healthy subjects using in vivo spectroscopy. No difference in metabolite concentrations was observed between the 2 days at rest. Painful skin stimulation induced an increase in N-acetylaspartate/creatine. Treatment with morphine induced decreased concentrations of glutamate/creatine, myo-inositol/creatine, and N-acetylaspartate/creatine during painful stimulation. This is thought to mainly reflect a normalization of the pain-induced increase in N-acetylaspartate/creatine as seen during placebo treatment. The method seems reliable and may be used to provide further insight into the mechanisms of pain and pain treatment.</p><sec><title>Methodological considerations</title><p>The reported changes in brain metabolite concentrations stated in the literature are variable, probably due to variation in the method of pain stimulation, positions of voxels of interest, magnetic field strength, post-processing methods, different patient groups, and ratios compared with absolute concentrations. We analyzed brain metabolites, which have previously been reported to show changes induced by acute pain and opioid treatment. The anterior cingulate cortex is involved in the processing of pain and is also an opioid-rich region.<xref rid="b16-jpr-7-269" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b18-jpr-7-269" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b20-jpr-7-269" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> We investigated the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex, because this is a region commonly investigated in MRS studies and metabolite changes have previously been reported in acute pain studies.<xref rid="b3-jpr-7-269" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b7-jpr-7-269" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-jpr-7-269" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> However, other parts of the anterior cingulate cortex and brain areas such as the insula would also be relevant to investigate. Chemical shift imaging would be a suitable method for investigating changes in metabolite concentrations in more brain areas at the same time, but the signal-to-noise ratio is normally reduced considerably.<xref rid="b2-jpr-7-269" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In line with previous studies using spectroscopy, we chose to analyze changes in metabolite concentration as ratios to creatine.<xref rid="b5-jpr-7-269" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b24-jpr-7-269" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Using ratios compared with absolute values of metabolite concentrations are easier to implement because the computational requirements are less comprehensive and tissue segmentation is not necessary.<xref rid="b2-jpr-7-269" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> On the other hand, change in absolute quantification of metabolite concentrations is a more direct measurement of changes of a specific metabolite concentration.</p><p>Because the study design was placebo-controlled and repeated spectroscopy measurements were included on both the morphine and placebo days, we chose to include only subjects who had complete data before treatment. This was done not to make the statistics too complicated and noncom-parable between the different days and treatment conditions. Furthermore, repeated measures analysis of variance would have been most appropriate for analysis of this study design; however, only eight subjects would have been included for analysis, and as this was an explorative study, we wanted to retain as much information from as many subjects as possible so did not use repeated measures analysis of variance.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of morphine on pain perception</title><p>Subjective ratings of pain intensity showed that the stimulus was perceived as slightly to moderately painful and morphine treatment tended to show analgesia. However, compared with placebo, the difference was not significant. It is well known that there is high interindividual variability in analgesic effect and it has been demonstrated that deeper and tonic stimulations are more sensitive to morphine analgesia.<xref rid="b25-jpr-7-269" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>Drug administration in this study was chosen based on our experience from previous studies in which the analgesic effects of this dose in human experimental pain studies were demonstrated.<xref rid="b26-jpr-7-269" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b27-jpr-7-269" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> However, it could be hypothesized that a larger dosage could have been more effective at eliciting behavioral and perhaps metabolite changes, but the 30 mg dose is close to the limit we can give in healthy volunteers. Higher doses may lead to adverse effects and high dropout rates. Furthermore, the lack of a significant effect on pain perception during treatment with morphine could be due to the low number of subjects included for analysis. Olesen et al and Staahl et al demonstrated analgesic effects of this dose of morphine in 24 subjects.<xref rid="b26-jpr-7-269" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b27-jpr-7-269" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Therefore, future studies should include more subjects for analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Pain-induced effect on cingulate metabolites</title><p>The N-acetylaspartate/creatine ratio increased significantly in response to acute painful stimulation. The exact physio logical mechanisms responsible for the changes in brain metabolite concentrations in response to acute pain are not known. N-acetylaspartate is well known to be a neuronal and axonal marker and involved in neuronal metabolism.<xref rid="b28-jpr-7-269" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b32-jpr-7-269" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> N-acetylaspartate is synthesized within the mitochondria, and decreased concentrations of N-acetylaspartate are correlated with a reduction in adenosine triphosphate and oxygen consumption.<xref rid="b29-jpr-7-269" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b32-jpr-7-269" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> We showed an increased N-acetylaspartate/creatine ratio in response to acute pain, which might be explained by the role of N-acetylaspartate in neuronal metabolism. Clark et al proposed N-acetylaspartate to be a reservoir of glutamate.<xref rid="b30-jpr-7-269" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Hence, changes in N-acetylaspartate and glutamate could be considered to be related in a complex metabolic way, explaining why acute pain may induce changes in the total N-acetylaspartate/glutamate balance. Theoretically, this could explain the observation of changes in glutamate in some studies and N-acetylaspartate in others, depending on the exact setup and conditions. This could also explain why we did not see any pain-induced change in glutamate in the present study. This is consistent with a report by Kupers et al, who investigated metabolite changes in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex following painful tonic heat stimulation.<xref rid="b7-jpr-7-269" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> On the other hand, Mullins et al reported a painful cold pressor test to evoke an increase in glutamate in the anterior cingulate cortex, and Gussew et al also reported increased glutamate concentrations in the anterior insula cortex following painful skin heat stimulation.<xref rid="b6-jpr-7-269" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b8-jpr-7-269" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Effect of morphine on pain-induced changes in cingulate metabolites</title><p>Decreased glutamate/creatine, myo-inositol/creatine, and N-acetylaspartate/creatine were seen on applying painful stimulation during morphine treatment compared with painful stimulation before treatment. In contrast, treatment with placebo increased the concentration of N-acetylaspartate/creatine. Hence, morphine tends to normalize the concentration to a &#x0201c;rest-like&#x0201d; level, whereas the further increase after placebo treatment could be related to a placebo response. As the metabolite concentrations did not change in response to morphine without pain, this strengthen that the changes in the abovementioned metabolite ratios are actually related to the analgesic effect of morphine.</p><p>Overall, the reduction in concentrations of several metabolites, as seen in the present study, is not inconsistent with the results of previous studies in animals and long-term opioid-dependent subjects; however, these results cannot be compared directly with our explorative study of acute pain stimulation during acute morphine treatment. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies have reported changes in metabolite concentrations after chronic morphine treatment in rats.<xref rid="b14-jpr-7-269" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-jpr-7-269" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Gao et al found increased levels of GABA and decreased levels of glutamate in the prefrontal cortex, and increased glutamine and myo-inositol levels and decreased GABA, glutamate, Tau, and N-acetylaspartate levels in the hippocampus.<xref rid="b14-jpr-7-269" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Xiang et al reported an increase in lactate, myo-inositol, and aspartate levels and a decrease in glutamate and glutamine levels in the thalamus, and increased lactate and myo-inositol levels and decreased glutamate levels in the somatosensory cortex.<xref rid="b15-jpr-7-269" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In both these studies, the concentrations of the different metabolites normalized during the withdrawal period.

Overall, the results of our study indicate that changes in N-acetylaspartate concentrations are related to the physiology of pain and opioid treatment, and additional changes in glutamate and myo-inositol concentration are also related to morphine treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this explorative, placebo-controlled study, we investigated the effect of a single dose of oral morphine on the acute pain-induced metabolic brain response in healthy subjects. We found an increase in N-acetylaspartate/creatine during painful stimulation and a decrease in N-acetylaspartate/creatine during treatment with morphine, which is consistent with previous findings in animal studies and in opioid-dependent subjects, whereas N-acetylaspartate/creatine increased during treatment with placebo. Furthermore, glutamate/creatine and myo-inositol/creatine decreased only during treatment with morphine. The method seems reliable and may in the future be used to provide further insight into the mechanisms of pain and treatment with analgesics.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was funded by The Danish Council for Strategic Research and A P M&#x000f8;llers Foundation.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Author contributions</bold></p><p>TMH, AEO, and JBF: conception and design of the study, acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation of data, drafting the article, revising it critically for important intellectual content, and final approval of the version to be published.
