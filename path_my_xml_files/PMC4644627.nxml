The ability to predict achievement of low disease activity (LDA) at week 28 from improvements in Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), swollen joint count (SJC) and Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) up to week 12 was assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The 28-week study population included all patients who completed the double-blind (DB) phase and entered the open-label (OL) phase, receiving 200 mg CZP every 2 weeks (Q2W) &#x02265;16 weeks. In the 12-week DB period, patients with active RA and an inadequate response to &#x02265;1 disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) were randomized 4:1 to CZP (400 mg at weeks 0, 2 and 4 then 200 mg Q2W) or placebo (Q2W), stratified by prior anti-TNF use, concomitant use of MTX and disease duration (&#x0003c;2 years vs. &#x02265;2 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 955 patients entered the OL phase. At week 28, similar clinical improvements were seen in those receiving CZP throughout (CZP&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;CZP; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;771) and those receiving placebo during the DB phase&#x000a0;and switching to CZP in the OL phase (placebo&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;CZP; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;184) (ACR20 response rate&#x02009;=&#x02009;59.7 % vs. 53.3 %; ACR50/ACR70 response rates were also similar). Effect of CZP treatment was similar regardless of prior anti-TNF use, disease duration and concomitant DMARDs, based on ACR20 response rates. The percentage of patients achieving DAS28(ESR) LDA at week 28 was calculated for DAS28(ESR), SJC or CDAI responders at earlier time points. Reductions from baseline (&#x00394;) of DAS28(ESR) &#x0003c;1.2, &#x00394;SJC &#x0003c;25 % or &#x00394;CDAI &#x0003c;10 by week 12 were associated with &#x0003c;9 % chance of achieving LDA at week 28 regardless of prior anti-TNF exposure. Adverse event rates were similar for placebo&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;CZP and CZP&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;CZP patients, with no new safety signals identified.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A diverse population of RA patients with varying disease duration showed rapid and sustained clinical improvements on CZP treatment, regardless of prior anti-TNF or concomitant DMARD use. Failure to achieve improvements in DAS28(ESR), SJC or CDAI within the first 12 weeks of CZP therapy was associated with a low chance of achieving LDA at week 28.

While such trials demonstrate the ability of anti-TNFs to slow radiographic progression and improve the signs and symptoms of RA in patients with active disease, studies which permit the inclusion of more diverse patient groups such as those with and without prior anti-TNF use, with and without baseline methotrexate (MTX) use or with prior exposure to non-MTX conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) would more accurately reflect patients in real-world clinical care. The REALISTIC trial is one such study, from which the efficacy of certolizumab pegol (CZP) after 12 weeks of treatment in a heterogeneous population of RA patients has previously been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Following the 12-week double-blind (DB) period, the REALISTIC study included a 16-week open-label extension (OLE) period, in order to assess the efficacy and safety of CZP as an add-on therapy to current treatment in this varied population relevant to clinical care, over a 28-week period.</p><p>Here we report the safety and key secondary outcomes, including maintenance of response to certolizumab pegol (CZP) in this heterogeneous population of RA patients, stratified by prior exposure to anti-TNFs, concomitant MTX use and disease duration. In addition, the results of exploratory analyses are reported, investigating whether lack of response during the first 12 weeks of treatment (based on the timing and magnitude of the change in Disease Activity Score based on 28 joints and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [DAS28(ESR)], swollen joint count [SJC] or Clinical Disease Activity Index [CDAI]), predicts failure to achieve low disease activity (LDA) at week 28 in this diverse patient population.</p><p>Early prediction of clinical outcomes allows identification of a time at which it might be appropriate to stop therapy in patients failing to respond to CZP and could allow an earlier change to a more appropriate treatment option, resulting in faster improvements in patient outcomes and potentially better cost efficiency for the health care system. It has been previously reported in the RAPID 1 trial for CZP that a lack of improvement in DAS28(ESR) by week 12 in RA patients predicted failure to achieve LDA at later time points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Full inclusion and exclusion criteria were reported in the primary publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Briefly, eligible patients were &#x02265;18 years of age, had adult-onset RA for &#x02265;3 months as defined by the 1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, and showed an unsatisfactory response or intolerance to &#x02265;1 csDMARD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Patients had active disease by &#x02265;5 tender and &#x02265;4 swollen joints (TJC; SJC [28-joint count]) and either C-reactive protein (CRP) &#x02265;10 mg/l or ESR (Westergren method) &#x02265;28 mm/h at screening. Biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDS) were discontinued before study entry; patients were excluded if previously treated with &#x0003e;2 anti-TNFs, rituximab or abatacept. Analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral corticosteroids (10 mg/day prednisone equivalent) and csDMARDs, MTX, leflunomide, sulfasalazine, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine and gold were permitted if doses were stable prior to baseline. Exclusion criteria included any other inflammatory arthritis or a history of chronic, serious or current infection (including evidence of latent tuberculosis [TB] defined as a positive purified protein derivative skin test [&#x02265;5 mm] or close contact with individuals with active TB). Patients positive for purified protein derivative could be included if active TB was ruled out and if they were adequately treated for latent TB (e.g., isonicotinic acid hydrazide), with treatment initiated at least 1 month before first administration with the study drug.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This 28-week, phase IIIb study (NCT00717236) consisted of a 12-week, randomized, DB period and a subsequent 16-week OL phase.

The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee as defined in local regulations and performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki (please see Acknowledgements for a complete list of ethics committees that approved this study). All patients provided written consent. Sample size was selected to provide at least 90 % power to show a statistically significant difference between the active and placebo groups at week 12 in both the primary outcome (ACR20 response rate) and also subgroup analyses (prior anti-TNF usage; concomitant MTX treatment and disease duration).</p><p>During the initial 12-week period patients were randomized 4:1 by means of an interactive voice response system to either 400 mg CZP at weeks 0, 2 and 4 followed by 200 mg CZP every 2 weeks (Q2W) (CZP patient group), or placebo (0.9 % saline) Q2W (placebo group), stratified by prior anti-TNF use, concomitant use of MTX and disease duration (&#x0003c;2 years vs. &#x02265;2 years) to ensure balanced treatment assignments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Patients who had completed 12 weeks of treatment with either 200 mg CZP Q2W or placebo were eligible to receive OL CZP 200 mg Q2W for &#x02265;16 weeks (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).

Secondary endpoints included efficacy measurements (ACR20/ACR50/ACR70 response rates, DAS28[CRP], Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index [HAQ-DI], Clinical Disease Activity Index [CDAI] and Simplified Disease Activity Index [SDAI]) at week 12 and throughout the OLE.</p><p>Post hoc analyses included week 28 ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 response rates stratified by prior anti-TNF use, and week 28 ACR20 response rates stratified by number and type of concomitant DMARDs at baseline, baseline MTX use, disease duration and rheumatoid factor (RF) titer at baseline. Post hoc analyses to predict the proportion of CZP-treated patients who achieved DAS28(ESR) LDA (&#x02264;3.2) at week 28 based on early responses were also conducted, stratified by prior anti-TNF experience.

ACR response rates were determined using nonresponder imputation (NRI) when patients withdrew for AE or lack or loss of efficacy, and last observation carried forward (LOCF) in case of any other reason. Least squares means (change from baseline) in DAS28(CRP), SJC and HAQ-DI were analyzed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) to estimate response, which included terms for visit, visit by treatment interaction and baseline response (for the respective endpoint) by visit interaction. Predictability analyses by early changes in DAS28(ESR), SJC and CDAI were conducted using observed data (from the OL set); data for DAS28(ESR) were also analyzed using LOCF-imputed data from the full analysis set (FAS) (comprising all patients who received &#x02265;1 dose of CZP). If all weeks prior to the specified time point were missing, the patient was not counted. Failure to achieve the specified reductions in DAS28(ESR), SJC and CDAI was defined as (percentage) change from baseline less than the cut point at every visit up to and including the time point under analysis. Predictability analyses by DAS28(ESR) nonresponse &#x02018;at&#x02019; (as opposed to &#x02018;up to&#x02019;) the relevant time point were also conducted using LOCF-imputed data from the FAS.

Both the onset and the magnitude of response were consistent with previous studies, in which clinical benefits associated with CZP treatment have been observed from week 1 following the commencement of CZP therapy, both as a monotherapy (the FAST4WARD study) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and in addition to MTX (the RAPID 1 and 2 studies) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Sustained efficacy was observed across all subgroups of CZP patients, including those with and without prior anti-TNF use, receiving CZP monotherapy or concomitant DMARDs (regardless of type or number), with and without concomitant MTX use at baseline, and with disease duration of&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;or &#x02265;2 years. This is in agreement with the DOSEFLEX study of CZP, where CZP exhibited similar efficacy in RA patients with or without prior exposure to anti-TNF agents over 34 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Previously published studies employing a range of biologic agents have also demonstrated the efficacy of this class of drug in RA patients who have previously shown inadequate responses to anti-TNF agents. These include both TNF-targeting (golimumab) and non-TNF-targeting (rituximab, tocilizumab, abatacept) therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Moreover, in the current study, there was a suggestion of a possible correlation between improved ACR20 response and increasing baseline RF levels, based upon the observed data.

The safety profile was in line with the anti-TNF class [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. No new safety signals were identified. The incidences of AEs and SAEs were similar between the CZP and placebo groups during the 12-week DB phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and the CZP&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;CZP and placebo&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;CZP groups during the OL phase.</p><p>In this diverse patient population, the majority of patients responded to treatment with CZP by week 12. Low chances of achieving LDA at week 28 could be predicted for subgroups early in the course of CZP treatment based on the timing and magnitude of the initial change in DAS28(ESR). These data are in line with the post hoc analysis of the RAPID 1 study of CZP in adult patients with active RA despite MTX therapy, who received CZP 200 mg or 400 mg Q2W plus MTX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These analyses demonstrated that failure to achieve improvement in DAS28 within the first 12 weeks of CZP therapy was predictive of a low probability of achieving LDA at year 1. Moreover, the percentage of patients achieving LDA at week 28 in subgroups of nonresponders at early time points was found to be strongly dependent on the magnitude and timing of the lack of the response. This is in agreement with published studies of other biologics, which report that failure to respond by later time points (up to 26 weeks after commencing biologic therapy) correlated with reduced likelihood of achieving clinical endpoints. In the present study, a low percentage of patients achieving LDA at week 28 could also be predicted using either SJC or CDAI early nonresponses. Furthermore, a lack of response up to week 12, as measured either by change from baseline in DAS28(ESR) or CDAI, or percentage change from baseline in SJC, predicted failure to achieve LDA at week 28 in both patients na&#x000ef;ve to, and previously exposed to, anti-TNFs.</p><p>These data support the concept that a decision can be made at week 12 regarding continuation of CZP treatment. This is in line with the treat-to-target recommendations, which state that until the desired treatment target is reached, drug therapy should be adjusted at least every 3 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Limitations of this study included the lack of radiographic assessment, without which any joints swollen due to factors other than structural damage could not be detected. Furthermore, results are reported here up to week 28 and longer-term data would be useful in ascertaining the maintenance of response. Predictability analyses were conducted using the OL set, comprising all patients who received at least one dose of CZP in the OL phase, and also using the FAS, comprising all patients who were administered at least one dose of CZP, and which included 80 patients (9.4 %) who dropped out of the study by week 12. While the predictive values appeared similar when calculated either using LOCF imputation or an observed case analysis, both ways may slightly bias the predicted response rates, and as such, general trends may be of more clinical value than precise figures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the results of the REALISTIC study conducted in patients reflective of real-world clinical care demonstrate sustained improvements in disease activity and physical functions following 28 weeks of CZP treatment across this diverse population of RA patients, including with and without prior anti-TNF use, on a variety of concomitant DMARDs and regardless of disease duration&#x000a0;(&#x0003c; and &#x02265;2 years). Additionally, in patients both na&#x000ef;ve to and previously exposed to prior anti-TNFs, DAS28(ESR), SJC or CDAI non-response at time points up to week 12 were predictive of a low probability of achieving LDA at week 28.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Consent statement</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee as defined in local regulations and performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki.
