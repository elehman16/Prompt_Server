Chronic airways disease has presentations that overlap with tuberculosis. However, chronic airways disease is often unrecognised due to a lack of diagnostic services. Within developing countries, referral systems at primary health care level are weak and patients turn to unskilled informal health providers to seek health care. Delayed diagnosis and treatment of these diseases facilitates increased severity and tuberculosis transmission.</p><p>The World Health Organisation developed the Practical Approach to Lung Health strategy which has been shown to improve the management of both tuberculosis and chronic airways disease. The guidelines address the need for integrated guidelines for tuberculosis and chronic airways disease. Engaging with informal health providers has been shown to be effective in improving health services uptake. However, it is not known whether engaging community informal health providers would have a positive impact in the implementation of the Practical Approach to Lung Health strategy. We will use a cluster randomised controlled trial to determine the effect of using the two interventions to improve case detection and treatment of patients with tuberculosis and chronic airways disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A three-arm cluster randomised trial design will be used. A primary health centre catchment population will form a cluster, which will be randomly allocated to one of the arms. The first arm personnel will receive the Practical Approach to Lung Health strategy intervention.

CAD includes asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchiectasis. Risk factors for these conditions include tobacco-smoking, indoor air pollution from biomass fuels and lower respiratory tract infections.</p><p>Chronic or persistent coughing is a frequent clinical presenting feature of both CAD and tuberculosis (TB). Chronic cough is a distressing symptom and a common reason for people to seek health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Findings from studies conducted in Malawi show that patients presenting with cough exert a huge burden on out-patient department (OPD) services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and yet there are many challenges to providing effective care for patients with respiratory symptoms in the OPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Chronic airways diseases</title><p>COPD is characterised by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible but nonetheless treatable. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 65 million people have moderate to severe COPD with 5&#x000a0;% of all (3 million) global deaths being attributed to COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. About 90&#x000a0;% of these COPD deaths occur in low-income and middle-income countries. At the other end of the spectrum, asthma, a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways, is characterised by episodes of reversible breathing problems (that may be life-threatening) due to airway narrowing and obstruction. These episodes are characterised by coughing, wheezing, chest tightness and shortness of breath. The frequency and severity of these episodes can have a marked impact on the livelihoods and the well-being of those affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Bronchiectasis is a severe, chronic infection of the lung associated with permanent abnormal dilatation of bronchi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As a result mucus clearance is impaired, leading to accumulation of secretions, bacterial overgrowth and recurrent infections.</p><p>Regular therapy of CAD with the rational use of inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators can reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations. To date, inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators have not been consistently available for use anywhere in Malawi&#x02019;s health system, and particularly not at primary care level. Because it is difficult to diagnose CAD without appropriate equipment, unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics are made for treatment. Where available, inhalers are not used effectively because the patients lack adequate education in their proper use. Some patients are treated empirically for TB (sometimes repeatedly) despite negative sputum smears because of a lack of tools and guidelines for further screening for CAD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Tuberculosis</title><p>TB is the world&#x02019;s leading infectious cause of death in adults; approximately 1.4 million deaths out of the 8 million annual TB cases occur per year. TB predominantly affects the respiratory system and chronic or persistent coughing is a cardinal symptom. The Stop TB strategy relies heavily on identifying and treating TB cases from among the large group of patients who seek health care because of persistent coughing. However, TB case detection remains a challenge in most countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and especially across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Therefore, adult individuals with chronic respiratory symptoms are potential TB cases and pose a relatively high risk of onward transmission of TB. The WHO estimates that Malawi is detecting only 50&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] of infectious TB cases, which is below the global target of 70&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The relationship between non-communicable chronic respiratory disease and TB</title><p>In developing countries with a high prevalence of TB, only between 10 and 20&#x000a0;% of patients presenting in primary care with persistent coughing will actually have TB. The majority of the remaining 80 to 90&#x000a0;% of patients will be suffering from a wide range of non-communicable chronic respiratory diseases including CAD. A proportion of patients who have TB will also have underlying non-communicable chronic respiratory disease. It is now increasingly recognised that chronic respiratory diseases and TB share risk factors including smoking and low socioeconomic status. It is also recognised that a proportion of patients who have not been treated effectively for TB will develop chronic respiratory diseases, such as bronchiectasis and fibrosis, as a result of the tissue destruction and subsequent scarring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>The impact of chronic airways disease and TB on disability and quality of life</title><p>Severe CAD and TB exert disabling effects that reduce quality of life and livelihood opportunities for the affected individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It is not known, however, what proportion of patients with COPD are so severely affected as to fulfil international criteria for disability, measured by level and type of activity limitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. People with disabilities face particular challenges in accessing social and health services and have higher risks of disease, including TB infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These challenges, which include stigma and discrimination, may cause patients with disabilities to fail to access health services, remain in a morbid state, and eventually be caught in a damaging cycle of disability, poverty and ill-health.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>The need for integrating approaches to CAD and TB case detection and treatment</title><p>Despite the relationship between CAD and TB, health systems in most developing countries have mainly focused on the detection and cure of infectious diseases including TB. There has been less emphasis on the diagnosis and life-long management of CAD. As a result, patients with chronic cough who do not end up with a TB diagnosis are often frustrated because they are not given a diagnosis, education about their condition or treatment. Given the relationship between TB and CAD, integrated management could reduce the proportion of patients with chronic cough without a diagnosis, reduce costs and reduce multiple visits to health facilities for diagnosis.</p><p>For this reason, within the Stop TB strategy framework, WHO and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD) developed the Practical Approach to Lung Health (PAL) strategy. PAL is a patient-centred approach to the diagnosis and treatment of common respiratory illnesses in health care settings other than health centres at primary health care level. Specifically, the PAL strategy aims to improve the quality of respiratory disease management by promoting a symptom-based and integrated approach to diagnosis and treatment. The aim is to ensure standardised service delivery by the implementation of standardised clinical and diagnostic guidelines. The PAL strategy focuses on TB, pneumonia, asthma and COPD.</p><p>In Syria and Jordan, where the PAL strategy has been adopted, they have seen improvements in referrals, sputum smear examinations, and a reduction in the prescription of antibiotics for CAD, thereby markedly reducing management costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In Jordan, Abu Rumman et al. found that the PAL approach decreased the number of drugs prescribed per patient by 12.2&#x000a0;% but increased the prescription of inhalers by 155&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Similarly, in Syria, Me&#x02019;emary et al. showed a 14.8&#x000a0;% decrease in the number of drugs prescribed per patient and a decrease of 27.4&#x000a0;% in the proportion of patients who received antibiotic prescriptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Despite evidence for efficacy, the PAL strategy has not been universally adopted in most developing countries, including Malawi. This may be a result of poor acceptance and lack of political will by the national health authorities, or due to concerns regarding the feasibility of strategy implementation at primary health care facilities which are managed by low-level and middle-level health care workers.</p><p>The PAL strategy was designed for use in district hospitals. However, there is some evidence that the approach can be implemented at primary health care levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The studies in Syria and Jordan, as stipulated above, used qualified medical doctors to implement the PAL strategy. However, it is not clear whether it would be feasible to implement the PAL strategy in primary health care facilities staffed by low-level or middle-level health cadres such as clinical officers, medical assistants and nurses. Nonetheless, similarly adapted PAL approaches Practical Approach to Lung Health in South Africa (PALSA) and Practical Approach to Lung Health in Malawi (PALM) have been implemented in South Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and Malawi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], respectively, using low level cadres. However, these studies were primarily interested in assessing the impact of outreach training on the recruitment and retention of staff.</p><p>In addition to the feasibility challenges of implementing the PAL strategy in developing countries, access to health services in general, and in particular CAD and TB services, remains a challenge. These challenges are due to both, health system and patient barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Health system barriers include inadequately qualified health staff with insufficient training and a lack of equipment and treatments.</p><p>Optimal utilisation of the available services is further restricted by patient barriers such as poverty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], stigma, disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], low awareness levels for CAD and TB as well as geographical barriers. These barriers encourage patients to seek care from informal health providers such as traditional healers and grocery shop owners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. These informal health providers, in general, lack the knowledge and skills needed to provide appropriate health care information, treatment and referrals to health care centres. As a result, poor people accessing care from informal health providers often experience delays in treatment, waste time and resources, and worse still, experience poor health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>In view of these patient barriers, strengthening community-based structures could not only improve a community&#x02019;s knowledge on CAD and TB but also service utilisation. Engagement of informal health providers in delivery of health interventions to promote service access is well documented. In Kenya, storekeepers have been used to recognise and treat uncomplicated malaria in children and to refer to health services when needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In South Africa, storekeepers provided successful supervision of TB treatment &#x02013; directly observed treatment (DOT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A previous study in Malawi, conducted by the REACH Trust, demonstrated that storekeepers could promote TB case-finding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and further work by the REACH Trust demonstrated that informal providers can be engaged in the provision of integrated TB and HIV services at the community level. We found that these interventions led to improvements in HIV-testing by 61&#x000a0;%, anti-retroviral therapy (ART) access rates by 34&#x000a0;% and diagnostic uptake rates for presumptive TB cases by 15&#x000a0;% (manuscript in preparation).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Aim</title><p>The proposed trial aims to determine the effect of Informal Health Provider and Practical Approach to Lung Health interventions on the detection and management of CAD and TB at primary care level in Malawi.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods - trial design</title><p>A cluster level randomised controlled open trial with three arms.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Trial sites</title><p>The trial sites will be in the districts of Dowa and Ntchisi, in the central region of Malawi.

In some instances the Gene Expert test will be performed according to an available standard algorithm.

The interventions are particularly low-risk and targeted at improving access to medical care for those at need. Overall we anticipate that participation in the trial will reduce risks to participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Adverse event reporting</title><p>An adverse event (AE) is any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, syndrome or illness that develops or worsens during the period of observation in the study. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is an AE following the intervention that results in a) death, b) a life-threatening AE, c) hospitalisation or prolongation of an existing hospitalisation, d) disability or incapacity, e) congenital anomaly in the offspring of a participant.</p><p>The interventions we will be using in this trial are particularly low-risk interventions that offer potential safety benefits (e.g. improved access to care). Nevertheless, we will collect data about AEs. Data about AEs that are not serious will be collected with the population-based survey at the end of the trial. Participating health centres will be asked to report SAEs in relation to the interventions immediately to the trial coordinating centre. The trial coordinating centre will collect details about the SAE using a pro-forma in accordance with a specific standard operating procedure (SOP). This information will then be passed immediately to Hastings Banda who will conduct a causality assessment (not related/improbable, possible, probable, definite), assess seriousness and expectedness, take any appropriate medical action and inform the College of Medicine Research Ethics Committee (COMREC) and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine Research Ethics Committee (LSTM REC) of any events deemed related to the trial intervention within 7&#x000a0;days of knowledge of the event. All other SAEs will be reported as part of an annual report to COMREC and LSTM REC. All SAEs that relate to the interventions will be followed to resolution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Sample size and sampling approach</title><p>The primary objective of this study is to measure the impact of the interventions on the proportion of chronic cough patients with a diagnosis of CAD or TB in their health passport.

In addition health care workers will also be taught about spirometry results so that they acquire understanding to help with them in interpreting spirometry results to make accurate diagnosis.

At a community level, this is a signposting system and does not involve any treatments. At the health centre level we will be implementing an advanced care package that only contains components that would be considered standard good practice. At intervention health centres, each individual will, therefore, be managed with standard care and the additional diagnostic capabilities and treatments. Training will be given on the management of CAD and TB including managing any side effects of inhalers. As neither of the interventions are medications we have not included specific criteria for the modification or discontinuation of interventions. Individual treatments that have been initiated at the health centres can be discontinued by the patients at any time. There are no restrictions on the concomitant care that participants may receive during the trial.</p><p>If patients receive a diagnosis of CAD they may be given either salbutamol and/or corticosteroid inhalers, these have minimal side effects. Salbutamol inhalers may lead to a transient increase in heart rate, decreased plasma potassium concentration and decreased diastolic pressure. Side effects of corticosteroid inhalers include oesophageal candidiasis, dysphonia, wheezing and cough. Prolonged use of inhaled corticosteroids may increase the risk of developing TB in patients who are being treated for COPD&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Although the drugs used in this study are routinely used in health facilities in Malawi, the study will closely monitor and document any reported side effects and where possible the frequency of intake of these drugs may be reduced. Health facility staff will manage the side effects and refer to the district hospital if appropriate. Furthermore, adequate training in the use of inhalers and corticosteroids and side effects recognition will be given to minimise the occurrence of these side effects. Training on use of spirometers for diagnosing airflow limitation will also be given.
