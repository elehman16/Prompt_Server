This interaction with both bacterial and viral pathogens is referred to as porcine respiratory disease complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Therefore, control of <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic> is critical in reducing economic losses in the pig industry.</p><p>Active immunisation of pigs has been recommended for preventing <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic> disease and reduced productivity. A meta-analysis of the effect of <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic> vaccines showed an increase in the average daily gain (ADG) of 20&#x000a0;g for vaccinated finishers compared with non-vaccinated pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Pig production levels in Denmark are very high; the ADG from a body weight of 30&#x02013;100&#x000a0;kg is 905&#x000a0;g and the mortality is 3.6% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This high level of productivity is mainly due to modern production units operated on an all-in/all-out basis and with a high level of biosecurity. Due to the widespread occurrence of <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic>, a large number of pigs are vaccinated against <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic>. Annually, more than 11 million doses of vaccine against <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic> are sold in Denmark for the production of 30 million pigs, of which nine million nursery pigs are exported, and 21 million pigs are slaughtered in Denmark.</p><p>It could be questioned whether the benefit of vaccination is still valid in modern pig production systems with a high level of biosecurity, which are becoming more and more widely adopted worldwide. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of two vaccines against <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic> on the prevalence of lung lesions, ADG, antibiotic consumption and mortality in such facilities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Selection of herds</title><p>Two herds were selected for this trial on the basis of a history of clinical respiratory problems.</p><p>Herd A was located on a small island close to Funen. It was a specific pathogen free (SPF) herd but infected with <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic>, Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRS) types 1 and 2 and housing only nursery and grower/finisher pigs. The herd received 575 four-week-old piglets every 4th weeks, which were assigned to two sections. The two sections of nursery pigs were commingled in one grower/finisher section. Both nursery and grower/finisher units were operated on an all-in/all-out basis by section. The pigs were treated for oedema disease with antibiotics during the first three weeks after arrival. Before inclusion in the trial, lung lesion scores were evaluated in 30 pigs from one delivery batch as described by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This evaluation found that 87% of the pigs had catarrhal bronchopneumonia. <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic> was detected by an in-house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay at the Danish Veterinary Institute (Copenhagen, Denmark) from one lung with catarrhal bronchopneumonia, and antibodies against <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic> were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at the Danish Veterinary Institute in ten out of ten finishers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Herd B was located in the middle of Jutland. It was a SPF herd infected with <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Actinobacillus pleuropneumonia</italic> serotypes 6 and 12. The herd was a farrow-to-finish production unit consisting of 380 sows producing between 300 and 500 pigs every second week. At weaning, at four weeks of age, the pigs were moved to a section that was operated on an all-in/all-out basis. The grower/finisher units were mainly operated on an all-in/all-out basis by section. Before inclusion in the trial, lung lesion scores were evaluated in 30 pigs from one delivery batch as described by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This evaluation found that 60% of the pigs had catarrhal bronchopneumonia. <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic> and antibodies were detected as for herd 1.</p><p>Before inclusion the herd owners had to sign informed client consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Vaccines</title><p>The vaccines tested in this study were marketed as ThoroVAX<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>VET (M&#x02009;+&#x02009;PAC outside Denmark; MSD Animal Health, Ballerup, Denmark) and Ingelvac<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>MycoFLEX (Boheringer Ingelheim Animal Health, Copenhagen, Denmark). Both vaccines contain inactivated <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic>. ThoroVAX<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>VET has an aluminium hydroxide and oil emulsion adjuvant, and Ingelvac<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>MycoFLEX has a Carbomer adjuvant. Both vaccines were used according to their Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC&#x02019;s).</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental design</title><p>Pigs were included in the trial just after weaning at four weeks of age and were given ear tags with an individual number in the same colour. The pigs were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups according to a randomisation list prepared beforehand. Pigs in group 1 were injected intramuscularly (im) in the neck once with 2&#x000a0;mL of ThoroVAX<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>VET. Pigs in group 2 were injected im once with 1&#x000a0;mL of Ingelvac<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>MycoFLEX. Pigs in group 3 were included as non-vaccinated controls. The vaccination was performed by a person who was not involved in other parts of the trial and vaccination status was thereby blinded to the evaluators. The pigs from all three groups were commingled within the pens. All the pigs within an age group were included, with 1/3 left non-vaccinated and 2/3 vaccinated against <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic>.</p><p>In herd A, pigs were included at two different times (two batches), and in herd B pigs were included at three different times (three batches).</p><p>The study was approved by the Danish Health and Medicines Authority (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sundhedsstyrelsen.dk">http://www.sundhedsstyrelsen.dk</ext-link>; J.no. 2011081993).</p></sec><sec><title>Data recordings</title><sec><title><bold>

<italic>Pathology</italic>
</bold></title><p>A subset of dead pigs was necropsied to validate the cause of death at the Laboratory for Swine Diseases, Kjellerup, Denmark. A gross pathological examination was performed.</p><p>Pigs were slaughtered when they reached market weight (110&#x000a0;kg). At the abattoir, the lung from each pig was collected and marked with the treatment group number. At the Laboratory for Swine Diseases, Kjellerup, Denmark the lung lesions were evaluated as described by Christensen <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Briefly, each lung was scored yes/no with regard to presence of uncomplicated catarrhal bronchopneumonia (presumable caused only by <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic>), complicated catarrhal bronchopneumonia (presumable aggravated with secondary infections) or fissures (appears in lobes previously affected with catarrhal bronchopneumonia). From this, the number of pigs with at least one <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic>-like lesion (lungs with uncomplicated catarrhal bronchopneumonia, complicated catarrhal bronchopneumonia or fissures) was calculated. Besides this, the volume percentage of lung tissue affected by uncomplicated or complicated catarrhal bronchopneumonia was roughly estimated [See Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> for examples].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Example of how the individual lung lobs contributed to the calculation of the total lung volume.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1751-0147-56-24-1"/></fig></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The sample size was based on lung lesions and ADG. With regard to lung lesions, expressed as a percentage of lungs with no lesions at all, it was assumed that a difference of 13 percentage points between groups in the range of 40% - 60% could be found. With a level of confidence of 95% and a power of 80%, the sample size was 206 animals per vaccination group per herd. With regard to ADG, it was assumed that a difference of 30&#x000a0;g per day between groups in the range of ADG of 900&#x000a0;g per day and an assumed variation of 120&#x000a0;g per day could be found. With a level of confidence of 95% and a power of 80%, the sample size was 253 animals per group per herd.</p><p>To allow both parameters to be evaluated in the trial, it was necessary to select 250 test animals per group per herd. In order to allow for mortality, lost ear tags and missing pigs, the calculated number were increased by 20% based on previous experiences. Thus, the sample size was 300 pigs per treatment group in each herd.</p><p>The prevalence of lungs with 1) uncomplicated catarrhal bronchopneumonia, 2) complicated catarrhal bronchopneumonia, 3) fissures and 4) at least one <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic>-like lesion for each treatment group and each herd was calculated. Four separate logistic regression analyses were performed for each of the four lung lesion prevalences. Mortality was also analysed by a logistic regression.</p><p>The percentage of the total lung volume with uncomplicated catarrhal bronchopneumonia and complicated catarrhal bronchopneumonia lesions, ADG and antibiotic treatment frequency were used as an outcome in three separate linear regressions. ADG and antibiotic treatment were compared for nursery and grower/finisher pigs separately. The start weight was included as a fixed effect in models with ADG.</p><p>PROC GENMOD from the statistical package SAS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was used for logistic regression, and PROC MIXED was used for linear regression (SAS Inst. Inc., Cary, NC). Herd, treatment group and gender were included as fixed effects in all models. To test for different results in the herds, an interaction with herd and treatment group was included. A significance level of 5% was used.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Although only 900 pigs per herd were needed, a total of 2,256 pigs were included in the field trial.

There was no statistically significant effect of vaccination on growth rate, antibiotic consumption and mortality. It was surprising that no difference was found between lung lesions and ADG, since this correlation has been observed in several studies e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], although missing in another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].The lack of correlation between lung lesions and growth rate, together with the low ADG seen in the study, could be explained by the fact that a batch of pigs was weighed when the first pig within the batch reached slaughter weight. At that time, the average weight was 75&#x02013;80&#x000a0;kg, with a normal slaughter weight of 100&#x02013;110&#x000a0;kg, and therefore some pigs had to remain in the grower/finishing unit for a further seven to eight weeks before being sent for slaughter. Furthermore, it was decided not to put restrictions on the normal delivery strategy for the herds, forcing the farmer to deliver pigs before they had reached slaughter weight. If the infection with <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic> was late, which the large number of pigs with catarrhal bronchopneumonia indicates, the ADG would be most reduced late in the grower/finishing phase. In this phase, pigs vaccinated with ThoroVAX<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>VET seemed to be best protected, since they had the lowest prevalence of lung lesions. Therefore, it could be hypothesised that the ThoroVAX<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>VET-vaccinated pigs would have a higher ADG, compared with the control, if all of the pigs had been weighed just before slaughter.</p><p>Overall, no benefit of vaccination was found in antibiotic treatment. A few vaccinated pigs were treated for respiratory diseases. The daily treatment was given by the farmer, and, despite careful training of the farmer in clinical observation, it could be questioned whether the observations were made correctly.</p><p>This trial was conducted in modern facilities with high performance and a good level of biosecurity. Nevertheless, ThoroVAX<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>VET was found to reduce the prevalence of lung lesions related to <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic> significantly. The best effect of vaccination was found in Herd B, although a good effect was also found in herd A. It is important to note that there were fluctuations in the prevalence of lung lesions related to <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic> over time for both herds. At one point, even the control non-vaccinated pigs had the lowest prevalence of lung lesions related to <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic>. The diverging effects in efficacy between herds and over time emphasize the complexity of the porcine respiratory disease complex. Therefore, it is important not only to make one evaluation of lung lesions when investigating the reason for a respiratory problem within a herd. It should always be supplemented with detection of the agent/agents and/or blood samples etc.</p><p>The effect of both vaccines might be underestimated in this study, since only parts of the total populations were vaccinated. This might lead to a lower level of protection at herd level, and, if non-immune pigs develop disease, they will increase the general pathogen load - not only associated with <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic> but the porcine respiratory disease complex in general. Therefore, vaccination against <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic> might still be an economic benefit in modern pig production with a high level of biosecurity despite the lack of increased ADG in this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The prevalence of lung lesions related to <italic>M. hyopneumoniae</italic> were statistically significantly reduced for pigs vaccinated with ThoroVAX<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>VET but not for pigs vaccinated with Ingelvac<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>MycoFLEX<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> compared with a non-vaccinated control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>SPF: Specific pathogen free; i.e.: free of infection with <italic>Mycoplasma hyopneumonia</italic>, <italic>Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae</italic> (serotypes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12) Toxigenic <italic>Pasteurella Multocida, Brachyspira hyodysenteriae</italic>, Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus (type 1 and 2), Sarcoptes scabiei var. suis and Haematopinus suis.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The study was financed and monitored by MSD Animal Health but was conducted solely by the Pig Research Centre.</p><p>The authors have no financial or personal relationship with people or organisations that could inappropriately influence or bias the content of this paper.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>CSK designed the study, selected the herds, assisted with farm visits and data collection, assisted with the statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript.
