The current study was designed and implemented to investigate the effect of vitamin D during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy in reducing the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in women who are at high risk [history of GDM, birth macrosomia, family history, and high body mass index (BMI)].</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>In a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial, 90 pregnant women who had at least one risk factor for GDM were randomized into intervention (46 participants) and control (44 participants) groups.

The number of participants in each group was 50, but finally 46 and 44 participants per group remained in the analysis stage [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Pregnant women with the following criteria were included; at least one risk factor for gestational diabetes including body mass index (BMI; kg/m<sup>2</sup>) more than 25, history of macrosome neonate, positive family history for diabetes and gestational diabetes, history of gestational diabetes in previous pregnancies, and glycosuria. Exclusion criteria were as follows: Chronic diseases including renal, rheumatologic, hepatic, thyroid; pregnant women who had had diabetes before pregnancy; gestational diabetes at the time of admission; history of consuming vitamin D and drugs that interfere with glucose metabolism. Blinding was carried out in which drugs and placebos were prepared to be completely similar in appearance and taste and put in numbered pockets based on a randomization, list and neither the patients nor the physician knew the trend.
