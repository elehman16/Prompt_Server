quadriceps muscle weakness and disruption of proprioceptive function are common. The
purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a 4 weeks preoperative exercise
intervention on knee strength power and function post-surgery. [Subjects and Methods]
Eighty male patients (27.8&#x000b1;5.7 age), scheduled for reconstruction surgery, were randomly
assigned to two groups, the preoperative exercise group (n=40) and a no preoperative
exercise group (n=40). The preoperative exercise group participated in a 4-week
preoperative and 12-week post-operative programs, while the no preoperative exercise group
participated only in the 12-week postoperative exercise program. Isokinetic measured of
quadriceps strength were obtained at 4 weeks before and 3 months after surgery. [Results]
The knee extensor strength deficits measured at 60&#x000b0;/s and 180&#x000b0;/s was significantly lower
in the preoperative exercise group compared with the no preoperative exercise group. At 3
months after surgery, the extensor strength deficit was 28.5&#x000b1;9.0% at 60&#x000b0;/sec and 23.3&#x000b1;9.0%
at 180&#x000b0;/sec in the preoperative exercise group, whereas the no preoperative exercise group
showed extensor strength deficits of 36.5&#x000b1;10.7% and 27.9&#x000b1;12.6% at 60&#x000b0;/sec and 180&#x000b0;/sec,
respectively. The preoperative exercise group demonstrated significant improvement the
single-leg hop distance. [Conclusion] Four week preoperative exercise may produce many
positive effects post reconstruction surgery, including faster recovery of knee extensor
strength and function, as measured by single-leg hop ability.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Anterior cruciate ligament</kwd><kwd>Preoperative exercise</kwd><kwd>Knee extensor strength</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are one of the most common and devastating knee
injuries associated with sport participation<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Surgical repair of complete rupture of the ACL is recommended to
prevent knee joint instability. While surgery corrects the structural defect, post-operative
impairments in knee strength, function and endurance are inevitable corollary problems
associated to the repair. Many patients experience some degree of muscle weakness post-ACL
reconstruction (ACLR), especially weakness of the quadriceps muscles, which can limit their
functional ability<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Palmieri-Smith et
al.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> assessed the deficit in quadriceps
muscle strength between the reconstructed and non-injured knees in patients six months after
ACLR. They reported deficits in isokinetic quadriceps strength ranging between 24% and
40.5%. Several studies have suggested use of an accelerated progression of knee strength,
function and endurance following ACLR to improve outcomes<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.While most recent studies
have focused on the effects of postoperative rehabilitation protocols, only a few studies
exist that have studied about effects of preoperative exercise on post-ACLR outcomes<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Keays et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported on the beneficial effects of a 5-week home-based exercise
program for improving quadriceps strength and knee function early post-ACLR injury. Based on
available research evidence, if a preoperative program of exercise can restore muscle
strength and function before surgery, it could be of benefit to improve outcomes
post-surgery. Based on the study Eitzen et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> the preoperative quadriceps strengthening may be a significant
predictor of knee function two year after ACLR<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Preoperative deficits in quadriceps strength of greater than 20%
have been associated with significant persistent muscle weakness two years after ACLR.
However, there is still little evidence regarding the benefits of preoperative exercise on
improving postoperative knee weakness.</p><p>We hypothesized that a preoperative program of exercise would improve functional outcomes
post-ACLR. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the effects of a 4 week,
hospital-based preoperative program of exercise, focusing on quadriceps strengthening and
single-leg hop function, on after ACLR outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>A prospective, randomized, controlled study was initiated to evaluate the effectiveness of
a 4 weeks preoperative program of exercises on after ACLR knee strength and function.
Patients with ACL rupture were recruited from Samsung Medical Orthopedics Centers from April
2012 to August 2014. The inclusion criteria were men between the ages of 20 and 35&#x02005;years,
presenting with an isolated ACL rupture in the knee. The exclusion criteria were previous
ACLR or meniscus repair, injury to other ligaments in the same knee, and any associated
fractures. The 80 patients were randomly assigned into two groups, the preoperative exercise
group (PEG, n=40) and no preoperative exercise group (NPEG, n=40). The mean height and body
weight PEG were 173.8&#x000b1;5.6&#x02005;cm and 75.2&#x000b1;8.9&#x02005;kg; for the NPEG, they were 172.8&#x000b1;4.4&#x02005;cm and
74.31&#x000b1;9.77&#x02005;kg. There were no significant between-group differences in height and weight
between groups.</p><p>The PEG participated in a 4-week exercise program preoperatively and in a 12 week
postoperative program, while the NPEG only participated in the 12 weeks postoperative
program. Knee muscle strength and function were measured at 4 weeks before surgery and 3
months after surgery. All patients were supervised at least three times a week in a sports
medicine center.</p><p>The preoperative exercise program was based on known impairments associated with ACL
injuries, focused mainly on strengthening, functional balance, muscle control, and
co-contraction<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The exercise program
was adapted to patients&#x02019; specific condition and needs. The exercise program mainly focused
on lower limb strengthening, with particular attention paid to strengthening of the
quadriceps muscles. Prior to performing the main strength training program, subjects
completed 20 minutes of stationary cycling. After completion of the warm-up, subjects
proceeded to a series of lower-body strengthening exercises, short arc extension, wall
squat, leg press, isometric leg extension, and leg curls as well as other exercises (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>A summary of the Preop exercise program</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exercise category</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exercise</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Repetitions and sets</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cardio exercise</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stationary bike </td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20 min</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Range of motion exercise</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Seat flexion/extension</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="2" colspan="1">10 min</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Wall slides</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Strengthening exercise</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="3" style="padding-left:10pt" colspan="1">Open-chain strengthening</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Short arc extension </td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10&#x000d7;2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Straight leg raises</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10&#x000d7;2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Leg curl (isometric)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10&#x000d7;2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="3" style="padding-left:10pt" colspan="1">Close-chain strengthening</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Leg extension (ROM 30&#x02013;80&#x000b0;)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10&#x000d7;2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Leg press</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15&#x000d7;2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Half squat</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15&#x000d7;2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Balance/Proprioception</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Single-leg standing</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30 sec&#x000d7;3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Balance board</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30 sec&#x000d7;3</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>). Selected exercises reduced anterior shear force across the tibio-femoral
joint and, therefore, helped strengthen the muscles without risk of damaging intra-articular
structures of the knee. The postoperative exercise program was based on a combination of
evidence-based exercises identified from the scientific literature.</p><p>Immediately after ACLR, the limb was immobilized in a postoperative functional brace, and
patients were instructed to perform straight leg raising and quadriceps setting exercises.
Patients were allowed to undergo partially weight bearing at 2 weeks after their surgery and
to move through full-range of knee joint motion and perform closed chain exercise at 4 weeks
after surgery. All patients underwent assessment of knee extensor strength and distance on
single-leg hop 4 weeks prior to surgery and again at 3 months after surgery. Isokinetic
strength and endurance were measured using a CSMI isokinetic dynamometer (CSMI Medical
solution, Stoughton, MA, USA). Knee strength was measured through the range of 0 to 90&#x000b0; at
an angular speed of 60&#x000b0;/sec, with four repetitions completed at an angular speed of
180&#x000b0;/sec, with 20 repetitions completed to calculate average power<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The highest peak torque value for each velocity was
compared with the uninjured side and described as percent of strength deficit. For the
single-leg hop for test, the mean average distance was quantified by limb symmetry index
(LSI) using the following formula: (distance for injured leg/distance for uninjured leg) &#x000d7;

the knee extensor muscle strengthening on post-operative quadriceps muscle strength and knee
function. Outcomes confirmed the benefits of the PEG in significantly lowering
post-operative deficits in quadriceps strength and improving single-leg hop distance
compared to patients who did not participate in a preoperative exercise program.</p><p>Knee extensor strength deficit following ACLR is a common problem which has been reported
in previous studies<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a recent review of the literature, 11 studies
including research by Palmier-Smith et al.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, reported knee extensor muscle strength deficit, ranging between 24%
and 40.5%, 6 months after ACLR, while another 10 studies reported a residual, deficit in
quadriceps strength of 10% to 27%, 12 months after ACLR<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, long-term negative outcomes of strength deficits on
knee function for sports activities and even during daily activities. Thus, the recovery of
quadriceps muscles strength is one of the most important factors after ACLR<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recent studies have investigated the relationship between pre and postoperative quadriceps
muscle strength deficits and function. According Eitzen et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> reported patients with greater than 20% deficit in quadriceps
strength to have a significantly greater impairment on functional knee scores and strength.
Further, Shelbourne et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
the postoperative quadriceps muscle strength to be significantly higher in patients with
greater preoperative strength than in patients with poor preoperative strength. These
studies provide strong evidence that preoperative quadriceps muscle strength positively
affects postoperative muscle strength and function. Therefore, adequate and suitable program
of exercise before surgery would have an important role of improving post-operative muscle
strength. In our study, there was a significant difference in postoperative knee extensor
strength deficit between the NPEG and PEG groups, with a mean strength deficit of 36.5% for
the NPEG compared to 28.5%. Various functional tests were performed to evaluate knee
function after ACLR<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Restoration of muscle strength, which was measured by
performance on the single leg-hop distance test, is considered to be an important
determinant for a successful return to sports after ACLR<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The limb symmetry index
(LSI) has been the most frequently reported criterion for comparing muscle strength and hop
performance with the uninjured side<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Our study demonstrated that patients in the showed PEG significantly improved in the single
leg-hop distance compared to the NPEG. The results indicate that the greater improvements in
quadriceps strength in the PEG had a positive effect on knee function test, such as the
single-leg hop, compared to the NPEG. The result indicated that preoperative exercises not
only prevented quadriceps weakness, but also accelerated the recovery of muscle strength,
which helped patients to quickly adapt to the rehabilitation environment. It is also
anticipated that possible re-injury could be prevented by having better strength and
function.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Herrington</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Myer</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Horsley</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Task based rehabilitation protocol for elite athletes
