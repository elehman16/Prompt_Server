Studies have shown that the most commonly studied exercise protocol for frail older adults is the multimodal training. Interactive video games (IVGs) involve tasks in virtual environments that combine physical and cognitive demands in an attractive and challenging way. The aim of this study will be to evaluate the feasibility, safety, acceptability, and functional outcomes of playing Nintendo Wii Fit Plus<sup>TM</sup> (NWFP) for frail older adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">The study is a randomized controlled, parallel group, feasibility trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to the experimental group (EG) and control group (CG). The EG will participate in 14 training sessions, each lasting 50&#x000a0;min, twice a week. In each training session, the participants will play five games, with three attempts at each game. The first attempt will be performed with the assistance of a physical therapist to correct the movements and posture of the patients and subsequent attempts will be performed independently. Scores achieved in the games will be recorded. The participants will be evaluated by a blinded physical therapist at three moments: before and after intervention and 30&#x000a0;days after the end of the intervention (follow-up). We will assess the feasibility, acceptability, safety, and clinical outcomes (postural control, gait, cognition, quality of life, mood, and fear of falling).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Due to the deficiencies in multiple systems, studies have shown that multimodal interventions including motor-cognitive stimulation can improve the mobility of frail elderly adults. IVGs, among them the NWFP, are considered as a multimodal motor-cognitive intervention that can potentially improve motor and cognitive functions in the frail elderly. However, there is still no evidence in the literature that proves the feasibility, safety, acceptability, and functional outcomes of this intervention in frail elderly individuals.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/RBR-823rst/">RBR-823rst</ext-link>).

A recent systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], incorporating 31 studies of frailty in persons aged 65&#x000a0;years or older, found a prevalence of from 4.0 to 17.0% (mean 9.9%) of physical frailty, with a higher prevalence when psychosocial frailty was also included. Women (9.6%) were almost twice as likely as men (5.2%) to be frail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The prevalence of frailty is markedly increased in persons older than 80 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Frail older adults have a high risk of becoming dependent; however, with adequate intervention (mainly nutrition and physical exercise), frailty can be reversed to a robust state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] showed that the best strategy to reduce the number of falls, improve gait and balance, and increase muscle strength in frail elderly individuals is interventions based on combined exercises, such as resistance training, muscle strengthening, flexibility, balance and coordination training, and aerobic exercises.</p><p id="Par19">New types of intervention have been proposed as complementary tools for rehabilitation of the elderly, among them interactive video games (IVGs) that can optimize motor learning and neural plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. IVGs combine motor and cognitive tasks which are performed in a motivating and challenging virtual environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. IVGs stimulate complex and dynamic movements that are similar to the movements required in daily life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In addition, IVGs are inexpensive, fun, and can be used by patients who live in remote settings. Together, these factors can help to improve adhesion to and results of rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Among IVGs, Nintendo Wii Fit Plus&#x000ae; (NWFP) games have been considered as an inexpensive motor-cognitive intervention. The games are played using the Balance Board, a wireless platform that detects body oscillation through four sensors that identify the center of pressure of the player. A recent systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] investigated the effects of IVGs on balance of different populations, among them, elderly people. Twelve of the selected studies assessed the effects of the NWFP and showed that the NWFP was effective for improving balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">We performed an extensive search in the PubMed, Web of Science, and PEDro databases and found only one pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] which compared the effectiveness of the NWFP to improve mobility of pre-frail elderly people. The participants were randomized to one of three groups: (1) control, (2) seated exercise (traditional senior fitness program), or (3) NWFP group (basic games and addition of weight vest with 2% of their body weight every 2&#x000a0;weeks). The training of groups 2 and 3 was performed for 45&#x000a0;min, three times a week, for 15&#x000a0;weeks. There was improvement in physical functional status in the seated exercise and NWFP group compared to the control group. Despite the positive effects of the NWFP group, there were some methodological issues in this pilot study such as the absence of blindness of the subjects, therapists, and evaluators and the absence of the intention-to-treat analysis, since there was a dropout of 12 participants during the study. Furthermore, this pilot study did not assess the feasibility, safety, or acceptability of the NWFP for pre-frail elderly people. Finally, the participants of the NWFP group performed their training using a weight vest. The addition of weight certainly interfered in the intensity of the intervention with the games. In fact, the weight addition makes it difficult to infer whether the improvement occurred due to training with the games or the resistance of the weight vest.</p><p id="Par22">Despite evidence of the positive effects of IVGs on clinical outcomes of community dwelling elderly people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], it is not clear whether IVGs are feasible, safe, and acceptable for frail elderly people.

Direct access to source data/documents will be required for trial-related monitoring by authorized personnel only. Personal data collected during the trial will be handled and stored in accordance with the 1998 Data Protection Act. All paper and electronic data will be retained for at least 5&#x000a0;years after completion of the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p id="Par56">A detailed analysis plan will be prepared before all the data has been collected. Analyses will be conducted in Dell&#x02122; Statistica (version 13.0) using the principles of intention-to-treat. Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize the groups at baseline and present the feasibility outcomes. Although determining differences in clinical outcomes between the two groups is not the primary purpose of this trial, comparisons will be undertaken to investigate the feasibility of studying these outcomes and calculate estimates for the likely effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals. The effect size will be calculated in order to determine whether change can be detected over time using these outcome measures and to determine the most appropriate primary outcome. The focus of the results will be on the estimates of the treatment effects rather than statistical significance, and as such, no hypothesis testing will be undertaken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Differences between the two comparison groups will be presented in the form of an unadjusted mean difference for continuous outcomes with their associated 95% confidence intervals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Adverse events</title><p id="Par57">An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this intervention. Any adverse events will be reviewed by the study team, and likely causality will be assessed and reported on a form.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Auditing</title><p id="Par58">We will institute a rigorous program of quality control. The research sponsor in conjunction with the trial coordinator will be responsible for ensuring adherence to the trial protocols at the trial sites. Quality assurance checks will be undertaken by the University of Sao Paulo to ensure integrity of randomization, study entry procedures, and data collection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Protocol amendments</title><p id="Par59">Any modifications to the protocol which may impact on the conduct of the study, potential benefits to the patient, or may affect patient safety, including changes in study objectives, study design, patient population, sample sizes, study procedures, or significant administrative aspects will require a formal amendment to the protocol. Such amendments will be agreed upon by the Ethics Committee of the Medical School of the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, and the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials prior to implementation and notified to the health authorities in accordance with local regulations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Dissemination policies</title><p id="Par60">The dissemination will be to inform a wide range of local, national, and international audiences about the results and conclusions. It must, however, be remembered as part of this strategy that the current project is preliminary work aimed at informing a subsequent definitive clinical trial. We aim to publish our research in journals that cover the relevant medical specialties and with preference for those that deposit publications in open access databases to increase free dissemination. In addition, we aim to present this research at appropriate national and international conferences.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par61">The current study is designed to evaluate the feasibility, safety, acceptability, and functional outcomes of playing NWFP for frail older adults. This feasibility study is in preparation for a main trial that will go ahead if all feasibility criteria and hypothesis are met.</p><p id="Par62">Frailty affects functionality in different aspects, such as mobility, gait, balance, muscle strength, motor processing, cognition, nutrition, and physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Due to the deficiencies in multiple systems, studies have shown that multimodal interventions including motor-cognitive stimulation can improve the mobility of frail elderly adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. IVGs, among them the NWFP, are considered as a multimodal motor-cognitive intervention that can potentially improve motor and cognitive functions in the frail elderly. The NWFP can promote physical activity and improve balance, mobility, gait speed, muscle strength, flexibility, and functional abilities in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. However, there is still no evidence in the literature that proves the feasibility, safety, acceptability, and functional outcomes of this intervention in frail elderly adults. We speculate that due to the challenging stimulation to the postural control and cognitive systems, added to factors that can improve motor learning such as visual and auditory feedback and motivating environment, the NWFP will be feasible, safe, and acceptable and will promote clinical benefit in frail elderly adults.</p><sec id="Sec29"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par63">To date, we have recruited about 50% of the participants.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec30"><p>
