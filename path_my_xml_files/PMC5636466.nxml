Furthermore, it aims to explore the proportion of people receiving care, barriers to receiving care, and the long-term disability attributed to craniomaxillofacial diseases.</p><p><bold>METHODS:</bold> The Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical Need (SOSAS) instrument is a cluster randomized, cross sectional, country wide survey administered in Nepal, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Uganda from 2011 to 2014. The survey identifies demographic characteristics, etiology (e.g. burn / mass/ congenital deformity / trauma), timing of the disease, proportion seeking/receiving care, barriers to care, and disability.</p><p><bold>RESULTS:</bold> Across the four countries 13,763 individuals were surveyed with 1,413 diseases of head, face, mouth, and neck region identified. Rwanda reported the largest proportion of children (age &#x0003c; 6, 13.94%) and elders (age &#x0003e;64, 7.96%) with craniomaxillofacial diseases while Nepal had the greatest proportion of working aged individuals (age 15&#x02013;64, 73.2%) (p&#x0003c;.001). Across the four countries diseases of the head were the most common craniomaxillofacial region reported with masses (22.13%) and trauma (32.8%) as the most common etiology. Nepal reported the largest proportion of masses (40.22%) and Rwanda reported the largest amount of trauma (52.65%) (p&#x0003c;.001). Rwanda had the highest proportion of individuals seeking (89.6%) and receiving care (83.63%) while Sierra Leone reported the fewest (60% vs 47.77%, p&#x0003c;.001). Rwanda also had the highest proportion of individuals reporting disability from craniomaxillofacial disease while Nepal reported the highest proportion with no disability (43.68% vs 79.33%, p&#x0003c;.001).</p><p><bold>CONCLUSION:</bold> This study is the largest of its kind evaluating craniomaxillofacial diseases from a multi-country population based perspective. Despite similar country socioeconomic make up there was significant variability across the four countries in demographic, craniomaxillofacial disease type, patterns of care seeking/receiving, and disability. These findings demonstrate the substantial burden of craniomaxillofacial diseases across four low-income countries and represents a call for increasing plastic surgery training in these countries.</p><sec><title>Reference Citations:</title><p>1.
