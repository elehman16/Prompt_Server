However, in their seminal paper from 1958, Smith and Robinson reported that brace immobilization of the neck was not used for 1-level fusions and was reserved for multilevel procedures.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="bibr2-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr3-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The utility and necessity of postoperative cervical bracing may be questioned since the advent of anterior plating as a means of increasing stability and decreasing micromotion across a fusion segment, acting as an internal brace. Anterior plating has become widely adopted due to its association with higher fusion rates, lower rates of graft extrusion and subsidence, and improved outcomes regardless of number of fused levels.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="bibr5-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr6-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr7-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr8-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr9-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr10-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr11-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr12-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Despite the success of ACDF with anterior plating, pseudarthrosis and subsidence remain relevant complications, at least partially related to excessive motion about a fusion segment postoperatively, which is thought to be mitigated by use of postoperative rigid cervical orthoses.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="bibr14-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr15-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr16-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr17-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr18-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>The rigid cervical collar remains a common means by which to limit cervical motion postoperatively.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr20-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> By preventing excessive motion, the cervical collar may reduce the risk of complications such as graft subsidence and nonunion.

A flow diagram detailing the enrollment, allocation, follow-up, and analysis is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2192568217697318">Figure 1</xref>. A total of 50 patients were enrolled in the study. After obtaining signed consent, patients were randomized into treatment groups using a randomizing computer generator in a 1:1 ratio. The first 10 patients were assigned a random number between 1 and 10 without duplicate numbers, ensuring a 1:1 ratio. Even numbers were assigned to the brace cohort and odd numbers were assigned to the no-brace cohort. This process was repeated for each subsequent set of 10 cases. Twenty-five patients were allocated to the no-brace group and 25 patients to the brace group. Five patients were lost to follow-up (2 in the brace group and 3 in the no-brace group), and 1 additional patient in the brace group was excluded from analysis due to removal of painful hardware before final follow-up. All patients underwent anterior arthrodesis with a cortico-cancellous machined allograft (Puros-S2 Allograft, Zimmer, Warsaw, IN) and static anterior plating (Invizia Cervical Plating System, Zimmer, Warsaw, IN). The braced cohort was fitted with an appropriate size semirigid cervical orthosis for 6 weeks postoperatively (Miami J Cervical Orthosis, Ossur American, Foothill, CA).</p><fig id="fig1-2192568217697318" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow diagram of patient enrollment and allocation into each cohort.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2192568217697318-fig1"/></fig><p>Indications for operative treatment were radiculopathy or myelopathy that had failed a minimum of a 6-week course of nonoperative management.

The NDI score is reported as a numerical value out of 50 points. Radiographic outcomes included subsidence and fusion rates assessed at 6-month and 1-year follow-up, respectively. Subsidence was measured as the change in middle vertebral distance between initial postoperative films taken on postoperative day 1 and 6-month lateral cervical radiographs. All radiographs were standing films to most accurately assess subsidence and promote internal consistency. In brief, middle vertebral distance is defined as the distance from the middle of the superior endplate of the superior operative vertebrae to the middle of the inferior endplate of the inferior operative vertebrae. Subsidence was recorded and analyzed for each fused level individually in all radiographs, with the most cephalad level denoted as first level and the caudad level denoted as second level in 2-level procedures. Fusion was assessed by an independent, blinded neuroradiologist with computed tomography scan at 1-year postoperatively. Fusion was defined as marginal bridging trabeculae, from endplate to endplate, through or around the graft.</p></sec><sec id="section5-2192568217697318"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>IBM SPSS (Armonk, NY) was used to perform all statistical analyses.

Using a power analysis calculator with 9 points as our expected difference in the mean NDI scores with a standard deviation of 10, we estimated 19 subjects in each group, totaling 38. We had 22 subjects in each group at final follow-up, suggesting we had sufficient power. With respect to subsidence and fusion rates, the paucity of literature on subsidence in bracing, the different methods used to measure subsidence, and the wide range of fusion rates reported in the literature, subsidence and fusion rates were not incorporated into our power analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="section6-2192568217697318"><title>Results</title><sec id="section7-2192568217697318"><title>Patient Characteristics</title><p>A total of 44 patients were analyzed at final follow-up, 22 in the no-brace group and 22 in the brace group.

However, even prior to the advent and wide acceptance of anterior plating, much heterogeneity existed among surgeon utilization of cervical bracing. Smith and Robinson employed postoperative bracing only after multilevel fusions.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Other pioneers of the procedure, such as Cloward, used bracing routinely after all ACDFs, regardless of number of levels fused. However, even Cloward acknowledged in his 1958 study that his group abandoned routine use of bracing after the first several cases.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p><p>Limiting excessive motion across a fusion segment is one of the many ways surgeons can improve fusion rates and clinical outcomes. This basic concept first prompted surgeons to use cervical orthoses as a means of external immobilization. The advent of anterior plating in ACDF was fostered based on this principle as well. Anterior plating was implemented in ACDF to act as an internal brace, controlling for motion through a fusion segment by direct immobilization. This pivotal advancement in the field has been shown to increase fusion rates and improve clinical outcomes and has been widely validated throughout the literature.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="bibr5-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr6-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr7-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr8-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr9-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr10-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr11-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr12-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> As plating acts as a superior means of immobilization, it seems intuitive that anterior plating would have curtailed the use of cervical bracing. However, many surgeons still employ routine use of postoperative cervical bracing, largely due to the paucity of high-level literature directly comparing bracing versus not bracing after instrumented ACDF. According to a questionnaire study sampling spine surgeons attending the &#x0201c;Disorders of the Spine&#x0201d; conference (January 2008, Whistler, Canada), 63% of spine surgeons employed routine postoperative cervical bracing following ACDF.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> In this level II prospective randomized study, we sought to elicit any difference that may exist in radiographic and patient-reported outcomes after 1- and 2-level ACDF with or without a brace.</p><p>Along with a lack of clinical literature comparing braced versus non-braced patients, there is also a lack of biomechanical evidence that braces actually significantly limit motion in the cervical spine. Sandler et al<sup><xref rid="bibr28-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> reviewed 3 types of commonly used cervical braces and demonstrated that no collar restricted the motion of any of the subjects to less than 19&#x000b0; of flexion-extension, 46&#x000b0; of axial rotation, or 45&#x000b0; of lateral bending, and most subjects demonstrated significantly more motion. Additionally, Bell et al<sup><xref rid="bibr29-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> highlighted the challenges of correctly fitting commercially available braces and demonstrated that ill-fitting braces not only failed to limit excess motion but also contributed to morbidity postoperatively.</p><p>Our results showed no difference in radiographic fusion rates, graft subsidence measurements, NDI scores at final 1-year follow-up, or complication/reoperation rates among patients, braced or not, following 1- and 2-level ACDF. However, interval NDI scores at 2 weeks postoperatively were significantly lower in the no-brace cohort for combined 1- and 2-level procedures and at the 6-week time point for 2-level procedure. Given the potential effect of the 2-level procedure, as well as the older age, higher number of patients with diabetes, and higher preoperative NDI scores in the brace group, we conducted a stepwise multiple linear regression to determine if these variables had an effect on NDI scores at the 2- and 6-week postoperative time points. We found that at 2 weeks, preoperative NDI, wearing a brace, and younger age all had a statistically significant effect on worse NDI outcomes, and only preoperative NDI had a statistically significant effect on 6-week NDI score. Diabetes and 2-level procedures did not have a statistically significant effect on outcomes at any time point. The preoperative NDI score was 3.71 points higher in the brace group than the no-brace group, which contributes to the statistical difference seen at the 2-week time point for all levels. We would expect increased preoperative NDI score to lead to higher postoperative NDI score, but wearing a brace was also found to be a statistically significant predictor of higher NDI score by 8.94 points (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-2192568217697318">Table 5</xref>) at the 2-week postoperative time point. This may be related to discomfort from brace-wear about a fresh incisional wound or perhaps even related to subsequent neck stiffness from prolonged neck immobilization. Our results echo those reported by Campbell et al in their retrospective study evaluating single-level fusions.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> We therefore agree with their conclusion that bracing is not necessary after 1-level fusion, with further validity, and expand on these claims to include 2-level fusions via our prospective model.</p><p>Our results clarify the existing debate on the advantages and disadvantages of cervical collars. Some reports profess that the use of rigid cervical collars improves postoperative patient outcomes, while others echo our results and demonstrate no association with improved outcomes.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="bibr22-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr23-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Given our results and additional reports that have reported adverse safety events from using cervical collars, we advise against their routine use in postoperative care following cervical spine surgery.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bibr26-2192568217697318" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p>The results of this study may change the way spine surgeons manage patients postoperatively.

First, although the study was a prospective randomized trial by design, it was relatively low-powered. Additionally, as with any radiographic measurement, our subsidence measurements were calculated using computerized measuring tools, which may not account for radiographic magnification and/or artifact error. Finally, although all patients had similar demographic information, there was no means of truly objectifying host status, which plays a significant role in any spinal fusion procedure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section14-2192568217697318"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The use of routine postoperative cervical bracing following 1- and 2-level ACDF, though widely practiced, has little high-level evidence to support its use. The results of this prospective randomized controlled trial demonstrated no advantage to postoperative brace use as patients exhibited no difference in fusion rates, measurable subsidence, complications, or reported outcomes. Additionally, results of this study suggest braced patients have worse NDI scores at the 2-week postoperative time point.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors acknowledge the Cervical Spine Research Society for providing the Resident Fellow Grant to conduct this research.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="fn1-2192568217697318"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: SK has received personal fees from Globus Medical and Zimmer.
