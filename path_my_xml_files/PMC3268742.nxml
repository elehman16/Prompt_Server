After obtaining informed consent and collecting baseline data, we randomized patients (men and women age 40-79 with no prior history of cardiovascular disease) to either the intervention or usual care. We then saw them for two additional study visits over 3 months. For intervention participants, we administered the decision aid at the primary study visit (1 week after baseline visit) and then mailed 3 tailored adherence reminders at 2, 4, and 6 weeks. We assessed our outcomes (including the predicted likelihood of angina, myocardial infarction, and CHD death over 10 years (CHD risk) and self-reported adherence) between groups at 3 month follow-up.

However, these strategies are underused in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and have low rates of adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Multiple systematic evidence reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and a recent meta-review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] have demonstrated that many types of interventions yield small to moderate improvements in medication use and adherence. A common observation, however, is that efficacious interventions are resource-intensive. For instance, the most efficacious interventions for hypertension and cholesterol medication adherence include multiple telephone or in-person counseling sessions delivered by researchers, nurses, or pharmacists with or without the addition of other approaches, such as medication reminders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This led one recent systematic review to conclude that "[current adherence trials] provide little evidence that medication adherence can be improved consistently within the resources available in clinical practice." [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]</p><p>Given limited resources for counseling in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], alternatives to medication use and adherence counseling must be considered and tested. Two such options are decision aids and automated message libraries. Decision aids employ interactive media to convey health information, help patients clarify their values, and choose health options that are consistent with their values. Automated message libraries generate individually tailored messages that can be used to address specific patient barriers, provide skill building, and give information about ancillary resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Both have the potential to alleviate provider burden for counseling. However, their role in promoting medication initiation and adherence is largely untested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>This paper reports on the effects of an intervention designed to promote initiation and adherence to efficacious strategies for the primary prevention of CHD.

After collecting baseline data, study staff randomized participants to either the intervention or usual care, and then saw them for two additional study visits over 3 months. (See Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Biomedical Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved and monitored this study.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Study Flow Diagram</bold>.

The 1-hour education session encouraged physicians to 1) engage their patients in decisions about CHD prevention and 2) use readily available resources to support adherence. Prior to the education session, physicians gave written informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient Population</title><p>Patients were eligible to participate if they were presenting for routine care with an enrolled physician; were between the ages of 40-79 years; had no prior history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, or other serious medical condition that limited their life expectancy to less than 5 years; and were at moderate (6-10%) or high risk (&#x0003e; 10%) of CHD over 10 years based on a Framingham risk equation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Patients were excluded if they were presenting for their first visit, had no cholesterol check within the past 18 months, were unable to speak or read English, or had extreme elevations of systolic blood pressure (&#x0003e; 180 mmHg) or cholesterol (&#x0003e; 300 mg/dL).</p></sec><sec><title>Patient Recruitment and Enrollment</title><p>To recruit patients, study staff identified all age eligible patients returning for visits with enrolled physicians. After reviewing patients' charts, staff mailed recruitment letters to potentially eligible patients and made 3 attempts to call patients who did not "opt-out" of further contact by returning an opt-out postcard. When they reached patients by phone, staff reassessed eligibility and arranged a visit for interested patients.</p><p>Patients presented for their initial study visit at least one week prior to a regularly scheduled clinic visit with an enrolled physician. During this visit, patients provided written informed consent; filled out a baseline survey about their demographics, medication use, and plans and self-efficacy for risk reduction; and had their CHD risk factors assessed. Study staff used baseline risk factor assessments to recalculate baseline predicted CHD risk and assure study eligibility.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization and Blinding</title><p>Following enrollment, patients were randomized by study staff who accessed an online randomized schedule. Staff told patients only that they were participating in a study about "prevention of heart disease." Physicians were not blinded and saw patients in both the intervention and control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient-Directed Intervention</title><p>The patient-directed intervention consisted of two components: a computerized decision aid to promote initiation of effective CHD prevention strategies, and a series of automated mailed tailored messages to promote adherence. Intervention components were based on the Integrative Theory, Protection Motivation Theory, and Self-Determination Theory as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Further, they were designed at a 6-8th grade reading level and pre-tested using cognitive and usability testing.</p><sec><title>Decision Aid</title><p>The web-based decision aid, called Heart to Heart, had five main functions: it 1) calculated patients' overall risk of CHD events in the next 10 years using a continuous Framingham equation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]; 2) educated patients about CHD, their predicted global CHD risk, their risk factors, and the benefits and harms of the most effective risk-reducing strategies (aspirin, cholesterol medication, hypertension medication, and smoking cessation); 3) helped patients clarify their values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]; 4) encouraged them to choose risk-reducing strategies that would be acceptable and feasible to them for long-term CHD risk reduction; and 5) coached them to communicate their decisions with their physicians by providing audio clips about ways to overcome common communication barriers. Investigators pilot-tested a previous version of the decision aid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and studied its effects with and without the values clarification section [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The coaching portion has not been independently described or tested; a more detailed description is provided in Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Tailored Adherence Messages</title><p>The tailored messaging system helped patients circumvent self-identified barriers and gain the necessary resources and skills for adherence. This automated messaging system included a library of 76 unique messages, which could be combined in over a million combinations in response to a few brief survey questions. The basic logic of this tailoring is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; more detailed content is provided in Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>. In brief, messages were first tailored based on patients' intentions to start one or more of the most effective risk reducing strategies (e.g. take aspirin, cholesterol medication, hypertension medication, or stop smoking). For patients who planned to start risk reducing strategies, messages then addressed self-identified barriers to adherence, including cost; side effects; difficulty remembering to take medications; difficulty accessing care; and, for smokers, behavioral challenges in stopping smoking. For patients who did not plan to start risk reducing strategies, messages encouraged reconsideration of the need for global CHD risk reduction and addressed self-identified barriers to risk reduction. Based on the logic in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, each participant in the intervention group received a series of 3 computer-generated mailed tailored adherence newsletters.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Basic Logic and Structure of Tailored Messages</bold>.

Participants randomized to the intervention group presented 45 minutes early to their clinic visit to view the decision aid and received a list of their risk factors to get them started. They then self-entered their risk factors and navigated the decision aid on their own using a computer stationed in a private room in the clinic. They had access to research staff at all times for questions about navigation. After viewing the decision aid, participants proceeded to their clinic visit. Participants randomized to the control group did not receive a decision aid and proceeded directly to their clinic visit. Following the clinic visit, a research assistant administered surveys to both intervention and control patients to assess their plans for CHD risk reduction. She then mailed tailored adherence messages to participants in the intervention group approximately 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks after their initial study visit.</p><p>Approximately 3 months after the initial study visit, all participants presented for a final study visit and final measures.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><sec><title>Feasibility of Intervention Delivery</title><p>Investigators measured the feasibility of intervention delivery by measuring the total time participants spent with the decision aid, whether or not participants required assistance with the decision aid, and the time spent by the research assistant preparing and mailing tailored messages.</p></sec><sec><title>Change in Predicted Global CHD Risk</title><p>Investigators measured predicted global CHD risk (i.e. risk of angina, myocardial infarction (MI), and CHD death over 10 years) using a well-validated Framingham risk equation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], that combined information about a patients' age, gender, smoking history, diabetes status, systolic blood pressure level, total and HDL-cholesterol levels, and left ventricular hypertrophy status in a multivariate equation. Following a precedent set by other researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], the research team assumed that the benefits of medication are reasonably captured by entering revised risk factor data into the Framingham equation. Because the effect of aspirin use on CHD risk is not accounted for by the Framingham equation, the team additionally performed a priori-specified modeling of the effects of aspirin by applying a 28% risk reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] to the calculated CHD risk. This modeling mirrored the modeling of aspirin effects participants saw in the decision aid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. To be consistent with a more recent meta-analysis published during the study period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], the team also performed a sensitivity analysis, recalculating predicted global CHD risk using a 23% risk reduction for men and a 0% reduction for women. The team also performed sensitivity analyses to determine whether modeling the effects of each CHD risk reducing strategy (aspirin, blood pressure medicine, cholesterol medicine, and smoking cessation) on baseline CHD risk produced different results than recalculating risk as described above. For this analysis, the team multiplied baseline Framingham risk scores by a 28% relative risk reduction for aspirin users, a 25% relative risk reduction for blood pressure medicine users, a 30% relative risk reduction for cholesterol users, and a 50% relative risk reduction for those who stopped smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Modeling medicine effects may allow investigators to estimate the full benefits of medicines (including those which accrue outside changes in traditional CHD risk factors), however, modeling doesn't adequately account for variance in medicine adherence or the effects of other co-interventions (such as diet and exercise) that impact CHD risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Intent to Start Any Effective CHD Risk Reduction Strategy</title><p>The research team measured intent to start any effective risk reducing strategy after the primary study visit by asking participants whether or not they planned to initiate aspirin or smoking cessation or initiate or increase blood pressure or cholesterol medication.</p></sec><sec><title>Self-reported Adherence</title><p>Adherence was assessed at 3 months both by self-reported adherence to <underline>any </underline>new or escalated risk reduction strategy and by self-reported adherence to each individual strategy separately. To verify self-reported adherence, the team then examined changes in CHD biomarkers (including blood pressure and total and HDL cholesterol) among those who self-reported adherence.</p></sec><sec><title>CHD Risk Factors</title><p>Study staff measured CHD risk factors at baseline and follow-up study visits using well-defined protocols. They measured blood pressure using a non-invasive oscillometric automatic monitor (Omron HEM-907) after the patient had been seated for at least 5 minutes. They averaged three measurements taken at one minute intervals, and defined hypertension as a systolic measurement &#x0003e; 140 mm Hg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. They measured serum total and HDL cholesterol levels at the UNC Hospitals' McLendon Laboratory using enzymatic calorimetric testing (Roche Diagnostics Corporation) and defined high cholesterol as a total/HDL cholesterol ratio &#x0003e; 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Finally, staff measured smoking status by self-report with confirmation by urine dipstick using the NicAlert test strips (Jant Pharmacal; Encino, CA). A test strip measure of 3 or higher (cotinine concentration &#x0003e; 100 ng/mL) is a positive indication of tobacco use.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical Considerations</title><sec><title>Sample Size</title><p>Sample size was not based on hypothesis testing, but instead on a reasonable estimation of the sample size necessary to 1) assess the feasibility of the intervention, and 2) determine the effect sizes for the main effects of the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis Methods</title><p>All data analysis was performed using SAS (Cary, NC) software. To examine the effects of the intervention on primary and secondary efficacy outcomes, including predicted CHD risk, intent to start therapy, self-reported adherence to therapy, and changes in risk factors, investigators used mixed effects models. The study team used a logistic link function for binary outcome variables. They used linear mixed effects models for the continuous outcome variables. Each model included the intervention, education as fixed effects and physicians as random effects. Models on CHD risk factors additionally included baseline measures of the pertinent CHD risk factors as fixed effects.

The effect on predicted CHD risk was mediated, in part, by intent to reduce CHD risk and by self-reported adherence.</p><p>These findings are similar to those reported in previous studies of more resource-intensive interventions for CHD prevention. For instance, multiple systematic reviews have shown 10-25 absolute percentage point increases in adherence, with the largest effects in studies using multiple telephone or in-person counseling sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, a recent systematic evidence review found that global risk information, in repeated doses or with repeated counseling, reduced predicted CHD risk by 0.2 to 2 absolute percentage points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. What is noteworthy about this study is that it achieved its effects using a computerized decision aid and automated message library to perform the functions of education and counseling.</p><p>Also noteworthy about this study are the reported effects of the intervention on aspirin adherence. Given the risk based recommendations for aspirin therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and individuals' desire for inexpensive, familiar, trusted interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], it is not surprising that the intervention had its greatest effect on initiation of and adherence to aspirin.</p><p>What is somewhat surprising about this study is the apparent lack of effect of our intervention on cholesterol-lowering medication adherence. Not only are cholesterol guidelines risk-based, but a recent systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] found consistent reductions in total and LDL cholesterol in patients who received predicted CHD risk information and counseling. We suspect the lack of effect of the intervention on cholesterol is due in large part to the small number of participants (n = 20) choosing, initiating and adhering to cholesterol therapy, which limits the ability to detect any effect.</p><p>To better understand the effects of our intervention, investigators performed mediation analyses. These analyses suggest that both intent to reduce CHD risk and self-reported adherence to medications partially mediate reductions in 10-year predicted CHD risk. The proportional effects, however, are small (~20%), raising questions about other potential mediators such as diet and physical activity.</p><p>Interpretation of these findings should proceed with acknowledgement of the following limitations. First, this was a relatively small study not designed to look at subgroup effects. Subgroup analyses are small and underpowered, and should be used only for hypothesis generation. Second, physicians saw patients in both the intervention and control groups, which may have resulted in contamination between study groups. This may have reduced the effects of our intervention. Third, the effect of the intervention was diluted by the presence of participants (10%) who had no options for CHD risk reduction. Fourth, investigators measured adherence primarily by self-report (although with correlation with biomarkers). Based on studies comparing objective and subjective measures of adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], it is likely we slightly overestimated adherence. Fifth, although randomization is expected to result in equally distributed characteristics between the intervention and control groups, the difference in education between groups raises questions about unmeasured confounders. Sixth, the study team conducted this study in one academic medicine clinic, and results might not generalize to other clinics, physicians, or patient populations. Finally, this was a short-term study with only 3 months of follow-up; longer follow-up likely would affect results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Limitations aside, the results of this study preliminarily suggest that an adherence intervention employing a computerized decision aid and automated adherence messages can increase patients' adherence and reduce CHD risk. This result should be confirmed in larger and broader populations with longer term follow-up. Additionally, future studies should consider additional implementation issues, such as cost, cost-effectiveness, and alternate mechanisms of delivery (e.g. via electronic health record).</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SS conceived of the study and its design, participated in data analysis, and wrote the manuscript.
