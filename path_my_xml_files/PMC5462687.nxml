and function of patients with plantar fasciitis. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty-nine
subjects (age 15 to 59&#x02005;years old, 20 females and 9 males), randomly assigned into the two
groups (dry cupping therapy and electrical stimulation therapy groups), participated in
this study. The research design was a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Treatments were
provided to the subjects twice a week for 4 weeks. Outcome measurements included the
Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAS) (at rest, first in the morning, and with activities), the
Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM), the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS), as
well as the pressure pain threshold. [Results]The data indicated that both dry cupping
therapy and electrical stimulation therapy could reduce pain and increase function
significantly in the population tested, as all the 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) did not
include 0 except for the pressure pain threshold. There was no significant difference
between the dry cupping therapy and electrical stimulation groups in all the outcome
measurements. [Conclusion] These results support that both dry cupping therapy and
electrical stimulation therapy could reduce pain and increase function in the population
tested.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Pain</kwd><kwd>Function</kwd><kwd>Foot</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Adult heel pain is usually caused by plantar fasciitis<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, the most common foot
condition diagnosed and treated by healthcare providers<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The onset of pain is usually gradual and typically occurs at the
plantar medial heel<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Most patients
experience pain and tightness when taking their initial steps in the morning immediately
after standing up from bed or after a period of prolonged rest such as sitting at the desk
during the day<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The pain usually improves
after walking for a short period of time but could intensify after prolonged weight-bearing
activities, including standing, walking, or running. Plantar fasciitis affects millions of
Americans every or 10 percent of the population of the United States<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Economic costs
from third-party payers relating to the treatment of plantar fasciitis have been estimated
to range from $192 to $376 million per year<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The plantar fascia is a thick fibrous aponeurosis formed from 3 bands of dense connective
collagen fibers that attach proximally to the medial calcaneal tuberosity and fans distally
to the flexor tendon sheaths and the base of the proximal phalanges<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. This important structure provides the static and dynamic
supports for the arch of the foot by transmitting forces between the heel and forefoot
during weight-bearing activities. As the terminology of plantar fasciitis implies, plantar
fasciitis has traditionally been considered an inflammatory process. However, recent
findings suggest plantar fasciitis be a chronic degeneration causing marked thickening and
fibrosis of the plantar fascia along with collagen necrosis, chondroid metaplasia, and
calcification<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hence, it has been advocated that plantar fasciosism may be a more
appropriate terminology compared to plantar fasciitis<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. While the diagnosis of
plantar fasciitis is usually based on patient history, risk factors, and findings from
physical examination<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, because the chronic
degeneration healing mechanism is poorly understood, treatment of plantar fasciitis is often
difficult<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Little convincing evidence
is available to support various approaches for treating plantar fasciitis<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. For example, mobilization of ankle and foot
joint was recently found no more effective than stretching and ultrasound alone in treating
plantar fasciitis<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. For chronic
recalcitrant plantar fasciitis that lasts more than six months after conservative treatment,
surgery is recommended<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally,
recent evidence has demonstrated that dry needling can significantly reduce plantar heel
pain<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the revised Clinical
Practice Guidelines released by the Orthopaedic Section of the American Physical Therapy
Association (APTA) titled &#x0201c;Heel Pain&#x02014;Plantar Fasciitis: Revision 2014&#x0201d; states that &#x0201c;trigger
point dry needling cannot be recommended for individuals with heel pain/plantar
fasciitis&#x0201d;<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Cupping therapy has recently gained the attention of the media and the public at the Rio
Olympics, with extensive media coverage of the dark red circles left on Olympians&#x02019; shoulders
and backs, telltale signs of cupping therapy. Although cupping therapy has been performed in
most cultures historically<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, this manual modality is mostly believed to be an ancient
therapy primarily used in China and other Asian countries for thousands of years<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. This alternative therapy involves creating a vacuum inside a cup
positioned over the surface of the skin, using the local negative pressure to promote blood
flow<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. A few Systematic Reviews (SRs) of randomized clinical trials
(RCTs) have been conducted to determine the effectiveness of cupping therapy in treating
pain<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, hypertension<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>, and stroke<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. The total number of RCTs meeting the inclusion criteria of the SRs
were limited to determine the effectiveness<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The quality of most of the RCTs were poor<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Based on the currently available SRs, the effectiveness of cupping has been demonstrated
only as a treatment for pain<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Cupping therapy may be a low-cost alternative to treat plantar fasciitis. To our knowledge,
there is no research on the effectiveness of cupping therapy on pain and function for
patients with plantar fasciitis. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of
dry cupping, a type of cupping therapy, on pain and function of patients with plantar
fasciitis. The significance of this research project is that it may provide insight to
physical therapy management of plantar fasciitis, particularly with regards to cupping
therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty-nine subjects (age 15 to 59&#x02005;years old, 20 females and 9 males) were recruited
through a convenience sampling on the university campus using flyers posted on bulletin
boards around campus and word of mouth. Data for body weight and height for each subject
were not collected. The inclusion criteria included heel pain with a current or previous
diagnosis of plantar fasciitis from a physician or with patient history, risk factors, and
physical examination findings consistent with plantar fasciitis, and between 15 and 60&#x02005;years
of age. The exclusion criteria included contraindications to manual therapy or electrical
stimulation, including tumors, recent fractures (&#x0003c;6 months), rheumatoid arthritis,
prolonged history of steroid use, severe vascular disease, open wounds, recent surgery to
ankle joint or rear foot region (&#x0003c;6 months), impaired sensation, pacemaker, and implants;
inability to comply with treatment or the follow-up protocols; and currently undergoing
other treatments for heel pain. Ethics approval for this study was sought and obtained from
the Institutional Review Board at Youngstown State University. Written informed consent was
obtained from each subject.</p><p>The research design was a randomized controlled trial. Subjects were randomly assigned to
the dry cupping therapy (experimental) group (n=14, age 40.1 (SD 14.6) years old, 10 females
and 4 males) or the electrical stimulation therapy (control) group (n=15, age 39.3 (SD 13.5)
years old, 10 males and 5 females). There was no significant difference between the ages of
the two groups (p=0.36).</p><p>The sample size was determined using G*Power 3.1 (version 3.1.9.2) with the following
parameters: effective size of 0.5, alpha of 0.05, and power of 0.80. The total number of
subjects was calculated to be 22.</p><p>Treatments were provided to the subjects twice a week for 4 weeks. In the dry cupping
therapy group, a plastic cupping bell (Kangzhu 6-Cup Biomagnetic Chinese Cupping Therapy
Set, Model B1 &#x000d7; 6, Kangzhu, Beijing, China) was applied to the painful site for 10 minutes
in each session. A manual hand pump was used to create the vacuum for suction. The intensity
of the vacuum was based on subject tolerance. In the electrical stimulation therapy group,
the subjects were provided with electrical stimulation therapy, a therapeutic modality
routinely used by physical therapists for pain management, using a cabinet, multi-current
stimulator (Dynatron Solaris 709, Dynatronics, Salt Lake City, UT, USA). The electrodes were
placed around the painful site, and pre-modulated interferential current electrical
stimulation was conducted for 10 minutes. The intensity of the current was increased to
patient tolerance at the sensory level. The carrier frequencies were 4,000&#x02005;Hz and
4,000&#x02013;4,150&#x02005;Hz. The beat frequency was 80&#x02013;150&#x02005;Hz.</p><p>Outcome measurements included the Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAS) (at rest, first in the
morning, and with activities), the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM), the Lower
Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS), as well as the pressure pain threshold. Pressure pain
threshold was measured 3 times using a hand-held digital dynamometer (Lafayette Manual
Muscle Tester Model 01163, Lafayette Instrument Company, Lafayette, IN, USA) at the most
painful spot in the painful area. The subjects were instructed to report to the investigator
when they started to feel pain or discomfort while the investigator gradually increased the
force applied to the painful area through the dynamometer. A familiarization trial was
conducted for pressure pain threshold for each subject. The pressure pain threshold was
determined as the mean of the three trials. Outcomes were measured at baseline and at each
session for VAS or every other session for all other outcome measurements.</p><p>Changes in VAS, FAAM, LEFS, and pain threshold are reported as means and 95% confidence
intervals (lower, upper 95% confidence interval). Student t-tests were used to determine
whether there were statistically significant differences in the changes in the outcome
measurements between the experimental and control groups. Significance was determined at
&#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The data indicated that both dry cupping therapy and electrical stimulation therapy could

no statistically significant difference between the two groups (p=0.27). The mean changes in
patient perceived function were 12.3 (7.6, 17.0) % in the dry cupping therapy group compared
to 14.3 (5.5, 23.0) % in the electrical stimulation therapy group. There was no
statistically significant difference between the two groups (p=0.36).</p><p>For the LEFS, the mean changes in score were 19.6 (8.6, 30.7) % in the dry cupping therapy

therapy group. There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups
(p=0.19). All the within-group changes were significant except for the pain threshold, as
all the 95% CIs did not include 0 except for the pain threshold.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study on the effectiveness of dry cupping therapy on
the pain and function of patients with plantar fasciitis compared to electrical stimulation
therapy. A recent Systematical Review on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) identified that
cupping therapy, along with acupuncture and acupressure, could be efficacious in treating
pain and disability in patients with chronic neck pain or chronic low back pain<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, cupping therapy has been
used in treating various painful disorders<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>, including low back pain<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>,
neck and shoulder pain<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>, fibromyalgia<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>, knee osteoarthritis<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>, and carpal tunnel syndrome<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results from this study add plantar
fasciitis to the list. For all the outcome measurements, the cupping group did slightly
better than the control group, although no statistically significant difference was found
between the two groups. This research supports the integration of cupping therapy in
treating plantar fasciitis in physical therapy practice.</p><p>We found that dry cupping therapy and electrical stimulation therapy had a similar level of
effectiveness in decreasing pain and improving function in patients with plantar fasciitis.
Interestingly, the therapeutic mechanisms of dry cupping therapy may be different from that
of electrical stimulation therapy. Dry cupping therapy is believed to decrease pain by using
the local negative pressure to promoting blood flow while electrical stimulation therapy by
stimulating large-fiber sensory neurons and decreasing nociceptive inputs to central nervous
system through the mechanisms of the gate control theory.</p><p>Cupping therapy can be performed using several different techniques<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The two primary types are dry and wet cupping. Wet
cupping, also called bleeding cupping, involves controlled bleeding<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>, and hence may
be prohibited by the current physical therapy practice laws in the United States. Cupping
therapy can also be achieved using various subtypes of techniques, including retention,
moving, shaking, quick, and balance cupping<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. The vacuum required in cupping therapy for suction can be achieved
using fire-heated air, manual hand pump, or electrical pump<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. In our study, dry cupping with retention technique and manual
hand-pump was selected because it was easy to administer with relatively constant dosage and
does not require expensive equipment. However, it should be noted that wet cupping is the
most studied cupping technique in the literature, followed by dry (retained) cupping<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Institute of Medicine&#x02019;s Relieving Pain in America: a Blueprint for Transforming Prevention,
Care, Education, and Research calls for a culture transformation to better prevent, assess,
treat, and understand pain<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
Blueprint advocates that the clinicians should increasingly aim at tailoring pain care to
each person&#x02019;s experience, and self-management of pain by the patients should be promoted.
Dry cupping is an ancient healing art that is easy to learn and suitable for self-management
of pain. It does not require expensive equipment or a huge space to provide treatment for
the patient.</p><p>The limitations of the research project include convenience sampling and the small sample
size limited by our available resources. The convenience sampling significantly impacts the
generalizability of the results. The subjects were mostly young volunteers, and the sample
lacked diversity. In addition, double blindness was not possible to minimize subject and
investigator biases. Future rigorous research with a larger sample size from physical
therapy patients is necessary.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank DPT students Toby Gerez, Evan Wray, Joseph Osborn, and Adam Kaufman for
