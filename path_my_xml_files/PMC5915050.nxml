However, the administration of a restrictive volume of crystalloids could be more cost-effective and safe. This trial aimed to determine the effectiveness and safety of a restrictive regimen of crystalloids in patients during laparoscopic cholecystectomy by analyzing its cost-effectiveness and 1-year morbidity rate.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and methods</title><p>In this randomized, prospective study, patients were assigned to one of three groups based on the volume of fluid administered: the restrictive group received 1 mL/kg/hr, the low liberal group received 5 mL/kg/hr, and the high liberal group received 15 mL/kg/hr of Ringer&#x02019;s solution intraoperatively. There were 40 patients in each group. Each patient&#x02019;s hemodynamic parameters and laboratory values (arterial blood gas and lactate levels) were measured together with their consumption of crystalloids, volatile anesthetics, and analgesics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Analysis of the hemodynamic and laboratory parameters revealed no signs of global hypoperfusion in any of the groups analyzed. There was no significant difference in the duration of surgery and anesthesia, but the consumption of crystalloids, volatile anesthetics, and opioids was significantly lower in the restrictive group, compared with the low and high liberal groups. Although there was no significant difference in the 1-year morbidity among the groups, heart failure was observed in one patient in the high liberal group in the early postoperative period.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Restrictive fluid therapy during laparoscopic cholecystectomy is justified, safe, and more cost-effective than other options.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>cholecystectomy</kwd><kwd>laparoscopic</kwd><kwd>crystalloid solutions</kwd><kwd>fluid therapy</kwd><kwd>hemodynamics</kwd><kwd>cost&#x02013;benefit analysis</kwd><kwd>morbidity</kwd><kwd>mortality</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The maintenance of adequate tissue perfusion is the objective of intravenous fluid therapy.

It was cross-matched with the restrictive group. Patients allocated to the high liberal group received 15 mL/kg/hr of Ringer&#x02019;s solution intraoperatively. The survey was conducted in the operating room and at the Department of Abdominal Surgery, General Hospital Karlovac, Croatia. All 120 patients received 7.5 mg midazolam orally 30 minutes before surgery. In the recovery room, an intravenous line was placed in each patient and an infusion of isotonic Ringer&#x02019;s solution<xref rid="b7-tcrm-14-741" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> using Infusomat was started in accordance with the protocol.</p><p>Operations were conducted under general anesthesia. For co-induction of general anesthesia, 2.5 mg midazolam was intravenously administered to all patients to reduce the dose of other anesthetics and preserve hemodynamic stability. At 3 minutes after co-induction, anesthesia was induced by intravenous hypnotic thiopental at a dose of 5 mg/kg. For muscle relaxation, rocuronium bromide at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg was administered. After the induction of anesthesia, the patient was endotracheally intubated and mechanically ventilated by the anesthetic apparatus Avance CS2 (FIN-00031 GE; GE Healthcare, Finland). Anesthesia was maintained by a mixture of oxygen and air and the volatile anesthetic sevoflurane. For analgesia, opioid fentanyl in 2&#x02013;3 &#x000b5;g/kg doses was given during operation and, for postoperative analgesia, 25&#x02013;100 mg tramadol hydrochloride and 1.25&#x02013;2.5 g metamizole were given intravenously.

Descriptive statistics were used for presenting demographic and surgical data. Because of the abnormal distributions of laboratory values and hemodynamic variables, nonparametric tests were applied. Data were presented as a median and interquartile range from the 25th to 75th quartiles. Friedman&#x02019;s test and a post hoc Wilcoxon rank sum test were used to compare various time points within the same group. For the statistical comparison of data between the groups, a Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test and post hoc Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test were used. Chi-square test was used for comparison of critical outcomes, early postoperative surgical complications, and 1-year morbidity. The G*Power program (G*Power 3.1.9.2 Software 2014; University of D&#x000fc;sseldorf, D&#x000fc;sseldorf, Germany) was used to estimate sample size. A predictive sample size was calculated for the nonparametric Wilcoxon and Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests. The expected difference between the two means of the cardiac index was 0.85, and the SDs were 0.7 and 0.6. The total sample size was 78 respondents, and there were 39 respondents per group, with a two-sided confidence interval of 0.95 and a desired power of 0.90. Data were recorded in Excel (Microsoft Office Excel 2003; Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA). Statistical processing was carried out with SPSS 22 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). The results are presented in tables and graphs.

The 1-year mortality rate was 0% in all three groups, but there were some differences in morbidity. There were no statistically significant differences in early postoperative surgical complications, with one complication in each of the three groups. Postoperatively prolonged bile secretion by abdominal drainage was observed in the restrictive and high liberal groups without signs of inflammation, but with prolonged hospitalization (8 days in the restrictive group and 14 in the high liberal group). These were treated conservatively. Prolonged hospitalization of 15 days was observed in the low liberal group and was associated with inflammation; it was treated conservatively with antibiotics and resolved spontaneously. In addition, critical outcomes were observed, with one case of pulmonary congestion as a consequence of heart failure in the high liberal group in the early postoperative period as a direct consequence of the high volume load. Moreover, we analyzed the 1-year morbidity and found no statistically significant differences between the groups. In the restrictive group, we observed a case of acute pancreatitis with sepsis and another case of choledocholithiasis with obstructive jaundice, which was treated by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and sphincterotomy. In the low liberal group, an episode of heart failure was observed 4 months postoperatively and was determined to be unrelated to the surgery. The two cases of choledocholithiasis with obstructive jaundice were resolved by ERCP, sphincterotomy, and endobiliary stent implantation. In the high liberal group, we observed a case of bile reflux gastritis and another of stomach cancer 10 months after the cholecystectomy that required a subtotal gastrectomy. Furthermore, a single case of Klatskin tumor or hilar cholangiocarcinoma was observed in the high liberal group. Cholangiocarcinomas tend to grow slowly and infiltrate the walls of the ducts, growing along tissue planes. Local extension occurs into the liver, porta hepatis, and regional lymph nodes of the celiac and pancreaticoduodenal chains. Further, life-threatening infection (cholangitis) that requires immediate antibiotic intervention and aggressive biliary drainage may occur.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The major finding of this study was that global hemodynamics were preserved in the restrictive group, despite the negative intraoperative fluid balance, and there was no evidence of activated anaerobic metabolism. Moreover, global hemodynamics were preserved in the low and high liberal groups. MAP did not significantly change after inducing pneumoperitoneum in any group &#x02013; a finding that contrasts with the results of a previous study by Joris et al,<xref rid="b15-tcrm-14-741" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> in which the MAP increased after a pneumoperitoneum was created. The CI decreased after the induction of anesthesia and the creation of pneumoperitoneum in the restrictive and the low liberal groups, but it did not change in the high liberal group. The decreases in CI were likely the results of the reduced preload and the effects of pneumoperitoneum.<xref rid="b15-tcrm-14-741" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Pneumoperitoneum causes caval compression, an increase in venous resistance, and pooling of blood in the periphery of the circulatory system.<xref rid="b15-tcrm-14-741" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> SVI decreased after the induction of anesthesia, creation of pneumoperitoneum, and extubation within the restrictive and low liberal groups, whereas it significantly increased within the high liberal group. The volume load was larger in the high liberal group and, according to the Frank&#x02013;Starling law, there was, therefore, a greater stretching of the myocardium, resulting in larger end-diastolic volume and greater SVI.<xref rid="b16-tcrm-14-741" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The SVRI significantly increased after induction, creation of pneumoperitoneum, and extubation in the restrictive group, and after creation of the pneumoperitoneum in the low liberal group. The increase in SVRI can be attributed to a release of vasopressin and catecholamines.<xref rid="b17-tcrm-14-741" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In the high liberal group, SVRI did not significantly change after the pneumoperitoneum was created because the large volume load prevented a preload reduction after the creation of the pneumoperitoneum. According to Joris et al,<xref rid="b15-tcrm-14-741" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> hemodynamic changes induced by the pneumoperitoneum can be attenuated by increasing the cardiac filling pressures before peritoneal insufflation (by fluid loading and tilting the patient to the head-up position only after insufflation).</p><p>The effects of various doses of infusion solutions have been previously described, mostly in major abdominal operations.

These liberal volumes are intended to compensate the loss of fluid from injured tissue and the vascular space, thus maintaining hemodynamic stability.

We chose a continuous dose of crystalloids because the dose was adequate to compensate for the losses in the low and the high liberal groups without the need for additional fluid boluses. In the restrictive group, the dose of 1 mL/kg/hr was sufficient to compensate for losses from insensible perspiration and diuresis. We assumed that the surgical losses would be low enough that the postoperative infusions could compensate for them. In case of hypotension, we would administer the vasopressor ephedrine, which was required in four patients in the restrictive group. We have omitted additional fluid boluses in the restrictive group to provide equal conditions across all three groups (continuous dose of crystalloids). Cost-effective analyses of the anesthetic regimens and anesthetic consumption have become increasingly important in an attempt to reduce the costs of healthcare systems. A study by Smith et al<xref rid="b22-tcrm-14-741" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> compared the costs of inhalational anesthesia using sevoflurane with those of total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol, and balanced anesthesia induced with propofol and maintained with sevoflurane. The primary variable studied was the cost of the anesthetic drugs (including wastage) and disposable equipment. After re-evaluation of the data from that study based on the current prices of propofol at the institution where the research was conducted, TIVA was found to be significantly less expensive than inhalational or balanced anesthesia.<xref rid="b22-tcrm-14-741" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Vomiting occurred in 17% patients in the sevoflurane group and in none of the patients in the intravenous group; however, in the propofol plus sevoflurane group, 9% experienced vomiting.<xref rid="b22-tcrm-14-741" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The simplest method for determining the cost of a particular anesthetic is to simply calculate drug consumption, perhaps including drug wastage and the cost of disposable equipment.<xref rid="b23-tcrm-14-741" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In our study, we measured only the actual consumption of anesthetics and crystalloids but not drug wastage. Nausea and vomiting followed by incisional pain were found to be the most distressing factors for the postoperative patient and affect the cost necessary to ensure patient satisfaction.<xref rid="b23-tcrm-14-741" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Furthermore, they have an impact on the time spent in the recovery room and will, therefore, influence the personnel costs associated with the anesthetic.<xref rid="b23-tcrm-14-741" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Various studies have shown that intravenous techniques were associated with a significantly lower incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting as compared with the inhalational technique.<xref rid="b23-tcrm-14-741" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Intravenous anesthesia with propofol has been shown to result in a shorter period of sick leave than anesthesia with thiopental and isoflurane.<xref rid="b23-tcrm-14-741" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In our study, all groups received balanced anesthesia with thiopental and sevoflurane and analgesia with fentanyl, and we did not compare the cost-effectiveness of each form of anesthesia, but rather the consumption of anesthetics and crystalloids according to the various volumes of Ringer&#x02019;s solution. With regard to the 1-year postoperative morbidity, we would like to highlight a case of gastric carcinoma that occurred within a year of cholecystectomy. Kang et al&#x02019;s<xref rid="b24-tcrm-14-741" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> retrospective study mentioned that the possibly increased risk of stomach cancer in patients undergoing gallstone cholecystectomy might be due to a duodenogastric bile reflux, and that the survival of these patients was poor.<xref rid="b24-tcrm-14-741" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Therefore, close follow-up strategies for early detection are recommended for such patients.<xref rid="b24-tcrm-14-741" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Despite the zero mortality rate in our study, the predictive mortality calculated by the SAPS II score was significantly higher in the high liberal group than in the restrictive group, and both cases of carcinoma (gastric and cholangiocarcinoma) were observed in that group. The incidence of gastric and cholangiocarcinoma in patients in the high liberal group could not be explained by hypervolemia, and it seems that this observation is the result of additional cofactors such as multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations in oncogenes, impairment of DNA repair and tumor suppressor genes, or dysregulation of cell-cycle regulators or signaling molecules that can, at least partially, be induced by the pro-inflammatory response caused by surgery and anesthesia in susceptible patients.<xref rid="b25-tcrm-14-741" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b26-tcrm-14-741" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>There are some limitations to this study.
