Patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest display evidence of endothelial injury and coagulopathy (hypocoagulability, hyperfibrinolysis), which in associated with poor outcome. Recent randomized controlled trials have revealed that treatment with infusion of prostacyclin reduces endothelial damage after major surgery and AMI. Thus, a study is pertinent to investigate if prostacyclin infusion as a therapeutic intervention reduces endothelial damage without compromising, or even improving, the hemostatic competence in resuscitated cardiac arrest patients. Post-cardiac arrest patients frequently have a need for vasopressor therapy (catecholamines) to achieve the guideline-supported blood pressure goals. To evaluate a possible catecholamine interaction with the primary endpoints of this study, included patients will be randomized into two different blood pressure goals within guideline-recommended targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind investigator-initiated pilot trial in 40 out-of-hospital-cardiac-arrest (OHCA) patients will be conducted. Patients will be randomly assigned to either the active treatment group (48&#x000a0;hours of active study drug (iloprost, 1&#x000a0;ng/kg/min) or to the control group [placebo (saline) infusion]. Target mean blood pressure levels will be allocated 1:1 to 65&#x000a0;mmHg or approximately 75&#x000a0;mmHg, which gives four different permutations, namely: (i) iloprost/65 mHg, (ii) iloprost/75&#x000a0;mmHg, (iii) placebo/65&#x000a0;mmHg, and (iv) placebo/75&#x000a0;mmHg. All randomized patients will be treated in accordance with state-of-the art therapy including targeted temperature management.</p><p>The primary endpoint of this study is change in biomarkers indicative of endothelial activation and damage, [soluble thrombomodulin (sTM), sE-selectin, syndecan-1, soluble vascular endothelial growth factor (sVEGF), nucleosomes] and sympathoadrenal over activation (epinephrine/norepinephrine) from baseline to 48&#x000a0;hours post-randomization.</p><p>The secondary endpoints of this trial will include: (1) the hemostatic profile [change in functional hemostatic blood test (thrombelastography (TEG) and whole blood platelet aggregometry (multiplate)) blood cell and endothelial cell-derived microparticles]; (2) feasibility of blood pressure target intervention (target 90&#x000a0;%); (3) interaction of primary endpoints and blood pressure target; (4) levels of neuron-specific enolase at 48&#x000a0;hours post-inclusion according to blood pressure targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The ENDO-RCA study is a pilot study trial that investigates safety and efficacy of low-dose infusion of prostacyclin administration as compared to standard therapy in post-cardiac arrest syndrome patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Trial registration at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02685618?term=NCT02685618&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02685618</ext-link>) on 18 February 2016.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA)</kwd><kwd>Endothelial dysfunction</kwd><kwd>Prostacyclin</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007405</institution-id><institution>Hjerteforeningen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004954</institution-id><institution>Augustinus Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Region Hovedstaden Forsknings Fond(DK)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Despite efforts during the last decades to optimize cardiac arrest resuscitation techniques and post-cardiac arrest care, mortality rates are still high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Survival to discharge rates from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) varies among studies and regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and was reported in a recent systematic review to be 2, 6, 9 and 11 percent respectively for Asia, North America, Europe and Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] with half of cardiac arrest survivors suffering from cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The high mortality rate of patients with initial return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is in part due to a specific pathophysiologic process known as the <italic>post</italic>-<italic>cardiac arrest syndrome</italic> (PCAS). This term describes a global ischemia-reperfusion injury in response to whole-body ischemia following successful resuscitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. On a pathophysiologic level, the ischemia-reperfusion injuries associated with PCAS involve microcirculatory dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], vascular leakage with ensuing edema, and an increase in platelet and leukocyte adhesion to the activated/injured endothelium. The consequence of these injuries to the endothelium results in a sepsis-like inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] that ultimately determines patients&#x02019; outcome.</p><p>Patients suffering from acute critical illness display evidence of excessive sympathoadrenal activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and there is emerging evidence that the normal &#x0201c;fight-or-flight&#x0201d; response may become maladaptive and induce organ damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Thus, increasing levels of endogenous catecholamines induce widespread dose-dependent effects on the vascular system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In high concentrations catecholamines directly damage the endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and promote hypocoagulability and hyperfibrinolysis in the blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. It is hypothesized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] that the progressive hypocoagulability and hyperfibrinolysis observed in critically ill patients reflects an evolutionary adapted response aiming at keeping the microvasculature open in conditions with low flow, and inferred that the catecholamine surge, through its opposite directed effects on the endothelium and blood, is a critical driver of this response (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>A systems biology perspective on vascular homeostasis in critical illness. Schematic illustration of the changes in the vascular system (circulating blood, vascular endothelium) with increasing disease (ischemia-reperfusion, trauma, sepsis, etc.) severity and sympathoadrenal activation (circulating catecholamines) evaluated by plasma-based (APTT, INR, PT) and functional whole blood-based (TEG) coagulation tests. Progressive endothelial activation and damage is accompanied by concurrent progressive hypocoagulability in the circulating blood. We infer (Johansson and Ostrowski) that the circulating catecholamine level dose-dependently promotes a switch from hyper- to hypocoagulability and hyperfibrinolysis in the blood to keep the progressively more procoagulant microvasculature open. From Johansson &#x00026; Ostrowski [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2016_1477_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>This hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] was investigated in three different types of patients characterized by acute critical illness. The outcome of these studies displayed strong and independent associations between circulating levels of catecholamines and biomarkers of endothelial activation and damage and outcome in trauma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Several studies provide evidence of endothelial damage after successful cardiac arrest resuscitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and the specific biomarkers investigated as endpoints for endothelial damage and sympathoadrenal activation in this study has recently been related to patient outcome in OHCA patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In alignment with the hypothesis described, it has been reported that patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest display evidence of coagulopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and endothelial injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Current state-of-the art therapy for OHCA includes general organ support and targeted temperature management for up to 24&#x000a0;hours after admission in unconscious patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Therapeutic interventions directed toward the damaged endothelium may improve outcome for patients with PCAS. Prostacyclin (prostaglandin I<sub>2</sub>, PGI<sub>2</sub>) is an endogenous prostanoid which is formed and released by endothelial cells with antiplatelet, vasodilatory and cytoprotective properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Accordingly, prostacyclin is expected to be beneficial by protecting and deactivating the endothelium and by restoring vascular integrity in patients suffering from endothelial breakdown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p>Prostacyclin is currently used for the treatment of critically ill patients with pulmonary hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and critical limb ischemia due to its vasodilatory properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Former studies with critically ill patients that received prostacyclin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] showed results reflecting a stabilizing effect on the endothelium and hemostasis measured by endothelial biomarkers and viscoelastic hemostatic assays. These studies provide the rationale for the hypothesis that prostacyclin may be beneficial as an endothelial rescue treatment in patients suffering from endothelial breakdown such as after resuscitated cardiac arrest (RCA). From a safety point of view, the low-dose infusion of prostacyclin selected for this trial is lower than the recommended dose for approved indications. The dosage chosen for the current trial has previously been utilized without reported significant adverse side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>Systemic blood pressure is part of the goals in most post-cardiac arrest care protocols. Blood pressure goals have not been specifically studied and the level of evidence is generally low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The recent update of the American Heart Association continues to emphasize the necessity of standardized goal-directed care but also acknowledges that existing protocols include blood pressure targets varying from 65&#x000a0;mmHg to as high as 80&#x000a0;mmHg in mean arterial pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Studies have found a significant prevalence of impaired cerebral autoregulation post cardiac arrest, and that some patients may need significantly higher perfusion pressure to maintain cerebral blood flow post cardiac arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The recent guideline however recommends a target blood pressure on 65&#x000a0;mmHg and the use of catecholamines to achieve this pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Blood pressure and exogeneous catecholamines may consequently influence the effect of prostacyclin analogue (iloprost) on the endothelium.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aim</title><p>This pilot study aims to investigate (1) the relationship between the stress response and endothelial damage, (2) if prostacyclin treatment reduces endothelial damage (and organ failure) in RCA patients, (3) the effect of prostacyclin treatment on hemostasis, and (4) if blood pressure target (65&#x000a0;mmHg or 75&#x000a0;mmHg) during the intensive care unit (ICU) stay will influence the endothelial response to the study drug and levels of neuron-specific enolasis at 48&#x000a0;hours.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p>This is a single-center, randomized (1:1, active:placebo), placebo-controlled, double-blind investigator-initiated pilot study in 40 out-of-hospital-cardiac-arrest (OHCA) patients investigating iloprost safety and efficacy. Furthermore, the impact of exogenous catecholamines and blood pressure targets is investigated by randomization of target blood pressures to 65&#x000a0;mmHg and approximately 75&#x000a0;mmHg. Blood pressure levels will be allocated 1:1 in a 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 factorial design, providing four different permutations: (i) iloprost/65 mHg, (ii) iloprost/75&#x000a0;mmHg, (iii) placebo/65&#x000a0;mmHg, and (iv) placebo/75&#x000a0;mmHg with ten patients in each group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Withdrawal</title><p>Participation in the ENDO-RCA trial is voluntary. Patients, relatives or scientific guardians are free to discontinue the trial at any time. The treating physician can discontinue patient participation in the trial if the physician suspects that participation affects the patient&#x02019;s safety. If there is medical reason for the withdrawal, the patient should be followed medically until the condition has stabilized or terminated. The reason for withdrawal should be recorded in the patient&#x02019;s case report form (CRF).</p><p>If consent for patient participation is declined by the patients&#x02019; next of kin, the patients&#x02019; general practitioner or the patient him/herself, blood samples will be destroyed according to laboratory standard operating procedure. Collected data, laboratory notes, and sample analysis results will be deleted. If consent is declined during study drug administration, the drug-infusion will be terminated. In case a patient or next of kin make a withdrawal of consent, the party will be asked for permission to use data obtained prior to withdrawal and to obtain data for the primary outcome measure. If this is achieved, the patient will be included in the final analyses. If the patient declines, all data from that patient will be destroyed. All patients who withdraw from the trial for any reason and at any time should have an end-of-trial examination. Patients will be examined for any status changes that require further follow-up. All withdrawn patients will be followed up as the remaining patients in the trial.

Interventions are considered emergency procedures and study drug infusion should be commenced as soon as possible after sustained ROSC, screening and randomization. Patients with active treatment will receive a low-dose prostacyclin infusion whilst the placebo group receives a dummy saline infusion for 48&#x000a0;hour in a total of 40 patients.

Patients in the placebo group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20 patients) will receive dummy saline infusion at a volume comparable to active treatment and will otherwise be treated exactly as active patients. This dosing regimen was chosen since intravenous doses of prostacyclin 0.5&#x02013;2.0&#x000a0;ng/kg/min have been reported to be successful at achieving endothelial modulating/preserving effect with no significant hemodynamic or platelet aggregation complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].

We expect no loss to follow-up in hospital, provided that this pilot study takes place in a hospital setting where the majority of the outcomes will be evaluated. After discharge from the hospital, attrition bias will be avoided by following measures: family member contact information will be requested in case patient contact is unattainable or if the patient is incapacitated to provide information; the study coordinator will have continuous contact with the patient and family member during the ICU stay and at the time of ICU discharge to emphasize following contact (30, 90 and 180&#x000a0;days); the patient and family member will be notified of upcoming interviews in writing; public records will be utilized to acquire survival status on patients lost to follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Endpoints</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>The primary objective of this pilot study is safety and efficacy of low-dose iloprost administration in addition to standard therapy, as compared to standard therapy alone, in post-cardiac arrest syndrome patients.

Blood pressure levels will be allocated 1:1 in a 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 factorial design, providing four different permutations: (i) iloprost/65 mHg, (ii) iloprost/75&#x000a0;mmHg, (iii) placebo/65&#x000a0;mmHg, and (iv) placebo/75&#x000a0;mmHg with ten patients in each of the four groups.</p><p>The number of patients participating is based on a power calculation. The calculation is based on data collected in a randomized study performed by Johansson et al. (manuscript in preparation), investigating the effect of prostacyclin infusion (1&#x000a0;ng/kg/min) on hemostasis and the endothelium in patients undergoing Whipple surgery. The primary biomarker of interest is thrombomodulin, which is used for the power calculation: the increase in circulating thrombomodulin differed significantly among the active ((mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD) 0.53&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.52&#x000a0;ng/ml) and placebo (2.14&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.19&#x000a0;ng/ml) group post-surgery (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.046).

Twenty patients will be included in each group. All patients that receive low-dose prostacyclin infusion will be included. A total 40 patients will be recruited in a 1:1 ratio active:placebo. Patients who drop out or are withdrawn for any reason before day 4 will be replaced.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>This is a pilot trial and thus all statistical tests should be considered to be exploratory. Descriptive statistics will be calculated for all endpoints. All summary statistics of continuous variables will include: n, mean with standard deviation, median with min/max and interquartile ranges. All summary statistics of frequency tables will include n, % and N, where N is the total number of patients recorded values in the corresponding group. The difference between treatment groups for continuous data will be evaluated using analysis of variance (mixed model) followed by post hoc pair-wise comparisons of means. Furthermore, delta values (numerical change in variables between time points) within and between groups will be compared by paired (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and non-paired (Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test) nonparametric tests. The difference between treatment groups for categorical data will be evaluated using McNemar&#x02019;s test (change over time), frequency tables and chi-square statistics. The difference between treatment groups for continuous data will be evaluated using analysis of variance (mixed model) followed by post hoc pair-wise comparisons of means. Nonparametric tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, will be used if the assumption of normality is not fulfilled. Mortality will be evaluated applying survival statistics, i.e., Kaplan Meier plots and log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards models. Data will be tabled and summarized descriptively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Pilot study</title><p>ENDO-RCA is a comprehensive exploratory framework that investigates the possible beneficial role of prostacyclin on endothelial integrity in patients suffering post-cardiac arrest syndrome. Several studies in the OHCA population have been successfully conducted at the trial site (ICU at the Department of Cardiology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen) and the timeline for patient enrollment is anticipated to extend over 6&#x000a0;months. This pilot study has no planned interim analyses and the trial will not be extended. The results from ENDO-RCA, if positive, will form a basis for grant applications from the European Commission (HORIZON 2020) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) enabling large-scale multicenter randomized clinical trials.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Discussion</title><p>The continuously low survival-to-discharge rates after cardiac arrest necessitates further exploration of resuscitation techniques and post-cardiac arrest care. This study will attempt to address and target the harmful effects of systemic ischemia and reperfusion in patients with PCAS.</p><p>The excessive sympathoadrenal activation presented by critically ill patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] is hypothesized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] to be a critical driver of endothelial damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], progressive hypocoagulability and hyperfibrinolysis in the vascular system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The stress response in critically ill patients has been linked to the development of endothelial damage and coagulopathy in three patient groups (trauma patients, AMI patients and severe sepsis and septic shock patients) of which all revealed strong and independent associations between circulating levels of catecholamines and biomarkers of endothelial activation and damage and outcome, demonstrating that patients presenting with severe endothelial dysfunction suffer from higher mortality rates as compared to patients without endothelial complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Prostacyclin infusion is expected to be beneficial for PCAS patients by protecting and deactivating the endothelium and by restoring vascular integrity in patients suffering from endothelial breakdown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In a study of critically ill patients needing renal replacement therapy, patients receiving prostacyclin as anticoagulant in the dialysis filter had lower mortality than patients receiving heparin as anticoagulant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The results were speculated to be due to a spillover effect of prostacyclin to the systemic circulation, reflecting a stabilizing effect on the endothelium. As a continuation of this finding, a randomized controlled pilot study was performed in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The study showed that patients randomized to receive infusion of low-dose (1&#x000a0;ng/kg/min) prostacyclin after coronary stenting improved endothelial functionality evidenced by lower levels of the soluble endothelial biomarker sE-selectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Finally, a randomized controlled pilot study performed on patients with pancreatic cancer undergoing Whipple surgery, known to experience capillary leakage due to endothelial disintegration, patients allocated to infusion of low-dose prostacyclin presented significantly improved endothelial integrity again as evaluated by lower sE-selectin as compared to patients receiving placebo (Johansson PI. Clinical trial ET-abdominal, manuscript in preparation). This body of evidence indicates that low-dose intravenous prostacyclin may be beneficial as an endothelial rescue treatment in patients suffering from endothelial breakdown. The low-dose infusion of prostacyclin selected for this trial (1.0&#x000a0;ng/kg/min) is five- to tenfold higher than the normal endogenous prostacyclin production. However, the dose is lower than the recommended dose for approved indications and has been reported to be without significant adverse side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>Post-cardiac arrest patients most often have a need for vasopressor infusions (catecholamines) to achieve the guideline supported goal of mean arterial artery pressure of approximately 65&#x000a0;mmHg. Subsequently a possible interaction with the primary endpoints may exist. This will be evaluated by targeting two different goals (65&#x000a0;mmHg or approximately 75&#x000a0;mmHg) within the interval of blood pressure goals supported by the recent guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p>This study will target high-risk critically ill patients, suffering global ischemia-reperfusion injury, with likelihood to derive benefit from the immediate intervention of low-dose prostacyclin infusion. The included patient group provides a pertinent background to investigate circulating catecholamines, endothelial damage and coagulopathy in low/ceased blood flow and the protective and stabilizing effects of prostacyclin on the endothelium.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Trial status</title><p>Inclusion of patients is scheduled to commence February 2016 and expected to be completed by September 2016.
