respiratory functions of stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods] This study was performed
with 25 stroke patients. The subjects were divided into the control group (n=12) which did
not perform upper arm training and the experimental group (n=13) which conducted upper arm
training. Forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in the first second, both of
which are used in this study, are well-known indicators of respiratory capabilities. Peak
cough flow is used to indicate cough capability. [Results] Concerning changes in forced
vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in the first second and the peak cough flow of
each group after the exercise, while the control group did not show significant
differences, the experimental group showed statistically significant increases.
[Conclusion] The results of the study indicate that exercise programs that increase the
mobility of upper limbs and increase muscular strength have the effect of normalizing
vertebral alignment for stroke patients, and thus can provide effective interventions for
improving respiratory function.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Upper limb exercise</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Respiratory function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke causes sensory deficits, changes in muscular tension, and lack of physical
activity<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. These damaging effects lead
to biomechanical changes in respiration<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>,
which are due to the weakening of the respiratory muscles of the affected side,
inappropriate diaphragmatic action, and the movement of the intercostal muscles<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. All of these factors can reduce the total
lung capacity and vital capacity of stroke patients<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Training of respiratory muscles, such as inspiratory muscles, has commonly been conducted
to improve the respiratory function of stroke patients<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, respiration is closely related to the upper limbs, because
in order to breathe, the movement of the trunk is necessary, which in turn is related to the
movement of the upper limbs. It has been reported that the coordination of the trunk can
prevent compensation movements of the upper limbs in stroke patients, indicating that the
movement of the upper limbs is closely linked to the movement of the trunk<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. It can then be inferred that stroke
patients may experience difficulties with trunk movements due to issues in the movement of
the upper limb on the affected side, which can undermine respiratory functions.</p><p>Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effects of these exercises on the respiratory
functions of stroke patients by having them perform upper-limb exercises and measuring their
respiratory functions after the exercise.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were stroke patients hospitalized in the H Rehabilitation
Hospital in Daegu, South Korea. Experiments were conducted from August to October, 2015,
with patients who understood the motives of the study and agreed to participate. The
subjects consisted of 25 patients with no medical history of respiratory diseases, no signs
of lung disease observed in radioactive and physical examinations, and no serious cognitive
impairments (over 24 points on the MMSE-K), such as aphasia or dementia, which could hinder
the experiment. A physiotherapist who was blinded from the assessment entered all the
demographic data into a computer program designed for stratified randomization. The
stratification performed before randomization was based on gender (male and female) and side
of hemiplegia (left and right). By way of random assignment, the subjects were divided into
the control group (CG, n=12), which did not perform upper arm training and the experimental
group (UATG, n=13), which conducted upper arm training. The study subjects provided written
informed consent prior to participation, according to the ethical standards of the
Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The interventions were conducted five days a week for a four week period. The two groups
received the same physiotherapy they had already received, consisting of 30 minutes of
exercise, 15 minutes of rehabilitation ergometer, and 15 minutes of functional electrical
stimulation. The UATG group underwent 30 minutes of upper arm training in addition to the
physiotherapy.</p><p>For the upper arm training, the program used by Volpe et al. was revised and applied to
improve muscular strength and the range of movement of the upper limb on the affected
side<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The program consisted of three
elements, namely, active assisted arm exercise, static stretching, and a goal-directed
planar reaching task. First, the active assisted arm exercise was performed, which included
flexion of the glenohumeral joint and strengthening of the muscles near the scapula. During
flexion of the glenohumeral joint, the patient was seated comfortably on the side of an
adjustable table while the therapist led the exercise to maintain an upright trunk
positioning, prevent compensatory trunk movements, and minimize the increase of abnormal
muscle tone. The angle of the glenohumeral joint flexion did not exceed 90 degrees so as not
to cause pain. With the patient sitting on the edge of a mat, the training included three
sessions (10 repetitions per session) for 10 minutes. Between sessions, the patient was
given 30 seconds of rest. Exercises for strengthening the muscles near the scapula were
conducted for 10 minutes. Scapular elevation was performed in five concentric and five
isometric movements, followed by 30 seconds of rest. After that, depression, retraction, and
protraction were performed in the same manner in five concentric and five isometric
movements. Then, the second program, the static stretching of the adductor, internal
rotator, and elbow flexors, was conducted for five minutes. While lying straight, the
patient performed 90 degrees of glenohumeral joint abduction with the elbow in full
extension. As for glenohumeral joint abduction, lateral rotation was performed to the extent
that it did not cause pain. Lastly, the third program, goal directed movements using a skate
board system, was conducted for five minutes. The patient placed his/her forearm on a skate
board that had almost zero friction with the table while performing 35 degrees of shoulder
flexion. Then, the patient makes a motion as if drawing the number eight, and moves left and
right, and forward and backward.</p><p>The pulmonary function calculator (Micro Medical Ltd., UK) of the Micro Spirometer (Micro
Medical Ltd., UK) was used to measure respiratory function. With the patient seated on a
treatment table with adjustable height, the forced vital capacity (FVC) and the forced
expiratory volume at one second (FEV1) were measured. The FVC is defined as the amount of
air that the patient breathes out as quickly as possible after breathing in as much air as
possible. The FEV1 is defined as the amount of air that the patient breathes out as quickly
as possible for one second after breathing in as much air as possible. As for cough
function, the peak cough flow (PCF) was measured using a Peck flow meter (Cardinal Health
232 Ltd., UK). The patient was put in the same position as when lung function was measured.
Measurement was taken after the patient had breathed in as much air as possible and coughed
out as vigorously as possible.</p><p>The paired t-test was conducted to compare changes in the values of respiratory function
and cough function according to the period of each group. To test the statistical
significance, the level of significance was set at 0.05. The results of the experiment are
presented in terms of average and standard deviation. The findings were statistically
analyzed with PASW 18.0 for Windows.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were a total of 25 subjects, with 13 in the UATG, and 12 in the CG. The general

effect of upper-limb exercises on the respiratory function of stroke patients. The FVC and
FEV1 are known as important indicators of damage to the neuro-respiratory system<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, since damage to the cough
function increases the risks of aspiration and causes chest infections due to a decreased
ability to clear the cilia of mucous, the PCF is a critical method of measuring damage to
the cough function after stroke<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The upper-limb exercises conducted in this study consisted of flexion of the glenohumeral
joint and exercises designed to strengthen muscles near the scapula. Vertebral misalignment
can cause respiratory function to deteriorate<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies have indicated that exercises that increase the
movement of the shoulder joint and enhance muscles near the scapula of stroke patients
increase the upward rotations of the scapula, which in turn reduces abnormal lateral spinal
deviation<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the current study, the
UATG showed increases in FVC, FEV1, and PCF, compared with the CG. This indicates that if a
therapist provides upper-limb exercises for stroke patients in a way that does not cause
compensatory movement of the trunk, it could have positive effects on the abnormal trunk
angle and could improve respiratory function. The results of previous studies also show that
the enhancement of the shoulder girdle muscle as well as respiratory muscle exercise can
provide effective interventions to normalize the abnormal spinal curvature.</p><p>Muscle-strengthening exercises have not been recommended as rehabilitation exercises for
the reason that they aggravate the spasticity of stroke patients. However, it has been
reported in recent years that muscle-strengthening exercises do not affect spasticity, and
there is a growing interest in such exercises as critical treatment methods for improving
functional abilities<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, it has been reported that
muscle-strengthening exercises are favorable training methods for helping stroke patients
regain neuromotor function, as they increase motor unit recruitment and reduce the stiffness
and reflexive hyperactivation of muscles while maintaining the muscles&#x02019; functional
extensibility<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. There are reports
maintaining that, for patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
muscle-strengthening exercises have a positive impact not only on the muscle enhancement of
limbs, but also on respiratory functions such as FVC and FEV1<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Based on the results of the abovementioned studies, exercises for
strengthening the muscles of limbs are considered to have favorable effects on the
respiratory functions of stroke patients.</p><p>Upper-limb exercises using skateboards, as in the current study, are often used to increase
the range of motion (ROM) of upper limbs and restore the functions of upper limbs<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Regaining the ROM of upper limbs can help
in reducing the compensation movement of the trunk and supporting the trunk in an upright
position. Upper-limb exercises using skateboards, as in the current study, are considered to
have increased the ROM of upper limbs, which in turn helped normalize vertebral misalignment
and increase the respiratory function of stroke patients.</p><p>Moreover, continued upper-limb exercises of appropriate intensity are reported to increase
the density of capillaries and improve their ability to carry oxygen<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, it can be anticipated that the four week upper-limb
exercise program conducted in the current study can help increase the body&#x02019;s ability to
carry oxygen, improve endurance and respiratory functions, and assist in performing the
activities of daily living.</p><p>This study examined the effects of upper-limb exercise programs on the respiratory function
of stroke patients. The results of the study indicate that exercise programs that increase
the mobility of upper limbs and increase muscular strength have the effect of normalizing
vertebral alignment for stroke patients, and thus can provide effective interventions for
improving respiratory function. While exercises for improving the respiratory function of
stroke patients have focused on the training of respiratory muscles, the current study
explains the effect of upper-limb exercises in improving respiratory function. Hence, there
is a need for continued and multi-dimensional research on respiratory function related to
the movement of the upper limbs of stroke patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the 2015 Gimcheon University Research Grant.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Liao</surname><given-names>CF</given-names></name><name><surname>Liaw</surname><given-names>LJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>RY</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Relationship between trunk stability during voluntary limb
