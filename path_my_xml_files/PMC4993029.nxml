Background</title><p>A diarrhea lasting for seven days or less is classified as acute diarrhea (<xref rid="A25852R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Accounting for an annual 1.7 million deaths worldwide, diarrhea is the leading cause of mortality in children under 5 years old (<xref rid="A25852R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). It is responsible for over a quarter of all childhood mortality worldwide (<xref rid="A25852R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). This disease negatively impacts quality of life and could lead to high health costs (<xref rid="A25852R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Dehydration is the immediate cause of death in most cases and if appropriately treated, mortality can be averted almost completely (<xref rid="A25852R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Despite this fact, mortality due to diarrhea is still considerably high (<xref rid="A25852R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="A25852R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Diarrhea dehydration was treated by intravenous (IV) infusion of fluids until the 1970s, but it was costly and impractical in low-resource settings (<xref rid="A25852R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Therefore, oral rehydration solution (ORS) was introduced and developed for widespread use and since then millions of children and adults with diarrhea were saved (<xref rid="A25852R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). ORS has been termed as &#x0201c;the most important advance in this century&#x0201d; and has kept its fame even after the turn of the century. However, there have been controversies regarding its ideal composition due to the fact that its formulation does not seem universal for children of all ages with gastroenteritis or other causes within all geographical regions (<xref rid="A25852R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>As nations launched diarrhea control programs, they faced with many problems in making ORS accessible with high coverage levels, which was partly due to inadequate manufacturing capacity. Control programs promoted using additional fluids and home-made solutions like rice water to prevent development of dehydration in an attempt to improve fluid provision in early diarrhea episodes (<xref rid="A25852R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). As diarrhea can cause serious short- and long-term complications, it is necessary to educate women on how to prevent the disease and to take care of children with diarrhea (<xref rid="A25852R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) as most diarrhea episodes are treated at home by mothers (<xref rid="A25852R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Accordingly, various research and experiments have been performed to alter the composition of ORS to achieve an ideal formula (<xref rid="A25852R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Moreover, appropriate nutrition habits play an important role in controlling diarrhea (<xref rid="A25852R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Rice-based oral rehydration solution has proved to be effective in the treatment of diarrhea and dehydration (<xref rid="A25852R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="A25852R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Some studies have altered the composition of current ORS formula replacing glucose with rice components, which has also been effective in treating diarrhea (<xref rid="A25852R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>In previous studies, rice-based ORS (R-ORS) has been compared with the world health organization (WHO) recommended glucose-based ORS (G-ORS) in treating children with acute diarrhea and contradictory results have been reported. In a research to investigate the efficacy of R-ORS compared to G-ORS, in treating children with acute watery diarrhea, R-ORS was more effective in reducing the duration of diarrhea and hospital stay, although no significant effect was found on stool output or intravenous fluid administering frequency (<xref rid="A25852R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Some other studies have found no significant difference between R-ORS and G-ORS in the treatment of children with diarrhea (<xref rid="A25852R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="A25852R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>The WHO guidelines for treatment of diarrhea in children emphasize on continued feeding together with prescription of ORS and supplementary zinc therapy. However, conflicting viewpoints exist regarding optimal diet and dietary ingredients for children with diarrhea (<xref rid="A25852R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Nonetheless, we found no studies investigating the effect of rice soup along with ORS in the treatment of diarrhea; therefore, the question still comes to mind whether rice soup ORS is effective in treating children with acute diarrhea.</p></sec><sec id="sec151945"><title>2. Objectives</title><p>This study aimed to investigate the effects of simultaneous consumption of G-ORS and rice soup compared with consumption of G-ORS only in the treatment of acute diarrhea in 8 to 24-month- old children.</p></sec><sec id="sec151949"><title>3. Patients and Methods</title><p>This study was a single blind randomized controlled clinical trial conducted from June 2013 to February 2014. The sample population included children hospitalized in the pediatric ward of 22nd of Bahman hospital, Gonabad, Iran with acute diarrhea and having normal sodium and potassium ion ranges in their blood serum. To decide on the number of patients needed, a pilot study was performed on 10 children (5 in each group). The stool output frequency in the second 24 hours was considered and the following results were obtained: &#x000b5;<sub>1</sub> = 2.8, &#x000b5;<sub>2</sub> = 2.1, S<sub>1</sub> = 0.25, S<sub>2</sub> = 0.94. Accordingly, with a type I error probability of 0.05 and a power of 0.80, the sample size was estimated as 16 patients for each group. However, we recruited 20 patients in each group, with a total of 40 patients for the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig28668">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig28668" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Flow Diagram of the Participants</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="nms-05-02-25852-i001"/></fig><p>Children hospitalized with acute diarrhea and fulfilling the inclusion criteria were assigned into two groups of control (G-ORS) and experimental (G-ORS along with rice soup) in 10 blocks of 4 using balanced block randomization (five blocks for each group).</p><p>The inclusion criteria were age of 8 to 24 months, having no comorbidities, experiencing an acute diarrhea and having a normal range of sodium and potassium in serum. Moreover, during the study children were not supposed to consume anything that would aggravate diarrhea (such as artificial fruit juices, very sweet foodstuffs, etc.) and were to adhere to the prescribed regimen.</p><p>The exclusion criteria included: the child being incapable to continue the study from a medical point of view, child&#x02019;s parents unwillingness to continue the study, non-adherence of child to the prescribed regimen, diarrhea being associated with severe vomiting (of more than 2 times per day) and requirement of antibiotics administration.</p><sec id="sec151946"><title>3.1. The Procedures</title><p>The treatment protocol was as per the recommendation of the WHO chart in which the need for intravenous fluids and G-ORS has been determined based on the severity of diarrhea (<xref rid="A25852R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The control group received recommended treatment with G-ORS (produced by Daroopakhsh Drug Manufacturing Co., Iran). The experimental group received rice soup (25 mL for children under one and 50 mL for those older than one year old) based on per stool output or vomiting besides receiving the same G-ORS protocol. To consider the fluid intake amount not to exceed the recommended levels, G-ORS volume was decreased in proportion to the amount of rice soup added.</p><p>The rice soup was prepared by the hospital cook for hospitalized children every day. To prepare the soup, 100 g Iranian rice plus 6 g salt with 1.2 L of boiled water was cooked by simmering at a low flame for one hour and stirring from time to time until the final soup volume reached 1 L. The prepared soup and a measuring container were given to each mother to feed the child with the required amount of soup per stool output or vomiting. The extra soup was kept in the fridge but fresh soup was prepared and kept at the disposal of the mothers the next day.</p><p>On the first day of hospitalization and prior to the treatment, sodium and potassium in blood serum were measured using Photometer Model PFP7 (manufactured by Jenwey Company, England) and urine specific gravity was measured using a refractometer Model SPR-T2 (manufactured by Erma company, Japan).</p><p>The checklist for demographic information such as age, gender, weight and nutrition type was filled out by the researcher before treatment on the first day of patient&#x02019;s hospitalization. The weight was measured using weighing scale Model 61907 (produced in Germany) and the mother was asked regarding child&#x02019;s age and nutrition type eating habits.

Discussion</title><p>In the present study, taking G-ORS along with rice soup was more effective in decreasing children&#x02019;s duration of diarrhea compared with taking G-ORS. This finding was consistent with some previous studies (<xref rid="A25852R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="A25852R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). A randomized clinical trial revealed that although R-ORS is effective in the treatment of diarrhea caused by vibrio cholerae, its effect does not exceed that of G-ORS (<xref rid="A25852R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). A study on rats having diarrhea from sorbitol found that the duration of diarrhea in gruel-based and rice-starch groups decreased compared with that of the control group (<xref rid="A25852R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In another study, diarrhea duration in the group received enriched glucose with amylase-resistant starch was less than that of the G-ORS group (<xref rid="A25852R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). However, another study did not find any significant difference in diarrhea results between the group receiving G-ORS and the one receiving R-ORS (<xref rid="A25852R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Probably the type of rice or the amounts used in different studies were different from each other. A study conducted on rats pointed out that different types of rice have different effects on diarrhea (<xref rid="A25852R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p><p>Our results revealed no significant difference for administering intravenous fluids during the first and second 24 hours of rehydration between the group received rice soup and G-ORS compared to the G-ORS only group. Therefore, these findings concur with those of another research (<xref rid="A25852R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), but in some studies intravenous fluid needed during rehydration in the R-ORS group was significantly less than that in the G-ORS group, which is probably due to the difference in amount and the procedure of preparing rice (<xref rid="A25852R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="A25852R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, the frequency of stool output was significantly less in the intervention group both in the first and second days after the treatment. This finding was also in line with some previous investigations that compared the effects of R-ORS and G-ORS (<xref rid="A25852R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="A25852R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Yet, there is another study that showed no significant difference in the stool output frequency of the two groups (<xref rid="A25852R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Glucose in rice is slowly released and quickly absorbed in the small intestine. Then, it increases the water and electrolyte absorption, which consequently decreases stool output, reduces diarrhea duration and shortens the amount of IV fluid replacement. Since glucose available in ORS ingredients is completely present inside the lumen of the small intestine and has no important effect in water and electrolyte intake (<xref rid="A25852R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). On the other hand, the pectin available in rice absorbs a large quantity of water in the intestine and consequently causing stool to become fairly hard (<xref rid="A25852R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, the results revealed that the duration of hospital stay in children receiving rice soup was less than that of the control group. This finding corresponds with some other studies (<xref rid="A25852R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="A25852R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). As the duration of diarrhea in the experimental group decreased, the duration of hospital stay lessened.</p><p>In conclusion, the findings pointed out that stool output frequency and the volume of intravenous transfusion decreased in the both groups, but R-ORS was more effective in lessening diarrhea duration, duration of hospital stay and stool output frequency compared to the use of G-ORS alone. Therefore, since rice soup is rather inexpensive, it can be prescribed with G-ORS to decrease both hospital expenses and complications of acute diarrhea.</p><p>One limitation of the study was that diarrhea duration was reported by mothers prior to children&#x02019;s hospital stay. Mothers were required to report a rough estimate of diarrhea duration as we could not practically measure it exactly. Another limitation was that samples only consisted of children from one hospital, which reduces the generalizability of our findings. Thus, performing a multicentral study is recommended. Since the volume of intravenous fluids was registered based on nursing reports, there is the chance of potential error in measurement and registration as another limitation of study.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We should thank the student research committee of Gonabad University of Medical Sciences for their financial support for the study.
