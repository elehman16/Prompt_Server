Only 1 of 16 included trials was low risk of bias, and only 3 trials investigated individualised physiotherapy outpatient management, reflective of current practice<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> in several countries including the UK. The others investigated group management. Evidence was inconclusive overall. Some evidence suggested physiotherapy improved disability, with a potential benefit of more intensive intervention; and weak evidence suggested improved movement/physical impairment; all in the short-term. The findings mirrored a recently updated Cochrane review that investigated effectiveness of rehabilitation programmes that included physiotherapy.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Only 10 of 22 included trials were low risk of bias. Of particular interest, is a potential positive effect of exercise on pain and function; with very low/low quality evidence supporting high&#x0003e;low intensity exercise programmes short term, and low quality evidence supporting physiotherapy starting at 4&#x02013;6&#x02005;weeks compared with no treatment/education only. The evidence from their previous review<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> of n=14 trials had been stronger, with low to moderate evidence supporting effectiveness of exercise compared with no treatment, and high intensity exercises as more effective than low intensity for pain and improved physical impairment.</p><p>These data raise questions regarding optimal rehabilitation. An adequately powered low risk of bias trial is required to identify whether individualised physiotherapy is effective/cost-effective. Substantial heterogeneity in treatment effects across all systematic reviews could be explained by variation in quality, administration and components of interventions, illustrated by the documented variability in management and advice.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Therefore, prior to planning a trial, an optimised 1:1 physiotherapy outpatient intervention was developed through a rigorous process<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> to reflect best practice, with flexibility to tailor management to individual patients in line with Medical Research Council (MRC) guidance regarding the development of complex interventions (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary file S1</xref>).<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The intervention was evaluated through an external pilot and feasibility study<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> that enabled description and analysis of the intervention and physiotherapist decision-making.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2016-012151.supp1</object-id><label>supplementary file</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss1" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-012151supp_S1.pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material><sec id="s1a"><title>Objective</title><p>To describe, analyse and evaluate application of the optimised 1:1 physiotherapy outpatient intervention for patients following primary lumbar discectomy.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design and setting</title><p>A descriptive analysis of the optimised (designed to reflect best practice) 1:1 physiotherapy outpatient intervention embedded within an external pilot and feasibility study in preparation for a randomised controlled trial (RCT) reported elsewhere.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> This was a descriptive analysis of one arm of a small-scale parallel RCT design, randomising consenting patients across two UK sites, the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham (QEHB) and the Salford Royal Foundation Trust (SRFT), to either the optimised intervention including patient leaflet or patient leaflet alone.

Their clinical presentation was characteristic of disc problems affecting the nerve roots with all patients presenting with pain and the majority with leg pain (93%); most accompanied with paraesthesia and numbness. The mean age of participants of 44&#x02005;years emphasises the importance of returning to work/function. The demographic profile closely resembles the populations in existing clinical trials,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>

<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> in the subacute stage of healing, participants were characterised by moderate disability (mean RMDQ 10.52), and although pain was of overall low severity, most still required analgesia. There was considerable variability in disability (range 0&#x02013;23, SD 5.94) highlighting heterogeneity of this population. While the median GPE of 2 and high health related quality of life scores reflected considerable improvement from surgery, participants did present with high kinesiophobia. The mean TAMPA of 40.48 (SD 6.47) was &#x02265;37, the recommended cut-off.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> This may reflect a lack of confidence in returning to function following surgery. In contrast, the mean (SD) FABQ activity score of 13.15 (4.52) and FABQ work of 19.96 (11.15) were not elevated according to preliminary data regarding cut-off scores.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> These differences are interesting as some overlap between these two measures in a chronic LBP population is proposed, and a strong relationship exists between disability and increased FABQ.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>Use of STarT Back suggested that at baseline, 55% of participants required physiotherapy; being evaluated not at low risk of poor outcome. Physiotherapy evaluation designated other patients as requiring caution in their management, and others with multiple problems that were not detected using STarT Back. Leg pain&#x02014;a question on STarT Back is the main indicator for lumbar discectomy and so this may have affected the data, reflecting an obvious limitation of STarT Back in this population. Interestingly, five of seven patients who did not attend for physiotherapy were classified as low risk of poor outcome which may have informed their decision not to attend. This is the first time the STarT Back tool has been used in secondary care with post operative patients, as previous secondary care studies excluded post operative patients<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> or included a broad range of conditions.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The STarT Back tool has less predictive ability in secondary care but its performance equals alternative measures.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Overall, STarT Back may therefore be useful in combination with other factors to inform decisions regarding patients that require more than minimal physiotherapy intervention. This merits further investigation to explore potential stratification of this population.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Physiotherapist clinical reasoning</title><sec id="s4b1"><title>Diagnosis and caution</title><p>Physiotherapists used a range of diagnostic categories following their assessment of patients, with most focused on the surgical procedure, distinguishing discectomy, microdiscectomy and level of procedure; reflecting a biomedical approach. The most common levels were low lumbar specifically L<sub>4,5,</sub>S<sub>1</sub>. Physiotherapists designated n=8 participants as requiring caution, the main reason being a risk of overdoing activity at a time when tissues are still healing; and this evaluation did not reflect STarT Back. This does suggest, unsurprisingly that STarT Back is not focused on all relevant issues for this population, and that the intervention framework facilitated further discrimination between patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4b2"><title>Participants' problems</title><p>The mean of 5.36 (SD 2.63) problems highlighted the substantive issues still experienced by participants 4&#x02005;weeks following surgery. The higher number of problems was consistent with the physiotherapist reasoning around caution and STarT Back not at low risk. The nature of the identified problems reflected the chronicity and complexity of patients undergoing surgery, and therefore the requirement of intervention to support their ability to self-manage. The nature of problems reflected a focus on function with the key issues being muscle strength, range of movement, general conditioning and fitness.</p></sec><sec id="s4b3"><title>Physiotherapy treatment</title><p>Clarity of a framework for the intervention<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> perhaps contributed to a consistent approach to physiotherapy management that did not reflect previously identified variability.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Treatments reflected an emphasis on education, advice and progressing activity and function, with the use of manual therapy, specific exercises, and general exercise interventions. Reduced neural mobility was identified as a problem for n=10 participants but few specific treatment interventions were implemented; suggesting that neural symptoms resolved through other interventions/time. There was an emphasis on progression of management, for example, exercises for an individual, but not the emphasis on high intensity exercises within the literature;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> perhaps limited by the exclusion of exercise class interventions in this study. Psychological issues were only identified for n=2 participants and so psychologically informed interventions were not widely used (cognitive&#x02013;behavioural approaches, pacing or goal setting). This suggests that physiotherapists were happy using education, advice and other interventions to address kinesiophobia. The number of physiotherapy sessions ranging 1&#x02013;6 was not reflective of the UK survey of 1&#x02013;20 sessions perhaps reflecting a change in more recent practice.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The physiotherapists reasoned that participants with a greater number of problems, or in situations where caution was required, needed a greater number of sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s4b4"><title>Outcome data</title><p>The data demonstrate that participants improved in most outcomes by 12&#x02005;weeks. In particular, the return to work data was promising with 59% participants back at work and 65% back to usual activities by 12&#x02005;weeks compared to 28% and 24% at baseline. This compares to 70% fit to return to work 12&#x02005;months after surgery.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> For the RMDQ, sensitivity to change at 12&#x02005;weeks was promising. These positive outcomes were reflected in the physiotherapists' discharge summaries, and physiotherapists identified that n=3 participants required further management, identifying a small number of participants who required greater intervention than the defined parameters. Although improved, an issue that requires further consideration is kinesiophobia as at 12&#x02005;weeks the TAMPA remained close to the &#x02265;37 cut-off.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p></sec><sec id="s4b5"><title>Limitations</title><p>While some potentially interesting differences between participants are highlighted and areas for further investigation identified, it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from this data owing to the low number of participants. To reflect current practice, the nine-item STarT Back may have been more valuable to avoid reducing the tool's discriminative power.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Although specific interventions were indicated as used, free text sections were often left unanswered thereby limited depth of information was gained. It is difficult to establish whether this represents a training issue regarding data collection, or the increasing demands placed on NHS physiotherapists. The wide inclusion of all bands of physiotherapist, with some less experienced in managing this population, may also have contributed to these issues.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data suggest that patients present differently postlumbar discectomy and therefore require different interventions. These differences can be identified by clinical reasoning and a tool such as STarT Back, although the congruence between the two merits further consideration, and these findings merit further investigation in a larger sample. The crux of this issue is the identification and targeted treatment of patients to ensure that patients at low risk of poor outcome are not over treated and patients not at low risk of poor outcome are not under treated. This is a key issue in this climate of austerity and the move towards more resourceful healthcare, improving quality and safety, and minimising costs by avoiding unnecessary treatment.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Claire Littleford and Christopher Bayliss, patient users.
