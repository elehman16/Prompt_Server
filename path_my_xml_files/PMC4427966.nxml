Even fewer have focused on organizational change, which is required to sustain community-based initiatives. We hypothesized that FBOs serving Latinos would be more likely to offer evidence-based strategies (EBS) for cancer control after receiving a capacity enhancement intervention to implement health programs, and designed the CRUZA trial to test this hypothesis. This paper describes the CRUZA design and baseline findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We identified Catholic parishes in Massachusetts that provided Spanish-language mass (n = 65). A baseline survey assessed organizational characteristics relevant to adoption of health programs, including readiness for adoption, &#x0201c;fit&#x0201d; between innovation and organizational mission, implementation climate, and organizational culture. In the next study phase, parishes that completed the baseline assessment will be recruited to a randomized cluster trial, with the parish as the unit of analysis. Both groups will receive a Program Manual and Toolkit. Capacity Enhancement parishes will also be offered technical support, assistance forming health committees and building inter-institutional partnerships, and skills-based training.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 49 parishes surveyed at baseline (75%), one-third (33%) reported having provided at least one health program in the prior year. However, only two program offerings were cancer-specific. Nearly one-fifth (18%) had an active health ministry. There was a high level of organizational readiness to adopt cancer control programs, high congruence between parish missions and CRUZA objectives, moderately conducive implementation climates, and organizational cultures supportive of CRUZA programming. Having an existing health ministry was significantly associated with having offered health programs within the past year. Relationships between health program offerings and other organizational characteristics were not statistically significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Findings suggest that many parishes do not offer cancer control programs, yet many may be ready to do so. However, the perceptions about existing organizational practices and policies may not be conducive to program initiation. A capacity enhancement intervention may hold promise as a means of increasing health programming. The efficacy of such an intervention will be tested in phase two of this study.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Latinos</kwd><kwd>Hispanics</kwd><kwd>Faith-based organizations</kwd><kwd>Catholic</kwd><kwd>Cancer screening</kwd><kwd>Evidence-based interventions</kwd><kwd>Implementation science</kwd><kwd>Organizational capacity enhancement</kwd><kwd>Capacity building</kwd><kwd>Community-based participatory research</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Evidence-based strategies (EBS) to increase utilization of cancer screening tests have proliferated rapidly over the past 20 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, the utility of these strategies is hindered by limited information about how best to deliver and sustain them within existing community infrastructures, where they could exert maximum benefit. Historically, there has been greater emphasis on developing and testing new interventions under &#x0201c;ideal&#x0201d; (controlled) conditions, with little focus on <italic>if</italic> or <italic>how</italic> interventions could be transferred or scaled for &#x0201c;real world&#x0201d; settings. As a result, little is known about how to encourage and support community organizations in adopting and implementing EBS. It is imperative to conduct research to understand the processes by which community organizations decide to adopt and implement EBS, rather than continuing to create complex interventions that are not sustainable outside the context of research trials. If the science of dissemination and implementation continues to lag behind that of intervention development, the ultimate aims of reducing cancer morbidity and mortality cannot be fully realized.</p><p>Collaborations with faith-based organizations (FBOs) has been suggested as an effective means for reaching out to underserved populations that experience health disparities, such as Latinos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Several factors make FBOs natural partners for the delivery of cancer control programs. First, national data show that many FBOs view health as integral to their mission and are interested in providing health programs for their members, yet only a small percentage actually do [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Second, FBOs often have infrastructures (e.g., health ministries), facilities (e.g., meeting halls), and social/human resources (e.g., support networks) that may be useful for delivering and sustaining health programs over time. Moreover, FBOs often place a high value on volunteerism&#x02014; which can bolster personnel resources needed for program delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and potential sustainability of programs once grant funding is completed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Despite the potential for establishing cancer control interventions through FBOs, minimal organizational-level research has been conducted on how best to harness this resource. A number of randomized trials of health interventions in African American churches have successfully targeted changes in individual health behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], such as diet and physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], as well as cancer screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, few have targeted organizational-level change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Moreover, only a handful of intervention trials have been conducted in Latino FBOs; of these, all have targeted individual-, not organizational-level change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>In response to the paucity of research on organizational interventions in Latino FBOs, we designed CRUZA, a three-year study of Catholic churches in Massachusetts. We targeted Catholic churches (hereafter referred to as &#x0201c;parishes&#x0201d;) since a little over half of all Latinos in the U.S. self-identify as Catholic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The name &#x0201c;CRUZA&#x0201d; was selected because of its religious connotations (&#x0201c;la cruz&#x0201d; in Spanish means &#x0201c;cross&#x0201d; in English) but also to reflect the collaboration among FBOs, academic universities, and community organizations. CRUZA&#x02019;s aims are to understand the organizational infrastructure, skills, and resources required by parishes to adopt and implement EBS for cancer control. The trial will compare the efficacy of a Capacity Enhancement intervention versus Standard Dissemination approach in promoting EBS adoption and implementation. In this paper, we describe the study rationale, design, methods and baseline findings, including a description of organizational characteristics of FBOs, as well as their past offering of health programs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Overview of design</title><p>In the first phase of CRUZA, we identified Catholic parishes in Massachusetts offering religious services in Spanish and surveyed parish leaders to: (1) document the prevalence of health programming and EBS for cancer control; and (2) understand organizational characteristics associated with implementation of health programs. This manuscript focuses on findings from phase one. Phase two is a randomized cluster trial comparing a 3-month Capacity Enhancement (CE) Intervention with a Standard Dissemination (SD) comparison condition at the organizational level, with the parish as the unit of randomization and analysis.

The CFIR is a meta-theoretical implementation framework that integrates constructs from relevant theories and addresses multiple domains, including the: (1) characteristics of the intervention; (2) inner organizational setting; (3) outer setting; (4) characteristics of those implementing the intervention; and (5) processes put in place for implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Taken together, these theories and frameworks suggest that interventions are more likely to be adopted and implemented if they are simple, adaptable, low-cost, easy to use, and demonstrate a relative advantage over current practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Moreover, they suggest that an organization that is stable, and has clear lines of decision-making and communication, capacity for and receptivity to change is more likely to adopt/implement an innovation than those lacking these characteristics. The outer setting &#x02013; including connectedness with other organizations &#x02013; may also influence implementation. Characteristics of individuals or groups charged with implementation of change (e.g., skills, self-efficacy, commitment) may also play a role. Processes for implementation refer to activities essential to complete intervention activities, including: planning, engaging, executing, reflecting and evaluating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>While the CFIR provides a model for examining factors that may influence the adoption and implementation process, the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] augments this by providing a framework for evaluating intervention uptake at the organizational level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Relevant aspects of this framework include: (1) adoption &#x02013; the absolute number, proportion, and representativeness of organizational units willing to initiate a program; (2) implementation &#x02013; the delivery of the intervention as planned; and (3) maintenance &#x02013; whether an intervention sustains over time and integrates into organizational practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Adoption, implementation, and maintenance are outcomes for the larger CRUZA trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Community engagement</title><p>We employed a community-based participatory (CBPR) approach, in recognition of the need for community expertise and engagement in all phases of the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In the first year of the study, we established a statewide Community Advisory Board (CAB) comprised of Catholic faith leaders and representatives from health and social service organizations serving Latinos. CAB members met regularly to advise about recruitment strategies and materials, data collection methods, and religious tailoring of messages. Our community activities also included extensive formative research. Between April 2011&#x02013;February 2012, we conducted 18 key informant interviews among Latino faith and community leaders, as well as 8 focus groups totaling 67 Spanish-speaking parishioners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. These formative research activities illuminated contextually appropriate strategies for engaging faith communities and adapting EBS for delivery in parishes. These findings are described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Organizational recruitment</title><p>Study sites were located in Massachusetts, which has 577 Catholic parishes under the purview of four dioceses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Given the hierarchical structure of the Catholic Church, we conducted diocesan (administrative units of parishes) recruitment prior to individual parish recruitment. During this period, investigators gave formal presentations at a state-wide gathering of more than 30 Catholic leaders. Investigators subsequently met individually with the bishops and/or Hispanic Ministry directors within each of the four dioceses in Massachusetts to obtain their approval and support.</p><p>Once permission for conducting the study in parishes was granted at the diocesan level, we utilized a two-stage sampling scheme to identify eligible parishes, and within them, eligible representatives to respond to the organizational surveys. This process is described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. First, using lists reviewed by the four dioceses, we identified 70 parishes that potentially met our eligibility criteria. They were: (1) Roman Catholic; (2) located in Massachusetts; (3) offered mass in Spanish; and (4) not undergoing closure/merger at the time of recruitment.</p><p>We mailed recruitment packets that included a project brochure, which described the study&#x02018;s goals and procedures and provided informed consent information. The packet also contained a letter of support from the bishop. We enclosed a request for contact information so that pastors could indicate if they were willing to participate, and if so, the names of appropriate parish representative(s) to complete relevant sections of the organizational survey.</p><p>Bilingual survey assistants subsequently made telephone calls and in-person visits to parishes, following study recruitment protocols and using standardized scripts. During these interactions, survey assistants described the study verbally and provided written recruitment materials. If the pastor consented to proceed with study activities, we asked for the names of organizational representatives who could accurately describe parish activities and organizational characteristics for the organizational surveys.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Data collection</title><p>We contacted the organizational representatives named by the pastor by phone or in person using a standardized script. Detailed tracking logs ensured that contact attempts occurred at various times of the day and week. During calls/visits, we presented study information, ascertained level of interest, and offered to conduct the interview immediately or schedule at another time convenient for the participant. Prior to interview administration, survey assistants obtained verbal informed consent in the respondent&#x02018;s preferred language (English/Spanish).</p><p>The organizational survey consisted of four sections based on the content and intended respondent: Part A &#x02013; leadership (pastor), Part B &#x02013; bookkeeping (business manager), Part C &#x02013; Hispanic ministry (deacon/director of Hispanic ministry), and Part D &#x02013; health/social services (parish nurse or director of social outreach). In cases where one individual completed all survey sections, the total interview time was approximately 60 minutes. When completed by different individuals, each segment took approximately 20 minutes. We donated a $50 gift card to the parish upon completion of any survey sections. A detailed description of the survey recruitment methods is available elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p>For non-participating parishes, we collected information on finances, weekly attendance (when available), founding year of parish, presence of a health ministry/programs, and number of Spanish services from publicly available sources including parish newsletters, websites, and information documented in Diocesan reports.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Measures</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Instrument development</title><p>We reviewed the literature for validated instruments that assessed organizational characteristics associated with adoption and implementation of innovations among community organizations. We also identified existing national surveys conducted in FBOs and catalogued measures on health-related activities and characteristics of churches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Available instruments were reviewed by the investigator team, the CAB, and our Scientific Advisory Committee &#x02013; experts in the fields of organizational behavior, cancer control and faith-based interventions. Following an iterative review process, we conducted cognitive testing of the resulting survey with experienced pastoral leaders outside our sample (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;5) to assess item comprehension and cultural/religious appropriateness of items. Afterward, items were refined and subsequently re-tested with two parish leaders (also not included in our sample). The entire instrument was reviewed by the CAB and the Scientific Advisory Committee, with particular attention to the relevance and &#x0201c;face validity&#x0201d; of the Organizational Characteristics measures. Final data collection instruments were vetted by officials from the Archdiocese of Boston and translated into Spanish by a certified translator working for the Archdiocese.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Organizational characteristics</title><p>We assessed organizational characteristics that emanated from our conceptual model, including: (1) <italic>organizational readiness</italic> &#x02013; 12 items measuring the organizational members&#x02019; shared resolve to implement a change (change commitment) and collective capability to do so (shared efficacy), adapted from Weiner et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]; (2) <italic>innovation-values fit</italic> &#x02013; 5 items based on the work of Belkhodja et al. measuring the extent to which health programs fit with the overall organizational mission and values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]; (3) <italic>implementation climate</italic> &#x02013; 7 items adapted from Weiner et al. measuring the extent to which the organization&#x02018;s policies and practices encourage, support, and reward implementation of programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]; and (4) <italic>organizational culture</italic> &#x02013; 7 items adapted from the work of Helfrich et al. measuring the extent to which the organization has an atmosphere of trust, support, flexibility, participative decision-making, and innovation, and that proper values are in place to optimize implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Each item was read to respondents in the form of a statement and respondents were asked about the extent to which they agreed with the statement on a five-point Likert scale (1 = low agreement, 5 = high agreement).</p><p>For each construct, items were summed and divided by the total number of items in the scale, with 1 representing the lowest level of a given factor and 5 representing the highest. For each of the Organizational Characteristics, responses (ranging from 1&#x02013;5) were summed and subsequently divided by the total number of items in the scale. Therefore, the theoretical range for each of the Organizational Characteristics was 1&#x02013;5.</p><p>We also measured parish resources (e.g., size, monetary collections, volunteerism), leader characteristics (e.g., educational level, number of pastoral staff); existing health-related structures or committees (e.g., health ministry), and existing/prior inter-organizational ties and collaborations with hospitals or health centers. Questions were worded so that it was clear that we were asking about the parish <italic>organization</italic> (i.e., organizational-level data), as opposed to individual opinions about these topics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Intervention development</title><p>EBS for cancer control adapted and packaged for use among CRUZA parishes were largely based on recommendations by the Community Preventive Services Task Force for breast, cervical, and/or colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. These included: (1) group education (although evidence insufficient for colorectal cancer); (2) one-to-one outreach; (3) small media; (4) client reminders; and (5) reduction of structural barriers (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). We conducted a systematic search for all research-tested intervention protocols for these EBS by scouring the online archives of Research Tested Intervention Programs (RTIPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] and Cancer Control P.L.A.N.E.T. (Plan, Link, Act, Network with Evidence-based Tools) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], and by contacting prominent intervention researchers in the field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Through this process, we identified 28 community interventions for cancer control, which we then evaluated for cultural and linguistic appropriateness for Latinos and for delivery in a faith-based setting.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

The Program Manual provides a step-by-step activity guide for each EBS, and includes planning tools, sample materials, and resource guides. The CRUZA Toolkit is stocked with promotional and intervention materials that can be easily distributed to parishioners, such as: Bible bookmarks, parish bulletin inserts, spiritually-themed photo frames with health messages, birthday cards with reminders about age-appropriate screening guidelines, and bi-fold brochures that weaved family, faith, and health messages together. Toolkits contain local resource guides, including contact information for organizations willing to provide guest speakers, assistance with obtaining health insurance, and sources for additional health information and materials. Materials developed or translated by CRUZA are included on USB flash drives so parish leaders can tailor materials or print additional copies. Materials from MIYO are also included in the kit.

This first phase of the CRUZA study provides descriptive information about health programming offered by Catholic parishes, as well as an assessment of organizational characteristics theorized to be relevant to adoption and implementation of EBS for cancer control. These data will inform our efforts to develop, implement, and evaluate the efficacy of a capacity enhancement intervention as a means of promoting EBS uptake by parishes. To our knowledge, CRUZA is the first randomized trial of an organizational-level intervention aimed at disseminating EBS for cancer control in Latino Catholic communities.</p><p>Sixty-nine percent of eligible parishes invited to participate in the baseline assessment completed all four sections of the survey and 75% completed at least one survey section. These results suggest a willingness among Catholic parishes to take part in research and may portend interest in offering additional health programs. Indeed, one-third (33%) of parishes surveyed had conducted some form of health program within the past year. Although definitions of health programs differ somewhat across studies, our findings suggest a high level of commitment to health, when compared to a national study of a variety of denominations, which found that only 10% offered health programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Moreover, nearly one-fifth (18%) of parishes in this study had existing health ministries, which could be instrumental in the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of cancer control or other health programs over time. Overall, the results of the baseline surveys suggest that parishes willing to initiate EBS for cancer control, felt that the objectives of such programs aligned well with their organizational missions, and believed that their parish&#x02019;s organizational culture was conducive to offering these programs. However, concerns about the feasibility of implementing programs given limited funds were prevalent and cannot be overlooked.</p><p>National studies have found that higher levels of education among FBO leaders and a greater proportion of volunteers relative to the size of the congregation are associated with health program offerings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. As we had expected given the rich history of social service provision in the Catholic Church, the proportion of volunteers relative to parish size was large in this sample, compared to churches nationally. Whereas half of congregations in the U.S. do not have volunteers, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] the mean proportion of volunteers relative to the size of the congregation was 9% in this study. In addition, compared to the National Congregations Study, where 75% of religious leaders had a bachelors degree, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] pastors in this study were highly educated, with 74% having a graduate level degree. This may well reflect the level of training that is required of Catholic pastoral staff and leaders. Notably, the vast majority of pastors completed the organizational surveys in English.</p><p>Parishes had high levels of existing collaborations with health/social service organizations, although these collaborations largely reflected the offering of communion, shared prayer and social support offered Catholic in institutional settings, such as hospitals, nursing homes, prisons etc., as opposed to health promotion activities. Relationships between FBOs and health or social service organizations in our sample may be due to affiliations between the Catholic Church and hospitals. The combination of favorable organizational characteristics, existing health ministries, high levels of education among pastors, and existing collaborations with health and social service agencies provides strong support for the premise that Catholic parishes may be effective partners in disseminating EBS for cancer control among Latinos. The finding that parishes with a greater proportion of Latino members reported higher Organizational Readiness to adopt EBS for cancer control also provides support for this hypothesis.</p><p>Before we discuss study implications, limitations must be noted. First, with only 49 parishes, we lacked adequate statistical power to detect small differences between health program offerings and organizational characteristics. In our calculations, our power to detect a medium effect size (0.40) was less than 40%. Nevertheless, the second phase of the study is adequately powered to detect meaningful changes in the primary outcomes of the trial (adoption and implementation of EBS). Second, in nearly one-third of the parishes (31%) that completed the organizational survey, one individual (most often the pastor) completed the entire assessment. When examining organizational-level factors, it is ideal to have multiple respondents to ensure that the data are not skewed toward the perceptions of an individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Another limitation is that these data were collected only among Catholic parishes. While the majority of Latinos living in the U.S. self-identify as Catholic, a growing sector of Latinos identify with non-Catholic Christian denominations whose structures, resources, and practices are different from those in the Catholic Church [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Additional research is needed to understand adoption and implementation of EBS beyond Catholic parishes.</p><p>Despite these limitations, the first phase of this study provides important information about the existing resources and needs of Catholic parishes in Massachusetts, as we embark on efforts to disseminate EBS for cancer control. Furthermore, we now have evidence that it is feasible to recruit parishes to participate in research activities. A detailed process tracking system is in place to evaluate intervention reach and dose in phase two, as well as fidelity to intervention protocol. This system will be essential for identifying factors that facilitate or impede implementation, as well as for explaining any unexpected effects of the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Baseline findings suggest that many parishes do not currently offer cancer control programs, yet many demonstrate readiness to do so. A capacity enhancement intervention holds promise as a means to increase health programming. We developed the CRUZA Capacity Enhancement intervention based on published &#x02018;best-practices&#x02019; for working with faith-based organizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. The general literature suggests that building community capacity to offer health programs should entail technical assistance, formal skills training, and assistance forming inter-institutional partnerships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Yet, to our knowledge, these strategies have not been formally tested among FBOs. After doing extensive formative research, we concluded that the success of CRUZA would depend largely on the appropriate adjustment of the interventions to core Catholic religious beliefs and values. This strategy allowed us to build on strengths and convictions existing in the communities to advocate for health, while avoiding theological and ethical tensions<italic>.</italic> Taking the time and effort to ensure that interventions are not only culturally relevant, but also relevant and meaningful from a religious and spiritual perspective, we believe, will ultimately enhance the acceptability, adoption and maintenance of CRUZA programs<italic>.</italic> Overall, findings from the first phase of CRUZA suggest that Catholic parishes could be strong partners in efforts to implement EBS for cancer control and other prevention programs among Latinos.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>EBS</term><def><p>Evidence based strategies</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FBOs</term><def><p>Faith-based organizations</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RE-AIM</term><def><p>Reach effectiveness adoption implementation maintenance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CAB</term><def><p>Community advisory board</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TA</term><def><p>Technical assistance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CE</term><def><p>Capacity enhancement</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>Standard dissemination</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>JDA and MIT were responsible for obtaining funding.
