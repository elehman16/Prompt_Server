However, there is still large room for improvement in the treatment of this condition by corticosteroid injection. The mechanical, viscoelastic, and antinociceptive properties of hyaluronic acid may potentially support the use of this molecule in association with corticosteroids for the treatment of trigger finger. This study examines the feasibility and safety of ultrasound-guided injection of a corticosteroid and hyaluronic acid compared, for the first time, with open surgery for the treatment of trigger finger.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> This was a monocentric, open-label, randomized study. Consecutive patients aged between 35 and 70 years with ultrasound-confirmed diagnosis of trigger finger were included. Patients were randomly assigned to either ultrasound-guided injection of methylprednisolone acetate 40 mg/mL with 0.8mL lidocaine into the flexor sheath plus injection of 1mL hyaluronic acid 0.8% 10 days later (n = 15; group A), or to open surgical release of the first annular pulley (n = 15; group B). Clinical assessment of the digital articular chain was conducted prior to treatment and after 6 weeks, and 3, 6, and 12 months. The duration of abstention from work and/or sports activity, and any treatment complications or additional treatment requirements (e.g. physiotherapy, compression, medication) were also recorded.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Fourteen patients (93.3%) in group A had complete symptom resolution at 6 months, which persisted for 12 months in 11 patients (73.3%), while three patients experienced recurrences and one experienced no symptom improvements. No patients in group A reported major or minor complications during or after corticosteroid injection, or required a compression bandage. All 15 patients in group B achieved complete resolution of articular impairment by 3 weeks after surgery, but ten patients were assigned to physiotherapy and local and/or oral analgesics for complete resolution of symptoms, which was approximately 30&#x02013;40 days postsurgery. The mean duration of abstention from work and/or sport was 2&#x02013;3 days in group A and 26 days in group B.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Although the limited sample size did not allow any statistical comparison between treatment groups, and therefore all the findings should be regarded as preliminary, the results of this explorative study suggest that ultrasound-guided injection of a corticosteroid and hyaluronic acid could be a safe and feasible approach for the treatment of trigger finger. It is also associated with a shorter recovery time than open surgery, which leads to a reduced abstention from sports and, in particular, work activities, and therefore may have some pharmacoeconomic implications, which may be further explored. In light of the promising results obtained in this investigation, further studies comparing ultrasound-guided injection of corticosteroid plus hyaluronic acid with corticosteroid alone are recommended in order to clarify the actual benefits attributable to hyaluronic acid.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Adis Data Information BV 2011</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stenosing tenosynovitis, otherwise known as trigger finger (TF), affects the flexor pollicis longus or flexor digitorum tendons, and causes a characteristic painful tendon snap or click on flexion and extension, and/or locking of the metacarpophalangeal or proximal interphalangeal joints of the involved digit. Most cases are idiopathic. Entrapment of the affected tendon at the first annular (A1) pulley occurs because of a difference in the diameter of the flexor tendon and its sheath as a result of thickening of the sheath and some localized tendon thickening. Chronic repetitive friction between the tendon and its sheath may then lead to an intratendinous nodule at the A1 pulley.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]</p><p>TF is one of the most common causes of pain and disability in the hand with an incidence of around 28 cases per 100 000 population per year, or a lifetime risk of 2.6% in the general population.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] In adults, it occurs more commonly in women than in men, usually in the dominant hand, and most often in the thumb or ring fingers.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] The aim of treatment is abolition of pain and restoration of a full range of smooth motion in the involved digit(s).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] Current treatment options include either conservative management by splinting,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroid injection (usually with local anesthetic) in the flexor tendon sheath,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] or surgical release of the A1 pulley (via an open or percutaneous approach).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]</p><p>Although there are no well controlled studies comparing treatment modalities, corticosteroid injection is widely accepted as first-line treatment of TF; surgery is generally reserved for cases of corticosteroid treatment failure or for patients with more severe articular locking and joint rigidity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] Certainly surgery is the definitive treatment, providing permanent resolution of symptoms,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] but corticosteroid injection is often preferred, not only because a single injection is effective in a large proportion of patients, but also because it can be given in an office setting and is a relatively simple, low-cost procedure.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] However, symptoms may not resolve with only one corticosteroid injection and the likelihood of success decreases with each subsequent injection (60% of 109 trigger digits after the first injection, 36% after the second, and 33% after the third; for those patients requiring more than one injection, average duration of relief from injection was 14 weeks, and ranged from 4 to 40 weeks).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] There is some room for improvement in the treatment of TF by corticosteroid injection.</p><p>The glycosaminoglycan hyaluronic acid (HA) is an essential component of the connective tissue[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and is naturally found in the synovial fluid. HA injection has been used in the effective and safe treatment of osteoarthritis of the hip, knee, and other joints with success rates varying from 68% to 95%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]</p><p>Several properties of HA support its use in combination with corticosteroid injection in patients with TF. We hypothesize that HA may act initially as a mechanical intermediary via its visco-supplementing properties (by immediate recovery of synovial fluid viscosity),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] consequently enlarging the tendon passageway narrowed by the disease and thereby regaining enough space for the tendon to glide normally. Subsequently, for 3&#x02013;7 days after injection, HA not only provides shock absorption via its rheologic (visco-elastic) properties, but it has an antinociceptive effect and also significantly decreases the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the synovial space.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] In addition, experimental studies show that HA has a direct effect on tendons by inhibiting and modulating fibroblast activity impaired by stenosing tenosynovitis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies to date on the use of HA in the treatment of TF.</p><p>The aim of this explorative study was to establish the feasibility and safety of injection of a corticosteroid followed by HA in the treatment of TF, using surgery as the reference treatment, because in the study institution, surgery is the treatment of choice for TF, and a conservative infiltration treatment with corticosteroid is only seldom prescribed. The relatively new method for corticosteroid injection of ultrasound-guided injection was employed because of its very high long-term success rate (90% of digits at 1 year post injection),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and potential to be more accurate and safer than blind injection.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] This procedure allows data to be obtained that is as free as possible from the potential errors associated with infiltrative procedures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects and Study Design</title><p>This was a prospective, open-label, randomized, single-center study. Consecutive patients aged between 35 and 70 years presenting with clinical signs and symptoms of stenosing tenosynovitis of the flexor tendons and in whom diagnosis was confirmed by ultrasound (in order to exclude other conditions that may be associated with the same symptoms, e.g. luxations, joint abnormalities, focal dystony) were eligible for enrollment. Ultrasound diagnosis was based on the criteria described previously by Ebrahim et al.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] which, briefly, were as follows: hypoechoic thickening of the A1 pulley; visualization of a nodule in the flexor superficialis tendon; bow-stringing of the pulley during flexion; and visualization of triggering (obstruction of the tendon passing through the osteofibrous canal in the pulley during flexion-extension) of the involved digit. Patients with grade IV TF or the following co-morbidities were excluded: diabetes mellitus; rheumatoid arthritis; hypercholesterolemia; hypotension; and hypertension. This choice was taken in order to avoid changes associated with alterations in the synovial and intratendinous microcirculation.</p><p>Disease severity was graded according to Froimson&#x02019;s modification[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] of Quinnell&#x02019;s classification,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] as follows: grade I (pre-triggering) &#x02013; pain and a history of catching, not demonstrable on clinical examination; grade II (active triggering) &#x02013; demonstrable actively correctable catching; grade III (passive triggering) &#x02013; demonstrable passively correctable catching (III A) or impossible active flexion (III B); and grade IV (contracture) &#x02013; uncorrectable fixed flexion.

This infiltrative therapy regimen also led to faster recovery with fewer complications and required less additional treatment than open surgery; however, this finding is somehow conflicting with other evidence, which has suggested that the higher costs associated with surgery may be ultimately offset by the benefit conferred through permanency of relief.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] The faster recovery times associated with this infiltrative regimen, when compared with those following open surgery, led to an approximate 10-fold decrease in abstention from sporting and, in particular, work activities. This may have some pharmacoeconomic implications, which may be further explored. Patient-reported outcomes for disability, satisfaction, and pain were satisfactory in patients treated with ultrasound-guided corticosteroid and HA injection, and similar to those obtained in patients who received surgical treatment.</p><p>Open surgery is considered the gold standard for the treatment of TF,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and we therefore chose it as a control to assess the feasibility of ultrasound-guided injection of a corticosteroid and HA. As expected, in this study, open surgery was associated with a complete resolution of articular symptoms, while the conservative approach resulted, in a limited number of cases, in recurrences, possibly due to the fact that the anatomical structures remain unmodified. However, the ultrasound-guided injection of a corticosteroid and HA provided an overall favorable clinical outcome and some potential advantages (e.g. a short recovery time and few complications after the procedure), which deserve further investigation.</p><p>Corticosteroid injection into the sheath of the flexor tendons as a conservative treatment based on the anti-inflammatory effect of corticosteroids dates back to the 1950s. Since then, local corticosteroid injections have been assessed in many reports, with different outcomes, and long-term efficacy rates between 60% and 93% obtained with between one and four injections.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] As emphasized in the review by Kelly et al.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] no literature reports are currently available on the use of HA to treat stenosing tenosynovitis of the flexor tendons, but the results of our study appear to compare favorably with those obtained in other studies utilizing injection of methylprednisolone acetate. A retrospective review of 76 digits in 50 patients treated with methylprednisolone acetate or triamcinolone diacetate showed complete resolution of symptoms in 82% of digits for a mean follow-up period of 35 months.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] Of these, a single injection was needed for 42 digits, two injections for 11 digits, three injections for six digits, and four injections for three digits. A second study prospectively followed 77 digits in 58 patients for an average of 4.6 years following injection of methylprednisolone acetate.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] A total of 61% of digits showed complete resolution of symptoms after a single injection, 27% reported recurrent episodes, and 12% failed or required surgery because of early recurrence. Finally, a double-blind, randomized study showed a success rate of 60% in patients treated with injection of methylprednisolone acetate plus anesthetic compared with 16% in those treated with anesthetic alone (p = 0.02).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] However, in all of these studies, corticosteroid injection was not ultrasound-guided and no information regarding the severity of disease or duration of symptoms was reported, so direct comparison with our study cannot be made.</p><p>Such a wide variation in efficacy rates can be explained by many factors. Obviously, injection of the drug into the correct location will enhance the likelihood of a successful outcome and preclude many of the complications associated with the procedure. For this reason, ultrasound guidance is deemed the most accurate technique to ensure an optimal result, especially in an anatomically difficult location such as the hand, requiring injection into a virtual space such as the flexor tendon sheath, and avoiding iatrogenic injury.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] Corticosteroid administration carries the risk of complications such as adipose necrosis, skin depigmentation, dermal or epidermal atrophy, infection, and tendon rupture.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] These adverse effects have occurred following corticosteroid injection without ultrasound guidance; therefore, certain complications are presumably due to incorrect deployment of the drug,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] as well as direct tendon puncture and the undesired effects of corticosteroids.</p><p>The use of ultrasound-guided injection of corticosteroids and HA may be associated with a relevant cost (in Italy, about &#x020ac;180 if the procedure is performed outside the National Healthcare System, on a private basis [2010 values]). However, these costs are likely to be lower than those determined by the gold standard for the treatment of TF (i.e. open surgery). Moreover, ultrasound-guided injection of corticosteroids and HA appears, in this preliminary study, to be associated with a high proportion of patients achieving disease resolution and with a short recovery time (in turn reducing abstention from working and sporting activities), without significant post-procedural complications. These potential advantages should be taken into consideration for a full evaluation of the cost/benefit ratio of ultrasound-guided injection of corticosteroids and HA.</p><p>It is important to point out that this study has a number of limitations that must be acknowledged and discussed to better clarify the potential implications on future research. A lack of a corticosteroid-only treatment arm means that any benefits of adding HA to the regimen of injection compared with corticosteroid alone cannot be shown. In light of the promising results obtained in this investigation, further study comparing ultrasound-guided injection of corticosteroid plus HA with corticosteroid alone, or exploring other treatment strategies (e.g. no ultrasound-guided injection, corticosteroid only vs surgery) is recommended. Also, due to small patient numbers in this study, it is not possible to analyze for any trends in the duration of symptoms or number of injections and success rates. Further studies with a larger sample size are likely to provide new insights on the effectiveness and safety of ultrasound-guided injection of corticosteroid plus HA. It also must be acknowledged that, due to the explorative nature of this study and the low number of patients enrolled, neither a calculation of power nor a statistical comparison between groups were performed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Ultrasound-guided injection of corticosteroids and HA appears a safe and feasible option in the treatment of TF. While open surgery remains the reference treatment in terms of symptom resolution, the reduced need for physiotherapy and additional medications, suggesting lower costs, and in particular the short recovery time associated with ultrasound-guided injection of corticosteroids and HA may support a further evaluation of the use of this infiltrative therapy for the treatment of TF.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors declare no conflicts of interest that are directly relevant to the content of this study.</p><p>We thank Tracy Harrison and Luca Giacomelli of <italic>in</italic>Science Communications, a Wolters Kluwer business, who provided technical and native-English editing and journal styling prior to submission.
