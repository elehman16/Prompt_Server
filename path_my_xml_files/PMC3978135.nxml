One of the well-known complications of breast cancer treatment is secondary lymphedema; an accumulation of protein-rich interstitial fluid due to the insufficient capacity of the lymphatic system. Axillary lymph-node dissection and subsequent radiation therapy are the most common causes of arm lymphedema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The incidence of lymphedema as a sequelae to breast cancer treatment ranges from 6-50%, depending on the surgical procedure in the axilla and the type of the radiation therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The reported prevalence relies among other things on the definition of lymphedema and which techniques are used to measure it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Lymphedema occurs most often within the first year following the treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and 77% of the patients develop lymphedema within the first three years post-surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Lymphedema is a chronic condition and when untreated, the risk of worsening of the lymphedema over time in terms of volume and stage of tissue fibrosis increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition to the cosmetic deformities, lymphedema causes impaired physical mobility, mental discomfort, social isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], reduced quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and higher incidence of erysipelas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Physical therapy treatment of patients with lymphedema is based on the principles of &#x02018;Complete Decongestive Therapy&#x02019; (CDT). CDT consists of the following components; skin care, manual lymphatic drainage, bandaging and exercises. Traditionally, the bandages used in CDT have been short-stretch bandages. In Denmark, the most commonly used manual lymphatic drainage method is described by F&#x000f6;ldi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The treatment is based on manual lymphatic drainage 4&#x02013;5 times weekly and each treatment takes 30&#x02013;45&#x000a0;minutes. However, standardization between different treatment locations and among treating physiotherapists does not exist.</p><p>The scientific evidence regarding what type of treatment or combination of treatments is most effective is sparse. Studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] have focused on time-consuming manual lymphatic drainage, but the scientific evidence is not consistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The lack of robust evidence may be a contributory cause to the variation of available treatment options among different treatment locations and among treating physiotherapists.</p><p>This includes both the combination of treatment methods used and the time spent on each treatment. Furthermore, the type of bandages used varies. Traditionally, the patients receive the manual lymphatic drainage in combination with the replacement of the bandage i.e. 4&#x02013;5 times weekly, but a new type of bandage may only require replacement two or three times weekly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Reduced replacement of the bandage leads to fewer manual lymphatic drainage treatments and it is unknown whether use of the relatively new but fairly common bandage, Coban&#x02122;2 Lite, alone can constitute the treatment.</p><p>In a recent systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], the authors concluded that there was not sufficient scientific evidence supporting the use of manual lymphatic drainage in preventing or treating lymphedema. Furthermore, the authors found that the methodological quality of the studies reviewed was poor and with clinical and statistical inconsistencies between the various studies. Therefore, there is a need for well-designed, high quality studies with follow-up.</p><p>The hypothesis of this study is that skin care and guidance of physical activity combined with Coban&#x02122;2 Lite bandage alone is equally effective as Complete Decongestive Therapy including skincare and guidance of physical activity, manual lymphatic drainage and Coban&#x02122;2 Lite bandage.</p><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>Complete Decongestive Therapy is equally effective whether it includes manual lymphatic drainage or not in the treatment of arm lymphedema among patients with breast cancer.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Trial design</title><p>The study is a randomized, single blinded, equivalence trial aiming to determine whether an applied composite treatment is equally good if one of its components, manual lymphatic drainage, is removed.
