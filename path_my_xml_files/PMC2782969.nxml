Exercise energy cost, REE, leptin, adiponectin, cortisol, insulin, lactate, glucose, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs), and glycerol were determined at baseline, immediately after exercise, and during a 72-h recovery period.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>Exercise energy cost was lower in high-intensity than in low-intensity and moderate-intensity groups (221.6 &#x000b1; 8.8 vs. 295.6 &#x000b1; 10.7 and 281.6 &#x000b1; 9.8 kcal, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).

Obesity, a growing health concern, is characterized by low-grade inflammation, which is associated with insulin resistance and metabolic diseases such as diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>Leptin and adiponectin, adipose tissue&#x02013;derived cytokine proteins, are involved in insulin resistance and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Leptin improves fatty acid oxidation in muscle, regulates short-term carbohydrate intake, mediates energy balance and body weight, and upregulates resting energy expenditure (REE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Adiponectin is inversely related to body fatness and type 2 diabetes risk in healthy adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), has an anti-inflammatory action, and is involved in substrate metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Aging increases body fat and leptin levels probably owing to an upregulation of leptin gene expression and is characterized by a negative association between adiponectin and body fat distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>Exercise is believed to extend life-span by reducing the incidence of cardiovascular and other degenerative diseases and increases functional performance in older individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Regular exercise seems to create energy deficits that help to regulate body weight and fat on a long-term basis in older individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Chronic resistance exercise increases muscle tissue, reduces aging-related sarcopenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), and alters adipokine responses in elderly individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Acute resistance exercise may elevate lipid mobilization in subcutaneous adipose tissue, energy expenditure, and neuroendocrine responses of obese subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Although the American Diabetes Association endorses resistance exercise as a means of improving body composition and metabolic control in obesity and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), limited information exists regarding the acute effects of resistance exercise on adipokine and REE responses in aging. Therefore, the purpose of the present investigation was to explore <italic>1</italic>) the time course of leptin, adiponectin, and REE responses after a single resistance exercise bout in elderly individuals and 2) whether resistance exercise intensity represents an important factor in adipokine and REE responses in elderly individuals.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>Forty apparently healthy, older sedentary men (recruited from a volunteer database, by word of mouth and fliers sent to local medical practitioners, physiotherapists, and nursing homes) participated in a four-group randomized, repeated-measures, controlled trial.

In the present study, we monitored circulating leptin, adiponectin, and REE for as long as 72 h after a resistance exercise bout of different intensity configurations in overweight elderly individuals. The novel findings of this study are that in older men acute resistance exercise <italic>1</italic>) does not alter leptin responses, <italic>2</italic>) augments circulating adiponectin levels only if intensity is of a sufficient magnitude, <italic>3</italic>) increases REE for 24&#x02013;48 h in an intensity-dependent manner, and <italic>4</italic>) raises energy expenditure.</p><p>Leptin baseline values were higher than the corresponding values in lean young males but were lower than those observed in human obesity and insulin-resistant states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) because our sample had lower BMI and insulin sensitivity within the normal range as estimated by HOMA, which was used only for descriptive reasons. Leptin absolute values declined after resistance exercise, but these changes were abolished after their correction for hemoconcentration. Human studies that used cardiovascular exercise reported an acute leptin decline after high-intensity protocols but not after mild exercise protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), suggesting that the exercise program configuration (intensity, duration, and total volume) could explain discrepancies in previous findings. Our results in older men coincide with previous observations in young lean males, indicating that the circulating leptin concentration remains unaffected by variations in resistance exercise intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>Leptin seems to respond mainly to extreme exercise conditions, resulting in substantial hormonal perturbations and exercise energy cost (&#x0003e;800 kcal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). In this study, leptin remained unaltered despite pronounced metabolic and hormonal perturbations (NEFAs, glycerol, glucose, and cortisol increases) independent of intensity. Although increased glucose uptake by peripheral tissues in the presence of lactic acidosis may decrease blood leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), the increase in blood lactate (four- to ninefold) in the present study (indicative of increased glucose uptake) was not accompanied by a leptin decline. It is possible that these protocols did not induce adequate glucose uptake and utilization capable of reducing serum leptin.</p><p>Another plausible explanation for the absence of leptin changes is previous observations of leptin mRNA upregulation by hexosamines and inhibition of leptin decline by glucose infusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). An 8&#x02013;15% increase in glucose levels as observed in this study and a possible increase in hexosamine due to increased muscle glycolysis as reflected by the increased lactate concentrations may have inhibited a leptin decrease despite marked metabolic disturbances.</p><p>It is possible that the exercise energy cost magnitude is a more important factor than intensity for exercise-induced leptin responses. Leptin demonstrated a decline only when the exercise energy deficit was &#x0003e;800 kcal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Although there are no studies with older adults, leptin in young adults failed to change with resistance exercise or aerobic work that produced low to moderate energy deficits (150&#x02013;500 kcal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Resistance exercise in this study induced a 222- to 296-kcal deficit, which is well below the 800-kcal threshold. Others proposed a delayed (9&#x02013;48 h) leptin decline after exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Although we monitored leptin responses for 72 h, no changes were recorded. Therefore, an exercise energy cost threshold may be a prerequisite for exercise-induced leptin changes. Although leptin has been implicated in sarcopenic states such as aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), an anabolic intervention such as RE does not seem to alter it.</p><p>Adiponectin resting levels were close to the lower limit of its normal range (5&#x02013;20 &#x003bc;g/ml), which coincides with its corresponding values reported in human obesity (&#x0223c;6 &#x003bc;g/ml), suggesting possible reduced protein secretion with increasing fatness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Adiponectin data after acute resistance exercise in aging are not available. Adiponectin appears to remain unaltered in young individuals after cardiovascular exercise after correction for hemoconcentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>Acute plasma adiponectin perturbations are rarely noticed despite its substantial increase in subcutaneous tissue interstitial space during exercise because it requires a marked increase of adiponectin secretion rate due to its relatively large pool in plasma. Postexercise adiponectin changes have been measured only for short periods (&#x0003c;24 h). After exercise, adiponectin may need 24&#x02013;72 h to increase because perturbations in substrate metabolism require 24&#x02013;48 h to develop. In this study, adiponectin increased in the high-intensity group only after 12 h and remained marginally elevated for 24 h, confirming previous observations of a delayed postexercise increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Cardiovascular exercise seems to upregulate adiponectin levels only after high-intensity protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The adiponectin elevation in this study cannot be attributed to a circadian rhythm because the control group did not demonstrate any changes and adiponectin may not exhibit diurnal variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p><p>Adiponectin is related to increased insulin sensitivity, which is mainly attributed to increased fat oxidation and inhibition of hepatic glucose production, whereas exercise enhances insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). However, acute exercise studies reported a dissociation between adiponectin concentration and insulin sensitivity changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), whereas moderate-intensity resistance exercise does not appear to alter insulin sensitivity acutely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Given that adiponectin in this study increased in the high-intensity group and insulin sensitivity remained unaffected, one would suggest that in overweight elderly individuals, adiponectin is not associated with insulin sensitivity after exercise and its rise is related to other factors.</p><p>Adiponectin is negatively associated with insulin resistance, whereas acute high-intensity resistance may induce hyperglycemia and transient hyperinsulinemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Furthermore, insulin may inhibit adiponectin gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). However, adiponectin concentration increased in the absence of any discernible insulin changes, suggesting that its increase may not be mediated by insulin. Adiponectin concentration may be regulated acutely by NEFAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). However, adiponectin failed to change in the low- and moderate-intensity groups despite a marked NEFA elevation.</p><p>Low- and moderate-intensity resistance exercise resulted in a substantially greater metabolic stress than high-intensity resistance exercise based on greater lactate and cortisol responses, coinciding with earlier findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Protocols eliciting the greatest cortisol response also elicit the greatest acute growth hormone and lactate response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The lactate increase also coincides with a cortisol increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), suggesting that lactate may be a factor contributing to the cortisol increase seen with resistance exercise. It appears that cortisol responses to resistance exercise depend on metabolic requirements, which appear to be higher in the low- to moderate-intensity protocols, based on the lactate response and energy cost of these protocols. The greater lactate response in the low- and moderate-intensity groups is mainly attributed to the shorter resting intervals used by these groups, thereby allowing a lower lactate clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Therefore, adiponectin responses may be related to factors other than substrate metabolism during exercise because it remained unaltered in low- and moderate-intensity groups and increased only in the high-intensity group.</p><p>Based on previous observations of different adiponectin responses between trained and untrained individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and adiponectin elevation only after high-intensity resistance exercise in this study, we hypothesize that the amount of muscle tissue recruited may affect adiponectin responses. The reduced hepatic gluconeogenesis and muscle triglyceride levels after adiponectin therapy suggest that adiponectin may be implicated in the communication between adipose and muscle tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Moreover, adiponectin upregulates fat oxidation in skeletal muscle by activating AMP-activated protein kinase, which is related to muscle mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). These findings suggest that recruitment of greater muscle mass by high-intensity protocols may lead to a more pronounced adiponectin response in an attempt to regulate substrate utilization.</p><p>Aging decreases REE owing to age-associated sarcopenia, physical inactivity, and reduced energy intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Disproportionate REE reductions relative to daily energy intake may predispose to age-related increases in body fatness. Chronic resistance exercise may help to increase or maintain REE and add muscle mass during weight loss programs in older individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Although a prolonged REE elevation (24&#x02013;72 h) after resistance exercise has been documented in young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), there is limited information for overweight elderly individuals. Our results indicate that low- and moderate-intensity resistance exercise elevates REE for 24 h after exercise, whereas high-intensity resistance exercise induces a more prolonged (48-h) response. REE elevation has been attributed mainly to homeostatic perturbations that require energy to repair exercise-induced muscle trauma and support tissue hypertrophy. Maximal rates of muscle protein turnover may last 48 h after heavy resistance exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Because the energy cost of protein turnover may account for as much as 20% of resting metabolism, the energy utilization during the 48-h recovery period in this study may have been reflected in REE elevations. It is characteristic that the high-intensity protocol induced the greatest REE response and the lowest lipolytic response as reflected by glycerol and free fatty acid levels. The higher REE in the high-intensity scheme may be explained by the higher degree of muscle damage induced by the high-intensity resistance exercise protocols compared with protocols of lower intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Furthermore, muscle damage after exercise is accompanied by temporary decreased lipid oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>Resistance exercise prescription for the older, overweight population, is based on acute program variables, i.e., intensity, frequency (session/week), resting intervals, and type and number of exercises. To our knowledge, this is the first study to address the effect of resistance exercise intensity and frequency on various metabolic responses, suggesting that the residual effect of a single resistance exercise session is largely dependent on the intensity level of the protocol. The high-intensity protocol has a residual effect on REE and adipokines of 2 days and 1 day, respectively. In contrast, low- and moderate-intensity protocols demonstrate a shorter residual effect (12&#x02013;24 h). Therefore, for frail elderly individuals, we may prescribe moderate- to low-intensity schemes of higher frequency (daily or every other day), whereas for more advanced individuals, we can prescribe higher intensities with lower frequency (i.e., twice/week). Furthermore, it appears that even the lowest resistance exercise intensity may alter REE for several hours after exercise, an important finding for those who cannot tolerate intense loads.</p><p>It seems that high-intensity resistance exercise elicits a lower metabolic stress compared with lower-intensity schemes, suggesting that it may be suited for older populations. Because of a lower response of cortisol, a known catabolic hormone, high-intensity resistance exercise may provide a greater hypertrophic stimulus, which is crucial in the effort to offset aging-associated sarcopenia. The longer resting intervals adopted during high-intensity resistance exercise may better accommodate the older population with respect to lactate clearance in between work periods because less lactate accumulation has been associated with fatigue delay.</p><p>Our data show that acute resistance exercise induces an energy expenditure of &#x0223c;220&#x02013;300 kcal/session for overweight elderly men, suggesting that resistance exercise may be an important factor in overall weight management programs in elderly individuals. These numbers may aid personal trainers, physicians, and dietitians in estimating the day-to-day energy expenditure when resistance exercise is included in a weight loss program.</p><p>Chronic resistance exercise studies using different intensity levels are scarce. The most relevant study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) showed a leptin decline and an adiponectin and REE increase by moderate- to high-intensity resistance training. In the present study, we found an acute decrease in leptin levels only in the noncorrected values, although a trend for lower leptin values in the corrected leptin levels also remained during the first 12 h of postexercise recovery. Our data also show an acute increase only after acute high-intensity resistance exercise, even though higher, but nonsignificant, levels of adiponectin were detected after low- and moderate-intensity exercise within 12 h of recovery. Similarly, a REE rise was also observed in this acute study. It appears that acute resistance exercise elicits similar responses of these variables compared with chronic training in this population group.</p><p>In summary, resistance exercise does not alter circulating leptin concentration but increases REE and adiponectin in an intensity-dependent manner for as long as 48 and 24 h, respectively, in overweight elderly individuals. These findings indicate that overweight older men may benefit from training with a frequency of two to three resistance exercise sessions per week. In addition, it appears that all resistance exercise schemes induce marked energy expenditure.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges.
