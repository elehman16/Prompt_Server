Here we show in patients with focal hand dystonia that additional, new effects build up progressively over time, making it difficult to predict the effect of long term interventions from shorter treatment sessions. In a sham-controlled study, real or sham continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) was given once daily for five consecutive days to dorsolateral premotor cortex (PMd). Five days of real, but not sham, premotor cTBS improved intracortical inhibition in primary motor cortex (M1) to a similar extent on day 1 and day 5. However 5 days of cTBS were required to restore the abnormal PMd-M1 interactions observed on day 1. Similarly, excessive M1 plasticity seen at baseline was also significantly reduced by five days of real premotor cTBS. There was only a marginal benefit on writing. The results show that additional, new effects, at sites distant from the point of stimulation, build up progressively over time, making it difficult to predict the effect of long term interventions from shorter treatment sessions. The results indicate that it may take many days of therapeutic intervention to rebalance activity in a complex network.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Science Council (NSC 100-2314-B-182A-001-MY2, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://web1.nsc.gov.tw/mp.aspx?mp=7">http://web1.nsc.gov.tw/mp.aspx?mp=7</ext-link>); the National Health Research Institutes of Taiwan (NHRI-EX99-9913EC, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://english.nhri.org.tw/NHRI_WEB/nhriw001Action.do">http://english.nhri.org.tw/NHRI_WEB/nhriw001Action.do</ext-link>); Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CMRPG381281, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cgmh.org.tw/eng2002/index.asp">http://www.cgmh.org.tw/eng2002/index.asp</ext-link>); the Royal Society of the UK (UK-Taiwan Joint Project Grant, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://royalsociety.org/">http://royalsociety.org/</ext-link>); and the European Union grant REPLACES: Restorative Plasticity At Corticostriatal Excitatory Synapses: an FP7 Collaborative Project (222918, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.replaces-pd.org/">http://www.replaces-pd.org/</ext-link>).

Because studies have shown that the after-effects of stimulation can be prolonged when repeated sessions are given <xref rid="pone.0047574-Nyffeler1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0047574-Baumer1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, therapy is almost always designed around daily stimulation delivered for weeks or more. The effects of a single session of stimulation are often assumed as valid predictors of long-term changes that might be expected in a therapeutic protocol <xref rid="pone.0047574-Langguth1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However, there is some evidence that the effects of long-term treatment may differ in quality from those of a single session. In depression, effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in excess of those of placebo can only be observed after several weeks of treatment. Similarly, a progressively developing response to therapeutic brain stimulation can be observed after implantation of deep brain stimulation (DBS). Maximum clinical effects of DBS in dystonia, as well as Tourette syndrome and obsessive compulsive disorder, may take months to develop <xref rid="pone.0047574-Maciunas1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0047574-Collins1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Indeed, in dystonia, implantation of DBS may initiate progressive changes in underlying motor physiology that are not apparent when testing acutely <xref rid="pone.0047574-Ruge1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>The present experiments examined whether repeated sessions of rTMS can promote slow reorganisation in the motor system of patients with writer's cramp (WC). This is a clinically relevant condition in which rTMS to the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) has already been tested as a potential therapeutic intervention. Although small effects of a single session of have been reported <xref rid="pone.0047574-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, repetitive sessions over consecutive days are usually required for clearer therapeutic effects <xref rid="pone.0047574-Murase1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0047574-Borich1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. We ask whether repeated sessions of rTMS lead to cumulative effects on typical pathophysiological hallmarks of dystonia that cannot be observed after a single intervention.</p><p>Our intervention targeted PMd since functional imaging studies have often revealed that it is hyperactive during movement in patients with dystonia <xref rid="pone.0047574-Eidelberg1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0047574-Carbon1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. However the underlying mechanism of hyperactivity in PMd and its role in causing dystonia remain unclear. It could be an intrinsic premotor deficit or reflect abnormal interaction in a wider motor network. We therefore assessed effects of multisession premotor suppression on both premotor and motor cortex to gain some insight into possible motor network reorganisation in dystonia.</p><p>We applied cTBS to PMd for 5 days and measured effects on physiological markers of dystonia: the network interaction from PMd-M1, and the increased plasticity and reduced inhibition within M1 in WC patients <xref rid="pone.0047574-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047574-Quartarone1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0047574-Koch1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. cTBS is generally believed to suppress the stimulated cortex <xref rid="pone.0047574-Huang2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047574-Huang3" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, although recent reports using protocols slightly different from that used in the current study suggest that the response to TBS protocols is variable and the effect of cTBS may not be always inhibitory <xref rid="pone.0047574-Hamada1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0047574-Gentner1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. We hypothesised that PMd suppression might restore PMd-M1 connectivity. This would not only be evident as a normalisation in M1 intracortical inhibition as we have observed previously in a single session cTBS study <xref rid="pone.0047574-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, but also might reduce overactive M1 plasticity that is so common in dystonia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The experiments were performed with the approval of the Institutional Review Board of the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital.

The control experiment was performed at least one month apart from the main experiment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Data Recording</title><p>Subjects were seated in a comfortable chair. EMGs were recorded from the right FDI. Signals were sampled at 5 kHz, amplified with a gain of 1000 and 5000 and filtered (3 Hz to 2 kHz). The surface EMG of the FDI was continuously monitored by an oscilloscope throughout the experiments. Trials in which the target muscle was not relaxed were rejected online.</p><p>Single- and paired-pulse TMS was given using a 70 mm figure-of-eight coil connected to a Magstim BiStim<sup>2</sup> (Magstim Co., UK), whereas TBS was produced by a Magstim Rapid<sup>2</sup> Package through another 70 mm figure-of-eight coil. The coil was placed over the left hemisphere tangentially to the scalp with the handle pointing backwards. The &#x0201c;motor hot-spot&#x0201d; was defined as the location where TMS produced the largest MEP from FDI. RMT was defined as the minimum stimulation intensity over the hot-spot that could elicit an MEP of no less than 50 uV in five out of ten trials. Active motor threshold (AMT) was defined as the minimum stimulation intensity over the &#x0201c;motor hot-spot&#x0201d; that could elicit an MEP of greater than 200 &#x000b5;V in five out of ten trials during voluntary contraction of FDI. MEP assessment was assessed with single-pulse TMS in trains of 12 pulses (unless specified) given every 4.5&#x02013;5.5 seconds, and the intensity was set to that required to produce an MEP of approximately 1 mV in the baseline condition and remained unchanged throughout the experiment.</p><sec id="s2d1"><title>Theta burst stimulation (TBS)</title><p>Two TBS protocols were used in the present study: cTBS600 and cTBS300 that contains 3-pulse 50 Hz bursts at 80% AMT given every 200 ms for 40 s and for 20 s, respectively <xref rid="pone.0047574-Huang2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047574-Fang1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047574-Huang4" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. cTBS600 was given over left PMd, which was located as being 2.5 cm anterior to the &#x0201c;motor hot-spot&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0047574-Gerschlager1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047574-Huang5" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, while cTBS300 was given over the left M1.</p><p>In the sham stimulation, the coil was flipped over to stimulate with the flip side and the stimulus intensity was reduced to 60% of AMT.

Subjects were instructed to trace as quickly as possible and avoid errors if possible. All subjects practiced twice before assessment.

On the first day of premotor stimulation, cTBS600 over PMd enhanced SICI, but failed to suppress MEPs in dystonic patients. After five consecutive days of premotor stimulation, cTBS600 over PMd successfully reduced the size of MEPs, although the amount of SICI was not further enhanced. In addition, the excessive plasticity-like effect induced by cTBS300 over M1 disappeared after five days of real, but not sham, premotor stimulation. Patients who had real stimulation reported a better subjective improvement than those had sham stimulation. However, this was not evident in the objective measures of writing performance: both real and sham premotor stimulation improved in writing speed and spiral maze tests.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>PMd-M1 Interaction</title><p>The lack of effect of premotor cTBS600 on M1 excitability on the first day of stimulation confirms that the PMd-M1 interaction is reduced in dystonia <xref rid="pone.0047574-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047574-Koch1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047574-Huang6" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The new data shows that the suppressive effect of premotor cTBS on M1 excitability can be restored to some extent after five daily sessions of premotor cTBS600. Many imaging studies have reported PMd hyperactivity in dystonia, and this is possibly compensated by reduced PMd-M1 interactions. If 5 days of premotor cTBS600 reduced overactivity of PMd this would reverse the process and normalise PMd-M1 interaction. An alternative possibility, that PMd is hyperactive because of reduced PMd-M1 interaction seems less likely, since suppression of PMd could occur without affecting PMd-M1 interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>SICI/ICF</title><p>As reported previously <xref rid="pone.0047574-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, premotor cTBS600 enhanced abnormal SICI towards normal levels in WC patients even on day 1 stimulation. However, there was no further improvement in SICI after five-days of PMd stimulation: after premotor cTBS the amounts of SICI are very close to the values in healthy subjects tested with the same protocol <xref rid="pone.0047574-Huang5" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Hence, it is likely that a single session of premotor cTBS600 has reached the maximum effect that premotor cTBS600 can have on SICI in dystonia, and multisession stimulation brings no further improvement. There was no difference in the amount of SICI immediately before premotor cTBS on day 5 compared with baseline SICI on day1, indicating that repeated sessions of premotor cTBS do not produce longer-lasting (&#x0003e;24 hrs) effects on SICI. However, since drugs were withdrawn 24 hours before the first cTBS600 session, we cannot exclude the possibility that the longer period of benzodiazepine withdrawal on Day 5 counteracts the effect of multisession premotor stimulation on GABAergic SICI.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Motor Cortex Plasticity</title><p>In the baseline condition, cTBS300 over M1 produced an excessive plasticity-like response in patients as reported previously with a variety of protocols <xref rid="pone.0047574-Quartarone1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047574-Edwards1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Interestingly, cTBS300 over M1 no longer produced an after-effect on MEP size after five days of premotor stimulation. This combination of restored PMd-M1 interaction together with reduced M1 plasticity mimics the pattern that we had previously observed in non-clinically manifesting DYT1 mutation carriers <xref rid="pone.0047574-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047574-Edwards1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. A reduced M1 plasticity responding to paired associative stimulation is also seen in dystonic patients after DBS <xref rid="pone.0047574-Ruge2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047574-Tisch1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Hence modification of motor cortex plasticity could be one of the underlying mechanisms of the therapeutic benefit caused by rTMS over the premotor area <xref rid="pone.0047574-Murase1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0047574-Borich1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Interpretation of the mechanism of the effect of 5 days' premotor cTBS600 on motor plasticity was, however, slightly complex. Our control experiment showed that a single session of premotor cTBS600 in healthy individuals abolished their response to the motor plasticity protocol even when it was tested 2 hrs later. In contrast, the effect of a single session was minimal in patients; 5 consecutive sessions of premotor cTBS600 were required before it abolished motor cortex plasticity as in healthy subjects. We suggest that the smaller effect seen in dystonic patients on day 1 was due to reduced PMd-M1 connectivity at that time. Five days of premotor stimulation restored the connectivity and therefore restored the modulatory effect of premotor cTBS600 on motor plasticity. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that an overactive premotor cortex requires repetitive suppression to show consequent reduction in motor plasticity.</p><p>The mechanism whereby premotor stimulation modulates motor plasticity is unknown. One possibility is that the premotor area modulates motor plasticity though heterosynaptic metaplasticity, a mechanism in which the history of synaptic activity not only alters subsequent synaptic plasticity in activated synapses but also in neighboring non-activated synapses <xref rid="pone.0047574-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047574-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. cTBS600 over PMd may lead to a form of heterosynaptic metaplasticity that changes the threshold for, or degree of response to cTBS300 over M1. The lack of such heterosynatic metaplasticity in our patients may coincide with the impaired homeostatic plasticity within M1 of WC patients <xref rid="pone.0047574-Quartarone2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. It may be surprising to see the effect on cTBS is still present after 2 hr of premotor stimulation. However, the effect of metaplasticity is commonly seen after a protocol producing no plasticity effect on its own <xref rid="pone.0047574-Abraham1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047574-Siebner1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> or after the end of detectable plasticity <xref rid="pone.0047574-Jung1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Clinical Effects of Premotor Stimulation</title><p>Although this study was not designed as a clinical trial we did note that patients in the real group reported a more significant subjective improvement than those in the sham group, although this was not observed using objective measures of writing. This discrepancy implies either that the clinical improvement observed in the present study is contaminated by a placebo or learning effect or that the writing scores were insufficiently sensitive and the patient number is too small to detect relevant clinical changes.</p><p>Given the cumulative physiological effects of daily stimulation, it is possible that further sessions of premotor stimulation could further enhance clinical effects and distinguish sham and real groups. Similar delayed therapeutic benefit is found with DBS. DBS usually improves dystonia after weeks to months of continuous stimulation, whereas its physiological effect on synaptic plasticity occurs earlier <xref rid="pone.0047574-Ruge2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>In the sham group, we used the flip side of coil at a reduced intensity to deliver TBS. It feels and looks very similar to the real stimulation as compared to that tilts the coil away from the scalp or uses a sham coil with sound mimicking. Although the reduced intensity (from 80% to 60% AMT) may produce slightly different scalp sensation, subjects can barely distinguish between them when sessions are several days apart from each other. As a result, the lack of effect on all the physiological investigations even after five days of sham stimulation suggests that stimulating with a flip side coil is a good option for physiological investigations. However, we cannot fully rule out that the clinical improvement in the sham group was because of the very low stimulus intensity produced by the flip side coil.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present data show that multisession stimulation may not always prolong or enhance the effect of a single session. Indeed, in the present case, the effect on SICI observed after a single session was no different after 5 daily sessions. In contrast, multisession stimulation modulated the motor networks more extensively than a single session by restoring PMd-M1 interaction and reducing M1 plasticity. Thus testing with just a single session of rTMS may not give true insight into long-term effects of multisession stimulation. Moreover, the findings support previous arguments that clinical benefits of real stimulation could be further separated from those of sham by increasing the number of sessions, and provides a clearer rationale for using multisession brain stimulation to treat not only dystonia but also other diseases.</p><p>Finally, the present study provides additional physiological evidence that the premotor cortex is a potential target site for therapeutic intervention in the disordered motor networks of dystonia. It also highlights the potential importance of network-wide changes following intervention at a single site. Not only did we see changes in PMd-M1 connectivity but also in the response to plasticity protocols in M1. Given their potential benefits, remote effects from one area to another area deserve further study and may be relevant for treatment of related neurological disorders <xref rid="pone.0047574-Huang7" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0047574-Nyffeler1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
