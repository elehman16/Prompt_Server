This study aimed to investigate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles and tolerability of evogliptin after repeated oral administration in healthy subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and methods</title><p>A block-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose, dose-escalation study was performed in a total of 30 subjects. Repeated once-daily doses of 5, 10, or 20 mg evogliptin or the same doses of placebo were orally administered to ten subjects in each dosage group for 10 days. Subjects in each group were randomized to receive evogliptin or placebo with a ratio of 8:2. Pharmacokinetics of evogliptin were evaluated, with its concentrations in serial plasma and urine samples collected following the first and last administrations. DPP-IV activity and glucagon-like peptide-1, glucose, and insulin levels were quantified to evaluate evogliptin&#x02019;s pharmacodynamics on the first and last dosing days.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All participants completed the study without any serious or severe adverse event. The evogliptin plasma concentration reached its peak within 4&#x02013;5 hours and decreased relatively slowly, with a terminal elimination half-life of 33&#x02013;39 hours. Repeated administration resulted in a 1.4- to 1.5-fold accumulation. Evogliptin&#x02019;s systemic exposure and inhibition of plasma DPP-IV activity increased in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of DPP-IV activity &#x0003e;80% was sustained over 24 hours in all evogliptin dose groups and provided an increase in postprandial active glucagon-like peptide-1 levels by 1.5- to 2.4-fold. Postprandial glucose levels in the evogliptin-treated groups were reduced 20%&#x02013;35% compared to placebo, but were not accompanied by increased insulin levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Repeated administration of evogliptin in healthy subjects was well tolerated and exhibited linear pharmacokinetics within the 5&#x02013;20 mg dose range. A once-daily regimen of 5&#x02013;20 mg evogliptin effectively inhibited DPP-IV activity.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>DPP-IV</kwd><kwd>GLP-1</kwd><kwd>insulin</kwd><kwd>glucagon-like peptide-1</kwd><kwd>glucose</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The International Diabetes Federation reported that the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in 2013 was 382 million and will rise to 592 million by 2035.<xref rid="b1-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Type 2 DM is a chronic progressive disorder with metabolic abnormalities that results from pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell dysfunction and peripheral resistance to insulin. The treatment goal of DM is to keep blood glucose levels within the normal range and to prevent macrovascular or microvascular complications such as coronary heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, amputation, and retinopathy.<xref rid="b2-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> However, maintaining long-term intensive blood glucose control without adverse events (AEs) is challenging in many patients with type 2 DM despite mono- or combination therapy with several classes of antihyperglycemic agents.<xref rid="b3-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors were introduced in the last decade as a novel class of antihyperglycemic agents whose mechanism of action is distinguishable from the other available agents. The agents in this class reduce blood glucose level by inhibiting the DPP-IV enzyme, which is primarily responsible for the rapid degradation of incretin hormones including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide.<xref rid="b4-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Incretins are gut hormones that are released in response to food intake and that induce the synthesis and release of insulin according to glucose level, thereby reducing blood glucose level after a meal.<xref rid="b5-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In addition, increased incretin levels, particularly of GLP-1, increase &#x003b2;-cell mass, potentiate the induction of small islets, and stimulate islet neogenesis in the pancreas.<xref rid="b7-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Evogliptin (DA-1229) is a piperazine derivative that is in clinical development as a novel DPP-IV inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 DM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-dddt-8-1709">Figure 1</xref>).<xref rid="b8-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b11-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The DPP-IV inhibition of evogliptin was demonstrated to be reversible, highly potent, and selective in in vitro studies.<xref rid="b8-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> It has the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) value of 0.9 in human plasma for DPP-IV, with a 6,000 times higher potency compared to human DPP-VIII and DPP-IX, as well as with more than 20,000 times greater potency compared to human DPP-I, DPP-II, fibroblast activation protein-alpha (FAP&#x003b1;), antiphagocytic protein 1 (APP1), prolidase, and granzyme B.<xref rid="b8-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b10-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The interaction of evogliptin with DPP-IV has been proposed to occur through noncovalent binding, such as with linagliptin.<xref rid="b8-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Evogliptin improved insulin sensitivity in high fat diet-fed mice, delayed the onset of diabetes in young leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice, and increased &#x003b2;-cell replication and neogenesis in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice.<xref rid="b9-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> According to in vitro studies, evogliptin is not an inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 nor an inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4, although its metabolism is primarily mediated by CYP3A4.<xref rid="b8-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> As part of the clinical development of evogliptin, the tolerability and the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of single-dose regimens were characterized in healthy volunteers.<xref rid="b11-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Evogliptin displayed dose-proportional PKs and good tolerability within the dose range of 1.25&#x02013;60 mg. The DPP-IV inhibition increased in a dose-dependent manner, and remained &#x0003e;80% over 24 hours after a single administration of 10&#x02013;60 mg evogliptin. The objective of the present study was to assess the PK/PD properties of evogliptin after multiple oral doses in normoglycemic, healthy volunteers. Information from these studies should help to characterize the PK/PD profiles of evogliptin and to define the dosing recommendations to support regulatory submissions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The present study was conducted at the Clinical Trials Center of Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) in Seoul, Republic of Korea.

All the study procedures were conducted according to the recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki on biomedical research involving human subjects.</p><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p>Thirty healthy, Korean, male subjects were enrolled in this study. Subjects with significant medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal disease, hepatic disease, renal disease, respiratory disease, endocrine disease, psychiatric problems, or a history of alcohol and/or drug abuse, were excluded from the study. Furthermore, subjects with family histories of diabetes were also excluded. The subjects were determined to be healthy based on the results of a physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG), serology, urinary drug screening, and routine clinical laboratory tests (hematology, blood coagulation, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis), which were performed within 21 days prior to the first administration of the study drug. Ingestion of any prescribed medication within 2 weeks or over-the-counter drugs within 1 week before the beginning of the study was also reason for exclusion. The subjects had only the standard meals with fixed calories and composition of nutrients (2,300 kcal/day with 60%&#x02013;65% carbohydrate, 15% protein, and 20%&#x02013;25% fat), which were provided by the Clinical Trials Center during the admission period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>The present study was conducted as a block-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose, dose-escalation study. The study participants were placed into three groups, with ten subjects (including two placebo subjects) per group. Each group was administered 5, 10, or 20 mg of the study drug or the same dose of the placebo once a day for 10 days. The administered doses in this study were determined based on the results of the previously performed single-dose study.<xref rid="b11-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In the single-dose study, the subjects receiving a single dose of &#x02265;10 mg evogliptin exhibited &#x0003e;80% DPP-IV inhibition for &#x0003e;24 hours. Dose escalation proceeded only after assessment of the safety and tolerability of the previous dose. After fully explaining the study procedures, written informed consent was obtained from all subjects prior to beginning the study. At the baseline visit the day before drug administration, the laboratory test results of the eligible subjects were reevaluated. After overnight fasting, the study drug was administered once daily at 9 am with 240 mL of water for 10 consecutive days except on day 2, on which the study drug was administered at 11 am, because blood was collected to test for active GLP-1, glucose, and insulin levels before and after a morning meal. On days 1 and 10, the subjects fasted for 4 hours after drug administration, and water was allowed 2 hours after drug administration. The subjects who did not exhibit any clinically relevant changes were discharged on day 15, after the scheduled procedures were conducted, and these subjects visited the study center for the post-study visit on days 18, 19, or 20.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety and tolerability assessments</title><p>A safety assessment was conducted for all subjects who were administered any investigational product. AEs were identified by asking general health-related questions or voluntary reporting by the subjects during the study. To assess the tolerability of evogliptin, a clinical evaluation of vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressures, heart rate), physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests (hematology, blood coagulation, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis), and 12-lead ECGs were performed at predefined intervals throughout the study. Computerized impedance cardiography was also performed to monitor the effects of evogliptin on cardiac index, stroke volume, and systemic vascular resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Blood and urine collection</title><p>Blood samples (8 mL) were collected to analyze the evogliptin PKs and to assess DPP-IV activity according to the following schedule: pre-dose (0), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 16 hours after the first administration on day 1; each pre-dose (0 hour) on day 2 to day 9; pre-dose (0 hour) and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 96, and 120 hours after the last administration on day 10.

The causal relationships between the drug and AEs were judged based on the temporal sequences from the drug administration, the response after discontinuation of the drug, the well-known effects of the study drug or of other drugs in the same class, and explanations from study participants or from other environmental factors. Of the AEs occurring during the study, six were considered to be related to the study drug: fatigue, insomnia, epigastric discomfort, oral mucosa erosion, headache, and high urinary frequency. No serious AEs were reported during the study, and all AEs were mild in severity. All subjects who experienced AEs recovered without concomitant medication or management, except for one subject who was concomitantly medicated with topical policresulen for oral mucosal erosion. No subject discontinued the study due to a clinical adverse experience and no clinically significant changes in the clinical laboratory results, vital signs, computerized impedance cardiography, or ECG were observed.</p></sec><sec><title>PKs</title><p>The PK parameters of evogliptin after the first and last doses are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-dddt-8-1709">Table 3</xref>.

Both incretin-based therapies have several advantages over most classical antidiabetic agents, such as a low risk of hypoglycemia, no weight gain, and improvement in &#x003b2;-cell function.<xref rid="b12-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Compared to GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP-IV inhibitors are orally available, less expensive, and have better tolerance profiles; cause fewer digestive AEs: and cause neither local reactions nor formation of antibodies, although they are slightly less potent in terms of reductions of HbA<sub>1c</sub>, appetite, and body weight, with no effect on gastric emptying delay.<xref rid="b14-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b16-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>Evogliptin shares similar properties with already marketed DPP-IV inhibitors, such as sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, alogliptin, and linagliptin. Evogliptin is a small molecule that is orally available and has demonstrated a similar mode of action in preclinical studies.<xref rid="b8-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b11-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In healthy volunteers, its systemic exposure and effects on plasma DPP-IV inhibition increased in a dose-dependent manner.<xref rid="b11-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> At steady state with the investigational regimens of this study (once-daily administration of 5&#x02013;20 mg), plasma DPP-IV inhibition &#x0003e;80% was sustained over 24 hours by evogliptin. This finding supports the rationale for the use of a once-daily regimen of evogliptin.</p><p>Evogliptin also exhibits several discriminative aspects in PKs and PDs from other DPP-IV inhibitors. The T<sub>max</sub> of evogliptin was 4&#x02013;5 hours, which is longer than the T<sub>max</sub> of other DPP-IV inhibitors, of 1&#x02013;4 hours.<xref rid="b17-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> However, plasma DPP-IV inhibition rapidly surpassed 80% within 0.5&#x02013;1 hour after administration. Despite its late T<sub>max</sub>, the PDs of evogliptin were not delayed, owing to its high potency to plasma DPP-IV enzyme with relatively low IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.9 nM in in vitro study and 2.3 nM in this clinical trial with healthy volunteers; the IC<sub>50</sub> of sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, alogliptin, and linagliptin were 19 nM, 62 nM, 50 nM, 24 nM, and 1 nM, respectively in the previous studies.<xref rid="b18-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The degree of plasma DPP-IV inhibition in this study correlated well with the plasma concentration of evogliptin without hysteresis. This finding was consistent with the binding characteristics of evogliptin, which are competitive and reversible. The terminal elimination half-life (T<sub>1/2,ss</sub>) of evogliptin of 32.9&#x02013;38.8 hours is in between that of linagliptin (120 hours) and other DPP-IV inhibitors (2&#x02013;21 hours).<xref rid="b19-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The renal clearance and fraction excreted unchanged in urine 15.0&#x02013;16.8 L/h and 27%&#x02013;34%, respectively, are comparable to those of vildagliptin and saxagliptin.<xref rid="b20-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Evogliptin reached a steady-state concentration within 3 days and accumulated only a small amount with an accumulation index of 1.38&#x02013;1.50. The evogliptin regimens that were investigated in this study were comparable to those for saxagliptin and linagliptin (5 mg once daily) in other studies, and with smaller doses than for sitagliptin and vildagliptin (100 mg once daily).<xref rid="b17-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Evogliptin increased the postprandial GLP-1 levels by 1.5- to 2.4-fold and decreased the postprandial glucose levels to 20%&#x02013;35% compared to placebo in healthy volunteers. The major mechanism of the glucose-lowering effect of GLP-1 is enhanced insulin secretion.<xref rid="b22-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> However, postprandial insulin levels did not increase in this study despite the known insulinotropic effect of GLP-1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-dddt-8-1709">Figure 6</xref> presents the temporal relationships for GLP-1 versus glucose, GLP-1 versus insulin, and glucose versus insulin. Counterclockwise hysteresis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-dddt-8-1709">Figure 6A</xref> and B shows that there was a time delay between GLP-1 on the x-axis and glucose or insulin, respectively, on the y-axis; the changes in GLP-1 level occurred prior to the changes in glucose or insulin levels. In contrast, no definite time delay was observed in the relationship for glucose versus insulin in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-dddt-8-1709">Figure 6C</xref>. This shows that the reciprocal regulation between glucose and insulin occurred in an immediate, intimate, and exquisite manner. Therefore, we suggest that postprandial insulin levels in the evogliptin treatment groups might have been regulated by their lower postprandial glucose levels, which were primarily influenced by the noninsulin-dependent glucose-lowering effects of GLP-1. In this study, insulin levels were more strongly influenced by the insulin-regulatory effect of glucose than by the insulinotropic effects of GLP-1. This glucose-lowering effect of GLP-1, without causing an increase in insulin release, has been previously reported by Flint et al.<xref rid="b23-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In their study, GLP-1 in physiologic concentrations greatly diminished the rate of entry of nutrients into the circulation by a reduction of gastric emptying rate in obese subjects. Knauf et al reported that GLP-1 increased glucose uptake into muscle even in muscle insulin receptor knock-out mice by signaling in the central nervous system.<xref rid="b24-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>The degree of increase in postprandial GLP-1, glucose, and insulin tended to be greater after lunch and breakfast compared to after dinner. Furthermore, this finding was consistently observed in the placebo group. Similarly, Lindgren et al observed that the increase in glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and GLP-1 secretion in healthy subjects over the first 30 minutes after a standardized meal was markedly (&#x0223c;80%) greater in the morning than in the afternoon.<xref rid="b25-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> They suggested that this increase might be related to diurnal variability in the activity of autonomic nerves or gastrointestinal motility, or in the levels of growth hormone and cortisol. In the present study, the increase in postprandial GLP-1 levels was markedly lower in the evening and was comparable in the morning and in the afternoon. Because the subjects were fasted over 12 hours before lunch and breakfast and for fewer than 6 hours before dinner on the study days, we suggest that these differences might be caused by the duration of fasting period before meal ingestion in regard to gastrointestinal smooth muscle activity or secretion of digestive juices, etc, rather than by the diurnal variability related to daily physical activity or hormonal rhythms, etc. The diurnal variation in postprandial glucose levels was parallel to that in GLP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-dddt-8-1709">Figure 5B</xref>). However, the diurnal variation in postprandial insulin levels was not parallel to those in postprandial GLP-1 and glucose levels. Postprandial insulin levels were prominently greater at breakfast (the third peak in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-dddt-8-1709">Figure 5C</xref>) than at lunch or dinner in all treatment groups. In other words, the insulin:glucose ratio at breakfast was higher than at lunch or dinner in this study. Similarly, the lower insulin:glucose ratio at dinner, compared to that at breakfast, has been reported by several researchers since the 1970s.<xref rid="b26-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b28-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Saad et al reported that lower hepatic insulin extraction and higher insulin sensitivity at breakfast than at lunch or dinner were related to a diurnal pattern in glucose tolerance in healthy humans.<xref rid="b29-dddt-8-1709" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>The results of the present study could not demonstrate any counterregulatory hormonal responses, because the levels of the counterregulatory hormones, including glucagon, adrenaline, growth hormone, and cortisol, were not measured in this study. This study was conducted in a small population of subjects with normal glucose tolerance for a short treatment duration. Therefore, further studies to investigate the efficacy and pharmacologic responses of evogliptin in patients with type 2 DM should be conducted for drug development. Based on the findings of the present study, once-daily dosing regimens of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg evogliptin were used in a multicenter Phase II clinical trial in patients with type 2 DM.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present PK/PD and tolerability study represents the first assessment of multiple doses of evogliptin in human subjects.
