Five relevant studies have been performed examining clinical symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0151055.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. All of these studies were based on a limited number of patients, varying between 16 and 47 participants. Cashew-allergic patients most frequently show skin symptoms, followed by respiratory and gastro-intestinal symptoms. Studies have shown that a small amount of cashew nut allergen may cause severe clinical reactions, suggesting a high potency of this nut, comparable to that of other tree nuts and peanuts [<xref rid="pone.0151055.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The study by Davoren et al. reported that 30% of the peanut and 74% of the cashew nut sensitised patients with peanut and tree nut allergy developed an anaphylactic reaction after allergen ingestion. Moreover, in this study, 5 of 27 patients with cashew nut allergy experienced an allergic reaction after only skin or mucosal contact. One of these five patients developed anaphylaxis [<xref rid="pone.0151055.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Clinical history, combined with the outcome of a skin prick test (SPT) and/or specific IgE (sIgE) test, is often used to establish the diagnosis of cashew nut allergy. The gold standard, however, is the double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) test.</p><p>The objectives of this study were to assess the clinical relevance of cashew nut sensitisation, to study the clinical reaction patterns and the severity of symptoms during the DBPCFC tests with cashew nut and to establish the amount of cashew nut that can elicit an allergic reaction.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study design and patient selection</title><p>This study was a collaboration of three tertiary care centres for food allergy and the Research Centre Wageningen, the Netherlands. Consecutive new children and children known to have a sensitisation to cashew nut (sIgE and/or SPT) and a history of previous reaction(s) to cashew nut or unknown exposure were asked to participate in this study. More than 1000 children from this tertiary care population between 2 and 17 years of age were asked to participate. Approximately 1 in 3 parents of children who responded to the invitation (40%), agreed. Children with high sIgE (&#x02265; 100 kU/l) to cashew nut and/or anaphylactic reactions after cashew nut ingestion in the past were also included. Sensitised children who could tolerate cashew nuts were excluded. All children were included in the study between May 2012 and March 2015. The last enrolled child finished the study in May 2015.

The medical history questionnaire contained 54 questions about general health, asthma and eczema. Also food allergies other than cashew nut allergy were evaluated by questions about the symptoms, the time between exposure and reaction, and the amount of allergenic food that caused the reaction. The dietary history questionnaire (12 questions) was used to identify allergic reactions in the past caused by cashew nut consumption. The type and severity of reaction was extensively evaluated and the amount of cashew nut causing the reaction was determined. The time between the reaction in history and the intake was also checked.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Skin prick test</title><p>The children underwent a SPT with cashew nut, pistachio nut, hazelnut, peanut, mango and birch pollen extracts, a positive control (histamine 10 mg/ml ALK-Abello, Nieuwegein, the Netherlands) in duplicate and a negative control. All the extracts, except birch pollen (ALK 10.000 BU), were made according to a previously described method [<xref rid="pone.0151055.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Cashew nuts (roasted, unsalted) and pistachio nuts, hazelnuts and peanuts (fresh, not roasted, unsalted nuts) were homogenised mechanically, ground with a mortar and pestle, defatted by ether extraction, and subsequently the extracts were air-dried. A 10% w/v extract in PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) with the pre-treated material was made and stored at -20&#x000b0;C in small aliquots. Before testing the aliquots were defrosted and mixed. Mango juice was prepared from small pieces of ripe mango fruit pulp, without skin or kernel.</p><p>SPTs were performed by applying a drop of the allergen extract on the skin of the volar part of the forearm. The extract was pierced through the skin barrier with a lancet. Twenty minutes after the skin tests, the contours of the wheal were encircled with a fine-tip pen and transferred to a record sheet by translucent tape. The area of the wheals was determined by using a scanner device (Hewlett Packard 2400c) in combination with software previously developed in our centre: Precise Automated Area Measurement of Skin Test (PAAMOST).

The test food was administered in increasing amounts of 8 doses at time intervals of 30 minutes.

Roasted cashew nuts were provided by Intersnack, Doetinchem, the Netherlands. NIZO Food Research, Ede, the Netherlands prepared the low-fat food matrix (muffin dough). The food matrix predominantly consisted of wheat, sugar, gingerbread spice mix and coconut. The total volume/weight of the cashew nut gingerbread was 120 grams. The starting dose consisted of 1 mg cashew protein, followed by increasing doses of 3, 10, 30, 100, 300, 1000, 1736 mg cashew protein. Dose 8 consisted of the remainder of the 120 grams cashew nut gingerbread recipe.

We performed a DBPCFC test with cashew nut in this group, to measure the clinical relevance of sensitisation, to investigate the severity of the allergic reaction to cashew nut and the dosage of cashew nut to which they react.</p><p>More than 75% of the children sensitised to cashew nuts showed a clinical response in the DBPCFC test. This percentage is much higher than that observed in a previous other cashew nut study that analysed the clinical features of 42 children with a clinical history suggestive of cashew nut allergy, and a positive skin prick test (SPT) and/or a positive specific sIgE and/or a previous positive food challenge test [<xref rid="pone.0151055.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Only in 8 (19%) of these children a cashew nut allergy could be confirmed with a positive challenge test. The percentage of a clinically relevant sensitisation to cashew nut in our study was also higher compared to the results of studies with other food allergens such as hazelnut. A study by Flinterman et al. showed that of the 28 children sensitised to hazelnut, a DBPCFC test could only confirm a hazelnut allergy in half of the patients [<xref rid="pone.0151055.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. During the challenge test in our study, most patients experienced gastro-intestinal symptoms, with skin manifestations as the second most prevalent symptom. This is in contrast to other studies on cashew-allergic patients in which skin symptoms were observed more frequently than respiratory and gastro-intestinal symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0151055.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Sixty-three percent of the children tested reported a history of allergic reactions to cashew nuts in our study. However, a cashew nut allergy could not be confirmed with the DBPCFC test in almost 20% of the children with a positive history. Half of these children experienced the last allergic symptoms to cashew nut between one month and two years ago. A negative oral food challenge test after positive testing and/or positive history is reported between 9% and 38% for peanut allergy [<xref rid="pone.0151055.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0151055.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Children with a positive history and negative testing may have outgrown their allergy or may have an unreliable history. In addition personal co-factors or differences in exposure may account for this discrepancy. Accidental ingestion of cashew nut is not very likely as they are incorporated in products in an unrecognisable form less often than peanut or hazelnut.</p><p>With the first dosage of only 1 mg of cashew protein, 46% of the children experienced subjective and 11% objective symptoms. The food allergy threshold study by Blom et al. with 363 DBPCFC tests showed that the number of patients with any type of symptoms caused by 1 mg cashew nut-, hazelnut-, egg-, milk- and peanut protein varied between 5 and 20% [<xref rid="pone.0151055.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The number of patients with objective symptoms to 1 mg hazelnut protein was reported in 10% of the patients and was comparable with our results for cashew nut. The number of patients reported with objective symptoms to 1 mg egg-, milk- and peanut protein was lower compared with cashew nut in our study. This confirms the potency and thus the potentially dangerous nature of cashew nut compared to other allergens.</p><p>Almost 40% of the children in our study showed anaphylactic reactions and 6% of these children was treated with epinephrine. Anaphylaxis was observed in 17% of the children with the start of the allergic reaction to the first dose (1 mg cashew nut protein). A previous threshold study demonstrated that approximately 5% of 257 peanut allergic patients reacted to 1 mg peanut protein with severe symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0151055.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, our study supports previous observations, showing that minimal amounts of cashew nut are sufficient to cause these severe allergic reactions.</p><p>Cashew nut, pistachio nut and mango belong to the <italic>Anacardiaceae</italic> family and are thus botanically related. In line with previous reports, this study shows a high rate of co-sensitisation between cashew nuts and pistachio nuts in SPT and sIgE (respectively 92% and 98%) [<xref rid="pone.0151055.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0151055.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Almost 50% (21/42) of our pistachio nut sensitized and exposed children reported allergic reactions to pistachio nuts.</p><p>Many cashew nut and pistachio nut sensitised children reported no consumption of cashew nut and/or pistachio nut. In most cases, these children were previously advised to eliminate cashew nuts and also pistachio nuts from the diet because of the possibility of cross-reactions. We advise, however, in these cases to perform a DBPCFC test to avoid unnecessary eliminations.</p><p>Mango is also botanically related to cashew nut, but our study shows only 19% co-sensitisation with mango in cashew positive SPT children and 21% in sIgE positive children. In this study, almost all children have consumed mango and only 7% reported a history of reactions due to the consumption of mango. Cross-reactivity has not been reported between cashew nut and mango [<xref rid="pone.0151055.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and oral challenges with mango are necessary to confirm the histories we obtained.</p><sec id="sec024"><title>Strengths and weaknesses of this study</title><p>The strength of this study was the prospective multicentre study design and its size compared to previous studies on cashew nut allergy [<xref rid="pone.0151055.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This relatively large number of children enabled us to estimate the rate of clinical reactions in sensitised children and to determine the severity of cashew nut allergy. All children underwent a DBPCFC test with cashew nut and thus, the diagnosis was based on this gold standard to establish food allergy, and consequently the clinical relevance of sensitisation and potency of the cashew nut allergen could be accurately examined. A limitation of this study was that we were unable to use the well-accepted scoring system to assess DBPCFC tests as proposed by a PRACTALL consensus group, as this was published after the start of the study [<xref rid="pone.0151055.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Furthermore, there might be a selection bias in this study because a lot of children or parents of children refused to participate in this study because of e.g. fear for severe allergic reactions during the DBPCFC test. However, there was also a large group of children with an unknown history of cashew nut ingestion and among this group were children with a severe cashew nut allergy. Furthermore, many children experienced an anaphylactic reaction in this study. Therefore, the selection bias seems to be small.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec025"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the largest prospective clinical study reported in children, sensitised to cashew nut so far. The study demonstrates a high percentage of clinical reactivity to cashew nut in sensitised children. Cashew nuts may cause severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. A minimal amount of cashew nut (1 mg comparable with 1/100 part of a cashew nut) may be sufficient to cause clinical symptoms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec026"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0151055.s001"><label>S1 TREND Checklist</label><caption><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0151055.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0151055.s002"><label>S1 Database IDEAL-Study</label><caption><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0151055.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0151055.s003"><label>S1 Study protocol</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0151055.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p><bold>Funding:</bold> Technology Foundation STW (STW number 11868), Food Allergy Foundation, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, HAL Allergy, Intersnack the Netherlands B.V., ALK-Abello B.V., and the Netherlands Anaphylaxis Network funded this project.</p></ack><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>DBPCFC</term><def><p>Double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HEP</term><def><p>Histamine equivalent prick</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>sIgE</term><def><p>Specific IgE</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SPT</term><def><p>Skin prick test</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0151055.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>van der Valk</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Dubois</surname><given-names>AE</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gerth van Wijk</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Wichers</surname><given-names>HJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>de Jong</surname><given-names>NW</given-names></name>. <article-title>Systematic review on cashew nut allergy</article-title>. <source>Allergy</source>. <year>2014</year>
