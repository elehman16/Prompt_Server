The study will be based in the UK, in partnership with the MND Association and DeNDRoN (the Dementias and Neurodegnerative Diseases Clinical Research Network). 220 patients will be recruited.

In about 5% of cases there is a family history of ALS, and in about a quarter of such cases, mutation in the SOD1, TARDBP, FUS or OPTN genes is responsible. ALS is the first neurodegenerative disease to provide hope that neuroprotective strategies may be feasible. Riluzole prolongs survival in ALS with a reduction in mortality of ~7% at 18 months for 100 mg daily riluzole versus placebo and a relative risk reduction of ~35% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Riluzole has been licensed by the MHRA and approved by NICE <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nice.org.uk">http://www.nice.org.uk</ext-link>. Nonetheless there remains a pressing need for effective treatments that further slow disease progression, while maintaining quality of life.</p><p>Any drug that can be shown to slow the course of ALS in a clinically significant way and to be safe and well tolerated will be an important advance for patients with this disease. A published report has suggested a dramatic effect of lithium carbonate on survival, albeit in a very small group of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. 44 patients were studied, with 16 randomly selected to take LiCO3 and riluzole and 28 allocated to take riluzole alone. In the group treated with lithium, no patients had died (i.e., 100% survival) at the end of the study (15 months from entry), compared to 71% surviving in the riluzole-only group. The difference in survival was significant at 12 and 15 months. There were also significant differences in the rate of functional deterioration measured by MRC Manual Muscle Testing scores (MMT; 18% decline in LiCO<sub>3 </sub>+ riluzole group versus 35% in the riluzole only group), the Norris scale (11% versus 46%), ALSFRS-R (14% versus 40%), and forced vital capacity (FVC; 14% versus 33%).</p><p>Unfortunately, the trial design can be criticised on several counts. First, the patients were not well matched for age, the LiCO<sub>3 </sub>group being approximately three years younger at age of onset than the control (riluzole only) group, which is known to be a prognostic factor. Secondly, and crucially, the groups were not truly randomised, but 'randomly selected'- no details of how this was done were provided, although the authors stated that patients were selected on the basis of matched forced vital capacity and pattern of clinical presentation. The study was single-blind, with the physicians carrying out the functional assessments being blinded. Adjustments of plasma lithium levels were carried out by an unblinded observer, and the patients were not blinded. The dose of lithium carbonate ranged from 300 mg to 450 mg daily, with plasma lithium levels targeted to reach 0.4-0.8 mmol/l.</p><p>ALS is a heterogeneous disease, and each group of patients entering a trial will differ, to a greater or lesser extent, in the average rate of progression measured by death or by measures of function such as the ALSFRS-R. The smaller the sample, the greater is the chance that there will be major differences in average rates of progression between treatment groups. While large samples and true randomisation will usually balance differences in prognostic factors such as the anticipated rate of disease progression between patients taking the active drug or placebo, this is not always the case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Even in large randomised trials in which patients are recruited using standardized entry criteria, there are patients with slow disease progression as well as patients with a high risk of dying before the end of the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It is therefore possible, by chance, to select a small group of patients with unusually good prospects for survival. On the other hand, despite the weaknesses of trial design, the size of the observed difference between the lithium and control groups (i.e., the assumed drug effect) is difficult to explain on the basis of imbalance of major prognostic factors alone.</p><p>The same study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] also included a series of experiments in mice transgenic for the G93A Superoxide Dismutase 1 (SOD1) mutation, known to cause ALS in humans. There was a prolonged mean survival time (p &#x0003c; 0.001) and increased disease duration (p = 0.05) with lithium treatment compared to saline treatment, starting at 75 days of age. The mean survival time in the lithium group was 148 &#x000b1; 4.3 days (n = 20), compared to 110.8 &#x000b1; 5 days (n = 20) in vehicle treated mice, representing ~36% increase in lifespan. Disease duration was increased from a mean of 9 days to more than 38 days (i.e., &#x0003e; 300%) in lithium compared to vehicle treated mice.</p><p>The authors comment that even when lithium treatment was started at the onset of motor symptoms there was still a comparable increase in disease duration, but these data were not shown. In addition, lithium delayed the onset of paralysis and limb adduction and also improved function on tests such as rotarod, grip strength and stride length. The authors found that lithium treatment increased the number of surviving &#x003b1; motor neurons in the G93A mice and had a number of other effects on pathological changes including increasing the numbers of Renshaw-like neurons in the spinal cord. They hypothesised that this was mediated through an effect on neurogenesis, since lithium has been reported to produce neurogenesis in physiological conditions in the hippocampus, albeit not in the spinal cord. They also reported that lithium rescues spinal cord mitochondria and facilitates the clearance of &#x003b1;-synuclein, ubiquitin and SOD1, and that it increases the number of autophagic vacuoles in the spinal cord.</p><p>There is a substantial rationale from other laboratory studies that lithium is worth investigating therapeutically in ALS. One previous study also identified a modest protective effect of lithium in the ALS transgenic mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Lithium has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in several models of neurodegeneration through a variety of mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The kinesin light chain, a key component of the cellular motor mediating fast anterograde axonal transport, is a substrate for glycogen synthase kinase 3 Beta (GSK3&#x003b2;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and lithium reverses deficits in axonal transport in a microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) over-expression model in drosophila [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Fast axonal transport of mitochondria is impaired by SOD1 mutations, resulting in a maldistribution of mitochondria in the neuron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] so lithium might counteract this.</p><p>The neuroprotective effects of lithium are thought to be mediated to some degree and in some models through GSK3&#x003b2; inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] but also by modification of NMDA-subtype glutamate receptor function through inhibition of NR2B tyrosine phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], activation of cell survival factors such as the PI 3- kinase/Akt signalling pathway, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] the induction of neurotrophic proteins, including brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and up-regulation of heat-shock protein and Bcl-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Lithium enhances neurogenesis in various experimental systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In addition, lithium may promote autophagy through the inhibition of inositol-monophosphatase-15, and thus through the neuroprotective effects of autophagy in neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, the effects of lithium on autophagy are complex, as lithium may reduce autophagy by inhibiting GSK3&#x003b2;, but stimulate it by inducing the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Thus combinations of lithium with agents that inhibit mTOR may prove more useful in neuroprotection than lithium alone. We have no data on possible interactions between lithium and riluzole.</p><p>Thus, despite reservations regarding the strength of the clinical trial data, there is a strong argument to carry out a phase II/III study of LiCO<sub>3 </sub>in ALS. We take the view that such a study should be powered to detect a large effect, i.e., close to that observed in the original human study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>There are various systematic reviews of neuroprotective strategies in ALS, as well as Cochrane systematic reviews of riluzole and failed treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In essence, apart from Riluzole, none of the many agents tested have had any positive effect on survival or function in ALS, and there remains a pressing need for disease-modifying therapy, the aim being to slow disease progression while maintaining reasonable quality of life, in conjunction with symptomatic treatments and palliative care.</p><p>It is hoped that results from our study will be used to inform decisions of whether lithium should be added to riluzole in the routine management of patients with ALS, to improve their survival, motor function and quality of life without significant adverse effects.</p><p>The protocol includes dose titration and monitoring to achieve therapeutic plasma levels of &#x0003e; = 0.4- &#x0003c; = 0.8 mmol/L.</p><p>Lithium has been prescribed in long term use over many decades for other patient groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Because the effective dose is fairly close to the toxic dose, it is necessary to conduct careful dose titration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. We have taken advice on initiation and monitoring of therapy from senior psychiatrists with extensive expertise in the pharmacology and clinical use of lithium therapy and will follow the NICE guidelines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nice.org.uk">http://www.nice.org.uk</ext-link>, Guideline No 38, 2006). The protocol will also involve un-blinded "safety monitoring" physicians who will be responsible for monitoring lithium levels and assessing patients for all aspects of safety and possible toxicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>For further detail please see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>.</p><sec><title>Primary Objective</title><p>To determine whether lithium carbonate (LiCO<sub>3</sub>), in doses achieving blood levels of 0.4-0.8 mmols/L, combined with standard ALS treatment, significantly prolongs survival in ALS over 18 months, compared with standard treatment alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary Objectives</title><p>To monitor the safety of treatment with LiCO<sub>3 </sub>over 18 months.</p><p>To determine whether treatment with LiCO<sub>3 </sub>slows the rate of functional deterioration over 18 months.</p><p>To determine whether treatment with LiCO<sub>3 </sub>affects quality of life (QoL) or mental state (anxiety, depression) in patients with ALS, over 18 months</p></sec><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>LiCALS is a multi-centre (UK) double-blind randomised parallel group controlled trial of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of lithium carbonate (LiCO<sub>3</sub>) at doses to achieve stable 'therapeutic' plasma levels (0.4-0.8 mmol/L), plus standard treatment, versus matched placebo plus standard treatment, in patients with ALS.

The medication will be titrated to achieve a blood plasma level of &#x02265; 0.4- &#x02264; 0.8 mmol/l.</p></sec><sec><title>Selection &#x00026; Timing of Dose for Each Participant</title><p>Interventions will be available in 295 mg tablets of lithium carbonate or matching placebo.</p><p>Tablets will be taken once daily, starting with one tablet (295 mg daily) initially, titrated up to two or three tablets daily over the first four weeks of treatment, depending on blood lithium levels. Blood levels will be measured at baseline, 7 days (12 hours +/-30 minutes after previous evening dose), and at 14 days (12 hours +/-30 minutes after previous evening dose). The target range for the lithium plasma level will be between &#x02265; 0.4 mmol/l and &#x02264; 0.8 mmol/l. Further plasma level measurements will be taken at 21 and 28 days to confirm the target range has been achieved. Ongoing lithium level monitoring will be scheduled for week 8 and week 12, and 3 monthly thereafter for the duration of the study.</p><p>Dose adjustments can be made by reducing back to 2 tablets daily or to 1 tablet daily as required. It is anticipated that most patients will remain on 2 tablets throughout the duration of the trial.</p><p>Sham dose adjustments will also be made to patients on placebo to maintain blinding in clinical sites as per SOP.</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding of Investigational Medicinal Product</title><p>Active study medication (Lithium carbonate) and placebo will be identical.</p></sec><sec><title>Identity &#x00026; Supply of Investigational Medicinal Product</title><p>Lithium carbonate-Apogepha (Germany)</p><p>The trial medication is supplied as white tablets of approximately 1.1 cm in diameter. There is a break notch on one side of the tablets.</p></sec><sec><title>Packaging &#x00026; Labelling of Investigational Medicinal Product</title><p>Active study medication and placebo will be supplied in blisters of 21 tablets. For months 1, 2 and 3, five blisters will be packaged into 1 month kits. 3 of these kits, each bearing the same kit number, will be packaged together and dispensed directly to the study site.</p><p>Thereafter, 14 individual blisters will be supplied in 3-monthly patient kits for months 4-6, 7-9, 10-12, 13-15 and 16-18. Each of those kits will have a different kit number. Packaging and labelling will be completed in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Annex 13 requirements and GCP, by Haupt Pharma, Brackenheim, Germany.</p></sec><sec><title>Prescription of Investigational Medicinal Product</title><p>Study medication will be prescribed by an authorised study physician according to the protocol, using a trial specific prescription. Medication will be dispensed according to local pharmacy practice.</p><p>Participants will be informed of potential adverse reactions and advised to seek medical help and contact the research team, if required. Patients will carry cards with an emergency 24 hour code break number (Guy's Medical Toxicology Unit, (0)207 358 9167), which will also be printed on the study medication packs.</p><p>Documentation of prescribing, dispensing and return of study medication shall be maintained for study records in the pharmacy file and reconciled with the investigator site file at the end of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Dispensing &#x00026; Distribution of Investigational Medicinal Product</title><p>Study drug will be stored in a secure area with limited access within each local pharmacy according to the storage requirements documented on the clinical trial label (store in the original package and protected from moisture), prior to dispensing for each participant's baseline visit. A temperature log will be maintained as per local pharmacy procedures.</p><p>Study medication will be distributed to the 10 study site pharmacies by and from Haupt Pharma, Brackenheim, Germany. Study medication receipt will be recorded in the study pharmacy file. A study medication dispensing and return log will be maintained by the site pharmacies.</p><p>Supplies of the study medications will be dispensed to the patient at Months 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15.</p></sec><sec><title>Administration of Investigational Medicinal Product</title><p>Tablets will be taken by participants using their normal methods for medicines management in a single dose at night. Participants will be provided with written information from the doctor detailing the dose to be taken.</p><p>Following stabilisation of blood levels over the first 3 months, plasma level monitoring can be measured every 3 months, except in the following circumstances, when monitoring needs to be done more frequently: presence of intercurrent illness, symptoms or signs of lithium toxicity, or if the patient is taking interacting drugs e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, diuretics, steroids, metronidazole, tetracycline, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors; or if there is a change in fluid or sodium intake. If the study medication is given crushed via a feeding tube, as opposed to as whole tablets, monitoring of Li Levels will also need to be more frequent. All medication will be monitored by a lithium physician (unblinded).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Unused Trial Study Medication &#x00026; Study Medication Accountability</title><p>At the end of each visit (months 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12,15, and 18) participants will be asked to return any surplus study drug in the original packaging to the research team, who will verify and document compliance and discuss any discrepancies immediately with the participant. All unused study medication and packaging will then be sent to the local pharmacy where the study monitor will check and arrange collection of returns. Monitoring checks will be carried out between the eCRF and pharmacy to ensure the number of tablets returned is correctly documented.</p><sec><title>Concomitant Medications</title><p>All concomitant drug therapies received will be recorded at baseline and follow-up assessment.</p><p>Contraindications include hypersensitivity to lithium or to any of the excipients.</p><p>Lithium can cause neurotoxicity, which can happen without an increase in blood lithium levels. Neurotoxicity usually follows interaction with medications; drugs implicated include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), calcium channel blockers, carbamazepine, phenytoin, neuroleptics and methyldopa. The protocol will therefore involve a lithium physician (unblinded) who will be responsible for monitoring lithium levels and making dose adjustments as described later. The treating physician (blinded) will assess patients, review adverse events, and consider possible toxicity.

Emails confirming the treatment kit allocation will automatically be generated to the requestor, the site PI, the site pharmacist and the trial manager. A study specific prescription will be completed and sent to pharmacy for dispensing. The confirmation e mail will be attached to the study prescription, and cross-checked against it, at the point of dispensing.</p><p>For baseline, week 4 and week 8 visits, this initial treatment kit number will be used for prescribing study medication.</p><p>For months 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15, the online system must be accessed again and a new kit number allocated per patient per visit.</p><p>Each kit will correspond to the appropriate study arm the patient was randomised to receive.</p><p>Any problems with the online randomisation system should be reported to the trial manager or to the MH&#x00026;N CTU at the email address below:</p><p>Contact details for Randomisation: Randomization_request@iop.kcl.ac.uk.</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>Assignment to either lithium carbonate or placebo will be blinded to the participants, investigators and pharmacy (double-blind). Blinding of patients and treating physicians to allocation status will be assured by identical tablet appearance, by identical labelling between placebo and doses of active drug, and by sham dosage adjustments made by a lithium physician (unblinded) in the control group to mirror titration of lithium dosage in the intervention group. For safety reasons, lithium physicians (unblinded) will monitor plasma lithium levels, safety bloods, and symptoms. Every effort will be made to maintain strict blinding, although for practical reasons, the unblinded lithium physicians will be part of the same unit as the treating physicians (blinded).</p><p>A set of sealed code-break envelopes will be prepared by Haupt Pharma and sent to Guy's Medical Toxicology Unit; these envelopes should be opened only where knowledge of the randomised treatment is needed to optimise the clinical management of the patient. Code breaks will not be routinely opened for participants who complete study treatment.</p><p>A sealed randomisation list will also be held by MH&#x00026;N CTU as back-up.</p><p>If a request for code break is received from a physician (e.g. the patient's general practitioner) outside the research team, Guy's Medical Toxicology Unit will attempt to contact the research team to verify the request before the code is broken.</p><p>If the code is broken, details including patient study number, the date code break was performed, the person who broke the code, and reason for code break shall be recorded on a record card within the code break envelope and maintained. If clinically indicated, the participant will be withdrawn from study medication.</p><p>Accidental unblindings will be dealt with on a case by case basis, if and when they arise.

Data analysis will be performed by the study statistician at Newcastle Clinical Trials Unit, using a password-protected computer in a private office.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Sensitivity analyses will include per-protocol and per-treatment analyses, as specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan to be developed by the Trial Statistician and approved by the TSC and the DMEC prior to database lock.</p><p>No interim analysis is planned although pre-defined stopping criteria will be discussed by the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) and the Independent Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) and agreed if appropriate.</p><p>The population used in the efficacy analyses is the Intention to Treat (ITT) population. This population will consist of all patients randomised to treatment, who took at least one dose of double-blind treatment, regardless of compliance with the study protocol and procedures. If the primary analysis event (i.e., death) does not occur, a patient's data will be considered censored either on his/her planned study end date, or on the cut-off date for the study as a whole, or when the patient becomes lost to follow-up, whichever is the earlier. Data will be included in the analysis regardless of whether the patient is still receiving double-blind study treatment or complying with the prescribed regimen. The Trial Steering Committee and/or Data Monitoring Committee may decide that sensitivity analyses (endpoints and population to be defined) are also required. The population used to assess safety and tolerability will consist of all patients randomised to treatment that took at least one dose of double-blind treatment and provided at least some data thereafter, regardless of compliance with the study protocol and procedures. Descriptive statistics of baseline data and summaries of safety and tolerance data will be further subdivided by randomisation stratum (site of onset of the disease, centre).</p><p>Demographics and population characteristics: Deviations from the protocol, with regard to both the entry criteria and the scheduled assessments and examinations, will be summarized. Individual deviations will be detailed and (if appropriate) commented upon. Treatment assignment by stratum and study site, and the numbers of measurements available for each parameter will be presented. Demographics, medical history, history of the disease, scores at baseline on all variables and scales assessed, and medication and other treatment received on entry will be summarized with tabular presentation of baseline comparability.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy</title></sec></sec><sec><title>Primary analysis</title><p>The primary outcome is survival at 18 months. Survival rates at 18 months in the two arms (Lithium treatment versus control) will be compared using a Kaplan-Meier analysis and log rank test. Results will also be given in the form of a 95% confidence interval for the relative risk of survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary analysis</title><p>Secondary outcomes including the ALSFRS-R will be assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months. The main statistical challenge in analysing such data is to take into account incomplete data which will be due to a number of factors most notably of which will be the death of individual patients; in this study we anticipate that survival rates may differ by at least 20%. It is necessary to take into account the differing drop out rates and the non-randomness of the drop out when comparing functional status between the two groups. This will be done by jointly modelling the survival data and repeated measurements data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The survival data are analysed using a Cox proportion hazards model incorporating random effects. Functional outcomes are modelled using mixed models appropriate for repeated measures. A key feature of each of these models is that within each of them it is possible to fit a latent variable that can be conceptualised as the patient's propensity to experience poor outcomes (in the context of survival analysis this is usually referred to as frailty). It is the inclusion of this latent variable that allows us to adjust our estimates of the treatment effect to allow for the different rates of drop out in each group. Both models are estimated simultaneously; parameter estimates are based on maximising the joint likelihood over both the survival and repeated measures data. Within this framework we will estimate the effect of Lithium treatment on survival and functional status/quality of life allowing for key baseline covariates including site of onset of disease and possible differences between centres. These methods will be implemented using software that has been developed as part of an MRC funded programme of work (Grant G0400615; statistical methodology for longitudinal studies in clinical research; Williamson PR, Diggle PJ and Henderson R, unpublished work).</p></sec><sec><title>Sample Size Calculation</title><p>The sample size is based on detecting a difference in survival rates at 18 months using Fleiss' method for a proportion incorporating a continuity correction. Two groups of 110 subjects will give us 80% power to detect a difference of 17.5% in survival rates (65% versus 82.5%) assuming a type 1 error rate of 5%. It is anticipated that we will have complete survival data on all subjects recruited. The parameters included in this calculation were informed by the database of Professor V Meininger (H&#x000f4;pital Piti&#x000e9;Salp&#x000e9;tri&#x000e8;re, Paris). The hypothesised difference in survival rates of 17.5% is clearly clinically very significant but less than that which might be expected on the basis of previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Sample size was calculated defining survival as death alone (i.e., not including tracheostomy or Permanent Assisted Ventilation, PAV). Loss of follow-up per year for the primary outcome measure was set at 0%-in previous studies we have been able to ascertain survival for all subjects who have been recruited. In the most recent multicentre European trial, the unadjusted survival rate for patients with similar inclusion criteria was ~60% on riluzole alone (V Meininger, personal communication, unpublished data). For functional measures, databases from recent large-scale trials have indicated that the average slope of decrease in ALSFRS-R score on riluzole plus placebo is approximately -10 points per year with a variation coefficient ranging from 1.2 to 1.5 (with SD ranging from 12 to 15 for ALSFRS-R) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Assuming the survival rates stated above our proposed sample size will give us 88% power to detect an effect size (or standardised difference) of 0.5 in our functional measures.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment</title><p>Patient recruitment began in June 2009 and the last patient is expected to complete the trial protocol in November 2011.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This protocol will allow us to determine if lithium carbonate is effective in ALS as suggested by an earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].
