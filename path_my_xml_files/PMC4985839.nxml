However, the feasibility and safety of oral intake directly following oesophagectomy remain unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of early versus delayed start of oral intake on postoperative recovery following oesophagectomy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This is an open-label multicentre randomised controlled trial. Patients undergoing elective minimally invasive or hybrid oesophagectomy for cancer are eligible. Further inclusion criteria are intrathoracic anastomosis, written informed consent and age 18 years or older. Inability for oral intake, inability to place a feeding jejunostomy, inability to provide written consent, swallowing disorder, achalasia, Karnofsky Performance Status &#x0003c;80 and malnutrition are exclusion criteria. Patients will be randomised using online randomisation software. The intervention group (direct oral feeding) will receive a liquid oral diet for 2&#x02005;weeks with gradually expanding daily maximums. The control group (delayed oral feeding) will receive enteral feeding via a jejunostomy during 5&#x02005;days and then start the same liquid oral diet. The primary outcome measure is functional recovery. Secondary outcome measures are 30-day surgical complications; nutritional status; need for artificial nutrition; need for additional interventions; health-related quality of life. We aim to recruit 148 patients. Statistical analysis will be performed according to an intention to treat principle. Results are presented as risk ratios with corresponding 95% CIs. A two-tailed p&#x0003c;0.05 is considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Our study protocol has received ethical approval from the Medical research Ethics Committees United (MEC-U).

<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> This is believed to reduce the incidence and severity of postoperative pneumonia and anastomotic leakage, although no causal relationship has been established.

<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>The best time to start oral intake following oesophagectomy is unknown.

<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Both studies found a significant reduction in anastomotic leakage with an extended delay of oral nutrition following oesophagectomy compared with a conventional 5&#x02013;7&#x02005;days nil-by-mouth regimen.

Interestingly, direct oral intake even resulted in less postoperative pulmonary complications. It remains unclear what the best strategy is for postoperative diet protocols in the early postoperative phase following oesophagectomy.</p><p>The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of early start versus delayed start of oral intake on postoperative recovery following oesophagectomy.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design</title><p>The design of this study is a multicentre prospective open-label randomised controlled trial performed at the Catharina Hospital Eindhoven and the Hospital Group Twente. Both hospitals are situated in the Netherlands. Additional centres will be approached to increase the inclusion rate. The aim of this superiority trial is to investigate the effects of early start versus delayed start of oral intake on postoperative functional recovery following oesophagectomy. It is expected that patients will be included over a period of 2&#x02005;years. Based on a previous study, it is expected that 80&#x02013;90% of eligible patients can be included. Perioperative protocols are standardised.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study population</title><p>Patients undergoing elective minimally invasive or hybrid (laparoscopy and thoracotomy) oesophagectomy for cancer with intrathoracic anastomosis are eligible for inclusion. They have to be aged at least 18&#x02005;years. Exclusion criteria are inability for oral intake (congenital or traumatic anatomical abnormalities), inability to place a feeding jejunostomy, inability to provide written consent, swallowing disorder, achalasia, Karnofsky Performance Status &#x0003c;80 and malnutrition. Malnutrition is defined as &#x0003e;15% weight loss before start of surgery. The investigator and the responsible surgeon verify eligibility. The patient will receive written and verbal information about this trial during a scheduled appointment. Sufficient time to enquire about details of this trial is offered.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Sample size calculation and statistical analysis</title><p>The sample size calculation is based on functional recovery as the primary outcome. Functional recovery is the time to surgical recovery according to the definition described previously.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;17</xref> On the basis of historical controls, patients receiving delayed oral feeding were at least considered to be functionally recovered by a mean of 12&#x02005;days postoperatively. Patients who were fed orally directly after oesophagectomy were at least functionally recovered at day 10 postoperatively (mean). Using a power of 80%, an &#x003b1; of 5% and an SD of 4&#x02005;days, a total of 128 patients (64 patients in each group) are needed to show this difference. It is expected that the primary outcome will not be normally divided, and therefore an extra 15% inclusion is necessary, requiring a total of 148 patients (74 patients in each group). An independent physician will perform a safety analysis following 50 and 100 patients. A Haybittle-Peto boundary principle is used regarding anastomotic leakage, (aspiration) pneumonia or mortality.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Randomisation</title><p>After obtaining written informed consent, patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups by online randomisation software (TENALEA Clinical Trial Data Management System). This computerised program will generate a randomisation list. A corresponding randomisation website will be used that generates the sequential randomisation number corresponding to the stratified randomisation list on randomisation of a patient. The hospital of inclusion and treatment and type of surgery (hybrid/total minimally invasive) are stratification criteria in the randomisation process. Randomisation will be performed before surgery and after neoadjuvant therapy (&#x0223c;3&#x02005;weeks before surgery). The result of the randomisation will be communicated at the outpatient clinic, via a telephone call or at admission (1&#x02005;day prior to surgery).

Patients in both groups receive similar preoperative treatment, including regular consultations by a dietician for assessment of supplemental feeding and by a physiotherapist, especially during periods of neoadjuvant treatment. The type of intrathoracic anastomosis (eg, side-to-side, circular, end-to-end) is left to the preference of the surgeon. A low-vacuum (Jackson Pratt, JP) drain is placed near the anastomosis on the dorsal side of the anastomosis and bilateral chest drains will be placed at the end of the procedure. The nasogastric tube will be removed at the end of the procedure in all patients. A jejunostomy catheter (9.6Fr) is placed during surgery in all patients (both groups) using the Seldinger technique.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Jejunostomy catheters in the intervention group are sealed and may only be used when an artificial route for enteral feeding is required or when caloric intake is not reached at postoperative day 5 (POD5). Postoperative nursing protocol with elevation of the bed (head rest) is standard care after an oesophagectomy. Amylase levels will be determined postoperatively in the drain fluid of the JP drain and will be correlated with the incidence of anastomotic leakage.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Nutritional procedure</title><p>Patients in the early diet group will receive a liquid oral diet (soup, yoghurt, porridge, liquefied solid foods, etc) supported by nutritional supplements (sip feeds) directly postoperatively until postoperative day 14. This liquid oral diet will be expanded gradually and a solid diet will be started at POD15.</p><p>Patients in the control group will receive standard tube feeding after surgery via a feeding jejunostomy. These patients are allowed to drink clear liquids up to 250&#x02005;cc/day. After 5&#x02005;days, patients in the control group will start with a liquid oral diet from 2&#x02005;weeks onwards. On postoperative day 20, a solid diet will be started. Tube feeding will be stopped when at least 50% of the daily needs are met with oral nutrition alone.</p><p>A dietician will calculate energy needs for each patient using the Harris-Benedict formula with a surplus of 30% for energy expenditure in the postoperative phase. On postoperative days 2, 5 and 14, caloric intake and protein intake are measured and calculated. When patients in the group of early oral intake have not reached an intake &#x0003e;50% of the calculated energy expenditure at postoperative day 5, tube feeding will be started. Tube feeding can be started via the jejunostomy present in all patients. No standard parenteral feeding is initiated to bridge the start of enteral feeding. In case enteral nutrition is not possible or not wanted (eg, due to a chylothorax), parenteral feeding will be started.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome parameter is functional recovery (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016011979TB1">table 1</xref>), defined as postoperative patients who are free of intravenous fluid, have adequate pain control, restoration of mobility to an independent level, sufficient caloric intake and no signs of active infection.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;17</xref> Date of functional recovery is the day when all criteria are met.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2016011979TB1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Functional recovery criteria</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Criteria</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Objective measurement</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Side notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Adequate pain control with oral analgesia</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Numeric Rating Scale &#x0003c;5 or Visual Analogue Score &#x0003c;5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Restoration of mobility to an independent level</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Walk to the toilet with/without walking aids and transfer bed/chair</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Only possible if preoperative mobility is independent</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ability to maintain sufficient caloric intake</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Minimum of 50% required calories</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Absence of intravenous fluid administration</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">No signs of active infection</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">

<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> These two studies based their conclusions on a retrospective analysis of historic patient data.

However, data including patients who underwent an oesophagectomy are scarce. A previous safety and feasibility trial performed by our group proves that direct oral intake following oesophagectomy is safe and does not result in an increase in major complications such as pneumonia and anastomotic leakage (TJ Weijs, GHK Berkelmans, GAP Nieuwenhuijzen, <italic>et al</italic>.
