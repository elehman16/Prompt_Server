Advance directives (ADs) were created to provide opportunities to set limits on aggressive care near life's end. This study tests the hypothesis that redesigning ADs such that comfort-oriented care is provided as the default, rather than requiring patients to actively choose it, will promote better patient-centred outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This multicentre trial randomises seriously ill adults to receive 1 of 3 different ADs: (1) a traditional AD that requires patients to actively choose their goals of care or preferences for specific interventions (eg, feeding tube insertion) or otherwise have their care guided by their surrogates and the prevailing societal default toward aggressive care; (2) an AD that defaults to life-extending care and receipt of life-sustaining interventions, enabling patients to opt out from such care; or (3) an AD that defaults to comfort care, enabling patients to opt into life-extending care. We seek to enrol 270 patients who return complete, legally valid ADs so as to generate sufficient power to detect differences in the primary outcome of hospital-free days (days alive and not in an acute care facility). Secondary outcomes include hospital and intensive care unit admissions, costs of care, hospice usage, decision conflict and satisfaction, quality of life, concordance of preferences with care received and bereavement outcomes for surrogates of patients who die.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Boards at all trial centres, and is guided by a data safety and monitoring board and an ethics advisory board.

Currently, critical healthcare decisions must be made for 43% of older Americans near the end of life, but 70% of these patients are unable to participate in making these decisions<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and must have decisions made for them. ADs, which include living wills and durable power of attorney designation, can help improve the quality of advance care planning. Observational studies show that elderly patients who complete ADs are more likely to die outside of a hospital, receive less costly care and receive care consistent with their preferences.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;21</xref> However, ADs have known shortcomings,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;26</xref> and finding a scalable solution for a diverse patient population is challenging.</p><p>The use of default options has been shown to have large effects in a variety of areas, including the use of opt out versus opt-in framing to increase organ donation and vaccination rates.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;32</xref> Defaults are considered a powerful approach to help overcome a variety of problems in healthcare without limiting choice.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33&#x02013;36</xref> In a pilot randomised clinical trial (RCT),<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> we showed that default options in ADs may influence patients' choices of care, while preserving patients' satisfaction with the decision-making process, and that patients rarely changed their plan of care after being alerted to the intervention and their responses. However, before advocating default options in ADs for broader clinical use, it is necessary to determine whether changing such choices leads to improved patient-centred and family-centred outcomes over the long term in a larger, more diverse population of seriously ill patients. The current association of aggressive treatments at the end of life with poor patient-reported and surrogate-reported outcomes suggests that aligning the care patients desire with the care they receive, such that aggressive care is reduced at the end of life, will improve these outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods/design</title><p>This study is an RCT examining whether structuring ADs to request comfort-oriented care or life-extending care by default influences the number of days that patients are alive and living outside of an acute-care hospital, as well as several secondary outcomes.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Study hypothesis</title><p>The primary study hypothesis is that ADs with preselected comfort care measures, compared with those defaulting to life-extension or standard ADs, will produce an increase in hospital-free days (HFDs), a measure that represents the number of days alive and not in an acute care facility. Secondary hypotheses are: compared with standard ADs or ADs defaulting to life-extension, ADs defaulting to comfort care will (1) produce no change in survival; (2) reduce hospital and ICU admissions; (3) increase hospice usage; (4) reduce costs of inpatient plus hospice care; (5) improve patients' quality of life; (6) improve patients' satisfaction with care; (7) improve surrogates' perceptions of the quality of dying and death and (8) decrease the incidence of symptoms of post-traumatic stress among surrogates following their loved ones' deaths.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study setting</title><p>Recruitment for the trial is occurring at several clinics associated with the University of Pennsylvania Health System in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

A patient's eligibility status is entered into the eligibility database along with ICD9 and ICD10 codes, staging information, provider name, clinic location and upcoming appointments. Once an eligible patient is identified, a research coordinator emails the patient's provider to (1) inform the provider that the patient is eligible for recruitment and (2) provide an opportunity for the provider to decline or defer any patient's enrolment by responding to the email. Patients who meet eligibility criteria but are new patients (ie, not follow-up visits) are tracked in the eligibility database so they may be rescreened at a later date. If eligible, they will be approached for consent. Patients are only eligible for inclusion once. Once they consent or decline, patients are not approached again if they meet eligibility criteria in a different clinic.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Recruitment and retention</title><p>Patients who screen eligible are approached by a research coordinator during routine clinic visits. The research coordinators seek patients' consent to participate in a study about healthcare decision-making. The consent forms (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary appendix</xref> A) contain Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act statements of authorisation of release of medical records, and include clear explanations that they are being asked to complete an AD, participate in several follow-up interviews and permit the research team to follow their health outcomes. Patients are also told that different types of ADs are assigned by chance, but that patients in all groups may select or decline any intervention or treatment goal, and may revise their choices at any time. All patients are encouraged to involve their family members and/or physicians in completing their ADs. All consenting patients are provided with: (1) their assigned AD; (2) an informational brochure about ADs; (3) contact information for study personnel; (4) a copy of the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) and (5) instructions for returning the completed AD and DCS and a stamped envelope addressed to study staff. Demographics, including age, race, ethnicity, sex, religion, income, education, marital status and health insurance type are collected at the time of consent, as well as data about previous experience with life-sustaining therapies and critical care medicine. If a participant does not return an AD within 10&#x02005;days, study personnel call every 10&#x02005;days for 1&#x02005;month, and again at 2&#x02005;months and at 3&#x02005;months, to encourage AD, return or meet with the participant in person at his or her next clinic appointment.

Recruited surrogates are those identified in patients' ADs or if none, according to states' legal hierarchies.

Surrogates are not approached for consent if a patient has not completed an AD.</p><p>Patients who do not wish to complete an AD and decline consent are asked to sign a limited consent form providing authorisation to access long-term health outcomes via electronic medical records and statewide databases, along with providing basic demographic information (age, race, ethnicity and gender). This information is essential to complete the proposed complier average treatment effect (or instrumental variable (IV)) analysis. No further contact with these patients is made.</p><p>Individuals will be contacted for participation in follow-up interviews 2, 6 and 12&#x02005;months after AD completion. In order to maximise participation in follow-up interviews, participants are asked if they would prefer to be contacted by phone or email. For participants who wish to be contacted by phone, phone interviews will be conducted by a research assistant who is blinded to the participant's study arm and using a standardised script. Participants who prefer email contact will be sent a link to complete surveys online using the REDCap electronic data capture tool.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> This survey will include information and questions that are identical to the phone surveys.

Patients are clearly instructed that other preferences can be chosen by crossing out the preselected options and choosing alternatives or choosing that they do not wish to specify. The order of responses (comfort care vs life extension) is randomised for those patients assigned to the standard AD arm to mitigate any potential ordering effects. Patients randomised to the comfort care or life extension arms will see the life extension or comfort care default options first, respectively.</p><p>Patients in all groups are provided with an informational brochure about ADs that uses simple language, and research coordinators are trained to answer patients' questions about advance care planning and offer assistance to patients if necessary.

As Wendler and colleagues note,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> debriefing &#x02018;should be understood as a tool of moral accountability&#x02019;, and that &#x02018;debriefing makes amends by retrospectively providing the disclosure about the research that standardly should have been offered prospectively&#x02019;. In our study, a thorough debriefing session will ensure that patients (1) understand their selections; (2) do not simply go with the default options because they failed to recognise that a choice was to be made or that a default was being used; (3) have multiple opportunities to withdraw their participation or data and (4) are actively engaged in the research and comfortable with the research process.</p><p>After receiving a patient's completed AD form, a research coordinator contacts the patient for a debriefing session. During the debriefing, the research coordinator uses an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved script (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">supplementary appendix</xref> C) that carefully explains the nature of the intervention, including the use of different default options in ADs. Patients are reminded that they received, by chance, one of three forms used in the study. The specific differences between all three versions are described, including explanations that choices were preselected, when appropriate. The research coordinator then reviews each AD choice with the patient and makes sure patients are satisfied with the selections before proceeding. Patients are specifically asked if they wish to change their selections on their AD forms, and are reminded that should their choices change in the future, they should contact the study team, their clinician or both. If the patient decides to make changes to his/her AD, changes can be made immediately by the research coordinator and a new copy forwarded to the patient or the patient may choose to receive a blank copy of the AD and make new selections. Any changes will be incorporated, and the completed AD will be scanned into the patient's medical record and mailed to the patient, identified healthcare agents/surrogates, and any other requested family members.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010628.supp3</object-id><label>Supplementary appendix C</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss3" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2015-010628supp_appendixC.pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material><p>Once patients confirm that they are comfortable with their selections, the research coordinator informs patients that their ADs will be scanned into their medical records and sent to their home address as well as to their surrogates.

This metric represents the number of days alive and not in an acute care facility following the date of consent. We choose the date of consent as day 0 so that all enrolled participants, including those who do not return ADs, are eligible for intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. However, to minimise immortal-time bias, we will also conduct a secondary analysis in which day 0 is defined as the date on which ADs are returned. Two additional variations on this metric will also be evaluated: (1) healthcare facility-free days, which represent the number of days alive where a patient is not in an acute care facility, a chronic care facility or a nursing home; and (2) HFDs within the first 6&#x02005;months of follow-up.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2015010628TB2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Outcomes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Outcome</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Measurement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hospital-free days (primary outcome)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of days alive and not in an acute care facility</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hospital and ICU admissions</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of admissions analysed as count data</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Costs of care</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Combination of all costs of inpatient and outpatient hospice, hospital stays and life-sustaining procedures</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hospice usage</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Analysed as time from AD completion to hospice enrolment, and as duration of hospice usage prior to death</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Choices to receive 4 potentially life-sustaining interventions (CPR, mechanical ventilation, dialysis, feeding tube)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Concordance of these choices with whether the interventions were actually received</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Choices regarding post-hospitalisation care (see online supplementary appendix B for specific choices)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Concordance of these choices with the care actually received</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Decision conflict and satisfaction</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Decision Conflict Scale<break/>CANHELP</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Quality of life</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">McGill quality of life</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Surrogates&#x02019; perception of the quality of death and dying</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Prigerson's quality of death</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bereavement outcomes</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Impact of Events Scale</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Healthcare system distrust</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Healthcare System Distrust Scale</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>AD, advance directives; CPR, cardiopulmonary resuscitation; ICU, intensive care unit.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>The use of HFDs as our primary outcome reflects the desire to choose a measure that is patient-centred, readily measured and analysed, and reflects a patient's holistic state rather than a specific symptom. HFDs have many attractive properties: they are continuous, enhancing power; they can be analysed reliably and indeed flexibly, to account for different values patients may place on avoiding hospitalisation; and in nearly all cases, they are unidirectional, in the sense, that nearly all patients prefer longer lives to shorter ones, and to have more of those days spent outside a hospital than within. This does not automatically assume that all days spent in a hospital are without value. Indeed, the relief of acute symptoms via a short hospital stay may have great value to a patient, but such days will be a small percentage of total cohort days. And while these beneficial days may not be weighed differently in our model, they also would not reduce the number of remaining days a patient would have outside the hospital.</p><p>Secondary outcomes include several clinical, economic and patient-reported measures. Specifically, we capture patient deaths via medical records and, if necessary, we verify deaths in the Social Security Death Index, performing linkages via social security numbers, which are collected at the time of consent. We assess hospitalisations, ICU admissions, costs of inpatient care and usage of life-sustaining therapies by querying state-run databases that capture all admissions and inpatient procedures in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. These databases are also used to assess concordance between patients' choices to receive four potentially life-sustaining therapies (CPR, mechanical ventilation, dialysis and feeding tube), and whether those interventions are actually received. Data on hospice usage and costs are collected via data use agreements with organisations that provide care for 80% of patients at the University of Pennsylvania Health System and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.</p><p>In patient interviews conducted 2, 6 and 12&#x02005;months following AD completion, we are assessing patients' satisfaction with their advance care planning, quality of life and desires to make any changes to their ADs. Satisfaction is measured with the Canadian Healthcare Evaluation Project (CANHELP)<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>
<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> instrument's global satisfaction and end-of-life care question. This instrument asks patients &#x02018;how satisfied are you with your advance care planning overall&#x02014;that is, the plans you have in place regarding your end-of-life care&#x02019;. Responses range from 1 to 5, with 1 indicating completely satisfied and 5 indicating not at all satisfied. Quality of life is measured using the McGill quality of life (MQoL),<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>
<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> which can be completed by family members on behalf of patients who are unable to complete it themselves. The MQoL questionnaire has 16 questions querying both mental and physical symptoms experienced by the patient during the past 2&#x02005;days, and asks patients to rate the severity of each. For example, the MQoL will prompt a patient with &#x02018;over the last two days, one troublesome symptom has been&#x02026;&#x02019;, and the patient will self-identify a symptom. The patient will then be asked to rate on a 0&#x02013;10 scale how problematic that symptom has been, with 0 indicating no problem and 10 indicating a tremendous problem. Patients will also be asked about their emotional well-being (eg, &#x02018;over the past 2&#x02005;days, I have been depressed&#x02019;,) as well as support (eg, &#x02018;over the past 2&#x02005;days, I have felt supported&#x02019;), with responses ranging from not at all (0) to extremely or completely (10). Additionally, we are assessing decision conflict, using the validated DCS,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> to assess patients' certainty in making healthcare decisions. The DCS provides patients with 16 statements (&#x02018;I know the benefits of each option&#x02019;, &#x02018;I am clear about which risks matter most to me&#x02019;), and assesses agreement or disagreement with each statement on a 5-point scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree. This measure is collected immediately following AD completion and is not assessed during follow-up.</p><p>We are assessing surrogates' perceptions of the quality of death and dying using Prigerson's quality of death measures.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> This three-question measure asks surrogates to rate, on a scale of 0&#x02013;10, the level of psychological distress or physical distress in the patient's last week of life, as well as the overall quality of the patient's death or last week of life. The Impact of Events Scale<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> is used to assess the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder in surrogates of deceased patients. The surrogate is presented with 15 statements commonly made after stressful life events (eg, &#x02018;I tried to remove it from memory&#x02019;, and &#x02018;I had dreams about it&#x02019;), and asked to respond with the frequency of how true the comments were for them during the last 7&#x02005;days. Response options include not at all, rarely, sometimes and often. Finally, healthcare system distrust is measured among the surrogates using the Health System Distrust Scale.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> This scale asks surrogates to rate statements about the healthcare system on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Statements include items such as &#x02018;the health care system covers up its mistakes&#x02019; and &#x02018;the health care system gives excellent medical care&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Data collection methods</title><p>The DMU at the University of Pennsylvania manages all study data, and ensures secure multisite data integration, accurate merging of trial data with hospice and state claims databases, and processes scanning of report forms for demographics collection and all follow-up data to minimise errors. The database automatically tracks patients and notifies study personnel when follow-up interviews are due. Only authorised project personnel have access to the data, which is stored behind firewalls and not on stand-alone PCs or laptops. All study participants are assigned a study identification number, and any personally identifying information is removed from analytic data sets.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Analytic plan</title><p>First, we will use ITT analyses to assess the impact of group assignment on all outcomes. Second, we will use Complier Average Treatment Effect (CATE) analyses to assess the influence of the choices patients make in ADs on long-term patient-reported and family-reported outcomes, and to estimate the impact of completing an AD at all, regardless of the choices made. These methods are made feasible because, based on our pilot trial, the intervention (default options) is expected to alter choices without altering the odds of completing an AD at all. To show how we will accomplish this, consider the three analyses described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015010628F2">figure 2</xref>. First, we will conduct ITT analyses using linear regression, adjusting for centre,<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> to compare the effects of assignment to complete ADs with different default options on the outcomes of interest. This approach uses data from all randomised participants, and provides the truest test of the overall effectiveness of the intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015010628F2">figure 2</xref>A). However, the ITT analysis does not provide a specific test of the effects of choices made in ADs, because these effects will be diluted by the fact that many randomised patients will not complete their assigned ADs. Furthermore, among patients who do return completed ADs, not all will stick with their assigned default choice. To surmount this problem, researchers sometimes conduct per-protocol analyses, which, in this case, would compare patients who complete ADs and stay with their assigned defaults in one arm with those who do the same in the other arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015010628F2">figure 2</xref>B). However, per-protocol analyses are likely to be biased by selection effects: patients who complete ADs and choose comfort care are likely different from those who do not complete ADs or make other choices in completed ADs, and these underlying differences may influence outcomes such as quality of life.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015010628F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Methods of inferring the causal effects of choices made in advance directives (ADs).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2015010628f02"/></fig><p>To surmount the limitations of ITT analyses in estimating the specific efficacy of choices in ADs, and of per-protocol analyses in providing biased estimates of such efficacy, we will conduct a two-stage least-squares regression in which the randomisation arm is modelled as an IV<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>
<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> in CATE analyses.<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57&#x02013;60</xref> Owing to the randomisation being stratified on the centre, the analysis will also adjust for the centre.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> Such analyses, also used in our recent randomised trial of behavioural economic interventions for smoking cessation,<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> use data on all randomised participants to estimate the effects of specifying any treatment choice in ADs regardless of group assignment, and after accounting for the possibility that AD completion rates may differ among the three arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015010628F2">figure 2</xref>C) by using the randomisation arm (ie, initial treatment assignment) as the IV. Thus, the estimated effect of the choices patients make is adjusted for the percentage of assigned patients who complete an AD at all, and the percentage who opt out from their assigned default option. Unlike a per-protocol analysis, this IV approach uses data on all randomised patients, and then adjusts for AD completion rates, thereby attenuating the selection effects.</p><p>This approach requires the use of principal stratification methods<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> to formulate the causal quantities of interest and determine the proportions of patients in each arm who would choose comfort care if they were assigned to complete each version of the AD. The analysis assumes that all patients who would choose comfort care in a standard AD would also choose it in an AD that defaults to comfort care, and that all patients who would choose comfort care in an AD that defaults to aggressive care would also choose it in a standard AD or an AD that defaults to comfort care. Coupled with the possibilities that some participants would never return an AD, and that others would return an AD but not choose comfort care regardless of group assignment, this creates five compliance classes (principal strata) of participants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015010628TB3">table 3</xref>).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>

This approach entails non-inferiority tests of data from a Poisson distribution, such that we seek to reject the hypothesis of a rate ratio (RR) for HFDs that is significantly &#x0003e;1.0. By enrolling 270 patients who complete ADs&#x02014;90 in each of the three arms&#x02014;we will obtain at least 80% power to demonstrate non-inferiority up to a margin of an RR for HFDs &#x02265;1.18 associated with use of one AD type. This calculation is based on: (1) a one-sided &#x003b1; of 0.05, yielding an upper confidence limit on the observed RR that falls entirely below an RR of 1.18; (2) a mean number of HFDs in the control group of 100, such that a RR of 1.18 would correspond to 15 (15%) fewer HFDs in a given AD group (100/85=1.18); (3) an allowance for considerable dispersion in the distribution of HFDs; (4) no loss to follow-up because all deaths and hospitalisations will be checked against the Social Security Death Index and Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council (PHC4), respectively; (5) an allowance for two primary hypotheses tests (comparing both the comfort-default and life-extension default arms to the control arm) and (6) a true RR of 1.0. This final choice reflects our hypothesis that assignment to all three ADs will produce equivalent numbers of HFDs. If the true RR is below 1.0 (eg, the comfort default increases HFDs), power would increase considerably. Further, because simulations used to generate these sample size estimates included scenarios with extreme assumptions of data dispersion, and the proposed sample sizes incorporate this conservative assumption, our observed power is likely to be higher than stated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Ethics</title><p>This study has been approved by the University of Pennsylvania IRB (protocol #819325) and the IRB at the University of Pittsburgh (PRO14020311).
