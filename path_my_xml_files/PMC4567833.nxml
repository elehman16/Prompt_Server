The primary aim of this study is to determine if prefabricated foot orthoses reduce the incidence of lower limb overuse injuries in naval recruits undertaking 11&#x000a0;weeks of basic training.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study is a participant and assessor blinded, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial. The trial will recruit participants undertaking 11&#x000a0;weeks of basic training at the Royal Australian Navy Recruit School, Cerberus, Victoria, Australia. Participants will be randomised to a control group (flat insole) or an intervention group (prefabricated foot orthosis). Over the 11&#x000a0;weeks of basic training, participants will document the presence and location of pain in weekly self-report diaries. The end-point for each participant will be the completion of 11&#x000a0;weeks of basic training. The primary outcome measure will be the combined incidence of four lower limb injuries (medial tibial stress syndrome, patellofemoral pain, Achilles tendinopathy, and plantar fasciitis/plantar heel pain) which are common among defence members. Secondary outcome measures include: (i) overall incidence of lower limb pain, (ii) severity of lower limb pain, (iii) time to injury, (iv) time to drop-out due to injury, (v) adverse events, (vi) number of lost training days, (vii) shoe comfort, and (viii) general health status.

For example, the incidence of lower limb overuse injuries among long-distance runners and physically active defence members has been reported to range from 19 to 79&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The most common injuries include medial tibial stress syndrome, patellofemoral pain, Achilles tendinopathy and plantar fasciitis/plantar heel pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Lower limb injuries result in lost training time, incur financial costs, adversely affect an individual&#x02019;s physical and mental health, and increase the likelihood of stopping physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Given the high incidence and detrimental effects of lower limb overuse injuries, interventions that are effective at preventing injuries are likely to have a significant positive impact on health-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, a recent systematic review concluded that there is only weak evidence to support the use of interventions, including foot orthoses, to prevent lower limb injuries and more high quality trials are needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Foot orthoses are commonly used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], having been shown to be beneficial for treating several musculoskeletal disorders of the lower extremity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], as well as reducing the incidence of shin splints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and femoral stress fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Although the specific mechanism of action by which foot orthoses provide benefits remains unclear, there is evidence that they alter kinematics, kinetics, and/or muscle activity of the lower limb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Evidence to support the use of foot orthoses to prevent lower limb injuries is limited, though, as existing trials are generally of poor methodological quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, this study aims to determine if prefabricated foot orthoses reduce the incidence of common lower limb overuse injuries in naval recruits undertaking 11&#x000a0;weeks of basic training.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>The Australian Navy Cerberus Orthotic Research (ANCOR) study is a participant and assessor, parallel-group blinded, randomised controlled trial. Participants will be randomised to a control group (flat insole) or an intervention group (prefabricated foot orthoses). To ensure allocation concealment, permuted block randomisation with random block sizes, stratified by sex, will be undertaken using an interactive voice response telephone service provided by the NHMRC Clinical Trials Centre (University of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia). The end-point for each participant will be the completion of their 11&#x000a0;week basic training programme. The location of the trial will be at the Royal Australian Navy Recruit School, Her Majesty's Australian Ship (HMAS), Cerberus, Victoria, Australia (HMAS Cerberus). The trial has been registered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12615000024549). The findings from the trial will be reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>Ethical clearance for this project was provided by the Australian Defence Human Research Ethics Committee (protocol number: 764&#x02013;14) and the La Trobe University Faculty Human Ethics Committee (protocol number: FHEC 14/250). All participants will provide written informed consent prior to recruitment. Ethical standards will adhere to the National Health and Medical Research Council National Statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and the World Medical Association&#x02019;s Declaration of Helsinki [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants will be naval recruits from the Australian Defence Force (ADF). The minimum age of entry for naval recruits is 17&#x000a0;years, with the maximum age being generally three to six years before the compulsory retirement age of ADF members (60&#x000a0;years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Prior to undertaking basic training, naval recruits must pass a pre-entry medical and fitness test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Fitness requirements include a minimum of 20 sit-ups and a multistage 20 m shuttle run test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] score of 6.1. The multistage 20 m shuttle run test involves running between two points that are 20 m apart and doing so within a series of pre-recorded audible beeps, with time between beeps decreasing as the test proceeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Achieving a shuttle run score of 6.1 equates to 43 shuttles or a total of 860 m in 5&#x000a0;min and 15&#x000a0;s. In addition, female and male recruits are required to perform a minimum of 6 and 15 push-ups, respectively. The maximum allowable body mass index (BMI) is 32.9&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>; and recruits with a BMI less than 18.5&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> may be deemed temporary unfit by medical staff, with this decision determined in consideration of the recruit&#x02019;s general and medical fitness.</p><p>All naval recruits undertaking 11&#x000a0;weeks of basic training at HMAS Cerberus will be invited to participate in the trial. Consecutive cohorts of recruits will be invited to participate until the pre-specified sample size (see below) is achieved. Participants will be excluded if they use foot orthoses or have a lower limb injury (causing pain of least 30&#x000a0;mm on a 100&#x000a0;mm visual analogue scale when at worst [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]) at the time of recruitment. All recruits will be provided information about the study at the commencement of their 11&#x000a0;week training programme.

The sample size for the study was calculated assuming: (i) a combined incidence of injury of 30&#x000a0;% for medial tibial stress syndrome, patellofemoral pain, Achilles tendinopathy, and plantar fasciitis/plantar heel pain, and (ii) a drop-out of 20&#x000a0;%.

Prior to the study commencing, the assessors will attend a minimum of two training sessions. A detailed manual outlining study procedures will be provided to all assessors. The training sessions will be conducted by the chief investigator (DRB) who has 10&#x000a0;years of clinical and research experience using foot orthoses for musculoskeletal conditions.</p><p>Participants will be randomised to one of two groups: (i) a <italic>control group</italic> that will receive a pair of 3&#x000a0;mm flat insoles, or (ii) an <italic>intervention group</italic> that will receive a pair of Formthotics&#x000ae; prefabricated foot orthoses (Model: Original Single Medium) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Both interventions, collectively referred to as shoe insoles, will: be manufactured by the same company (Foot Science International, Christchurch, New Zealand), be full-length insoles made from the same material (140&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>3</sup> single density, closed cell polyethylene foam), and will have the same branding (i.e. company logo). The only difference between the two interventions will be the geometry and level of support that the shoe insoles provide (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). To maintain blinding of participants, the participants will only be advised that they will receive one of two types of &#x02018;shoe insole&#x02019; during the study. The allocated shoe insoles (flat insole or prefabricated foot orthosis) will be placed in the participant&#x02019;s footwear and heat moulded to the participant&#x02019;s feet and footwear. To achieve this, the participants will receive their footwear containing their heated insoles and they will be required to stand in them to enable the insoles to mould to their feet, as per the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions (Foot Science International, Christchurch, New Zealand). For the 3&#x000a0;mm flat insole, this moulding process will be one largely of slight compression of the material under weightbearing areas of the foot (i.e. it will not provide support to the arch of the foot or substantial contouring around the heel). Each participant will have their shoe insoles fitted to their athletic shoes and Defence-issued boots (i.e. two pairs of shoe insoles per participant) to maximise convenience and adherence to the interventions. All recruits will receive the same Defence-issued boots (Oliver Footwear Pty Ltd Structural Fire Fighter Boot, Model Number 20292) at the beginning of their 11&#x000a0;weeks of basic training (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>The prefabricated foot orthosis (left) and flat insole (right) prior to being heat moulded to a participant&#x02019;s foot.

The therapist will fit and heat the allocated insoles into the participant&#x02019;s footwear. Once the insoles have been heated, the therapist will place the participant&#x02019;s footwear on a table outside of their room for the blinded assessor. The assessors, unaware of the insole allocation, will collect the participant&#x02019;s footwear and advise the participants to wear their footwear for several minutes to allow moulding. Following this, participants will be asked to rate the comfort of their shoes after a brief period of wear (see the &#x02018;outcome measures&#x02019; section for more detail). In addition, all participants will be issued with: (i) an information sheet informing them of the recommended wearing-in protocol and how to care for their shoe insoles, and (ii) an individual diary for participants to self-report pain levels over the 11&#x000a0;weeks of basic training. The self-report diaries will consist of body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and foot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] pain drawings, which have been shown to have good to excellent inter- and intra-rater reliability of scoring the location of pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Each week, participants will be required to indicate the presence and location of pain by shading within the outlines of the pain drawings.

Numerous clinical trials have previously investigated whether foot orthoses prevent injuries; however they are generally of poor methodological quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Of particular note, the majority of previous trials lacked participant and assessor blinding, and few compared the intervention to a control intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], which is likely to bias or confound the findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p>The foot orthosis selected for this trial were chosen for four main reasons. Firstly, prefabricated foot orthoses were considered more practical than customised foot orthoses (made from a cast or mould of the foot) as they can be issued to participants immediately, which is preferable in defence force populations. Secondly, prefabricated foot orthoses are relatively inexpensive compared to customised orthoses. This is an important consideration, as if this study demonstrates that foot orthoses can prevent injuries, cost effectiveness is likely to be a factor when deciding whether foot orthoses become standard issue for defence force recruits. Thirdly, the specific prefabricated foot orthosis (Formthotics&#x000ae;, Foot Science International, Christchurch, New Zealand) was selected as similar devices have been used in large randomised trials with few orthotic-related adverse events being reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The selected orthosis is made from polyethylene foam and a similar trial reported fewer orthotic-related participant drop-outs in those assigned to an orthosis made from a foam-based material (9&#x000a0;%) compared to a semi-rigid plastic (37&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Such factors are important because minimising adverse events and ensuring the orthosis is comfortable is particularly important in this trial as the naval recruits will undertake rigorous activity within days of receiving their allocated shoe insoles. Fourthly, the selected orthosis is commercially available and widely used in clinical practice, which should enable them to be readily utilised as a preventative intervention if they are indeed found to be effective in this trial.</p><p>A distinguishing feature of this trial is the use of a flat insole as a control intervention. The inclusion of a flat insole as a control intervention assists with accounting for non-intervention effects not directly related to an experimental intervention (e.g. placebo effect, Hawthorne effect, natural resolution, etc.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Similar flat insoles have been perceived by participants as being equally credible and expected to provide similar benefits as foot orthoses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], which is likely to aid blinding and minimise confounding factors such as resentful demoralisation among participants not receiving the prefabricated orthosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The potential effects of resentful demoralisation cannot be totally mitigated by the use of a control intervention as the participants will reside within the same barracks and there is the possibility that they will compare insoles and notice differences between them. However, as all insoles have the same branding, are made from the same material and will be heat moulded to the participant&#x02019;s feet they are intended to look as similar as possible. It is worth noting that the flat insole used in this study is best considered as a &#x02018;sham&#x02019; and not a true placebo, as it is likely to provide some mechanical (e.g. plantar pressure) effects to the foot, as shown in previous studies that used similar materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. In consideration of these potential effects, a flat insole was selected as the control intervention as similar insoles, whether flat or contoured, have been shown to provide the same mechanical effects as a shoe alone in the midfoot region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. This was considered important as one of the major modes of how foot orthoses are proposed to provide benefits is through increased loading of the plantar-medial midfoot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Clearly, the decision of what control insole to use is a balance between minimising non-interventions effects and avoiding participants experiencing resentful demoralisation.</p><p>The eligibility criteria do not require participants to have a particular foot type. Although foot orthoses are most frequently used to treat overuse conditions associated with excessive foot pronation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], orthoses have been shown to benefit a range of different foot postures including pronated and supinated feet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. In addition, foot orthoses effect lower limb kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activity with the specific mechanism of action remaining unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. As such, any benefits foot orthoses provide may result from one or all of these mechanisms and not necessarily be related to foot posture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Most importantly, it is not currently possible to identify individuals most likely to benefit from the prophylactic use of foot orthoses using particular characteristics such as foot posture.</p><p>Finally, this trial has been designed to optimise its scientific rigour, which will overcome some of the limitations of previous trials. Some strengths of the trial include the use of allocation concealment, participant and assessor blinding, blinded data entry, adhering to the intention-to-treat principle to analyse data and the use of a control intervention. In addition, as the trial is being conducted in a defence force setting, variables such as access to medical care, training loads, diet, sleep, clothing and footwear will be largely standardised. However, there is one potential limitation with this trial, and that is the generalisability of the population to be studied. Participants will be relatively homogenous as they will predominantly be healthy young adults that are enrolled in a relatively intense physical training programme. Accordingly, the findings of this trial will need to be generalised to the broader community in consideration of such strengths and limitations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This randomised controlled trial will evaluate the effectiveness of foot orthoses for the prevention of lower limb injuries.
