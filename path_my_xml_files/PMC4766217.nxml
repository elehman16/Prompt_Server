We report the results from two phase 2 randomized studies examining the use of sotatercept for the treatment of CIA in patients with metastatic cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In study A011-08, patients with metastatic breast cancer were randomized to 2:2:2:1 to receive sotatercept 0.1, 0.3, or 0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg, or placebo, respectively, every 28&#x000a0;days. In study ACE-011-NSCL-001, patients with solid tumors treated with platinum-based chemotherapy received sotatercept 15 or 30&#x000a0;mg every 42&#x000a0;days. The primary endpoint for both studies was hematopoietic response, defined as a hemoglobin (Hb) increase of &#x02265;1&#x000a0;g/dL from baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Both studies were terminated early due to slow patient accrual. Among patients treated with sotatercept in the A011-08 and ACE-011-NSCL-001 studies, more patients achieved a mean Hb increase of &#x02265;1&#x000a0;g/dL in the combined sotatercept 0.3&#x000a0;mg/kg and 15&#x000a0;mg (66.7&#x000a0;%) group and sotatercept 0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg and 30&#x000a0;mg (38.9&#x000a0;%) group versus the sotatercept 0.1&#x000a0;mg/kg (0&#x000a0;%) group. No patients achieved a mean Hb increase of &#x02265;1&#x000a0;g/dL in the placebo group. The incidence of treatment-related adverse events (AEs) was low in both studies, and treatment discontinuations due to AEs were uncommon.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Although both studies were terminated early, these results indicate that sotatercept is active and has an acceptable safety profile in the treatment of CIA.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>ActRIIA</kwd><kwd>Chemotherapy-induced anemia</kwd><kwd>Erythropoiesis</kwd><kwd>Sotatercept</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chemotherapy-induced anemia (CIA) is a common complication in patients treated with myelosuppressive chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Anemia is associated with fatigue, reduced functional ability, and impaired quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Current treatment options for CIA include red blood cell (RBC) transfusions and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs); however, both treatment types are associated with an increased risk of thrombotic events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition, ESAs may be associated with possible decreased survival and shortened time to tumor progression in patients with cancer, and RBC transfusions carry a risk of infection, transfusion-related reactions, and possible decreased survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Given these safety concerns, novel treatment options for CIA that are efficacious and safe are needed.</p><p>Sotatercept (ACE-011) is a recombinant fusion protein composed of the extracellular domain of the human activin receptor type IIA (ActRIIA) and the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of the human immunoglobulin G1 antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Animal models and in vitro human models using RAP-011, the murine ortholog of sotatercept, have shown that sotatercept improves RBC parameters by stimulation of late-stage erythropoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This mechanism of action is markedly different from that of ESAs, which act on earlier stages of erythroid development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Sotatercept is thought to act by trapping growth differentiation factor (GDF)-11, a ligand that binds to ActRIIA and impedes terminal erythroid maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A related ligand trap fusion protein, luspatercept (ACE-536), has also been shown to promote maturation of late-stage erythroid precursors via a similar pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Administration of sotatercept or RAP-011 has been shown to increase hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit levels in animal models and in healthy postmenopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]; these findings have promoted interest in sotatercept as a potential treatment for patients with anemia and other diseases characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis. In a mouse model of CIA, RAP-011 has similar effects on Hb and hematocrit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Here we report the results from two phase 2 randomized studies (A011-08 and ACE-011-NSCL-001) evaluating the effects of sotatercept for the treatment of CIA.

ACE-011-NSCL-001 was a phase 2a, open-label, randomized, dose-ranging study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sotatercept for the treatment of CIA in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Both trials are registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">www.ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, A011-08 as NCT00931606 and ACE-011-NSCL-001 as NCT01284348. The data cutoff dates for studies A011-08 and ACE-011-NSCL-001 were November 18, 2010 and January 29, 2013, respectively.</p><p>Adult patients with metastatic breast cancer who were undergoing treatment with a myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimen, and who were expected to continue treatment for &#x02265;9&#x000a0;weeks after initiation of study treatment, were eligible for inclusion in study A011-08. Adult patients with solid tumors and advanced or metastatic disease who were undergoing non-curative treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy were eligible for inclusion in study ACE-011-NSCL-001.</p><p>Chemotherapies were administered according to the standard of care of each study site and included anthracycline, taxane, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, or capecitabine. For both studies, eligible patients were required to have a baseline Hb level between &#x02265;6.5 and &#x0003c;11.0&#x000a0;g/dL.

All these dose levels were considered equivalent and combined for analysis and reporting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Dose modification</title><p>Dose modification rules were based on Hb concentrations and blood pressure readings since the last treatment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Patients in study A011-08 were discontinued from treatment if they experienced drug-related toxicity of grade &#x02265;3, with the exception of patients with grade 3 hypertension that had decreased to grade &#x02264;1 within 7&#x000a0;days of receiving antihypertensive therapy. Patients in study ACE-011-NSCL-001 who experienced an Hb increase &#x02265;3&#x000a0;g/dL sustained for a 28-day period received a dose reduction of two levels; of these patients, those who experienced a second Hb increase of &#x02265;3&#x000a0;g/dL were discontinued from treatment. Patients in study ACE-011-NSCL-001 were also discontinued from treatment if their Hb increased to &#x0003e;15&#x000a0;g/dL, sustained for a 7-day period, whereas patients in study A011-08 with an Hb concentration above the upper limit of normal were discontinued from treatment.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Sotatercept dose-modification rules for studies A011-08 and ACE-011-NSCL-001. <italic>DBP</italic> diastolic blood pressure, <italic>Hb</italic> hemoglobin, <italic>SBP</italic> systolic blood pressure</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="520_2015_2929_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study endpoints and definition of study population</title><p>For study A011-08, the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population and safety population included all randomized patients who received &#x02265;1 dose of study treatment.

For this analysis, the proportion of patients achieving a mean Hb increase from baseline of &#x02265;1&#x000a0;g/dL is reported for the combined A011-08 and ACE-011-NSCL-001 study populations; mean Hb increases were calculated from the first dose received until the end of the study period.</p><p>Secondary endpoints for study A011-08 included hematopoietic response (Hb increase of &#x02265;2&#x000a0;g/dL and Hb concentration &#x02265;11&#x000a0;g/dL sustained for 28 consecutive days), time to achieve hematopoietic response, duration of hematopoietic response, the proportion of patients requiring RBC transfusion and/or treatment with an ESA, and safety. Exploratory endpoints for ACE-011-NSCL-001 included the evaluation of the duration of hematopoietic response, assessment of renal function biomarkers, and evaluation of quality of life and bone metabolism. Safety was evaluated in A011-08 using the safety population, whereas all other secondary endpoints for A011-08 were evaluated in the mITT population. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events guidelines version 3.0 and version 4.0 for the A011-08 and ACE-011-NSCL-001 studies, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Both studies were terminated early due to slower than expected patient accrual rates.

Furthermore, preliminary data from another study have demonstrated evidence of sotatercept activity in patients with &#x003b2;-thalassemia, a condition in which ESAs are generally ineffective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. These data suggest a mechanism of action for sotatercept distinct from that of ESAs and, therefore, raise the possibility of its use in other disease areas.</p><p>The two phase 2 studies described herein evaluated sotatercept as a potential treatment for CIA. The studies were of a similar design, with similar endpoints, populations, and dose-modification rules. A mean Hb increase from baseline of &#x02265;1&#x000a0;g/dL was observed in 46&#x000a0;% of sotatercept-treated patients with CIA, whether they had metastatic breast cancer (study A011-08) or metastatic solid tumors (study ACE-011-NSCL-001). Higher response rates were generally reported in the combined sotatercept 0.3&#x000a0;mg/kg and 15&#x000a0;mg dose group and the combined sotatercept 0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg and 30&#x000a0;mg dose group versus the sotatercept 0.1&#x000a0;mg/kg group, suggesting a possible dose&#x02013;response relationship.</p><p>In both studies, sotatercept was well tolerated in patients with CIA; safety findings were comparable to placebo and were generally consistent with the disease under study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The incidence of treatment-related AEs was low in both studies, and treatment discontinuations due to AEs were comparable to placebo. A single grade &#x02265;3 thrombotic event was reported in the combined sotatercept 0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg and 30&#x000a0;mg dose group. Other treatment options for CIA, including ESAs and RBC transfusion, are associated with an increased risk of thrombotic events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. More deaths were reported in the sotatercept treatment groups versus the placebo group; the majority of deaths were due to disease progression. Given the small number of patients in the placebo group, mortality rates in the placebo and sotatercept treatment groups could not be meaningfully compared. The generally favorable safety profile of sotatercept highlights its potential as an alternative to ESAs in the treatment of CIA. However, due to the small number of patients enrolled and the limited follow-up data available, it was not possible to assess the effect of sotatercept on tumor progression.</p><p>There are several limitations to these studies. It is likely that the dose-modification rules used may have resulted in patients who would otherwise have achieved a hematopoietic response being categorized as non-responders; indeed, the majority of patients who had a dose interruption or reduction in study A011-08 achieved an initial Hb increase from baseline of &#x02265;1&#x000a0;g/dL that was not sustained after dose modification.</p><p>Although the optimal dose and schedule of sotatercept for the treatment of CIA has not been established, it is likely that the dose scheduling employed in our studies may have affected outcomes. The two studies reported herein used dosing intervals of 28 and 42&#x000a0;days, respectively; the dosing schedules used were selected based on preliminary pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data from healthy volunteers treated with sotatercept; mean terminal half-life after subcutaneous multiple dose administration of sotatercept was approximately 23&#x000a0;days, and Hb increase was sustained until &#x02265;2&#x000a0;months after the last dose of sotatercept. Previous studies involving healthy volunteers have also shown sustained Hb increases associated with subcutaneous administration of sotatercept once every 28&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, Hb increases peaked 15&#x000a0;days after administration of the first dose of study treatment in study A011-08, with a decrease to baseline levels by day 29, suggesting that the lack of a sustained Hb response may be due to the dosing schedule used. Most patients in study ACE-011-NSCL-001 had a hematological response, although responses did not always meet study criteria and were not sustained. These results suggest that shorter dosing intervals may be beneficial in future studies.</p><p>Based on preliminary pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data from healthy volunteers, the doses administered in these studies did not exceed 0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg administered once every 28&#x000a0;days. However, subsequent ongoing studies with sotatercept have exceeded this dose: patients with anemia are currently undergoing treatment with sotatercept &#x0003e;1&#x000a0;mg/kg administered once every 3&#x000a0;weeks, with no dose-limiting toxicities, and the maximum tolerated dose has not yet been reached. It is possible, therefore, that the sotatercept doses used herein may be beneath an optimal threshold.</p><p>The use of concomitant chemotherapy regimens was not controlled for in either study and may have potentially affected study outcomes.</p><p>Both of the reported studies were terminated early due to slow patient accrual as a result of significant changes in the recommended treatment of CIA, as opposed to insufficient efficacy or safety concerns. Consequently, the number of patients enrolled was small and the findings should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>Despite these limitations, the available data provide insights into the potential clinical efficacy and safety of sotatercept in the treatment of CIA. The results of these studies indicate that sotatercept is active and has an acceptable safety profile when used in the treatment of CIA. Furthermore, preliminary data from phase 2 trials of sotatercept for the treatment of anemia in patients with diseases characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis, including &#x003b2;-thalassemia and myelodysplastic syndromes, are encouraging, further supporting the clinical potential of sotatercept [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Kenneth Klesczewski for providing statistical input for the analyses.
