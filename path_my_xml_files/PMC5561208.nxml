Patients were randomized to: starting bronchoscopy when hypoventilation (hypopnea, two successive breaths of at least 50% reduction of the peak wave compared to baseline or apnea, no wave for 10&#x02009;seconds) (Study group, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;55), or when the Observer Assessment of Alertness and Sedation scale (OAAS) was less than 4 (Control group, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;59). Propofol infusion was titrated to maintain stable vital signs and sedative levels. The hypoventilation during induction in the control group and the sedative outcome were recorded. The patient characteristics and procedures performed were similar. Hypoventilation was observed in 74.6% of the patients before achieving OAAS&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;4 in the control group. Apnea occurred more than hypopnea (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001). Hypoventilation preceded OAAS&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;4 by 96.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;88.1&#x02009;seconds. In the study group, the induction time was shorter (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03) and subjects with any two events of hypoxemia during sedation, maintenance or recovery were less than the control group (1.8 vs. 18.6%, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). Patient tolerance, wakefulness during sedation, and cooperation were similar in both groups. Significant hypoventilation occurred during the induction and start bronchoscopy following hypoventilation may decrease hypoxemia without compromising patient tolerance.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Sedation to patients undergoing flexible bronchoscopy (FB), except when there are contraindications, is well documented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

Physicians responsible for sedation should be specifically trained in sedative administration and sedative level monitoring to prevent oversedation and cardiopulmonary depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The incidence of hypoxemia during propofol sedation is around 30~40% in different studies. Preventing the respiratory depression is a major goal of procedure sedation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. We have observed that certain respiratory depressions have occurred during the induction of FB sedation in previous works. However, studies about how to improve the induction of FB sedation are limited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The desired FB sedation depth is usually <bold>&#x02018;</bold>moderate sedation<bold>&#x02019;</bold>. In these cases, patients respond purposefully to verbal or tactile stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. However, patients respond to sedatives differently and the transition of patients&#x02019; consciousness from alert into the desired sedation depth during induction also varies. During the induction, the respiratory drive and muscle tone of the upper airway and respiratory muscle attenuate, which may contribute to hypoventilation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Traditionally, the detection of respiratory depression relied on monitoring the respiratory rate and oxygen saturation. However, studies reveal that there is no significant correlation between hypoventilation and the sedative scale, and the respiratory rate and oxygen saturation are not reliable indicators of hypoventilation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Capnography is a non-invasive measurement of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the absorption of infrared light. The maximal partial pressure of CO2 obtained at the end of an exhaled breath, is referred to as the end&#x02013;tidal CO2 (EtCO2). The resulting capnogram allows us to have a continuous assessment of the airway patency and ventilation. Different patterns of hypoventilation during sedation have been recognized, e.g. bradypnea with elevated EtCO2, hypopnea with decreased EtCO2, and apnea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Some studies have demonstrated that capnography appears to be more sensitive than clinical assessment or oxygen saturation in detecting depressed respiratory effort in pharmacologically sedated patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Although capnography seems proper in endoscopy sedation, whether a capnogram provides more accurate information about hypoventilation events, which may lead to hypoxic events, than the standard monitoring (for example, pulse oximetry) alone during FB sedation is still unknown.</p><p id="Par5">We hypothesize that hypoventilation may occur during the induction of FB sedation. There are two purposes of this proof-of-concept study&#x02013;first, to evaluate the hypoventilation pattern during the induction of FB sedation; second, to evaluate if the incidence of hypoxemia could be reduced by starting FB earlier, when a hypoventilation event occurs during induction, despite the level of sedation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><p id="Par6">This prospective, randomized study was conducted in the tertiary medical center Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou, Taiwan. The study protocol was approved by the Chang Gung Medical Foundation Institutional Review Board (No.104&#x02013;0872&#x02009;C). Patients who were undergoing elective FB and agreed with sedation, were screened for enrolment.

Patients with a known history of allergy to the study drugs, or to eggs, soybeans or sulfite products, were also excluded. All enrolled patients provided a written informed consent. Eligible enrolled patients were randomised by a predetermined random computer code into the study group or the control group in a 1:1 ratio, assisted by the research assistant.

The blood pressure was monitored using an automated pressure cuff while heart rate and rhythm were monitored by the three-lead electrocardiography. A nasal-oral cannula with a microstream CO2 monitoring (SMART CAPNOLINE O2 plus, Philips M3015A, USA) was fitted over the patients&#x02019; nose and an oxygen level of 2&#x02009;L/minute was delivered. This sidestream capnography allowed us a continuous monitoring of EtCO2 by means of a nasal&#x02013;oral cannula that sampled CO2 and simultaneously delivered oxygen during FB. Patients were informed to breathe through the nose as much as possible and a continuous stable square waveform of capnography after several minutes was recorded as the baseline waveform. The numeric value of the baseline waveform peak was recorded. The oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2) was monitored by the peripheral pulse oximeter. All parameters were monitored continuously, except for the blood pressure, which was recorded every 2.5&#x02009;minutes. Two screens, one inside and one outside the bronchoscopic room, displayed parameters, including capnography, in real time. The capnography was blinded to investigators by masking the screen inside the bronchoscopic room, if patients were randomized to the control group. Meanwhile, the waveform during induction was recorded by a research assistant outside the bronchoscopic room.</p><p id="Par8">Investigators were qualified for the intensive and critical care and advanced cardiac life support and were specifically trained in the sedative administration and sedative depth monitoring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.

The interventions aimed to avoid hypoxemia by maintaining SpO2 &#x0003e;90% &#x02013; when SpO2 is less 90%, supplemental oxygen was administered up to 6&#x02009;L/min, and/or head/jaw maneuvers were performed, to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. If there was no improvement, assisting ventilations with a bag valve mask was provided. In addition, fluid resuscitation and leg elevation were included in the intervention for hypotension to maintain systolic blood pressure (SBP) &#x0003e;90&#x02009;mmHg and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) &#x0003e;65&#x02009;mmHg.

After the patients were prepared and positioned, the investigators started the stopwatch and sedation. For the study group (capnography-guided induction), the investigator informed the bronchoscopist to start bronchoscopy when he/she recognized the hypoventilation, which includes hypopnea and apnea, from the EtCO2 waveform. The hypopnea is recognized when two successive breaths have at least a 50% reduction in the numeric value of wave peak compared to the baseline, and the peak of the secondary wave is lower than the first one. The apnea is recognized when no wave exists for 10&#x02009;seconds (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). If hypoventilation did not appear while Ce achieved 2.0&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml, Ce was increased by 0.2&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml every 90&#x02009;seconds until capnography showed hypoventilation. For the control group (sedation scale-guided induction), the bronchoscopist started bronchoscopy when the investigator recognized Observer Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAAS) scale &#x0003c;4 (scale 1, no response to shaking; scale 2, responds only to shaking; scale 3, responds only to name called loudly; scale 4, lethargic response to name called in normal tone; scale 5, responds readily to name spoken in normal tone).

Starting bronchoscopy while hypoventilation occurred during induction could shorten the induction time and reduce concurrent events of hypoxemia without compromising patient tolerance, cooperation and willingness to return for the second FB, when needed. To our knowledge, the present study is the first study to describe the profile of hypoventilation during induction of FB sedation.</p><p id="Par23">In the control group, hypoventilation preceded loss of consciousness during induction in three quarters of the patients, which could serve as a warning of respiratory depression. It has been shown that increasing the depth of propofol sedation is associated with upper airway collapse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In this study, we did not observe a direct reduction of hypoxemic events during induction in the study group (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This might be due to the relatively low rate of hypoxemia during induction in the control group and the fact that persistent oxygen administration blunted the effect of hypoventilation on oxygenation. However, there are significantly fewer subjects in the study group having concurrent hypoxemic events over any two of three periods during the broncoscopy procedure, including induction, maintenance, and recovery. One explanation is that the early intervention of hypoventilation may provide better ventilation for a certain period of time. Another possible explanation is that while identical propofol titration was applied during maintenance in both arms after induction, the overall sedative depth might be lighter in the study group than in the control group because of the early FB starts. In summary, starting bronchoscopy during hypoventilation provided protection of the upper airway, and capnography-guided induction did not compromise patient tolerance (including bronchoscope insertion) and amnesia, compared to the control group (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).</p><p id="Par24">Respiratory depression during different procedure sedations is defined as an EtCO2 level of 50&#x02009;mm Hg or greater, a 10% absolute increase or decrease from the baseline or 10&#x02009;mmHg greater than the baseline, or an EtCO2 level less than 30&#x02009;mmHg or less than half of the baseline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. To facilitate the operators&#x02019; practice during the short period of induction (about 3&#x02009;minutes), hypoventilation is defined as hypopnea (two successive breaths of a loss of waveform more than half of baseline) or apnea (no wave for 10&#x02009;seconds). Although the absolute level of ETCO2 was diluted by the oxygen administration, we found that the ETCO2 of hypoventilation during induction was lower than that during the baseline (data not shown).</p><p id="Par25">Moderate sedation is recommended by guidelines for FB sedation. We defined OAAS&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;4 as the adequate sedative level for bronchoscopy sedation. Other response-scale, like sedation-agitation scale or Richmond agitation-sedation scale might be feasible. However, the judgment of the scale should be standardized. Studies about how to achieve the desired sedative level are limited. Improving the respiratory events during induction is a novel field in FB sedation. The efficacy and safety of the induction protocol of the present study by alfentanil bolus two minutes before propofol infusion, has been validated previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Our work further provided the profile of hypoventilation during propofol induction and explored how the safety of FB sedation is influenced by an early intervention indicated by hypoventilation. About 25% of the patients in the control group did not experience hypoventilation before achieving the desired sedative level and two subjects in the study group were excluded for analysis due to no hypoventilation events before induction Ce exceeded 3.4&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml. These patients may represent a population that could maintain adequate upper airway or respiratory muscle tone during moderate or deeper sedation. Sedative scale-guided induction is the proper method for this group of patients.</p><p id="Par26">Applying the CO2 monitoring for respiratory depression in different procedures has been documented. Soto <italic>et al</italic>. reported that 26% patients undergoing a sedation procedure experienced apnea. All of the apnea events were detected by capnography. However, none of them were detected by clinical assessment alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Other studies of sedatives for upper gastrointestinal or colonscopy procedures also revealed that compared to capnography, only 50~38% of apnea or hypoventilation episodes were detected by pulse oximetry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Carmi <italic>et al</italic>. used the transcutaneous CO2 tension monitoring to demonstrate the intra-procedural CO2 tension of bronchoscopic sedation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Compared to propofol alone, the CO2 tension was significantly higher at the 5<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> minute after the sedation procedure started under midazolam combined with alfentanil. Compared to these studies, our data provided the profile of hypoventilation during the induction based on propofol combined with alfentanil. The hypoventilation could be a sign of respiratory depression and intervention. Inserting the FB during the hypoventilation may reduce the chance of airway collapse caused by the sedation and stimulate ventilation, while not compromising the sedative quality. The higher frequency of apnea than that of hypopnea during induction is thought-provoking (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This is the synergetic effect of respiratory drive suppression and/or respiratory muscle tone attenuation by combining propofol and alfentanil. Our data is not enough to distinguish which effect is predominant. In some cases, if respiratory muscle tone suppression is a concern, another sedative drug which less suppresses less respiratory muscle tone, e.g. dexmedetomidine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, could be considered. However, further study is needed to establish the rule.</p><p id="Par27">The present study has certain limitations. First, the investigators and bronchoscopists were not blinded to the sedation procedures. The monitor inside the bronchoscopic room of the control group was covered over the waveform of capnography. Therefore, it is difficult to make completely blinded conditions because of a major difference in the protocol. Nonetheless, the primary endpoint was hypoxemia, which was recorded objectively and data were analyzed by an independent investigator. Second, while the capnography provides a sensitive measurement of ventilation during the induction, its application during the bronchoscopy might be limited because the measurement of capnography by the nasal&#x02013;oral cannula will be disturbed after the entrance of the bronchoscope into the airway. In real-world practice, physicians can combine the visual inspection of respiratory patterns or snoring of patients, or analyze the hemodynamic information available from the photoplethysmography signal.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par28">Our data support the proof of concept that significant hypoventilation occurred during the induction of sedation and starting bronchoscopy following hypoventilation may decrease hypoxemia without compromising patient tolerance.
