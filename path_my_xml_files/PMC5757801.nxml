A prevalence of above 20% falls within the WHO guidelines for daily supplementation with multiple micronutrient powder (MNP). To evaluate the effect of daily MNP supplementation on anaemia amongst Colombian children aged 12&#x02013;24 months we ran a cluster RCT (<italic>n</italic>=1440). In previous work, we found the intervention had no impact on haemoglobin or anaemia in this population. In this current paper, we investigate this null result and find it cannot be explained by an underpowered study design, inaccurate measurements, low adoption of and compliance with the intervention, or crowding out through dietary substitution. We conclude that our intervention was ineffective at reducing rates of childhood anaemia because MNP itself was inefficacious in our population, rather than poor implementation of or adherence to the planned intervention. Further analysis of our data and secondary data suggests that the evolution with age of childhood anaemia in Colombia, and its causes, appear different from those in settings where MNP has been effective. Firstly, rates of anaemia peak at much earlier ages and then fall rapidly. Secondly, anaemia that remains after the first year of life is relatively, and increasingly as children get older, unrelated to iron deficiency. We suggest that factors during gestation, birth, breastfeeding and early weaning may be important in explaining very high rates of anaemia in early infancy. However, the adverse effects of these factors appear to be largely mitigated by the introduction of solid foods that often include meat. This renders population wide MNP supplementation, provided after a diet of solid foods has become established, an ineffective instrument with which to target Colombia&#x02019;s childhood anaemia problem.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0015"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0005">In contrast to other studies, MNP did not increase haemoglobin in Colombian infants.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">We conclude that MNP was both ineffective and inefficacious in our population.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">This is likely due to two differences from populations where MNP has been successful.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">First, rates anaemia in Colombia peak at earlier ages (6&#x02013;12 months) and fall quicker.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">Second, anaemia is less (and increasingly less with age) related to iron deficiency.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="keys0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Anaemia</kwd><kwd>Iron-deficiency</kwd><kwd>Haemoglobin</kwd><kwd>Colombia</kwd><kwd>Micronutrients</kwd><kwd>Multiple micronutrient powder</kwd><kwd>Child</kwd><kwd>Nutrition</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0030">Multiple micronutrient powder (MNP) has been described as an effective and scalable way to combat childhood and infant anaemia. The WHO, for instance, recommends population wide daily MNP supplementation in settings where anaemia has a prevalence of 20% or greater amongst under-twos. Anaemia affects nearly half (46.6%) of under-twos in Colombia&#x02019;s lowest socio-economic strata. This rises to nearly 70% of 6&#x02013;12 month olds (own estimates using ENSIN 2010 data (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Instituto Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar, 2015</xref>)). Colombia in general, and its youngest and most disadvantaged children in particular meet the WHO&#x02019;s criteria for MNP adoption. In an earlier paper (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Attanasio et al., 2014</xref>) we evaluated a daily MNP supplementation intervention targeted at children aged 12&#x02013;24 months from the poorest households in Colombian small towns. We found no effect on childhood anaemia. In this paper, we investigate why MNP supplementation had no impact.</p><sec id="s0010"><title>Early childhood anaemia</title><p id="p0035">Anaemia refers to a sub-optimally low concentration of haemoglobin (Hb) in the blood which reduces its capacity to transport oxygen. Very severe anaemia in young children probably increases mortality rates (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Brabin, Premji, &#x00026; Verhoeff, 2001</xref>) while less severe cases contribute to delays in children&#x02019;s cognitive and motor development (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Grantham-McGregor and Ani, 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Thompson et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="p0040">Deficiencies of iron and other micronutrients, arising from inadequate intake or poor absorption, are the most prominent causes of anaemia in young children (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Balarajan, Ramakrishnan, Ozaltin, Shankar, &#x00026; Subramanian, 2011</xref>). Rapid growth at the start of life means infants&#x02019; requirements for micronutrients are high, especially relative to body size and energy intake, whilst their stores are low (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2005</xref>). Coupled with often unvaried diets, this leaves many young children extremely vulnerable to nutritional anaemia. Iron deficiency is widely reported to account for approximately half the cases of childhood anaemia worldwide (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">DeMaeyer and Adiels-Tegman, 1985</xref>), although the generalisability of this result is not well established (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Stoltzfus, 2001</xref>). Aside from micronutrient deficiencies, other significant causes of childhood anaemia are parasitic infections and malaria, although the latter is not relevant in our regions of Colombia.</p></sec><sec id="s0015"><title>Multiple micronutrient powder</title><p id="p0045">Multiple micronutrient powder (MNP) was designed and described as a cost-effective and scalable way to target nutritional anaemia (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Zlotkin et al., 2005</xref>). Single dose sachets of powder, typically containing iron, zinc, vitamin A and other vitamins and minerals, are sprinkled over a child&#x02019;s food immediately prior to consumption. Because MNP contains multiple micronutrients it can simultaneously address different nutritional causes of anaemia and could, therefore, be more effective than iron supplementation alone. It is argued to be superior to tablets or drops through overcoming problems of poor adherence (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Zlotkin et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p id="p0050">The previous empirical evidence on MNP is encouraging. On the basis of a Cochrane systematic review (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">De-Regil, Suchdev, Vist, Walleser, &#x00026; Pe&#x000f1;a-Rosas, 2011</xref>), the WHO (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2011a</xref>) recommended daily MNP supplementation for all young children in populations with a prevalence of childhood anaemia (in children under 2 years) greater than 20%. The forest plot in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> updates the evidence from that systematic review. It includes all published randomised trials found through an extensive but non-systematic search of literature published up to and including November 2015, which compare MNP with iron to no intervention, or a placebo, or MNP without iron, in populations of children under two years at the start of the intervention (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Attanasio et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Zlotkin et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Soofi et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Jack et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Suchdev et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Macharia-Mutie et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kounnavong et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Veenemans et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Lemaire et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Lundeen et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Adu-Afarwuah et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Menon et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Sharieff et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Giovannini et al., 2006</xref>). <xref rid="s0130" ref-type="sec">Table A1</xref> summarises each study. In ten of the thirteen studies (excluding ours) the mean haemoglobin of the group receiving MNP, controlling for baseline haemoglobin where available, was significantly higher than that of the control group. Overall, a random effects meta-analysis estimates a Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) in haemoglobin concentration across these studies of 5.36&#x000a0;g/L (95% CI: 3.82&#x02013;6.91&#x000a0;g/L).<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Meta analysis of the effect of MNP interventions on mean haemoglobin.

The precise interventions also differed. Thus, we would expect substantial heterogeneity in effects between studies. Indeed, the estimated I-squared of 79.7% (excluding our trial) suggests that almost four fifths of the total variation between studies is due to heterogeneity, rather than sampling variation. In the context of meta-analyses of health interventions, this is high (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Higgins, Thompson, Deeks, &#x00026; Altman, 2003</xref>).</p><p id="p0060">In general, the studies in Asia had substantially greater impacts on haemoglobin than those in Africa, although even within geographic regions the degree of heterogeneity is large (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). On average, studies with high levels of haemoglobin at baseline recorded lower effect sizes. However, substantial heterogeneity remains within subgroups of studies with similar mean baseline haemoglobin.</p><p id="p0065">In the face of significant heterogeneity, estimated WMD from meta-analyses are not particularly informative. They are poor predictors of the effect in any one context and estimate a mean effect for a poorly defined group of populations (those where studies have been carried out and results published). Therefore, these estimates, alone, are ill-suited to create guidelines that will be applied to broad populations. In response to this problem, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Stoltzfus (2014</xref>) argues for moving beyond a &#x02018;black box&#x02019; approach to understanding nutrition interventions and using mechanistic evidence to understand generalisability of results to other settings. This is what we attempt in this paper.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><title>Hypotheses</title><p id="p0070">In this paper, we take the null result of our Colombian MNP intervention and the heterogeneity in the estimated effects of MNP reported by other studies as a starting point. After examining the accuracy of our measurements and the power of the study design, we further investigate the null result by considering three sets of hypotheses. First, we assess the hypotheses that MNP was effective for two subpopulations of children for whom we might anticipate larger impacts &#x02013; children with lower concentrations of haemoglobin at baseline and younger children. Second, we explore whether ineffectiveness of MNP was due to poor implementation or indirect behavioural effects (i.e. whether MNP may still have been efficacious despite being ineffective). In particular, we examine whether no effects of MNP were detected because of either (i) low adoption of or compliance with the intervention or (ii) because MNP crowded out children&#x02019;s consumption of micronutrient rich foods. Thirdly, we analyse whether our intervention was ineffective because the causes of anaemia amongst our population are fundamentally different from those in populations where similar interventions have been effective. Specifically, we investigate the extent to which childhood anaemia in our population is due to iron deficiency hence determining the extent to which the iron supplementation element of MNP is well-suited to address it.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0025"><title>The MNP intervention</title><p id="p0075">The MNP we used was &#x02018;Sprinkles&#x02019; developed by the Sprinkles Global Health Initiative. Each 1&#x000a0;g sachet, to be sprinkled over a child&#x02019;s meal daily, contains 12.5&#x000a0;mg iron (ferrous fumerate), 5&#x000a0;mg zinc, 300&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g vitamin A, 30&#x000a0;mg vitamin C and 160&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g folic acid. This safely meets the average child&#x02019;s daily requirement of iron, Vitamin A, Vitamin C and Folic Acid and the majority of their zinc requirement (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2005</xref>). Our intervention supplemented the children daily for 18 months.</p><p id="p0080">Our intervention and evaluation used the structures of <italic>Familias en Acci&#x000f3;n</italic> (FeA), Colombia&#x02019;s conditional cash transfer programme which targets the lowest socio-economic strata (SISBEN level one) which corresponds to roughly the poorest 16% of the population. The MNP intervention was delivered by home visitors who were local women and in 63% of cases were <italic>Madre L&#x000ed;deres</italic>, locally elected female representatives of FeA beneficiaries. Home visitors were paid $15,000 Colombian Pesos (US$40) a month. Before the intervention began, home visitors in MNP intervention areas received a five hour training session, led by a mentor.</p><p id="p0085">The home visitors delivered the appropriate number of sachets to households every fortnight. To minimise the sharing of sachets across children in the household they provided enough sachets for daily consumption of all children younger than six years. During their first visits, home visitors explained to the mothers (or primary carers) how to store and administer the MNP and what to do in the event of side effects. This information was also contained in a booklet that was given to the mothers. Mothers were asked to record daily whether the target child had consumed MNP and, when necessary, why not. In addition to general oversight the mentors managed stock and procurement logistics and compiled the charts of daily MNP intake.</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0035"><title>Study design and participants</title><p id="p0090">Our study evaluated the impacts of Psychosocial Stimulation (PS, see <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Attanasio et al.

In our context, treatment status is the obvious instrumental variable, as it is randomly assigned and therefore uncorrelated with any unobservable determinant of anaemia.

From the ENSIN sample we take children aged 12&#x02013;42 months (the survey only collected ferritin measurements for children over one year) from the poorest category of Colombia&#x02019;s six-level categorisation system for determining eligibility for social welfare programmes (SISBEN level one).</p><p id="p0150">We estimate the share of anaemia that could likely be addressed through supplementing children&#x02019;s diets with iron by looking at the coexistence of anaemia with iron deficiency. We first use multiple imputation (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Sterne et al., 2009</xref>) to impute missing ferritin measurements. Here we assume that ferritin measurements are missing at random once we control for haemoglobin, height, weight, age, sex, altitude and geographical area. Controlling for these (observable) variables in the imputation routine is important, since missing data (due to refusal for a venous blood sample to be taken) are unlikely to occur at random. Next, we calculate the proportion of anaemic children (Hb&#x0003c;110&#x000a0;g/L, adjusted for altitude) with iron deficiency (ferritin&#x0003c;12&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/L) on the subsample of children who show no evidence of infection (CRP&#x0003c;1.2&#x000a0;mg/L).

When we repeat this analysis for the older ENSIN children (30&#x02013;42 months) we find that, in addition to the overall prevalence of anaemia falling to 19.0%, the proportion of this anaemia that co-exists with iron deficiency falls substantially to 15.1%.

This finding holds even for children we might have expected to benefit the most &#x02013; younger children and those who were anaemic at baseline. Key to understanding this, when similar interventions have been successful, is the progression of anaemia, and its causes, with age in our population.</p><p id="p0230">Nearly 70% of the poorest Colombian children aged 6&#x02013;12 months are anaemic (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), just 10 percentage points below rates in South and Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. However, while anaemia appears very persistent in the Asian and African countries, in Colombia, the rate falls very quickly, almost halving in seven months and falling to 20%, a rate comparable to the USA, by 30 months. This trend appears similar to, but more pronounced than, other countries in South America; and is very similar in the evaluation sample we have analysed.<fig id="f0015"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Prevalence of childhood anaemia by age across different regions.

From <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> we notice that the studies that found MNP to be most effective at increasing haemoglobin were those with very low average initial haemoglobin (severe anaemia) and where the control group still had very low levels at follow-up (persistent anaemia). In contrast, at the time of our baseline survey mean haemoglobin in our study population was the highest amongst all the studies listed in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and mean haemoglobin in the control group increased rapidly over the duration of the intervention, from 114.5&#x000a0;g/L to 120.9&#x000a0;g/L. The increase was even more dramatic for those controls that were anaemic at baseline (104.2&#x02013;118.2&#x000a0;g/L). This supports the idea that our study began after and continued during a period of rapid improvement in anaemia and so did not act in time to address the nearly 70% of 6&#x02013;12 month olds in Colombia (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) who are anaemic.</p><p id="p0240">In <xref rid="s0110" ref-type="sec">Section &#x0201c;Coexistence of anaemia and iron deficiency&#x0201d;</xref> we show that just over a third of anaemia co-exists with iron deficiency for children aged 12&#x02013;24 months (the baseline ages for our study children) and this falls to just 15.1% by ages 30&#x02013;42 months (the follow-up ages of our study children), in a comparable sample of Colombian children. This proportion is substantially lower than in most settings where MNP has been successful (see <xref rid="t0025" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). We interpret this as implying that although iron deficiency is associated with childhood anaemia in our population at the start of our intervention this association is weaker than in other study settings. Therefore coupled with lower absolute rates of anaemia, the proportion of study children for whom the iron supplementation element of MNP could plausibly reverse their anaemia is far lower. This proportion falls rapidly over the ages we intervene to 2.9% by the ages where we collected follow-up. <xref rid="t0025" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> shows this is in contrast to studies where MNP has been effective.

Evidence from our household survey suggests that, in our population even deprived children consume relatively large quantities of meat and other sources of highly absorbable haem iron. At follow-up, children ate beef/liver a mean of 3.77 days out of the past seven days and poultry on 1.86 days (<xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). This is high relative to children&#x02019;s diet in Sub-Saharan Africa-our own (unpublished) data from rural Malawi showed only 38% of children had eaten any meat in the past three days. It is likely higher still relative to many areas of South and Southeast Asia. We also observe a relatively high consumption of Bienestarina, a government provided blend of flour and milk powder fortified with iron and other vitamins and minerals (although substantially less than our MNP), amongst our study population. At baseline 65% of children had consumed Bienestarina during the last week. Similarly, our study children were not eating unusually large quantities of foods with high phytate or phenolic contents which inhibit iron absorption. Therefore, descriptives of food intake render it unlikely that anaemia in Colombian children older than one year, is predominantly caused by current dietary factors, meaning it is unlikely that MNP supplementation could be useful in this context.</p><p id="p0250">If the anaemia we observe after one year of age is largely unrelated to current micronutrient intake, why are nearly 70% of 6&#x02013;12 month olds in Colombia, from the bottom socio-economic strata, anaemic? This study was not designed to answer this question and we provide no firm evidence here. However, we raise some potential hypotheses and provide correlation evidence (controlling for age) from under 12 month olds in the ENSIN sample that is consistent with such hypotheses.</p><p id="p0255">A first hypothesis relates to early feeding practices. In our ENSIN sample we find that mean haemoglobin was substantially (5.06&#x000a0;g/L) higher in infants who were introduced to semi-solid foods between 6 and 8 months (consistent with WHO guidelines) than infants for whom semi-solids had been introduced prior to 6 months. This is consistent with an argument that when semi-solids are introduced before 6 months these are often foods not rich in iron and therefore, because they reduce the consumption of breast milk, they reduce overall iron intake (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Geissler &#x00026; Powers, 2010</xref>). Similarly, dietary diversity and meal frequency in the early weaning period appear correlated with haemoglobin. Infants that met the WHO criteria for a &#x02018;minimum acceptable diet&#x02019; over the past 24&#x000a0;hours had, on average, a haemoglobin of 1.58&#x000a0;g/L higher than those who did not. Work by&#x000a0;<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Olaya, Lawson, and Fewtrell (2013)</xref> also suggests that dietary diversity and micronutrient intake during the early weaning period is key to childhood anaemia in Colombia. Their RCT found that a 6 month intervention encouraging parents to continue breastfeeding, offer red meat more than 3 days a week and offer fruit and vegetables daily increased haemoglobin of 6 month olds. Thus, while we find that diet after 12 months does not contribute greatly to high rates of early childhood anaemia in Colombia it may be that the micronutrient content of children&#x02019;s diet during the early weaning period is crucial.</p><p id="p0260">The second hypothesis relates to infants&#x02019; iron stores at birth, which form infants&#x02019; primary source of iron for the first months of life. Iron status of mothers during pregnancy is a key determinant of infant iron stores at birth (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Allen, 2000</xref>). In our ENSIN sample we find that infants (6&#x02013;12 month olds) whose mothers had taken iron supplements for 4 or more months of pregnancy had a mean haemoglobin concentration 3.10&#x000a0;g/L higher than those whose mothers had not. This is consistent with inadequate iron statuses of pregnant mothers being a key cause of early childhood anaemia in Colombia. A related potential factor is early clamping of the umbilical cord which is an important determinant of low iron stores in infants (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">McDonald, Middleton, Dowswell, &#x00026; Morris, 2013</xref>). While we do not have access to reliable information on timing of cord clamping in Colombia this may be important in analysing early childhood anaemia in Colombia.</p></sec><sec id="s0120"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0265">Although the population of Colombian infants we studied fitted the criteria of the WHO guideline for universal MNP supplementation, they gained no tangible benefit from the intervention in terms of increased haemoglobin. This suggests that favourable evidence from other settings on MNP as a population wide intervention for children 12&#x02013;24 months is not transferable to a Colombian context. We suggest that this is likely due to the causes of childhood anaemia, and its age profile, being different to those settings. Given the ineffectiveness and likely inefficacy of MNP administered from 12 months of age, and the pattern of anaemia we see in Colombia and other countries with a similar profile, future research might usefully study the effects of earlier interventions (gestation to 12 months) targeting early feeding practices and infant iron stores.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibliog0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Attanasio</surname><given-names>O.P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Fernandez</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Fitzsimons</surname><given-names>E.O.</given-names></name><name><surname>Grantham-McGregor</surname><given-names>S.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Meghir</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Rubio-Codina</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Using the infrastructure of a conditional cash transfer program to deliver a scalable integrated early child development program in Colombia: Cluster randomized controlled trial</article-title><source>British Medical Journal</source><volume>349</volume><year>2014</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Adu-Afarwuah</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lartey</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>K.H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Zlotkin</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Briend</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Dewey</surname><given-names>K.G.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Randomized comparison of 3 types of micronutrient supplements for home fortification of complementary foods in Ghana: Effects on growth and motor development</article-title><source>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</source><volume>86</volume><year>2007</year><fpage>412</fpage><lpage>420</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17684213</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref3"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>L.H.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Anemia and iron deficiency: Effects on pregnancy outcome</article-title><source>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</source><volume>71</volume><year>2000</year><fpage>1280S</fpage><lpage>1284SS</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10799402</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref4"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brabin</surname><given-names>B.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Premji</surname><given-names>Z.</given-names></name><name><surname>Verhoeff</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>An analysis of anemia and child mortality</article-title><source>J.
