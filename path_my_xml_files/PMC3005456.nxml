The principal finding was a significantly higher increase in IMAC in euglycemia than in hyperglycemia.</p><p>The effect of euglycemia and hyperglycemia on exercise-related substrate oxidation has also been assessed in healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), however, without determination of IMAC. Still, previous reports do not suggest genuinely different levels of acylated carnitine in patients with type 1 diabetes compared with nondiabetic control subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Conversely, a recent study in patients with type 1 diabetes investigated levels of IMAC during exercise in euglycemia but with differing insulin levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The authors reported a similar increase in IMAC in euglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, implying that the flux through the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) is independent of insulin concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that in individuals with type 1 diabetes, levels of IMAC are influenced by the availability of energy substrates, in particular systemic glucose, whereas levels of insulin seem to have less influence. Of note, IMAC has been shown to increase after a few minutes of high-intensity exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). This result has been hypothesized to be due to the production of acetyl-CoA exceeding its utilization by the Krebs cycle, the acetyl groups consequently being transferred to carnitine by carnitine acetyltransferase, which results in increases in IMAC as well as in free CoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Although IMAC may thus reflect the imbalance of the fluxes through the PDC and the Krebs cycle in high-intensity exercise, its role during exercise at lower intensity or at rest is less clear. Interestingly, previous studies in healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) have suggested an association of IMAC with increased &#x003b2;-oxidation. Compatible with these findings, the present study revealed a higher contribution of net lipid oxidation to overall substrate oxidation in euglycemia than in hyperglycemia together with a tendency toward increased consumption of intramyocellular lipids in euglycemia (data published in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Whether this association is due to a direct effect of substrate fluxes (e.g., increased glucose flux in hyperglycemia compared with euglycemia) on fuel metabolism or whether indirect regulation of key enzymes (PDC and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1) were involved remains speculative because noninvasive determination of IMAC precluded further analysis of intramyocellular metabolic pathways in the present study.</p><p>The strength of the present analysis is its strictly controlled design with stable and identical insulin levels, systemic glucose being the sole variable that has been modified. The use of MRS allowed for a repetitive, noninvasive measurement of IMAC, although technical differences limit the direct comparability of IMAC levels in the present study with results from muscle biopsies. We acknowledge that our results are limited by the small sample size. However, all individuals in this study showed similar dynamics of IMAC according to glycemia. Because of the study design, magnetic resonance spectra could not be obtained directly after completion of the exercise. However, previous studies have shown that postexercise levels of IMAC are remarkably stable for similar time periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The present study was performed in male individuals with type 1 diabetes exclusively, and the complex study design along with the limited resources did not allow us to include a control group of healthy individuals. Statements referring to a more general population thus clearly remain restrictive.</p><p>In summary, in individuals with well-controlled type 1 diabetes, an exercise-related increase in IMAC was detected in both glycemic conditions, but the effect was significantly higher in euglycemia than in hyperglycemia. These findings point to a role of IMAC as a marker of exercise-related fuel metabolism in skeletal muscle.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
