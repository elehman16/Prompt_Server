Although a number of fungal components have been implicated in these properties, &#x003b2;-glucans (naturally occurring carbohydrates) have attracted the most attention <xref rid="pone.0108794-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Since the early 1900s, numerous <italic>in vitro</italic> and animal studies have demonstrated immunostimulatory effects of &#x003b2;-glucans <xref rid="pone.0108794-Zekovic1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In addition, the advent of molecular immunology has provided rigorous mechanistic explanations for how humans recognize glucans and how this may influence the immune system <xref rid="pone.0108794-Palma1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. &#x003b2;-glucan is already applied as a food additive in animal feed to enhance the immune response <xref rid="pone.0108794-wwwmyfineequinecombetaglucanhtm1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and it is also widely offered on the internet as a dietary supplement for humans, advertised to have beneficial immunostimulatory effects. Due to the fact that it is inexpensive and well tolerated, oral &#x003b2;-glucan appears as a promising candidate to enhance the immune response. However, there are no studies to substantiate the putative immunostimulatory effects of orally administered &#x003b2;-glucan in humans. The only evidence of immunological effects of oral &#x003b2;-glucan in humans to date is derived from a study in patients with advanced breast cancer, in which oral &#x003b2;-glucans enhanced expression of surface molecules associated with macrophage proliferation and activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) <xref rid="pone.0108794-Demir1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>In the present study we investigated the effects of a commercially available orally administered water-insoluble &#x003b2;-glucan on immune responses of <italic>ex vivo</italic>-stimulated leukocytes in healthy volunteers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108794.s002">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108794.s003">Protocol S1</xref> in the online supplement.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><p>This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT01727895.

Their activity has been shown to be influenced by their degree of branching, size, molecular structure <xref rid="pone.0108794-Volman1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108794-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and the purity of the administered &#x003b2;-glucan <xref rid="pone.0108794-Volman1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The most active &#x003b2;-glucans reportedly share a common structure: a main chain consisting of (l-3)-linked &#x003b2;-D glucopyranosyl units, along which are randomly dispersed single &#x003b2;-D-glucopyranosyl units attached by l-6 or 1-4 linkages <xref rid="pone.0108794-Zekovic1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The BG used in this study is a polymer of &#x003b2;-(1-3)-D-glycopyranosyl units with branching at &#x003b2;-(1-6)-D-glycopyranosyl units, therefore belonging to the class of most active &#x003b2;-glucans. In addition, in an evaluation of four different orally administered commercially available &#x003b2;-glucans in mice, BG was shown to be the most potent in increasing phagocytosis capacity of peripheral blood cells and IL-2 production of splenic cells <xref rid="pone.0108794-Quintin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Based on these data, and because BG is rated &#x02018;GRAS&#x02019; (Generally Recognized As Safe) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a dietary food additive supplement <xref rid="pone.0108794-FDA1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, and safe and non-toxic by the Dutch Medicines Evaluation Board (MEB) <xref rid="pone.0108794-European1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, we deemed this preparation of BG representative of commercially available oral &#x003b2;-glucans. Because of the complete absence of any effect on cytokine production or microbicidal activity, although investigated in a small number of subjects for only a limited period, we conclude that BG or similar glucan products do not appear to be viable approaches for immunostimulation in humans.</p><p>The lack of immunostimulatory effects of &#x003b2;-glucan in our study could have several reasons. First, it could be due to the absence of adequate absorption of &#x003b2;-glucans from the intestinal tract in healthy volunteers, which is in agreement with the undetectable serum levels found in various other studies showing that enteral administration of insoluble &#x003b2;-glucans from different sources result in low systemic blood levels (less than 0.5%) in mice <xref rid="pone.0108794-Kournikakis1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, and weaned pigs <xref rid="pone.0108794-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Nevertheless, despite these low systemic blood levels, significant systemic immunomodulating effects in terms of humoral and cellular immune responses were demonstrated. It was speculated that these effects are exerted by enterocytes that facilitate the transportation of &#x003b2;-glucans and similar compounds across the intestinal cell wall into the lymph fluid, where they interact with macrophages and thereby activate the immune system despite low serum levels <xref rid="pone.0108794-Frey1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Given the lack of effects of BG in our study, it is unlikely that these local effects also take place to a significant degree in humans.</p><p>A second explanation might be related to the water solubility of &#x003b2;-glucans, because previous studies have demonstrated that water soluble &#x003b2;-glucans interact with the immune system differently compared with their insoluble counterparts. Soluble &#x003b2;-glucans activate the immune system in a complement mediated manner, depending on specific antibodies<xref rid="pone.0108794-Qi1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, while insoluble &#x003b2;-glucans, like BG used in this study, activate both the innate and the adaptive immune responses via the dectin-1 receptor pathway <xref rid="pone.0108794-Qi1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108794-Adams1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. As such, it has been suggested that soluble &#x003b2;-glucans possess less biological activity than their insoluble counterparts. Therefore, although we did not investigate a soluble formula, it is unlikely that orally administered water soluble &#x003b2;-glucans will have a more pronounced immunostimulatory effect in humans than the BG used in this study. However, future studies are warranted to assess this aspect.</p><p>Third, the lack of effects might be related to the fact we used a commercially available &#x003b2;-glucan preparation sold as a dietary supplement, with a relatively modest purity of at least 83%. It is possible that a highly purified pharmaceutical preparation optimized for oral delivery could have immunostimulatory effects in humans. Finally, we only investigated one dose of BG, based on the recommendation of the manufacturer, which is not supported by empirical data. Nevertheless, this dose is similar to that used in two previous studies, where it was demonstrated that oral ingestion of 900 mg water-insoluble &#x003b2;-glucan daily for 16 or 26 weeks reduced the incidence in common cold episodes during the cold season <xref rid="pone.0108794-GraubaumHJ1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108794-Auinger1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Of note, endpoints in both studies were based on questionaires, no immunological endpoints were assessed. Also, the dose used in the present study is higher than the dose rated &#x02018;GRAS&#x02019; by the FDA and MEB (375 mg per day) <xref rid="pone.0108794-FDA1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0108794-European1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, which was based on the mean background intake of &#x003b2;-glucans from other dietary sources.</p><p>While our study does not support use of oral &#x003b2;-glucan to enhance the immune response, it does not exclude that parental administration of &#x003b2;-glucan, as currently performed in clinical trials (e.g. NCT01269385, NCT00002099), could represent a valuable immunostimulatory therapy. It has been reported that &#x003b2;-glucan from S. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> administered intravenously to high-risk surgical patients resulted in decreased infection incidence, reduced need for antibiotics, shortened intensive care unit length stay, and ultimately improved survival compared with placebo <xref rid="pone.0108794-Dellinger1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In addition, several clinical trials in East Asia have proposed immunomodulatory and antioncogenic effects of &#x003b2;-glucan in cancer patients <xref rid="pone.0108794-Higashi1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0108794-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Larger studies are warranted to confirm these data, investigate the biological mechanisms though which effects are induced, and to fully explore the therapeutic potential of &#x003b2;-glucans.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Despite promising results obtained in <italic>in vitro</italic> and animal studies, our study demonstrates that the use of oral &#x003b2;-glucan does not enhance the responsiveness of the immune system in humans.
