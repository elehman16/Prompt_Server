In the fixed- and flexible-dosing groups, 12% and 41%, respectively, of between-injection intervals were outside the 23&#x02013;25-h range, and 2% and 16%, respectively, were outside the 21&#x02013;27-h range. Least squares mean between-group difference in HbA<sub>1c</sub> change from baseline was 0.05 % (95% confidence interval [CI], &#x02212;0.13 to 0.23); for fasting plasma glucose, 2.7&#x02009;mg/dL (95% CI, &#x02212;9.0 to 14.4); and for daily basal insulin dose, 0.00&#x02009;U/kg (95% CI, &#x02212;0.02 to 0.03).

The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of Gla-300, which extend beyond 24&#x02009;h,<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> may additionally allow greater flexibility in basal insulin injection time, permitting people to adapt injection times to their daily lifestyle needs.</p><p>To investigate the efficacy and safety of Gla-300 when there is greater variability in the timing of injections, two predefined, 3-month substudies were embedded within EDITION 1 and EDITION 2.

Gla-300 was administered each evening using a modified SoloSTAR<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Sanofi, Paris, France) pen injector, with its dose usually adjusted weekly (and no more often than every 3 days) seeking a fasting self-measured plasma glucose of 80&#x02013;100&#x02009;mg/dL (4.4&#x02013;5.6&#x02009;mmol/L) prior to breakfast, as in the main studies.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Participants documented their daily basal insulin dosage and time of administration. The reference injection times for all individuals were established at the start of the main studies. Participants in the flexible-dosing groups were instructed to inject insulin doses within 3&#x02009;h earlier or later than their injection reference time (24&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;up to 3&#x02009;h) and at the maximum interval (i.e., 3&#x02009;h earlier or later than the reference injection time in the evening) on at least 2 days in each week. Participants in the fixed-dosing groups were instructed to continue with the injection of basal insulin doses at their reference injection time each evening, with 24&#x02009;h between injections.</p><p>In the EDITION 1 substudy, mealtime insulin doses were adjusted at the discretion of the investigator. In the EDITION 2 substudy, if hemoglobin A1c (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) or fasting self-measured plasma glucose measurements were above target values and there was no reasonable explanation for inadequate glucose control, or if appropriate action failed to decrease the levels to below threshold values, rescue therapy could be considered by the investigator, based on a thorough evaluation of the participant's glycemic control. The choice of rescue medication was based on the investigator's decision and local approved guidelines. Assessment visits occurred at the baseline of each substudy (Month 6 of the main EDITION studies) and at the end of each 3-month substudy (Month 9 of the main EDITION studies). Telephone interviews were conducted at Week 1, Week 3, and Month 1.5 during each substudy.</p></sec><sec id="s005"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The time intervals between two consecutive injections in the last 7 days before the assessments at Month 1.5 and Month 3 (Month 7.5 and Month 9, respectively, of the main EDITION studies) were analyzed. Thus, for each participant two 7-day sequences of injections were available for analysis. For purposes of analysis, dosing intervals were assigned to the following categories: 24&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;up to 1&#x02009;h (within a 23&#x02013;25-h interval), 24&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1&#x02013;3&#x02009;h (within a 21&#x02013;23-h or within a 25&#x02013;27-h interval), and 24&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;more than 3&#x02009;h (beyond a 21&#x02013;27-h interval). The percentage of all between-injection intervals within or outside each of these ranges was calculated. In addition, the percentage of participants with all injection intervals in the 23&#x02013;25-h range was determined.</p><p>The primary efficacy end point was the change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> from substudy baseline to the end of the 3-month substudy. Secondary end points included the change in laboratory-measured (clinic-collected) fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and daily basal insulin doses. Hypoglycemia occurring between the substudy baseline and the end of the substudy was analyzed by categories defined by the American Diabetes Association<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and was classified as occurring during the night (&#x0201c;nocturnal&#x0201d;; 00:00&#x02013;05:59&#x02009;h) and at any time (24&#x02009;h). Both percentages of participants with one or more hypoglycemic event and annualized rates (events per participant-year) were calculated. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s006"><title>Data analysis and statistics</title><p>Outcomes were assessed separately for each substudy, as well as a pooled analysis of both. The individual substudy data were analyzed using analysis of covariance with treatment regimen and country as fixed effects and using the corresponding baseline value (at 6 months of the main study) as a covariate. A fixed-effect analysis based on the pooled data from EDITION 1 and EDITION 2 was performed for the modified intent-to-treat population (all participants who were randomized in the substudies and who, in the substudies, received at least one dose of Gla-300 and had an initial assessment and one or more subsequent assessment). For the change in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, FPG, and daily basal insulin dose from the substudy baseline to the end of the 3-month substudy, analysis of covariance was performed with fixed categorical effects of treatment regimen and substudy, as well as the continuous fixed covariates of corresponding baseline value. Safety end points were analyzed descriptively using the safety population, defined as all participants randomized within the substudies and exposed to at least one dose of Gla-300, regardless of dosage or duration.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s007"><title>Results</title><sec id="s008"><title>Study population</title><p>In total, 109 participants from EDITION 1 and 89 from EDITION 2 were enrolled in the substudies.

However, both people with diabetes and physicians agree that a daily fixed injection time is restrictive, and in real life individuals often deviate from a fixed injection time in order to adapt to daily changes of schedule.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> In one survey, only 19% of physicians reported that their patients were &#x0201c;very successful&#x0201d; at taking their insulin injection at a fixed time every day.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In a survey of people with diabetes,<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> 24% of respondents reported they had mistimed their basal insulin injection (&#x000b1;2&#x02009;h from the prescribed injection time) on one or more occasions in the previous 30 days, with a mean number of 4.2 mistimed doses in the previous 30 days. Some individuals (6.5%) had mistimed their injections on more than five occasions in the previous 30 days. In addition, 47% of people in this survey reported that a fixed-dosing schedule negatively affected many daily activities. Hence the results of clinical studies may not always be reflected in clinical practice, when people are less consistent in using insulin. New basal insulin analogs with longer and more stable profiles of action might be less affected by greater variation of injection time. Thus, finding no loss of efficacy or safety when intervals between injections of these agents are varied in research studies might allay concerns that such studies are not relevant to clinical practice.</p><p>These substudies of EDITION 1 and EDITION 2 were designed to address this issue, in the setting of glycemic control that had previously been optimized. The advice given to participants in the flexible-dosing arm of the study clearly increased the variability of injection timing compared with that observed in the fixed-dosing interval arm, both with regard to the number of participants with at least one interval outside the 23&#x02013;25-h range (85% vs. 36%) and in the percentage of all observed intervals outside the range (41% vs. 12%). Similarly, more extreme deviations of injection intervals, greater than &#x000b1;3&#x02009;h and thus outside a 21&#x02013;27-h range, were more frequent in the flexible-dosing group compared with the fixed-dosing group (16% vs. 2%). The degree of variability observed in the flexible-dosing group in this study appears similar to that commonly seen in daily life, as reported in the study described above,<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> where the timing of injections may be influenced by variations in timing of the evening meal or bedtime, as required by work or family activities, or by travel.</p><p>Therefore the present findings with Gla-300 provide reassurance that, given this much variability of injection timing, Gla-300 may be expected to have similar efficacy and tolerability in routine clinical use as in EDITION 1 and EDITION 2. Specifically, no differences between the treatment regimens in glycemic control assessed by HbA<sub>1c</sub> or by clinic-collected and laboratory-measured FPG were found, and insulin doses were the same with each regimen. There was no evidence that the occurrence of nonsevere hypoglycemia, defined as confirmed by glucose measurement of &#x02264;70&#x02009;mg/dL or &#x0003c;54&#x02009;mg/dL, was affected by greater flexibility of timing. Severe hypoglycemic events were uncommon with both regimens. Moreover, when data from each of the two substudies embedded within EDITION 1 and EDITION 2 were considered separately, no clear differences were apparent. Thus, increased flexibility of timing of Gla-300 injection led to no difficulties in the setting of either mealtime and basal insulin therapy or basal insulin without mealtime insulin.</p><p>Of interest in relation to these findings with Gla-300 is a previous report of use of insulin degludec, a basal insulin with an even longer action profile than Gla-300, for T2DM.<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Because insulin degludec has a duration of action approaching 2 days (with a half-life of approximately 25&#x02009;h),<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> its efficacy and safety were tested when it was administered with very widely variable (8&#x02013;40-h) dosing intervals and compared with once-daily degludec and once-daily Gla-100 that were always to be injected at the same time of day. In addition to testing dosing intervals that are well beyond those usually recommended in clinical practice, the insulin degludec study differed from the present study by including insulin-naive participants, having a longer follow-up (26 weeks vs. 12 weeks), and enrolling more participants in the variable dosing arm (229 vs. 99). Under these conditions, variable dosing intervals with insulin degludec resulted in equivalent levels of glycemic control and similar rates of hypoglycemia to fixed dosing intervals with either Gla-100 or insulin degludec, providing reassurance that substantially altering injection timing altered neither the risks nor the efficacy of insulin degludec.</p><p>The strengths of our substudies include the success of the intervention in reproducing a degree of variability of injection time that might be expected in usual daily life, as well as the lack of any trend toward undesirable effects of this variability. Limitations include the small numbers of participants enrolled and observation of participants for a period of just 3 months (resulting in relatively low statistical power), dependence on participant reports of the timing of dosing, and some uncertainty as to whether the findings can be generalized to longer-term periods of treatment or other populations. Also, the variability resulting from the advice given to the flexible-dosing group might be less than experienced by some individuals in daily life, and no comparison with an alternative insulin product was included in the substudies. Confirmation of the lack of untoward consequences of greater variability of injection timing will require larger and longer studies in people with T2DM that can provide greater statistical power. Studies of this issue in people with type 1 diabetes would also be of interest.</p><p>In conclusion, the results suggest that allowing greater variability of injection timing (24&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;up to 3&#x02009;h) of Gla-300 in the setting of a clinical study did not compromise efficacy and safety profiles in people with T2DM. Therefore, Gla-300 may allow people with T2DM more freedom in timing their basal insulin injections to deal with the situational variability experienced in daily life.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplemental data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supp_Table1.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d38e904" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><caption><title>Supplemental data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supp_Figure1.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d38e909" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><caption><title>Supplemental data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supp_Table2.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d38e914" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><caption><title>Supplemental data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supp_Table3.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d38e919" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><caption><title>Supplemental data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supp_Table4.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d38e924" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><caption><title>Supplemental data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supp_Table5.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d38e929" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec id="s014" sec-type="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was funded by Sanofi.
