Patients, who were carrying denture for more than 1 year, were included in this study. However, patients who had diabetes or systemic diseases, had used antibiotic, corticosteroids, or antifungal drugs in the past 1 month as well as during the treatment course, and had not followed medical procedure during treatment was excluded from the study. Demographic data and full medical and dental history for all patients were recorded and all clinical examinations were done by a registered prosthodontics specialist. The presence of <italic>C. albicans</italic> was confirmed using culture medium. Palatal swabs were taken from both patients&#x02019; upper denture and mucosa bearing denture for assessment of the presence of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. According to clinical examination and mycological tests, patients who have developed generalized erythema and edema of denture bearing area from moderate to severe, defined as type II and III denture stomatitis. According to the patients&#x02019; profiles number and the random Figures tables, they were randomly divided into two groups of 40 patients, cases and controls, treated with Pelargonium gel and placebo, respectively. We considered complete clinical improvement, if the lesion was completely eliminated and no colony was observed. In the case of reduced inflammation of palatal mucosa, it was reported partial improvement.</p><p>Essential oil of <italic>Pelargonium graveolens</italic> was provided from Barij Essence Company (Kashan, Iran) and the process of preparing the Orabase Gel was designed and formulated at the school of Pharmacy, Isfahan University of Medical science.

Remission of lesion was recorded by the specialized dentist. At baseline, all patients were instructed for denture hygiene and to remove dentures during the night. They were recommended to apply the gel (placebo or drug) twice daily (morning and night) for a complete 14-day course.</p><p>The study protocol was approved by the board ethics for human research at Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.

Denture stomatitis presents as an inflammatory under maxillary prosthesis affecting about 25-65% of subjects, with <italic>C. albicans</italic> being the principal etiological agent.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Toxicity and resistance to normally used antifungal drugs are a complicated challenge.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] To take into consideration are the expanded source of medicinal plants in Iran and immense anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial activity of them in the treatment of skin disorders. A wide variety of plant extracts have been reported to have dramatic inhibitory effects on <italic>C. albicans</italic>. In recent studies, some plants such as <italic>Zatariamultiflora, Origanumvulgare, Melaleucaalternifolia</italic>, and <italic>P. graveolens</italic> have been proved to have inhibitory effects on <italic>C. albicans</italic> which were assessed in synergism with Amphotericin B.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Several compounds derived from the oil of <italic>P. graveolens</italic> have been reported to have acaricidal and insect-repellent activity which can be used for preservative agent in food and cosmetic preparation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Essential oil of some species of Geraniaceae have antibacterial and immunomodulatory activities and are used in respiratory and mucosal infection.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Among such plants, essential oil of <italic>P. graveolens</italic> has great antifungal activity as well as anti-inflammatory and repairing effects. According to classical references &#x0201c;Geranium oil&#x0201d; has been discussed as being useful in healing wounds, abscesses, fever, colic, cold, and sore throats.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>On the other hand, the diluent and cleansing effect of saliva may reduce the level of antimicrobial agents below their therapeutic concentration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Application of Orabase gel which adhere to buccal mucosa to have long term effects, would be much more preferable.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>In this study, all patients of the two study groups were matched in terms of age, gender, colony count of <italic>C. albicans</italic> on palatal sample, duration of denture wearing, removal of denture during at night, and Newton's type of denture stomatitis [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><p>Patients in the intervention arm of the study (cases) who applied 1% gel for two consecutive weeks had a statistically significant improvement in colony count of <italic>Candida</italic> [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>] and the erythema of palatal mucosa [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Inflammation changes of palatal mucosa in cases and control groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="DRJ-8-105-g002"/></fig><p>According to the results of present study, it seems that topical formulation of <italic>P. graveolens</italic> may have some beneficial therapeutic effects in the treatment of denture stomatitis. It is important to mention that we have not observed any reportable side effects in patients receiving Geranium gels. Further clinical studies with larger number of patients are recommended.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Application of a 1% Geranium oil in the form of Orabase gel is more effective than placebo in the treatment of denture stomatitis.
