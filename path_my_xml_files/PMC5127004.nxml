The objectives of this study are to investigate if early controlled motion of the ankle affects functional and patient-reported outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The study is performed as a blinded, randomized, controlled trial with patients allocated in a 1:1 ratio to one of two parallel groups. Patients aged from 18 to 70&#x000a0;years are eligible for inclusion. The intervention group performs early controlled motion of the ankle in weeks 3&#x02013;8 after rupture. The control group is immobilized. In total, 130 patients will be included from one big orthopedic center over a period of 2&#x000bd;&#x02009;years. The primary outcome is the patient-reported Achilles tendon Total Rupture Score evaluated at 12&#x000a0;months post-injury. Secondary outcome measures are the heel-rise work test, Achilles tendon elongation, and the rate of re-rupture. The primary analysis will be conducted as intention-to-treat analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial is the first to investigate the safety and efficacy of early controlled motion in the treatment of acute Achilles tendon rupture in a randomized setup. The study uses the patient-reported outcome measure, the Achilles tendon Total Rupture Score, as the primary endpoint, as it is believed to be the best surrogate measure for the tendon&#x02019;s actual capability to function in everyday life.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02015364?term=kristoffer+barfod&#x00026;rank=2">NCT02015364</ext-link>.

It is a frequent (20 to 32 per 100,000 per year) and potentially debilitating injury that typically affects young active adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Consequently, there are great socioeconomic benefits in optimizing treatment and shortening recovery.</p><p>There is currently no consensus regarding the best treatment for acute Achilles tendon rupture. Traditionally, operative treatment has been considered superior; however, recent studies show that non-operative treatment is a safe treatment which leads to good results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. For this reason there has been a transition towards greater use of non-operative treatment in many orthopedic departments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>However, the optimal non-operative treatment protocol has yet to be clarified. Typically the treatment consists of 8&#x000a0;weeks of immobilization in a cast or orthosis with rehabilitation of the calf muscles and Achilles tendon beginning after week 8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Since the 1980s the impact of early controlled motion of the ankle joint has been discussed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In theory, early controlled motion of the tendon leads to a better and faster healing due to, inter alia, the release of growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Clinical studies looking at flexor tendons have found controlled early movement to promote faster and better healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Animal studies have shown a three times increased strength in mobilized Achilles tendons compared to the immobilized ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Three randomized studies of patients with acute Achilles tendon rupture have compared operative and non-operative treatment using a dynamic rehabilitation protocol in both groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. They show good results for both operative and non-operative treatment. In 2007 Twaddle and Poon concluded that: &#x0201d;possibly, controlled early motion is the important factor in optimizing outcomes in patients with acute Achilles tendon rupture and surgery makes no difference to the outcome apart from increasing the risk of local infection&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>In 1992 Saleh et al. investigated the effect of early controlled ankle motion in non-operative treatment of acute Achilles tendon rupture in a semi-randomized study of 40 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The group which was allowed early controlled motion had improved mobility of the ankle joint after 3 and 6&#x000a0;months but not after 12&#x000a0;months. There were no other significant differences between the groups. Since then, various randomized trials of varying quality have studied the effect of early controlled motion after operative treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. They find increased mobility of the ankle joint within the first 6&#x000a0;months but otherwise no significant differences. One study finds a less pronounced elongation of the Achilles tendon in the group with early controlled motion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Meanwhile, animal studies have shown that early controlled motion of the ankle joint can lead to elongation of the Achilles tendon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and elongation of the Achilles tendon has been shown to cause decreased push-off strength and thus a poor functional outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Several Nordic hospitals have, on the basis of the preceding results, changed their treatment algorithms to feature early controlled motion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, it has never been investigated, involving patients in a randomized setup, whether early controlled motion of the ankle joint is beneficial for the healing of the Achilles tendon in a non-operative treatment protocol.</p><p>With this project we wish to investigate the effect of early controlled motion of the ankle joint from day 14 following non-operative treatment. We will compare this to a traditional treatment protocol where the ankle joint is immobilized for 8&#x000a0;weeks. Full weight bearing is allowed from day 14 in both groups.</p><p>Hypothesis: The optimal loading of the Achilles tendon, and thereby the optimal healing condition, is achieved by early controlled motion of the ankle joint. This will result in a strong tendon with a shorter length than for immobilized ankle joints. The patient-allowed motion of the ankle will experience a better functional outcome and a better patient-reported health in comparison with immobilization.</p><p>Null hypothesis: There is no difference in the functional outcome or in patient-reported outcome when early controlled motion of the ankle joint is compared to immobilization.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a report of the second version of the trial protocol dated 26 March 2014.

At this hospital patients with acute Achilles tendon rupture are recommended non-operative treatment with the following exceptions: (1) ruptures older than 5&#x000a0;days, (2) degenerative ruptures (patients treated with steroids or fluoroquinolones within the last 6&#x000a0;months), and ruptures within 1&#x000a0;cm of calcaneus.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Intervention</title><p>A cast is applied in the emergency room and changed to a circular scotch cast in the outpatient clinic within 4&#x000a0;days. No weight bearing on the injured leg is allowed within the first 2&#x000a0;weeks post-injury. After 2&#x000a0;weeks the cast is changed to a removable orthosis, and full weight bearing is allowed. At this point patients who choose to participate in the trial are, through randomization, placed in one of the following two groups (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>): (1) the intervention group, which must perform controlled ankle motion exercises from the beginning of week 3 through week 8 or (2) the control group; in line with the current treatment regimen, the patients must keep the orthosis on at all times, and they are not allowed to move the ankle before week 9.

The patients are identified by an assigned number. At the completion of the study, all identifiable data will be destroyed. The patients are informed, both verbally and in writing, that data are stored and analysed in a computer, that the patient&#x02019;s anonymity is preserved, and that the data protection legislation is adhered to.

Due to the limited size of the study and the safety of the treatments, a data monitoring committee is not considered necessary.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Statistics and analysis</title><sec id="Sec23"><title>Sample size</title><p>Sixty-five patients will be included in each group, thus 130 patients in total. The sample size calculation is based on a clinical relevant difference of 10 points in ATRS, a standard deviation (SD) of 16, and power of 0.90 (two sided). In a previous study with a fully comparable population, we found an SD of 16 points at the 1&#x000a0;year post-examination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].

The primary and secondary outcomes of both groups are compared by the use of relevant statistics according to the characteristics and distribution of the variables. The change of the outcomes over a period of time is described within each group.</p><p>All statistical testing will be performed at the two-sided 5% significance level, and 95% confidence intervals will be presented where appropriate. No formal interim analyses are planned, and hence no statistical testing will take place until the 1&#x000a0;year analysis. The 1&#x000a0;year analysis will take place after all participants have completed their 1&#x000a0;year follow-up and sufficient time has been allowed for data entry and validation.</p><p>Prior to any analysis, missing data patterns will be investigated and reasons for missing data obtained and summarized where possible. The primary analysis will be conducted as an intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all participants with missing outcome data, unless there is clear evidence that its underlying assumption is inappropriate. A sensitivity analysis will be performed to assess the robustness of the results by imputing missing data using multiple imputation under both missing at random and missing not at random assumptions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Safety</title><sec id="Sec26"><title>Risks and side effects</title><p>Non-operative treatment of Achilles tendon rupture with or without early controlled motion of the ankle joint is a safe treatment used in orthopedic departments all over the country. At Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre we have periodically used first one and then the other regimen without registered risks and side effects for patients. One can theoretically argue that patients allowed early movement of the ankle joint are at risk of healing with an elongation of the Achilles tendon. Moreover, there is always the risk of unknown side effects. Patients participating in the trial are covered by the patient insurance of Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Adverse events</title><p>In this context an adverse event is defined as any unintended, unfavorable finding, symptom, or disease that occurs, whether it is considered to be related to the study or not.

The following factors are included in the assessment: consistency in time, consistency with the known effects of treatment, and alternative causes.</p><p>If a critical adverse event is considered to have a causal relationship with the treatment, then the project manager and other clinically responsible investigators will evaluate whether the study should be terminated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Satellite studies</title><p>Separate protocols have been written for the following substudies.</p><sec id="Sec30"><title>Ultrasonographic-guided treatment of acute Achilles tendon rupture: evaluation of two novel ultrasonographic measurements</title><p>This study will validate Amlang&#x02019;s ultrasound classification and investigate whether the treatment of acute Achilles tendon ruptures can be guided by (1) Amlang&#x02019;s ultrasound classification of acute Achilles tendon rupture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] or (2) Barfod&#x02019;s ultrasound measurement to determine the elongation of the Achilles tendon following a rupture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

We want to investigate the putative negative impact on glucose, lipid, and bone metabolism during a period of restraint from exercise secondary to immobilization following Achilles tendon rupture. We also want to study these patients during their physical active rehabilitation (at weeks 8&#x02013;52) to establish whether they succeed in improving the metabolic impairments they suffered during the early post-injury period, during which strong limitations on physical activity are prescribed (weeks 0&#x02013;8). The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02015364.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Risk of deep vein thrombosis in non-operative treatment for acute Achilles tendon rupture</title><p>This study will investigate the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in non-operative treatment for acute Achilles tendon rupture in the presence of a risk-stratified protocol for antithrombotic treatment.

Early controlled motion of the ankle can be performed in different ways: some use hinged orthoses allowing for movement of the foot while walking and resting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], while others use fixed orthoses that are to be removed for allowance of movement of the ankle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the time period leading up to this study, different orthoses were tried and evaluated in the department. A fixed orthosis was chosen, as it seemed the most reliable choice in the study setup. The chosen motion protocol is based on the one developed by Willits et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It is, however, debatable how often the ankle is to be taken out of the orthosis and how many exercises should be performed. The hinged orthoses were opted out due to technical problems with adjustment of the center of rotation and anxiety of putting too large a strain on the healing tendon.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Endpoints</title><p>For this study the patient-reported outcome measure ATRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] was chosen as the primary endpoint. It is validated in a Danish context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and has been increasingly used since its publication in 2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The score reports the patient perception of the function of the healed tendon and not the actual function of the tendon. The incidence of Achilles tendon ruptures peaks in the early 40s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], the age period in which many people reduce their physical activities and change their pattern of exercise and sporting activities. Therefore, patients might not register impairments leading to decreased physical capabilities, and a high ATRS might be due to low demands of the tendon and not a well-functioning tendon. Following this argument, a physical endurance test like the heel-rise work test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] or a measurement of tendon length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] might constitute better primary endpoints. However, these measurements are very specific and do not describe the tendon&#x02019;s actual capability to function in everyday life. Thus, the ATRS was chosen for this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Compliance</title><p>Compliance to the allocated treatment protocol is important in order to be able to measure the effect of the intervention. In the present study, compliance is measured with a training diary in the intervention group and a seal of the orthosis in the control group. The possibility of measuring compliance with use of motion sensors was investigated prior to the trial but found impossible.</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Changes to the protocol</title><p>Minor changes were performed between the first and the second versions of the protocol. The first version, dated 29 November 2013, was used for institutional review board (IRB) approval and clinical trial registration. The changes did not affect the essential parts of the protocol and did not lead to any changes in the trial registration. The second version of the protocol was accepted by the Ethical Review Board of the Capital Region of Denmark on 5 August 2014.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial commenced in February 2014. Recruitment was originally expected to span 2&#x000a0;years, but due to initial slow recruitment it is now expected to span 2&#x000bd;&#x02009;years.
