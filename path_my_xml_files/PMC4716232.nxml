Knowledge about how to intervene and encourage children with asthma to be physically active is required. In the present study, we aimed to pilot a 6-week exercise intervention designed as active play and examine attendance rate, exercise intensity and children's perceptions of participating.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>6 children with asthma (4 boys, 2 girls) aged 10&#x02013;12&#x02005;years, participated in 60&#x02005;min of active play exercise twice weekly. A mixed-methods design was applied. The data analysed included attendance rate, exercise intensity assessed by heart rate (HR) monitoring during exercise sessions, registration and description of the active play exercise programme, 3 semistructured focus groups, field observations of 5 exercise sessions, and preintervention and postintervention testing.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>The average attendance rate was 90%. Intensity &#x02265;80% of maximal HR (HR<sub>max</sub>) was recorded for a median (IQR) time of 22 (8) out of 60&#x02005;min per session. Median (IQR) HR during the sessions was 146 (9; 74% of HR<sub>max</sub>) bpm. Children reported increased health-related quality of life (HRQoL) post-test compared with baseline. Children enjoyed participating and reported no limitations by asthma or serious asthma attacks. Instead, they perceived that their asthma and fitness had improved after the programme. The instructors created an inclusive atmosphere that was characterised by easy-to-master games, fair competition, humour and mutual participation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The exercise intervention pilot focusing on active play had a high attendance rate, relatively high exercise intensity, and satisfaction; the children perceived that their fitness and asthma had improved, and reported increased HRQoL. A randomised controlled trial of active play exercise including children with asthma should be conducted to evaluate effect on PA level, physical fitness, asthma control and HRQoL.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>REHABILITATION MEDICINE</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>To our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind with a mixed-methods design combining attendance rate and exercise intensity with a qualitative in-depth exploration of children&#x02019;s perceptions and interactions.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The active play exercise sessions are described comprehensively, and relations with measurements and children&#x02019;s perceptions are outlined and discussed.</p></list-item><list-item><p>In-depth information about crucial elements of designing a randomised controlled trial of active play exercise in children with asthma is offered.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The study has a limited number of participants, and we may not generalise about the effectiveness of the intervention.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Participating children with asthma may not be representative of other children participating in future interventions.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Children with asthma, particularly those who are newly diagnosed and/or have poor disease control, may be less physically active than healthy children.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Physical activity (PA) is recommended for children with asthma,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>

The domains of activity limitation (range 4.2&#x02013;7.0), symptoms (range 4.7&#x02013;6.9) and emotion function (range 5.4&#x02013;7.0) also showed a small-to-moderate degree of impairment because of asthma, which ranged from &#x02018;quite bothered&#x02019; to &#x02018;not bothered at all&#x02019;. Participating girls reported the two lowest values in all three domains. One child was classified as overweight. The children reported asthma symptoms in relation to infections, cold air, pollen and exhaustion, and two children reported that asthma restricted their PA level. VO<sub>2max</sub> ranged from 24.7 to 56.7&#x02005;mL/kg/min. Four of six children (all boys) participated in MVPA above the recommended 60&#x02005;min/day (range 64&#x02013;125). The two girls participated in MVPA for 46 and 56&#x02005;min/day, respectively.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2015009721TB2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Baseline characteristics of participants (n=6)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char=" " span="1"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Boys*, n</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (year), median (min, max)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.5 (10, 12)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">FEV<sub>1</sub> (% of predicted) &#x02020;, median (min, max)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">78 (74, 87)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PAQLQ&#x02021;, median (min, max)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.3 (5.0, 6.9)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Activity scale, median (min, max)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.1 (4.2, 7.0)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Symptoms scale, median (min, max)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.8 (4.7, 6.9)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Emotion scale, median (min, max)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.8 (5.4, 7.0)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ACQ&#x000a7;, median (min, max)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.7 (0.4, 1.0)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Use of ICS, n</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Daily, regular use of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists, n</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Overweight, n</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">MVPA (min/day), median (min, max)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">68.6 (46.2, 125.2)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">VO<sub>2max</sub> (ml/kg/min), median (min, max)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">48.7 (24.7, 56.7)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>*With reference to girls.

Instructors paid little or no attention to negative statements or lack of contribution.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The children enjoyed participating without reporting limitations by asthma or serious asthma attacks, and they perceived that their asthma and fitness had improved. Attendance at exercise sessions was 90% and there were no drop-out. Exercise intensity was relatively high with a median time of 22&#x02005;min at &#x02265;80% of HR<sub>max</sub> and a median HR during the entire sessions of 74% of HR<sub>max</sub>. Highest intensity was recorded during endurance-based and interval-based activities. Children reported increased HRQoL post-test compared with baseline. Children appreciated being acknowledged as competent, and the intervention was placed within a context in which having asthma was considered normal. The instructors ensured that the activities were of high intensity and provided satisfaction while including games that were easy to master; they ensured fair competition and used humour, and also participated in the games.</p><p>Previously published exercise interventions for children with asthma have described various exercise modes, of which swimming,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>

<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> were used most frequently. None of these studies reported whether the children enjoyed taking part in these interventions or which interactions the children found most enjoyable. The mixed-methods design of the present study, however, enabled such reports.</p><p>We may assume that reported satisfaction and enjoyment motivated participants to exercise at a high intensity and contributed to the high attendance rate and zero drop-out during the intervention period. To our knowledge, only one study has reported on children's perspectives on exercise interventions; that study reported the children's perception of an increased ability to handle their asthma during exercise.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Unfortunately, the types of exercise and adherence were not reported.</p><p>The rates of attendance and drop-out during an intervention may give an indication of the children's motivation to take part and their preference for the modes of exercise. In interventions for children with asthma, drop-out rates of 22% in a 6-week individualised training on cycle ergometer<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and 13% in a 4-month running programme<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> have been reported. Far lower drop-out rates were reported in a 3-month programme of regular group exercises with different activities in a gymnasium and home exercise (4%)<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and in an 8-week basketball training intervention (3%).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The latter two studies were group based, which we assume included mutual support between participants. Peer support has been shown to be associated with level of vigorous PA regardless of asthma.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> However, the reasons for dropping out were not described in any of the studies.</p><p>In the present study, we found a high attendance rate (90%) throughout the intervention. Graff-Lonnevig <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> reported a similar attendance rate in their controlled active play intervention. Their training group comprised children living close to the training location, which might have influenced attendance. In our study, the small study sample may have contributed to a stronger sense of commitment to attend the sessions than if the intervention had included a larger study sample. By contrast, Fitch <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> found an attendance rate of 68% in their intervention of running exercise for a relatively small study sample of 10 children. However, children with asthma may perceive running exercise as having different interactions and enjoyment compared with indoor play-based exercise, as used by Graff-Lonnevig <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and the present study.</p><p>According to a recent systematic review of exercise training for children with asthma, intensity rather than the mode of endurance-based activity is one of the most important factors for improving physical fitness after an exercise intervention.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The reports from the children in the present study indicate that active play and enjoyment may be essential to increasing the effort and thereby intensity. In children without asthma, exercise at the anaerobic threshold or at an intensity &#x0003e;80% of HR<sub>max</sub> induces greater improvements in physical fitness compared with lower intensity exercise.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></p><p>In the present study, the children exercised at a HR &#x02265;80% of HR<sub>max</sub> for a median time of 22&#x02005;min. The overall intensity level during each session might have been lower because of the less active periods needed to organise the games and activities, including fitting and adjusting the HR monitors. Physical fitness improved in three of the children, and the baseline fitness levels in the three who did not improve were relatively high. The limited number of participants precludes us from drawing statistical conclusions. Nevertheless, qualitative data from the present study support an interpretation of increased perceived ability to manage intensive PA, either by enhanced perceived competence or increased perception of fitness.</p><p>The importance of feeling normal and competent for children with asthma and of children's adjustment to social norms is well documented.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Our study shows that instructors can create enjoyable, intense exercise programmes with high participation rates by focusing on the children's normality and independence, and by creating and defining the social norms within the group. One may suggest that these aspects of the instructor role and the exercise intervention are as important as the practical organisation including scheduling and leading and designing exercises. These findings are supported by studies suggesting that motivation and engagement in exercise are dependent on leadership; the supporting structure; and the basic psychological need for autonomy, relatedness and competence.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Our intervention design of active play-based exercise seemed to enhance enjoyment and mastery, and worked together with the instructors&#x02019; deliberate creation of fair competition and emphasis on mastery, enjoyment, fellowship and treating the participants as competent. The findings of the limitations induced by asthma away from the intervention scene and the participants&#x02019; desire to be normal despite having asthma may reflect the interaction and experiences within the intervention. The instructors&#x02019; deliberate emphasis on treating the participants as normal competent children may thus have appeared to these children with asthma as encouraging them to exercise and enjoy the programme despite the obvious presence of asthma.</p><p>Physical limitations may arise from physiological barriers caused by disease<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> or by poor psychological adjustment to the disease.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The present qualitative findings support the idea that physical limitations in addition depend on the situation and may change with the social context. Children and adolescents with asthma may experience frustration, embarrassment and low self-confidence because of their disease-related limitations.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> They may also withdraw from PA because of their parents&#x02019; fear and protectiveness.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Participants in the present study seemed to overcome those barriers and limitations, and the parents also supported their children's independence by being absent during intervention sessions. The participant's reports of perceived improvements in fitness, well-being and asthma symptoms highlight the benefits of creating different social situations and norms for interventions with children with asthma. Moreover, the girls&#x02019; increase in HRQoL and VO<sub>2max</sub>, particularly, support the possibility for change through intervention in girls who, with increased age, are reported to engage in less PA initiated and organised by themselves,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> and have a decreased HRQoL compared with boys.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></p><p>The present intervention may be perceived as resource demanding. However; PA is associated with several positive outcomes in asthma,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and may possibly save indirect costs raised by morbidity and mortality and direct healthcare expenditures which range between 1% and 2% of total healthcare costs in developed countries.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></p><sec id="s4a"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The main strengths of the present study are the mixed-methods design including the exploration of children&#x02019;s perceptions and the objective measurements of each child's intensity level during sessions using HR monitors. No children dropped out during the intervention, and the attendance rate of 90% indicated strong adherence to the programme. We aimed to explore specific themes in depth and were able to return to these themes repeatedly during the study by triangulating those data with the physical records. In qualitative research, the researcher as interviewer, observer and analyser relates and interacts with the research field and the participants.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Qualitative empirical work is considered as interpretative and thus may not always be generalisable, but the information may be transferable through the interpretations of the reader.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> We made an effort to enhance reflexivity during the analysis and interpretation of whether the findings relate to the data, and we have ensured that no extraordinary or unusual reports from participants were used to over-rule the issues noted repeatedly by participants.</p><p>The main limitation was the small study sample, which comprised only six children. A small exercise group made it more challenging to design feasible active play exercises of high intensity, especially when one or more children were absent during sessions. Three instructors were present at each session (2 participating actively), which might have influenced the children's participation level to a greater extent than if there had been larger groups. In addition, children in the present study reported that they enjoyed PA and had well-controlled asthma, a relatively high PA level, and physical fitness similar to that of children without asthma.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> These children's views of the intervention and the active play exercises may not be representative of children with less experience with PA or with more severe asthma. However, the findings may be relevant to health practice by providing an understanding of how physical limitations and activity may be changeable and how exercise interventions may be designed to maximise enjoyment and exercise intensity for children with asthma.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The exercise intervention pilot focusing on active play had a high attendance rate, relatively high exercise intensity, and satisfaction; the children perceived that their fitness and asthma had improved, and reported increased HRQoL. A randomised controlled trial of active play exercise including children with asthma should be conducted to evaluate effect on PA level, physical fitness, asthma control and HRQoL.</p><p>Additional implications for clinical practice may be to more consciously create social situations in which children and adolescents with asthma are treated by the health or exercise instructors as competent and normal young people who are motivated to exercise because of the enjoyment and sense of mastery and fellowship.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Authors would like to acknowledge sports students Betina Hissingby, H&#x000e5;vard Berg Vaule, Andreas Mathingsdal Pedersen and Christer Solberg for contribution and engagement within the intervention.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All authors contributed in the design of the study, and in writing, critically revising and finally approving the manuscript.
