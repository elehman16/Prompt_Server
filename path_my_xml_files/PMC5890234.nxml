electrotherapies on the gait parameters for stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty
patients with stroke were randomly assigned either to the functional electrical
stimulation group or the transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation group, with 15
patients in each group. Each electrotherapy was performed for 30 minutes simultaneously
with the therapeutic exercise, and the changes in the spatial and temporal parameters of
gait were measured. [Results] After the intervention, a significant, immediate improvement
in cadence and speed was observed only in the functional electrical stimulation group.
[Conclusion] Based on this study, functional electrical stimulation that stimulates motor
nerves of the dorsiflexor muscles on the paretic side is recommended to achieve immediate
improvement in the gait ability of stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Functional electrical stimulation</kwd><kwd>Gait</kwd><kwd>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Common pathological gait patterns appear in patients after stroke<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such gait patterns
are characterized by increased double support duration on the paretic side and reduced swing
phase duration, cadence, speed, and stride length<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, the asymmetric gait patterns in these patients
result from the weakness of dorsiflexors and the spasticity of plantarflexors<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, it is necessary priorly to
figure out whether an increase of the dorsiflexors strength or a decrease of the spasticity
of plantarflexors is required for immediate improvement of the gait ability for stroke
patients.</p><p>Among therapeutic modalities, electrical stimulation is an effective intervention method
for stimulating motor and sensory nerves<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Functional electrical stimulation (FES) stimulates motor nerves in patients with upper motor
neuron lesions<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, leading to an increase of
the dorsiflexor strength on the paretic side<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, a decrease of gastrocnemius (GCM) muscle tone and stiffness<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, and improvement of gait ability<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. On the other hand, transcutaneous
electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) stimulates sensory nerves, causing pain relief<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, and it increases the presynaptic
inhibition, reducing the muscle tone, stiffness, and spasticity<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, there have been few studies on the immediate comparison of spatiotemporal gait
parameters between different kinds of electrical stimulation on the paretic side in stroke
patients. This study aimed to propose an effective electrotherapy, applied simultaneously
with an exercise therapy, to improve gait of stroke patients by comparing the immediate
effects of FES and TENS on their gait ability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study included patients hospitalized in Gyeonggi-do, South Korea, who had been
diagnosed with stroke for more than 6 months. The included criteria for the study subjects
were as follows: 1) those with the modified Ashworth scale of 2 or below, 2) those with the
Brunnstrom stage 3 or above, 3) those who were able to perform dorsiflexion and
platarflexion in a lying position. Participation was excluded for those whose cognitive
function was reduced and who scored 24 or lower on the Korean version of the mini-mental
state examination. The informed consent form was obtained from the subjects after the
investigator explained the study&#x02019;s purpose and intent. This study was conducted in
accordance with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration.</p><p>The subjects were divided randomly into the FES group (mean &#x000b1; SD: age, 64.2 &#x000b1; 9.7&#x02005;years;
height, 168.0 &#x000b1; 6.8&#x02005;cm; body weight, 69.8 &#x000b1; 2.9&#x02005;kg; time since stroke, 13.6 &#x000b1; 3.7 months)
and the TENS group (mean &#x000b1; SD: age, 63.5 &#x000b1; 8.6&#x02005;years; height, 169.1 &#x000b1; 9.4&#x02005;cm; body weight,
71.0 &#x000b1; 9.4&#x02005;kg; time since stroke, 13.8 &#x000b1; 3.2 months), with 15 patients per group.</p><p>The spatiotemporal gait parameters of the stroke patients were measured using an
accelerator (G-waker, BTS Inc., Italy). This instrument has a high correlation with the
motion analysis system<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
investigator inserted a G-sensor in the pocket of the belt and fixed it on the lumbar 4&#x02013;5 of
the subject. After the stabilization phase in a static standing posture was completed, the
investigator instructed the subject to walk 8 meters straight forward in the usual walking
method. Among the collected data, the data of cadence, speed, stride length, swing phase
duration, stance phase duration, and double support duration on the paretic side were used
in this study.</p><p>During this study, the interventions were conducted on days without an exercise schedule to
rule out the variables that could affect the evaluation. All subjects were treated with the
respective electrotherapy along with the therapeutic exercise for 30 minutes, and all
interventions were performed by 1 physical therapist. The exercise method consisted of
arm-stretching to different directions in a standing position, sit-to-stand, stepping
forward and backward onto blocks, and forward step-up onto blocks.</p><p>For the FES group, FES (Microstim, Model GmbH, Germany) was used to stimulate motor nerves.
The electrodes were attached to the TA motor point and below the fibular head in the paretic
limb to induce dorsiflexion and eversion of foot, respectively. The flow of current was
arranged in such a way that the current was to be carried through the heel switch when the
paralyzed foot was heel-off from the ground during the therapeutic exercise. The frequency
of 35&#x02005;Hz, the pulse of 280 &#x003bc;s, and the intensity of the tolerance level of each subject were
applied<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the TENS group, TENS
(Novastim CU-FS1, CU Medical Systems, Korea) was used to stimulate sensory nerves. An
electrode for stimulating the sural nerve of the paretic limb was attached to the lateral
malleolus level on the paretic side, and the other electrode was attached 10&#x02005;cm above the
lateral malleolus. In the program mode of electrotherapy, TENS was set to adjust the ranges
of the frequency within 0&#x02013;100&#x02005;Hz and the pulse within 20&#x02013;700 &#x003bc;s. The intensity was adjusted
to prevent visible muscle contractions in each subject<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Windows version of SPSS 20.0 was used for data analysis. For general characteristics of
the subjects, the homogeneity of variance was verified by independent t-test, and the test
of normality was verified by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The paired t-test was used to
determine the difference in the intervention effects within groups, and the independent
t-test was used to compare changes after intervention between groups. All statistical
significance levels in this study were set at &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There was no significant difference in stride length, swing phase duration, stance phase

weakness of dorsiflexors and the spasticity of plantarflexors<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The application of FES to the TA muscles on the paretic side has
been shown to enhance the dorsiflexor strength<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> and decrease the medial GCM muscle tone and stiffness<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Electrical stimulation (TA, soleus muscles) and hip joint passive movements immediately
improved the gait speed of stroke patients<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, the cadence and speed of gait were significantly
improved only in the FES group. It seems that the intervention method, where both FES and
the therapeutic exercise were applied together in the TA muscles on the paretic side,
enhanced the gait speed immediately through the decrease of the GCM muscle tone stiffness
and spasticity on the paretic side and the increase of the motor unit recruitment of TA
muscles. The group receiving both electrical stimulation and a conventional physiotherapy
showed a significant improvement in the timed up-and-go test compared to the group receiving
TENS and a conventional physiotherapy<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Results of previous studies supports the results of this study.</p><p>In contrast, the TENS group of this study showed no significant difference in all gait
parameters. It seems that the one-time application of TENS to the paretic limb of stroke
patients has only a limited positive immediate impact on gait parameters.</p><p>This result suggests that the immediate intervention for a short period did not affect the
gait parameters enough to generate differences between the two groups.</p><p>Although various gait parameters were examined in this study, this study has limitations in
that it failed in evaluating the psychological effects on the subjects and the lower limb
spasticity and dorsiflexor strength of the subjects. But, this study suggested that the
simultaneous application of FES and a therapeutic exercise to the TA muscles on the paretic
side improved the gait ability of the stroke patients immediately, which may be helpful for
physical therapists to set short-term treatment goals for stroke patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Titianova</surname><given-names>EB</given-names></name><name><surname>Pitk&#x000e4;nen</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>P&#x000e4;&#x000e4;kk&#x000f6;nen</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Gait characteristics and functional ambulation profile in
