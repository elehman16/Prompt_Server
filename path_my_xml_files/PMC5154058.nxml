The inability to manage anger can reduce quality of life. For example, aggression is a strong predictor of out-of-area placements and is a risk variable for abuse. Recent research suggests that mindfulness-based therapies (specifically, Singh&#x02019;s Soles of the Feet meditation) can help people with intellectual disabilities manage angry emotions, with resultant reductions in challenging behaviour. However, previous research has been single-case design studies, and no group studies have been published with people with intellectual disabilities and aggressive behaviour.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>For this feasibility study, a UK protocol will be developed for use by health professionals within National Health Service (NHS) Intellectual Disability (ID) teams, based upon Singh&#x02019;s Soles of the Feet manual. Twenty adults with intellectual disabilities and identified problems with anger control will be recruited and six sessions will be delivered by a trained ID clinician. The study will monitor participant&#x02019;s aggressive behaviour, health-related quality of life, anxiety, depression, and use of support services (medication, hospital appointments etc.). These will be measured at three time points: (1) Baseline (within 2&#x000a0;weeks prior to the first session of the intervention), (2) 2&#x000a0;months post-baseline, and (3) 6&#x000a0;months post-baseline. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with participants, their carers, and the therapists who delivered the intervention. In order to help design an economic evaluation alongside a future full trial, we will cost the intervention and test the acceptability and validity of health economics measures to record resource use and health-related quality of life outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The data from this study will inform the feasibility of the project protocol and intervention, which will help develop future research and to determine whether a larger, randomised controlled trial with concurrent economic evaluation is feasible.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>UKCERN: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ukctg.nihr.ac.uk/trials/trial-details/trial-details?trialId=">16743</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Intellectual disability</kwd><kwd>Mindfulness-based</kwd><kwd>Aggressive behaviour</kwd><kwd>Feasibility study</kwd><kwd>UMAA-LD</kwd><kwd>Costs</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009250</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Social Care and Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RFPPB-2012-1007</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>In the UK, 2&#x000a0;% of adults and 3.5&#x000a0;% of children have an intellectual disability (ID) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]&#x02014;defined as an IQ below 70, alongside adaptive behaviour deficits, and onset within childhood. Approximately 10&#x02013;20&#x000a0;% of people with ID engage in challenging behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and challenging behaviours are likely to persist over extended periods of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Severe challenging behaviour has a range of negative impacts, such as a lower quality of life, a negative impact on carer well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], reduced access to community services, and admission to intensive and specialist, and therefore costly, residential, or forensic services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>When interviewed, some adults with ID report that they find their own anger and challenging behaviour difficult to cope with and aversive and described feeling regretful after engaging in challenging behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Qualitative studies and a recent meta-synthesis have found that adults with ID are keen to learn how to self-manage anger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Leading researchers on anger have called for creative and more effective interventions than the most common treatment methods such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT holds particular challenges for people with ID, as it requires high levels of language skills, and the ability to be introspective and self-aware, and yet does not explicitly address the development of such awareness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>There is an ongoing debate in the field about how best to define the complex construct of mindfulness (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]). An oft-cited definition of mindfulness is &#x02018;paying attention in a particular way, on purpose, in the present moment and non-judgementally ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. p.4)&#x02019;. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) was originally developed in the late 1970s, and MBSR courses today closely follow the original format. MBSR courses are taught in groups, for around 2.5&#x000a0;h a week for 8&#x000a0;weeks, with a full day of silent meditation practice around the sixth week. Participants are given home practices of around 45&#x000a0;min to an hour each day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Mindfulness has the potential to address a number of psychological processes and states that are relevant to the risk of anger and resultant challenging behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>These include reduced emotional reactivity to a trigger by observing anger-related sensations in the body without attempting to avoid or act on them. Evidence suggests that mindfulness is particularly relevant to the reduction of negative emotional episodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] because rumination increases the emotion of anger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Conversely, a non-judgemental view of one&#x02019;s thoughts may help reduce the negative impact of ruminative patterns. The ability to self-monitor one&#x02019;s own mood states is regarded as being central to anger regulation. To adjust an individual&#x02019;s anger response, there needs to be an awareness that anger is present. Aggressive outbursts may become autotomized anger responses, with little awareness of conscious attention (for people both with and without ID). Mindfulness training enables awareness of the bodily, cognitive, and behavioural signs of anger and opens the possibility of autotomizing non-aggressive responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK. Specifically, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is recommended for recurrent depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and Dialectical Behaviour Therapy for Borderline Personality Disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Typical MBIs rely on complex language to reflect on the experience of meditation, which may be cognitively demanding for individuals with ID. Therefore, it is important to consider how to adjust approaches for this population. In the USA, Soles of the Feet (SoF) meditation has been developed as a way of making MBIs accessible for people with ID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. It has been successfully used in ID populations to self-manage anger and, at long-term follow-up, has resulted in reported reductions or total elimination of aggressive behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. It has also been used to help reduce deviant sexual arousal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and health behaviours contributing to obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>A recent systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] found the most frequent objective of MBIs for individuals with ID was the reduction of aggressive behaviour (explored in 7/12 studies), and of these, all reported a reduction in aggressive behaviour. Although there were 12 studies in the Hwang and Kearney review, this represents just 22 participants as they were all single-case design studies.</p><p>The Singh SoF manual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] was originally designed to help individuals with ID cope with anger and reduce aggressive behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Individuals are taught to recognise situations that are &#x02018;triggers&#x02019; for their anger, then guided through the steps of the SoF meditation. These include breathing naturally without trying to respond to angry thoughts or emotions and then shifting attention to, and being mindful of, the soles of their feet (a neutral part of the body). This technique is tailored to the cognitive level of the individual and enables the regulation of emotional states and behaviours. Thus, it is a good match with current philosophical and policy perspectives on empowering the lives of people with ID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>Hwang and Kearney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] noted that teaching SoF to people with ID (in the studies, they reviewed) was labour-intensive, which creates a problem with intervention accessibility for patients and providers alike. The authors called for group evaluation: &#x0201c;Diversifying intervention methods and research methodology is the key&#x0201d; (p. 325). The proposed study addresses both the issue of labour intensity and of group evaluation. First, we aim to develop an adapted SoF package: Using Mindfulness for Anger and Aggressive Behaviour with people with Learning Disabilities&#x02014;Soles of the Feet (henceforth referred to as UMAA-LD SoF), that is delivered over six sessions by health professionals working in the UK National Health Service (NHS). This serves to create an intervention that is comparable or shorter in timescale to other developed clinical interventions for anger and aggressive behaviour in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Second, we are utilising a group design and so taking a step up the &#x02018;evidence hierarchy&#x02019; from the single-case designs used thus far with SoF with people with ID and aggressive behaviour. Third, it is important that researchers are able to measure levels of mindfulness within a population where intervention studies are being conducted. Existing measures of mindfulness such as the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] are likely to be too cognitively demanding for people with ID. Therefore, development and validation of a measure of mindfulness for this population will be undertaken as part of the UMAA-LD study.</p><p>Few studies evaluating MBIs consider the costs along with the possible clinical benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In the original SoF evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], a benefit-cost analysis indicated significant cost savings following SoF delivery due to a reduction in staff absenteeism at work. The SoF intervention costs were not included in the analysis as they were absorbed into routine behaviour training costs. These savings may not be representative of the costs of delivery within a UK health care setting. In order to evaluate whether SoF is a cost-effective intervention, a full economic evaluation alongside a randomised controlled trial is necessary. We chose to conduct a feasibility study because we wanted to explore the practicality of the proposed intervention and methodology. Therefore, this feasibility study will contribute to the growing evidence base of using SoF for people with ID and anger and aggressive behaviour.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims</title><p>The principal aims of this feasibility study are<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To test the UMAA-LD SoF protocol and research process including delivery across a NHS site, referral pathways, number of eligible participants and carers, treatment fidelity, willingness of clinicians to recruit, questionnaire completion rates, the time taken to complete outcome and process measures, and acceptability and accessibility of the UMAA-LD SoF protocol</p></list-item><list-item><p>To develop and carry out a preliminary test of the reliability and validity of a Mindful Awareness for adults with an Intellectual Disability Scale (MAIDS)</p></list-item><list-item><p>To cost the UMAA-LD SoF intervention and evaluate the acceptability and validity of the health economic outcomes for a subsequent full economic evaluation</p></list-item><list-item><p>To develop and test the feasibility of a protocol for a full-scale effectiveness randomised control trial (RCT) with concurrent economic evaluation of the UMAA-LD SoF intervention</p></list-item></list>

Although language ability is not an inclusion criterion, if participants are able to give informed consent, then they are also likely to have the language level needed to participate in an UMAA-LD SoF intervention.</p><p>Exclusion criteria are (1) existing diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (because of potential difficulties with more abstract concepts relating to mindfulness when ID and autism are co-morbid), (2) presence of mental health problems or behaviour that may prevent the participant from interacting with the carer or therapist or retaining information from the therapy (e.g., dementia, active psychosis), and (3) individuals who are currently receiving direct psychological intervention (e.g. relaxation training, DBT, CBT).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Recruitment</title><p>The research team will meet with clinicians working in NHS ID teams prior to commencement and explain the study. If clinicians are willing to be involved in recruitment, they will be given a supply of study information packs, comprising a letter of invitation, a participant information sheet, a carer information sheet, a reply slip, and a Freepost return envelope addressed to the researcher. Clinicians will be required to explain to the person with ID that a follow-up telephone call can be made by the researcher should they agree to this.</p><p>If the person with ID agrees to a follow up telephone call, clinicians will contact the potential participant once by telephone to check if they have retained the study information pack. If the pack has been mislaid, the clinician will offer to send a second pack. Adults with ID are often supported by several different carers, working across several settings (e.g. a person&#x02019;s home environment, day centre). This situation means there is a high likelihood of study packs going missing.</p><p>On receipt of reply slips with the name and contact details of the potential participant agreeing to contact by the researcher, the researcher will arrange an initial screening visit so that they can explain verbally to the person with ID and their carer what the study involves and so that informed consent can be sought.

There are three main SoF meditations, all follow the same broad therapist instructions but with a different emphasis on the evoked emotion.

In published research, the training times for SoF were usually in two stages, the first, an intensive training period with a therapist, usually between 5&#x000a0;days and a week, followed by a longer period of self-practice (between 12&#x000a0;weeks and 2&#x000a0;years), often with an audio recording [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>

The UMAA-LD SoF training was for a full day, co-delivered by clinicians (RJ and JW), and a mindfulness-based teacher (GG). During the training day, the manual was explained on a session-by-session basis and core SoF practices were demonstrated and explained, and therapists practiced delivering the SoF meditations in the training session. Therapists were encouraged to attend an MBSR class if they had not already done so and to sustain their personal mindfulness practice after the training and during delivery of SoF sessions. This is due to the importance of mindfulness being communicated through the therapists embodied practice during sessions. Therapists will receive two supervision sessions over the six sessions for each participant. At least one supervision session will be with a mindfulness-based teacher (GG) to discuss issues pertaining to the mindfulness elements of the intervention. The other supervision session will be provided by a senior ID clinician (RJ or JW) or by a clinician and researcher (JR).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Mindfulness scale for people with ID</title><p>To address aim 2, the following methodology will be adhered to.</p><p>The MAIDS will be a self-report measure to elucidate mindfulness processes in relation to problem areas, such as anger. Development of items will be informed by three sources: (1) examination of existing mindfulness measures (no current measure exists for use with people with ID), (2) research on the development of self-report measures for people with ID, and (3) consultation with mindfulness and ID professionals. To date, a working version of MAIDS (consisting of ten items) has been developed. The MAIDS will be incorporated in the UMAA-LD SoF protocol to test its feasibility as an evaluation tool.</p><p>The MAIDS will be tested on the 20 participants in the intervention study, at all three time points. In addition, to help determine reliability and validity of the scale, 80 further participants with ID will be recruited to complete the MAIDS, the Modified Overt Aggression scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], Novoco Anger Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], Glasgow Anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and Glasgow Depression Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] at a single time point.

Feasibility metrics (e.g. recruitment and retention rates, clinical characteristics, duration of the intervention, etc.) will be analysed first, together with adherence outcomes (patient acceptance and adherence to the intervention). The mean change from baseline together with associated variances will be calculated for all measures and will be presented as point estimates together with 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals.

Leading ID researchers have called for creative and more effective interventions for anger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Research in the field of ID shows the negative impact of challenging behaviour resulting from anger that can lead to a lower quality of life, a negative impact on carer well-being, reduced access to community services and admission to intensive and specialist, and therefore costly, residential, or forensic services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therefore, within specialist ID NHS services and mainstream mental health services, there is a need to further develop clinical practice to support adults with ID with mental health problems, including anger and aggressive behaviour. There has been some work to adapt and evaluate CBT methods for anger (although few examples of high-quality research), but little focus on adapting other psychological therapies from mainstream services.</p><p>This feasibility study will examine an evidence-based intervention for anger in adults with ID and is anticipated to benefit participants directly by offering a valuable treatment approach where limited approaches exist currently. An intervention informed by mindfulness may also have other benefits with an ID population because it encourages the individual to develop an attitude of shared responsibility for their own mental health with consistent practice of self-management skills. Thus, the proposed UMAA-LD SoF intervention is potentially useful both as an early intervention measure for reduction in aggressive behaviour and also as a strategy for long-term management of anger and aggressive behaviour. Mindfulness training is also non-intrusive, an alternative to medication and promotes resilience and well-being. By developing familiarity with mindfulness and basic meditation techniques, adults with ID may also be better placed to access mainstream mindfulness classes. Adults with ID may (perhaps with the support of their carer) be empowered to manage other emotional problems (e.g. anxiety) using their new transferable mindfulness skills. Finally, reducing anger and associated challenging behaviour may contribute towards participants&#x02019; ability to engage with paid employment, improving their economic situation and providing meaningful activity.</p><p>In health economics evaluations, the NHS traditionally prefers a cost-utility approach to economic analysis, whilst in Public Health cost-benefit and cost-consequence analysis are considered to be more appropriate by NICE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. The UMAA-LD SoF intervention may result in benefits and possible cost savings that goes beyond the health service; therefore, a public sector multi-agency approach to economic analysis is likely to capture this wider potential impact of the intervention.</p><p>There will likely be variability in therapists&#x02019; previous experience of practicing or teaching mindfulness-based approaches. The UK Good Practice Guidelines for teachers of mindfulness-based programmes such as MBSR and MBCT stipulate that those delivering MBIs have personal experience of mindfulness practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. However, due to practicalities of recruiting ID health professionals to deliver UMAA-LD SoF, we will aim for this but anticipate this will not always be possible. Those who do not have personal experience of mindfulness practice in advance will be offered support and encouragement to develop this. Although this intervention is mindfulness informed, it is not mindfulness-based, because it does not comply with UK good practice guidelines (although these were developed for teachers of the 8-week courses for the general public or clinical populations and are not intended to be specific for ID populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]). This aspect of the project will be closely monitored as part of the feasibility study, through the qualitative interviews with the therapists, as the personal practice of the teacher and how this is embodied could be important with an ID populations as it bypasses cognitive verbal channels.</p><p>We anticipate that the qualitative information will enhance the quantitative analysis and RCT protocol. Although preliminary data on the effectiveness of the intervention will be taken, it will not give insight into the mechanisms of change. This question will be explored in the qualitative data, with participants, their carers, and with clinicians. The qualitative data will also help identify any practical barriers or facilitators to participating in the intervention and any unanticipated positive or negative affects of the intervention.</p><p>Successful anger management intervention trials using RCT have been utilised for people with ID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] allaying concerns expressed by some researchers about whether it is feasible to undertake RCT&#x02019;s with people with ID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. This feasibility study will examine whether UMAA-LD SoF may be suitable for investigation as a large-scale RCT. First, all data collected will be used to make any final revisions to the UMAA-LD SoF protocol, if necessary. Secondly, if the feasibility study is promising, an intervention package and protocol for an RCT with concurrent economic evaluation will be developed. The intervention package will include a validated UMAA-LD SoF manual, a new mindfulness measure with initial psychometric data (MAIDS), a complete description of the intervention, clinician training method, method to measure treatment fidelity, and follow-up procedures. The protocol will draw on pilot data for recruitment pathways and inclusion and exclusion criteria. It will provide valuable information into the feasibility of key issues such as recruitment and acceptability of the UMAA-LD SoF protocol with participants, carers, and clinicians.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to acknowledge Helen Davies for her role in revising the final manuscript.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This study has been funded by Health and Care Research Wales (Formally National Institute for Social Care and Health Research).
