Research suggests that physical activity can contribute to the reduction of fatigue and other somatic symptoms and can thus significantly improve physical functioning and quality of life in these patients. Based on the self-regulation (SR) theory of behaviour change, we developed a brief physical activity program for patients suffering from unexplained chronic fatigue which focuses on the training of self-regulation skills, the "4-STEPS to control your fatigue" program.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial (RCT) that will be carried out in local primary care centres and at the Portuguese Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Patients Association. Patients aged between 18 and 65 and fulfilling operationalized criteria for Idiopathic Chronic Fatigue (ICF) and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) will be recruited and randomly allocated to standard care (SC) or standard care plus a self-regulation based physical activity program (4-STEPS). Patients will be assessed at baseline, after the intervention (3 months) and at 12 months follow-up. The primary outcome is fatigue severity.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of the RCT will provide information about the effectiveness of a brief self-regulation intervention for promoting physical activity in patients with unexplained chronic fatigue. If the program proves to be effective, it may be considered as an adjunctive treatment for these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ISRCTN: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anzctr.org.au/ISRCTN70763996.aspx">ISRCTN70763996</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Unexplained Chronic Fatigue</kwd><kwd>Physical activity</kwd><kwd>Self-Regulation</kwd><kwd>Randomized Controlled Trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Fatigue is a common symptom in adults worldwide, being reported by around 20% of patients seeking medical care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. A recent epidemiological review concluded that physical activity can reduce fatigue and improve energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Recent literature emphasizes that fatigue should be considered as a multidimensional concept, incorporating both physical and mental fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Due to its subjective nature, fatigue is difficult to define and measure. It is a personal experience that cannot be objectively measured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>In most cases, fatigue is transient, but for some, fatigue symptoms become chronic, resulting in disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. When fatigue lasts for at least six months, is not alleviated by rest, is debilitating, results in a significant reduction of daily activities and cannot be explained by an organic disease (unexplained chronic fatigue), it is classified as Idiopathic Chronic Fatigue (ICF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. If ICF is accompanied by four or more of the following symptoms - unrefreshing sleep, lengthy malaise after exertion (lasting for over 24 hours), impaired memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscle pain, multi-joint pain without swelling or redness and headaches of a new type or severity - it is diagnosed as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>CFS prevalence has been reported to be in between 0.2% and 2% in general population samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Prevalence rates vary according to several factors such as the criteria used to diagnose CFS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In terms of prognosis, a systematic review conducted by Cairns and Hotpof [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] found that full recovery from untreated CFS is rare. It is more common for patients to experience an improvement in symptom severity. CFS etiology remains unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and it is considered to be associated with a combination of several predisposing (e.g. genes), precipitating (e.g. life events) and perpetuating (e.g. physical inactivity) factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Patients with unexplained chronic fatigue often report complaints related to exercise intolerance and post-exertional malaise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Prins, van der Meer and Bleijenberg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] considered patients' perceptions and expectations related to symptom exacerbation as a consequence of exercise, to be the main cause of the reduced levels of physical activity found in patients with unexplained chronic fatigue, rather than physical fitness limitations per se. Other studies pointed out that lack of physical activity and excessive resting are factors that result in physical deconditioning which, in turn, perpetuates fatigue and physical disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. It has therefore been recommended that ICF/CFS patients engage in physical activity instead of refraining from it to manage their symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>To promote physical activity in ICF/CFS, Graded Exercise Therapy (GET) has been recommended. GET is based on the assumption that in patients with unexplained chronic fatigue, physical activity must be initiated at a level that doesn't exacerbate symptoms and must be gradually increased until patients reach an optimal level of activity. Graded exercise programs follow the exercise prescription guidelines from the American College of Sports Medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], tailored to each patient's level of physical activity. GET is usually delivered by an exercise physiologist or physical therapist, and consists of supervised exercise sessions and/or home-based exercise prescription (e.g. walking). Research has demonstrated that GET has a positive effect on physical activity and leads to decreased levels of fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has also demonstrated to be an effective treatment approach to CF. CBT interventions developed for ICF/CFS patients focus primarily on changing illness cognitions and expectations, as well as increasing control over symptoms. The CBT model makes a distinction between precipitating factors - factors that contribute to the initiation of a health problem - and perpetuating factors - factors that contribute to the maintenance of the health problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Since physical inactivity is considered to be a perpetuating factor of unexplained chronic fatigue, most CBT interventions also focus on physical activity promotion. A recent review conducted by Price and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] concluded that CBT interventions have a positive effect on fatigue, depression and anxiety in ICF/CFS patients.</p><p>In patients with unexplained chronic fatigue a "boom and bust pattern" is frequently found, that is, a systematic alternation between periods of excessive activity (when feeling good), and, as a consequence of that, feeling extremely fatigued and having to rest for longer periods of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Pacing, which is having an appropriate balance between activity and rest, is considered to be an important technique for reducing fatigue symptoms. Pacing implies that patients are encouraged to set realistic goals on a daily basis in terms of activity and rest periods; it is often combined with graded exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>CBT uses several self-regulation (SR) techniques. SR can be defined as a sequence of actions and/or steering processes intended to attain a personal goal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. According to SR theory, individuals set personally important goals that guide their behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In this goal-guidance process, self-regulation cognitions (e.g. self-efficacy expectations and autonomous/controlled motivation), emotions (positive and negative affect) and skills (e.g. self-monitoring and feedback), are considered to play an important role, both in goal setting, active goal pursuit and goal maintenance/attainment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. As a consequence, SR models not only contribute to our understanding of the influence of life goals on medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS) in general, and fatigue in particular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], but interventions based upon these models may also encourage patients to change their personal goals from symptom avoidance to more active and positive goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In their review, Maes &#x00026; Karoly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] distinguished a number of self-regulation strategies associated with behavior change and derived a set of guidelines for interventions. These self-regulation core processes are: realistic outcome expectations; illness representations; goal setting (personal goals, ownership); planning; progress evaluation and feedback; efficacy support; attention and emotion control; control over competing goals; self-monitoring; self-reinforcement; facilitate social support; goal reformulation; relapse prevention; anticipatory coping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>One of the main intervention techniques using self-regulation principles is Motivational Interviewing (MI), developed by Miller &#x00026; Rollnick [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. MI is a directive, client-centered technique for eliciting behavior change, by helping clients to explore and resolve perceived conflicts (ambivalence) with respect to behavior change and analyze the discrepancies between their current behavior and their life goals and values. It aims at increasing autonomous regulation and self-efficacy (i.e. confidence in one's ability to perform a certain behavior) and promotes the transition from planning (motivational phase) to action (goal pursuit). MI has been successful in promoting physical activity in healthy populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], but there is limited research on MI interventions in patients with ICF/CFS and other MUPS. Powell and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] evaluated an intervention based upon MI techniques to encourage graded physical exercise in CFS patients. The intervention led to increased physical functioning and decreased fatigue. In addition, the minimum intervention condition, consisting of only two face-to-face sessions, proved to be as successful as more extended versions of the program. A study conducted with fibromyalgia patients also showed a significant increase in physical exercise frequency, as well as reduced pain and physical impairment after an MI intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Based on the empirical literature we developed a brief self-regulation based physical activity program for patients suffering from unexplained chronic fatigue, the "4-Steps to control your fatigue" (4-STEPS) program. In this intervention program, the combination of graded exercise and pacing is incorporated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The development and evaluation of brief interventions is important because of the time, money and energy consuming efforts associated with longer interventions.</p><p>The main objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of the 4-STEPS program in promoting physical activity and in reducing fatigue.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Design of the study</title><p>This is a two-arm multi-centre randomised controlled trial in patients who meet operationalised criteria for either ICF or CFS.

Fatigue impact is assessed by means of a modified version of the pain interference subscale of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>5. Work or daily activities related fatigue is assessed by means of the Need for Recovery Scale (NFR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>6. Use of health care resources is measured on the basis of two questions: (1) number of visits to the primary care physician and medical specialists, (2) use of medication.</p><p>7. Work related information: currently (not) working, if currently working, number of hours working, working part-time due to fatigue, dropped out of work due to fatigue, number of days absent from work.</p><p>8. The All-or-nothing and Limiting behaviour scales from The Behaviour Responses to Illness Questionnaire (BRIQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] are used to assed behavioural symptom management.</p><p>9.

Physical and emotional functioning is measured with the Short Form Health Survey-12 (SF-12 V.2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>13. Physical activity: two different measures are used to assess physical activity level. The first is the pedometer (YAMAX SW-200), a portable device that counts the number of steps taken, by detecting hip motions. Participants are asked to use the pedometer on a daily basis for seven consecutive days and register their daily number of steps on a form that is provided to the patient. The second measure is the Sports subscale of the SQUASH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]; in this subscale participants indicate the type of physical activity they do (e.g. swimming) including the frequency per week (e.g. 3 days per week) and duration per day (e.g. 50 minutes) for each of these activities. The intensity of each of these activities is calculated based on the Ainsworth's Compendium of Physical activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Predictors</title><p>1. Demographic information (age, gender and education).</p><p>2. Presence of a severe infection prior to the onset of fatigue.</p><p>3. Duration of fatigue at baseline.</p><p>4.

Three subscales of the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire - Short Version (CERQ-short) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] were used to assess adaptive cognitive coping strategies, and a version of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) adapted for fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] was used to measure catastrophic cognitions related to CF symptoms.</p><p>7. Level and range of social support are assessed.</p><p>8. Goal progress and self-regulation skills to achieve a personal goal are measured with the Self-regulation Skills Battery (SRSB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p><p>9.

We also intend to use regression analysis and structural equation modelling to analyse longitudinal relationships between predictors, possible mediators and outcomes (path analysis).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Physical activity seems to be very important for patients suffering from unexplained chronic fatigue, while SR interventions seem to be effective in promoting long-term health behaviour change. The 4-STEPS program will be the first brief SR based physical activity intervention for ICF/CFS patients. We are not aware of any RCT to promote physical activity in these patients conducted in Portugal. This RCT will provide information on the efficacy of the intervention as well as on the predictors of physical activity, fatigue and other somatic symptoms. The fact that it is a brief intervention, that requires minimal personal contact with the health care professional and that patients receive self-help materials to support them can also be seen as an advantage from a cost-effectiveness point of view if the trial has a significant effect. If proven effective, this program can be considered as an adjunctive treatment for ICF/CFS.</p></sec><sec><title>Status of the trial</title><p>The 4-STEPS RCT started in January 2011 and it is ongoing.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CFS: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome; CBT: Cognitive Behavioural Therapy; GET: Graded Exercise Therapy; ICF: Idiopathic Chronic Fatigue; ISRCTN: International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial; MUPS: (Medically Unexplained Physical Symptoms); RCT: Randomised Controlled Trial; SR: Self-regulation; 4-STEPS: "4 Steps to control your fatigue" program.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MM, VDG and SM contributed to the design of the study and the creation of the Support materials.
