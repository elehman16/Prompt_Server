ARD is caused partly by damage to the skin and appendages, and associated symptoms include hair loss, dryness and itching (<xref rid="HYV155C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In normal healthy skin, the epidermis and its outermost stratum corneum layer act as a barrier to water loss, and thereby maintain skin hydration (<xref rid="HYV155C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The epidermis is primarily composed of stratifying layers of keratinocytes which are highly radiosensitive. Radiation skin injury involves immediate damage to basal keratinocytes and hair follicle stem cells, followed by DNA breaks and inflammation (<xref rid="HYV155C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Additionally, eccrine sweat glands are very radiosensitive compared with the epidermis (<xref rid="HYV155C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) and skin water content (WC) is influenced by eccrine sweating in regions rich in sweat glands (<xref rid="HYV155C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). As a result of barrier dysfunction, irradiated skin often feels drier compared with non-irradiated skin. However, it is evident that few systematic studies have been published on this topic.</p><p>To date, a number of studies performed have each failed to show a beneficial effect of skin care products to reduce or prevent ARD (<xref rid="HYV155C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="HYV155C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Although guidelines on the use of skin care during the course of RT remain somewhat inconsistent, moisturizers are currently often used in clinical practice in western countries for patients undergoing RT for breast cancer (<xref rid="HYV155C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In Japan, however, topical agents for Grade 1 dermatitis are not traditionally prescribed by most radiation oncologists unless the patient complains of symptoms such as itching and pain. In 2012, the JASTRO (Japanese Society for Radiation Oncology) Research Group distributed a booklet about skin care during and after breast RT. Without sufficient evidence, it recommended moisturizer use for dryness after RT. An investigation into the effectiveness of moisturizers in the early phase of ARD, when dryness is one of the main symptoms, therefore represents an important and timely clinical issue.</p><p>The heparinoid moisturizer, Hirudoid<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Maruho, Osaka, Japan) contains mucopolysaccharide polysulphate (at 0.3% w/w), which is structurally closely related to components of the connective tissue. It has been widely used in Japan to treat dry skin, and especially for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (<xref rid="HYV155C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>The present study evaluated the effect of this heparinoid moisturizer on skin WC after whole-breast radiotherapy (WBRT) using the corneometer, a simple instrument and a valid tool for assessing skin moisture (<xref rid="HYV155C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). It measures the electrical capacitance of the skin surface as an indicator of stratum corneum hydration, which is dependent on the high dielectrical constant of WC relative to other skin components. The corneometer has been demonstrated to be useful for objectively assessing radiation induced skin reactions for breast cancer patients (<xref rid="HYV155C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Skin-related signs and symptoms were also assessed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>Women aged 30&#x02013;65 years with non-inflammatory breast cancer or carcinomas <italic>in situ</italic> treated by lumpectomy were included. The tumor location was outside the inner-upper quadrant, which was designated as a skin WC measurement site. Exclusion criteria included patients who had: bilateral breast cancer; previous RT to the thorax; wide-spreading skin disease; collagen vascular disease; sensitivity to heparinoid substance; and patients who did not keep to the instructions on how to apply the topical agents on the breast. A compliance rate of 60% was set to the lower limit for acceptance.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Moisturizer treatment</title><p>All patients underwent individualized computed tomography-based treatment planning using the field-in-field technique (<xref rid="HYV155C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and efforts were made to ensure that the breast treatment volume received was not &#x0003c;95% or &#x0003e;107% of the prescribed dose. Standard fractionation (2 Gy per session, five sessions per week) was used. The entire ipsilateral breast was irradiated with two opposing tangential fields with a total dose of 48&#x02013;50 Gy with photons (4&#x02013;6 MV). According to the pathologic report, the primary tumor bed was boosted with a total dose of 10&#x02013;18 Gy with electrons (4&#x02013;16 MeV). After a pre-treatment evaluation, patients were instructed to not apply any moisturizer until 2 weeks following WBRT, and randomly assigned to either no further moisturizer (C) or treatment with the heparinoid moisturizer (M). Randomization was stratified according to the relative ratio of skin WC ratio (RWCR<sub>(p0w)</sub>) on the last day of WBRT (&#x02265;0.7 vs &#x0003c;0.7). Patients in Group M were instructed to apply the heparinoid moisturizer twice daily from 2 weeks following WBRT, and to continue to use the heparinoid moisturizer twice daily for 3 months after completion of WBRT. The treatment period totaled approximately 10 weeks. Group C patients were instructed to not apply any topical moisturizer during the study period (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="HYV155F1">1</xref>). However, all patients with itchy or reddened skin were allowed to use topical corticosteroids.

Sebum from the breast skin surface was measured via sebumeter<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> following a minimum of 20 min bed rest. After the skin was washed with hypoallergenic soap and wiped gently with lint-free cloth and dried well for 20 min, WC was measured using a corneometer CM825<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Courage + Khazaka, Cologne, Germany). The two designated areas for WC measurement were 3 &#x000d7; 3 cm<sup>2</sup> for each skin area analysis in an upper-inner quadrant of the irradiated breast, at least 2 cm apart from the midline. These areas had to be at least 2 cm away from the surgical wound and 1 cm away from the edge of boost (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="HYV155F2">2</xref>). WC was measured a total of five times at different points in each area, and the mean value of 10 measurements was used for analysis. For controls, the corresponding area of skin of the non-irradiated breast was measured in the same manner.

Evidence from a limited number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) does not support the use of topical <italic>Aloe vera</italic> (<xref rid="HYV155C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), trolamine (<xref rid="HYV155C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), calendula cream (<xref rid="HYV155C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), sucralfate cream (<xref rid="HYV155C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), hyaluronic acid (<xref rid="HYV155C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) or silver sulfadiazine (<xref rid="HYV155C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In a pooled analysis, the use of topical corticosteroid was associated with a significantly lower incidence of Grade 3 dermatitis (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01) (<xref rid="HYV155C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). However, the incidence of Grade 3 dermatitis is low in association with breast conserving therapy. The use of steroidal agents is limited because it can cause thinning (<xref rid="HYV155C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) of the skin and introduce bacterial infections (<xref rid="HYV155C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>Regarding the time-course of stratum corneum WC in irradiated field, several reports using the corneometer exist. Recently, Hu et al. (<xref rid="HYV155C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) demonstrated a significant decrease of stratum corneum hydration in 144 breast cancer patients undergoing RT. In this prospective study, the skin hydration dropped from 86 to 64 arb. unit on the last day of RT. Yamazaki et al. (<xref rid="HYV155C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) also analyzed RWCR<sub>(<italic>t</italic>)</sub> in 35 patients and found an immediate decrease to 0.71 at the last day of RT, recovering to 0.82, 0.87 and 0.92 at 1, 3 and 12 months post-WBRT, respectively. In the present study, RWCR<sub>(<italic>t</italic>)</sub> significantly decreased to 0.82 &#x000b1; 0.16 at the last day of WBRT and this low level continued until 3 months following WBRT in Group C (0.88 &#x000b1; 0.14). In an earlier study, Jensen et al. (<xref rid="HYV155C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) reported a similar time-course of skin WC following RT in irradiated field and cream-untreated field.</p><p>In the present study, the efficacy of the heparinoid moisturizer which is widely used for skin dryness of atopic dermatitis in Japan (<xref rid="HYV155C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) was evaluated following RT. Jensen et al. (<xref rid="HYV155C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) also evaluated the efficacy of an oil-in-water emulsion in a randomized study with 66 breast cancer patients. Reduced hydration values in the irradiated fields improved more quickly in the cream-treated group compared with untreated controls. The application of heparinoid moisturizer for 2 weeks significantly increased RWCR<sub>(<italic>t</italic>)</sub>, and MR between 2 and 4 weeks to a significantly greater extent than in the control group. However, there was no significant difference of RWCR<sub>(<italic>t</italic>)</sub> at 3 months after WBRT (Group M: 0.95 &#x000b1; 0.22 vs Group C: 0.88 &#x000b1; 0.14, <italic>P</italic> = 0.11). A marginally lower compliance rate in applying the heparinoid moisturizer at 3 months compared with that at 4 weeks following WBRT (<italic>P</italic> = 0.053) may have contributed to this reduction in difference between groups at 3 months. The slow recovery of RWCR<sub>(<italic>t</italic>)</sub> following WBRT in the irradiated field was noted, consistent with the time-course reported by other investigators (<xref rid="HYV155C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="HYV155C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). This may also have contributed to the small difference between groups at 3 months. In fact, WC appeared to return to pre-RT state after 6 months following WBRT in spite of the small number of patients (data not shown).</p><p>It is well-known that breast cancer patients following WBRT suffer from skin dryness and itching (<xref rid="HYV155C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The severity of signs of ARD, such as dryness and desquamation, which was evaluated by the experienced dermatologist, correlated well with RWCR<sub>(<italic>t</italic>)</sub> values. Those signs were milder in the treatment group. At 4 weeks (i.e. after 2 weeks application) and 3 months following WBRT, dryness and desquamation in the irradiated field were significantly less in Group M compared with controls. One of the reasons why the difference became smaller at 3 months may be due to putative spontaneous recovery of the stratum corneum WC.</p><p>There was no difference between the time-course of erythema score. Jensen et al. also noted no effect of oil-in-water emulsion on the skin score involving erythema and desquamation at 1 week following RT. However, the skin score marginally improved by the emulsion at 47 &#x000b1; 7 days following treatment (<xref rid="HYV155C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Moisturizer is therefore considered to have subtle or little effect on inflammatory changes.</p><p>Although the use of the heparinoid moisturizer also helped alleviate the pain related to ARD, symptoms were already generally mild and the actual influence of heparinoid moisturizer on pain reduction remains to be determined. In our study, the moisturizer did not alleviate itching. In contrast, Jensen et al. (<xref rid="HYV155C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) reported a significant decrease in itching score at an early phase following the immediate application of oil-in-water emulsion after RT. Collectively, these findings suggest that the early application of moisturizer may be warranted. However, in this study, the heparinoid moisturizer was started from 2 weeks following WBRT as it was thought to be more appropriate at that point for measurement of WC using the corneometer compared with at the end of WBRT, when inflammatory change was more likely to have subsided.</p><p>Di Franco et al. measured skin WC using the corneometer and evaluated skin-related symptoms regularly before, during and 1 month after RT for 100 breast cancer patients who had applied moisturizing cream twice a day starting 15 days before and 1 month after RT. The use of moisturizers increased skin WC after the application period, and reduced the incidence of RT-associated skin side effects. All five different moisturizing creams used in the study were reported to be equally valid (<xref rid="HYV155C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In contrast to their study, our exploratory study demonstrated the prophylactic application of a moisturizer adequately supplemented skin WC and sebum after WBRT. However, WC significantly decreased at the last day of WBRT in spite of starting treatment with the heparinoid moisturizer at the beginning of RT (<xref rid="HYV155C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Unfortunately, the reasons for this difference could not be analyzed as details about WC measurement are unknown in the study of Di Franco et al. (<xref rid="HYV155C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The sebum decreased until at least 1 year after WBRT; however, it was observed to be sustained throughout the study period associated with the prophylactic use of heparinoid moisturizer (<xref rid="HYV155C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The long-term application of moisturizer before and after RT may alleviate barrier dysfunction by supplementing WC in the early phase and the sebum.</p><p>The present study had a number of limitations. The major challenge was the level of compliance, and although compliance was high at the baseline, it decreased over subsequent assessments by the diary method. In most cases, it remained within acceptable limits, with just one patient excluded. Furthermore, although the effect of RT on the non-irradiated skin was expected to be negligibly small, the distance of &#x02265;2 cm from the field edge was insufficient. According to Epstein et al. (<xref rid="HYV155C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), the surface dose of contralateral breast 2&#x02013;4 cm from the midline receives 3&#x02013;12% of the prescribed dose. In fact, the sebum level measured by the sebumeter in the opposite breast skin (at least 2 cm away from the midline) was significantly decreased (data not shown). Fortunately, the WC value was minimally affected by low dose RT. A third limitation concerned the potential impact of the heparinoid moisturizer on skin WC measurement. In this regard, it should be noted that patients were carefully instructed with regard to the study procedures, washed the skin with soap, and wiped and dried the skin adequately enough prior to any measurements in order to minimize this potential effect.</p><p>The present study also has several notable strengths, including the use of an established instrument in the analysis of skin WC. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the effectiveness of moisturizer confirmed by RCT. Our study therefore provides some evidence on the efficacy of heparinoid moisturizer following WBRT.</p><p>Furthermore, skin appearance was independently evaluated in RCT by radiation oncologists and an expert dermatologist blinded for the treatment group. Actually, the findings by a dermatologist were almost identical to those of radiation oncologists under direct vision.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study has shown that skin WC significantly decreased to at least 3 months after the completion of WBRT. Treatment with heparinoid moisturizer for 2 weeks following WBRT significantly increased skin WC, and helped to improve skin dryness and desquamation. These observations support the use of heparinoid moisturizer for breast cancer patients undergoing WBRT, although confirmatory evidence is required in order to further understand the potential clinical benefits of this low risk intervention. The findings regarding prophylactic use warrant a next phase of study investigating the protective effect for ARD using heparinoid moisturizer in a randomized setting.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Funding</title><p>This research was supported by a <funding-source>Research Grant of St. Luke's International Hospital</funding-source>.
