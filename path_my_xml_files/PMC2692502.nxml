This predicted a <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> slightly (&#x0003c;15%) higher following the 2 min iv injection of daptomycin compared with the approved 30 min iv infusion regimen, irrespective of modelled differences in renal function. This potential increase in <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> is not expected to change the safety profile of the currently approved doses of daptomycin. The pharmacokinetic, safety and tolerability profiles of daptomycin have been investigated in clinical trials, with single daily daptomycin doses of up to 12 mg/kg, exposing subjects to substantially higher <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> than the levels observed from the 6 mg/kg daptomycin 2 min iv injection. High-dose daptomycin (8, 10 and 12 mg/kg) administered as a 30 min iv infusion,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP155C10">10</xref></sup> resulted in <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> values equivalent to 112%, 137% and 174% of that observed with the 6 mg/kg 2 min iv injection in Study 1, respectively. Furthermore, no significant AEs were observed in subjects receiving these high doses once daily for up to 14 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP155C10">10</xref></sup> Indeed, the present studies suggest that daptomycin administered as a 2 min iv injection has a similar safety profile to that of the 30 min iv infusion, with no new or unexpected safety concerns. The majority of treatment-emergent AEs were mild and not considered to be related to daptomycin treatment, and local tolerability reactions were similar between daptomycin-treated and placebo-treated subjects.</p><p>As a concentration-dependent bactericidal antibiotic, the efficacy of daptomycin is pharmacodynamically best correlated with the AUC/MIC or <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>/MIC ratio.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP155C21">21</xref></sup> Given that AUCs were similar following the different modes of administration, and that <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> was predicted to be slightly higher with the 2 min iv injection, the efficacy of the 2 min daptomycin iv injection is expected to be similar to that of the standard 30 min iv infusion.</p><p>The daptomycin 2 min iv injection has the potential to confer a number of benefits in the management of patients with serious Gram-positive infections. As well as simplifying the dosing schedule for patients receiving multiple medications via catheter, the reduced administration volume gives the physician more scope in managing the patient's fluid balance, which may be a particular concern for patients in intensive care units.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP155C22">22</xref></sup> Additionally, the increased risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections associated with the use of multilumen catheters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP155C23">23</xref></sup> suggests that drugs that can be administered relatively rapidly have the potential to decrease the need for such catheters, thereby reducing the risk of infection.</p><p>Patients with serious Gram-positive infections are increasingly treated in the outpatient setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP155C15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP155C16">16</xref></sup> Treating patients with serious infections, such as MRSA, as outpatients, reduces the risk of spreading infections to other hospital patients. Agents that can be administered by slow iv injection may be advantageous in this context, because they obviate the need for infusion devices,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP155C18">18</xref></sup> which may incur additional costs. Indeed, short injections have been shown to be one of the most cost-effective methods of administering iv drugs in the outpatient setting,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP155C24">24</xref></sup> and are more convenient for patients in that they minimize the degree of disruption to everyday activities.</p><p>These data indicate that daptomycin, administered as a 2 min iv injection once daily over 7 days, has a similar safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile to that of the 30 min iv infusion. The 2 min iv injection may, therefore, offer an alternative method of administration to the currently approved 30 min iv infusion. This could contribute towards more streamlined management of seriously ill patients in hospital and simplify treatment administration for patients and caregivers, thus facilitating the potential use of daptomycin in the outpatient setting. Additional studies in patients are warranted to confirm the promising results observed in healthy volunteers.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Funding</title><p>The studies presented herein were funded by Novartis Pharma AG and were conducted in preparation for submission of the daptomycin 2 min iv injection to regulatory authorities.
