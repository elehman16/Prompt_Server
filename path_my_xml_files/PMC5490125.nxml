After approval of Local Ethical Committee in Anesthesia Department, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo university, informed written consent was obtained from all patients, Sixty patients&#x02019; physical status American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classes I&#x02013;II, aged over 45 years old scheduled for radical prostatectomy under combined epidural-general anesthesia were included in this study. All cases were done in Urology Theater in Kasr Alaini hospital (Cairo university teaching hospital). The exclusion criteria included Physical Status ASA classes III or more, morbid obesity (body mass index &#x0003e;35), preexisting neurological or psychiatric disorders, chronic drug abuse, the use of drugs affecting immunity as chemotherapy or hormonal therapy, uncontrolled diabetics, renal, hepatic, hypertensive patients, contraindication for epidural catheter insertion, and hypersensitivity for any anesthetics or drug used. Patients were randomly divided into three groups according to randomized sequences without duplicates, twenty patients in each group. Group I received combined epidural-general anesthesia without S(+) ketamine (control group), Group II received combined epidural-general anesthesia and S(+) ketamine as a single preincision dose, and Group III received combined epidural-general anesthesia and S(+) ketamine as preincision and repeated doses up to 4 h of surgery. In the preparation room under local anesthesia intravenous cannula was inserted, midazolam 1 mg and ranitidine 50 mg were given to all patients. Then, the patient was transferred to the operating room, standard monitors were applied, and then epidural catheter was inserted under complete aseptic technique to supplement general anesthesia and to control postoperative pain. Then, general anesthesia was induced with propofol (2 mg/kg), fentanyl (1 &#x003bc;g/kg), and atracurium (0.5 mg/kg) to facilitate tracheal intubation. For maintenance of anesthesia, an infusion of atracurium at rate of 8 &#x003bc;g/kg/min and 1%&#x02013;1.5% isoflurane, ventilator parameter was adjusted to keep EtCO<sub>2</sub> between 30 and 35 mmHg, 5 ml of levobupivacaine 0.25% was administrated in the epidural catheter and repeated according to the hemodynamic variables. Blood samples were drawn immediately after induction of anesthesia and before S(+) ketamine injection to determine the baseline of cytokines that were measured (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-&#x003b1;] and IL-6); then, S(+) ketamine (Pfizer, Karlsruhe, Germany) was injected as a single IV dose 0.5 mg/kg before incision in Group II and III and repeated 0.2 mg/kg doses at 20 min intervals till the end of surgery (in Group III only). The blood samples were taken after 1 h and then hourly after S(+) ketamine injection till 4 h. Blood was collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tubes and centrifuged at 3.000 rpm for 15 min. Plasma was stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until the moment of analysis.

S(+) ketamine was chosen as it has better recovery profile with less hallucination or mood changes. This study shows the effect of S(+) ketamine in decreasing the level of cytokines, and that leads to less noxious stimulation. Furthermore, this study revealed that when S(+) ketamine used as a single dose before the incision, it decreased the level of cytokines, but when used as repeated intravenous doses, the cytokine levels decreased more and there was a significant difference between single and repeated doses. Roytblat <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] reported that a single dose of ketamine 0.25 mg/kg administered before cardiopulmonary bypass suppressed the increase in serum IL-6 during and after coronary artery bypass surgery,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and that a subanesthetic dose of ketamine suppressed IL-6 production in women undergoing a hysterectomy. In contrary, Cho <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] found that low-dose ketamine with anesthesia induction will not show any anti-inflammatory effect in the low-risk patient going for off-pump coronary bypass graft surgery. The author of this study used a single shot of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg and measured its effect on IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; after 4 h and once after 1 and 2 days. There was no continuous measurement over the early hours which may explain the differences between his study and this one.</p><p>Wang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] have tried ketamine in another nonconventional route; their study has examined ketamine through both inhalational and intravenous routes in the patient going for esophagectomy with one lung ventilation. The study demonstrated that ketamine has succeeded to lower serum level of IL-6, IL-8, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1. Furthermore, it has resulted in decreasing airway pressure.</p><p>Kawasaki <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] had carried out <italic>in vitro</italic> studies with human whole blood and reported a suppressive effect of ketamine on lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, and IL-8 production. TNF-&#x003b1; is the first cytokine which stimulates IL-6 and IL-8 production by macrophages.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Preincisional and
