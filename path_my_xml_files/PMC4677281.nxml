Although results have shown some promise, little is known about the optimal stimulation parameters for modulation in the cognitive domain. In this study, the effects of tDCS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) on working memory performance were investigated in thirty older adults. An N-back task assessed working memory before, during and after anodal tDCS at a current strength of 1 mA and 2 mA, in addition to sham stimulation. The study used a single-blind, cross-over design. The results revealed no significant effect of tDCS on accuracy or response times during or after stimulation, for any of the current strengths. These results suggest that a single session of tDCS over the dlPFC is unlikely to improve working memory, as assessed by an N-back task, in old age.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>tDCS</kwd><kwd>working memory</kwd><kwd>plasticity</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>N-back</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">European Research Council<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100000781</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">617280</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="32"/><page-count count="6"/><word-count count="4249"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aging is associated with cognitive decline, particularly in domains of working memory, executive function and episodic memory (Schaie, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>). Whilst the negative consequences of poor cognition are well-known (Allaire and Marsiske, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Salthouse, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), there is no universally accepted method for alleviating cognitive decline in old age (Zimerman and Hummel, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Pharmacological approaches for preventing or delaying cognitive decline in old age have been unsatisfactory, urging an exploration of alternative strategies (Shafqat, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p><p>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been put forward as an attractive option for modulating perceptual, cognitive and behavioral functions, in the young and old, as well as in health and in disease (Nitsche et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Zimerman and Hummel, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Brunoni et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The technique is non-invasive in nature and involves the induction of a weak constant current flow through the cerebral cortex via a positive electrode (anode) and a negative electrode (cathode) placed directly on the scalp. In the motor domain, anodal stimulation over the primary motor cortex increases motor evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), indicating a modulatory effect on neuronal excitability in the stimulated area (Nitsche and Paulus, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). If the stimulation is applied for several minutes, these effects have been shown to outlast the stimulation itself by up to 90 min, evidencing a more long-lasting change in brain function (Nitsche and Paulus, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). The mechanisms underlying tDCS are poorly understood but the current understanding dictates that changes occurring during stimulation follows from an acute modulation of the resting transmembrane potential towards depolarization (under the anode) or hyperpolarization (under the cathode), making the neurons more or less likely to fire, respectively. In contrast, the changes observed after the stimulation are thought to be underpinned by long-term potentiation-like and long-term depression-like plastic processes (Nitsche et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Horvath et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2015b</xref>).</p><p>While the effects of tDCS on MEPs are well established (Horvath et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>), effects on cognition have not been as consistent (Berryhill et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In fact, a recent meta-analysis in younger adults failed to detect a reliable effect of a single session of tDCS on any of the included cognitive measures, independently of whether measures were considered separately or as part of broader cognitive domains (Chhatbar and Feng, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Horvath et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>). Although the evidence base is much more limited for older adults, a recent meta-analysis that considered studies using tDCS as well as TMS revealed more promising results, with a moderate effect size (0.42) across all the included cognitive measures (Hsu et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Interestingly, an even greater effect size (1.35) was revealed in a separate analysis that focused on patients with Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease. It has therefore been suggested that the effects of tDCS may be dependent on the capacity of the individual, with potentially larger gains at the lower baseline levels commonly seen in old age and neurodegenerative disease (Hsu et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>An important consideration relative to the motor domain is that there are several potential stimulation sites and behavioral outcomes for evaluating the effects of tDCS on cognition. The resulting heterogeneity between studies is reflected in the meta-analyses described above, which have included studies using a wide range of stimulation parameters (e.g., target site, stimulation duration) and even different stimulation techniques (e.g., tDCS, TMS). A more sensible analysis can be achieved by only including studies that target the same brain area and use the same outcome measure. In the working memory domain, the stimulation site has been relatively consistent with several studies implementing anodal stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; Horvath et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>). Given the established involvement of this region in working memory, there is indeed a clear theoretical motivation for selecting this as a target site (Wager and Smith, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Nee et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Outcome measures have varied more, but the N-back task, which requires participants to respond when the stimulus shown is the same as N trials back, has featured frequently in tDCS studies that target working memory. In a meta-analysis in adults, anodal tDCS over the dlPFC was found to result in shorter reaction times in the N-back task (Brunoni and Vanderhasselt, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Similarly, in one of the sub analyses presented by Horvath et al. (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>), a trend towards a significant effect of anodal dlPFC stimulation on accuracy in the N-back task was detected (<italic>p</italic> = 0.065; Horvath et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>). Whilst not fully convincing, these findings indicate that consistency in regards to target site and outcome measure may increase the sensitivity of the analyses. Unfortunately, an analysis of equal specificity has not yet been conducted in old individuals and it therefore remains unknown whether tDCS over the dlPFC can improve working memory in old age.</p><p>Adding to target site and outcome measure, there are other stimulation parameters that are rarely given sufficient consideration. For example, not much is known about how current strength and stimulation duration influences the development of tDCS effects in the cognitive domain. In younger adults, individual studies have demonstrated greater cognitive gains following 2 mA compared to 1 mA (Iyer et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) but results have not been consistent (Hoy et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In regards to stimulation duration, Ohn et al. (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) found that the effects of anodal left dlPFC stimulation on N-back performance developed gradually during the 30 min long stimulation period, becoming reliable only at the end of stimulation. However, significant effects on N-back performance has also been demonstrated after only 10 min of stimulation over the left dlPFC (Fregni et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Even less is known about the impact of such stimulation parameters in old individuals. Given the widespread changes in brain physiology and brain plasticity in old age, optimal tDCS parameters can reasonably be expected to differ compared to younger adults (Zimerman and Hummel, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Fertonani et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>The present study aimed to provide a detailed investigation of the effect of anodal tDCS over the left dlPFC on working memory performance in older individuals. To investigate how the effect develops over time, N-back performance was assessed before, three times during, 5 min after and 30 min after the 25 min long stimulation period. Furthermore, by implementing tDCS stimulation at both 1 mA and 2 mA, as well as sham stimulation, the study explored the importance of current strength. Based on previous meta-analytic results demonstrating a positive effect of brain stimulation on cognition in old age (Hsu et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), it was hypothesized that tDCS over the left dlPFC would improve working memory performance in old individuals. More robust effects were expected for higher current strengths, in the later phase of stimulation and after the stimulation has ended.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Thirty older healthy adults (14 females) between 65 and 75 years participated.

Each shape was presented for 2250 ms with an interstimulus interval of 250 ms.

The anode (7 &#x000d7; 5 cm) was centered over F3 according to the 10&#x02013;20 international system for EEG placement. Models of current flow intensity and distribution have provided support for F3 for targeting left dlPFC (Seibt et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The cathode (10 &#x000d7; 10 cm) was placed over the contralateral supraorbital area. In all sessions, the current was initially increased in a ramp-like fashion over 8 s. In the active stimulation conditions, a constant current was delivered for 25 min at an intensity of 1 mA or 2 mA. The stimulation duration was set to 25 min to allow the completion of three N-back assessments during stimulation whilst also allowing five minutes rest in between each assessment. In the sham condition, the current was terminated after 40 s. After each session, participants guessed which stimulation they thought they had received.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>The primary outcome was overall accuracy and response time on accurate trials during/after tDCS. Overall accuracy was the averaged sum of true positives (number of hits/total targets) and true negatives (number of correct rejections/total foils) with a nominal chance level at 0.5.

Relative to sham, tDCS at a current strength of 1 mA or 2 mA did not modulate performance at any point during stimulation or after stimulation. The hypothesis that working memory can be improved with a single session of anodal tDCS over the left dlPFC in older adults could therefore not be supported.</p><p>The lack of a robust cognitive effect after a single session of tDCS over the left dlPFC can be considered consistent with the results in younger individuals (Horvath et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>). Although the results of brain stimulation techniques on cognition has been more promising in old individuals (Hsu et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), findings relating directly to the effect of anodal tDCS over the dlPFC on N-back performance has to our knowledge been limited to a single study (Berryhill and Jones, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Unfortunately, the methodology used by Berryhill and Jones (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) differs both in terms of the specifics of the stimulation protocol and the N-back task, which makes a direct comparison difficult. A possibility therefore is that the particular stimulation protocol used in the present study may not have been optimal or that working memory itself, as assessed by a figural three-back task, is not amenable to tDCS modulation in old age.</p><p>Another possibility is that the effect developed over a longer time period than that incorporated in the study design. In support of this, evidence has started to emerge that older individuals may exhibit a delayed response to tDCS. In the motor domain, the maximum response to tDCS has been shown to occur 30 min later in old individuals than for young individuals (Fujiyama et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Similarly, in a cognitive training study with repeated stimulation sessions in older adults, benefits of tDCS were not detected until one month after the last stimulation session (Jones et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Furthermore, the meta-analysis that investigated the effect of TMS and tDCS in older adults found evidence of a more reliable effect in studies that assessed cognition after the stimulation had ended (Hsu et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). It is therefore possible that the maximum response to tDCS occurred after the last N-back assessment at 30 min post-stimulation in the present study.</p><p>A single session of tDCS may not be sufficient to produce robust cognitive change. Considering the proposed involvement of NMDA receptors and long-term potentiation and depression in the enduring effects of tDCS (Nitsche et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>), repeated stimulation sessions may be required (Hsu et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In particular, combining repeated tDCS with cognitive training has emerged as a promising approach in young and well as in older adults (Martin et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Park et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Richmond et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Jones et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). If tDCS can indeed be understood as a facilitator of synaptic plasticity, an ongoing learning process may be necessary to achieve robust and long-lasting cognitive improvements.</p><p>In the context of the possibilities discussed above, the cross-over design employed in the present study is an important limitation (Brunoni and Vanderhasselt, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). First, if tDCS effects continue to develop post-stimulation, a wash-out period of 48 h may have been insufficient. Second, in the case of ongoing learning across study visits, the order of the stimulation protocols (1 mA, 2 mA, sham) may have been influenced the effects on working memory. Whilst the order was counterbalanced across subjects and therefore controlled for in the design, interactions between tDCS effects and the learning process may have introduced sufficient noise to prevent an effect from being detected. Related to the limitations of a cross-over design is the challenge to maintain blinding. At the end of the present study, participants were able to guess which stimulation they had received at which visit at a higher accuracy than would be expected by chance. Going forward, a between-subject design should therefore be favored.</p><p>Like the majority of previous tDCS studies, the present study was also limited in terms of statistical power. <italic>Post hoc</italic> power calculations indicate that our power to detect a significant pairwise difference was limited even for large effect sizes (<italic>effect size</italic> = 0.5 SD, &#x003b1; = 0.05 and <italic>n</italic> = 30 gives 1-&#x003b2; = 0.75, G &#x000d7; Power 3, (Faul et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Meta-analyses on tDCS on cognition have suggested effect sizes in the small to medium range (Brunoni and Vanderhasselt, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Horvath et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2015b</xref>; Hsu et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), which therefore may have gone undetected in our study. However, considering an average sample size of 21 in cognitive investigations of tDCS over dlPFC (Tremblay et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), it should be emphasized that limited power represents a general challenge in the field. It is therefore critical that results from individual studies are reported, independent of outcome, to enable meta-analyses with good statistical power.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study found no evidence in support of the hypothesis that a single session of anodal tDCS over the left dlPFC improves working memory performance in old age.
