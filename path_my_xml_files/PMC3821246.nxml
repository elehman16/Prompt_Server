Hence, everyone in general and youngsters in particular are very cautious about beauty of their face. <italic>Yauvanapidika</italic> (acne) is such a condition that disfigures the face during adolescent to younger age. If the condition remains untreated, it leaves permanent scars over the face.</p><p>The disease <italic>Yauvanapidika</italic> occurs due to vitiation of <italic>Kapha</italic>, <italic>Vata</italic>, and <italic>Rakta</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] <italic>Swabhava</italic> (natural status) has also been considered as one of the causative factors.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Though the <italic>Tarunyaavastha</italic> (adolescent period) is the age for <italic>Shukra pradurbhava</italic> (manifestation of <italic>Shukra Dhatu</italic>) and <italic>Sharangadhara</italic> has mentioned <italic>Vaktre Snigdhata</italic> (unctuousness on face) and <italic>Pidika</italic> (boil) formation on face as <italic>Mala</italic> (waste product) of <italic>Shukra Dhatu</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] So, development of the acne in this age is obvious. Charaka has described second half of <italic>Balyaavastha</italic> as <italic>Vivardhamanaavastha</italic> (growing period) for all <italic>Dhatus</italic> and <italic>Anavasthita Chittatva</italic> (unstable mind).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] This indicates a specific phase of life cycle, where <italic>Dhatu</italic> maturation is going on and for the same, secretion of various growth hormones definitely took place. Imbalanced hormonal levels play a key role in development of various diseases.</p><p>According to modern medical science, acne is a chronic inflammatory condition of the pilo sebaceous units, characterized by the formation of comedones, erythematic papules and pustules, less frequently nodules or cysts too.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] It occurs due to colonization of microbial flora (<italic>p. acne</italic>) and imbalance status of androgen like hormones. Excessive sweating, constipation, and stress are also considered as the aggravating factors.</p><p>To treat, modern medical science suggests hormonal therapy, antibiotics, and some surgical or para-surgical measures. As these measures have certain limitations, alternatives are being searched for significant relief. Herbal formulations that purify blood, check the status of <italic>Kapha</italic> and <italic>Pitta</italic> can be used safely in the condition for longer duration.</p><p>Taking into consideration of the above facts, present study was planned to evaluate the effect of <italic>Shalmalyadilepa</italic> and <italic>Guduchyadivati</italic> in <italic>Yauvanapidika</italic> as <italic>Shamana</italic> therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Selection of patients</title><p>Total 50 patients with symptoms of <italic>Yauvanapidika</italic>, fulfilling the inclusion criteria were selected from O.P.D. of IPGT and RA Hospital, Jamnagar, and grouped into two groups.
