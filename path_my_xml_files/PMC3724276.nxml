It is characterized by daily or almost daily attacks of unilateral excruciating periorbital pain associated with ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms, typically lasting between 15 and 180&#x02009;minutes if untreated. While in the episodic form, bouts of CH attacks are separated by headache-free intervals; chronic cluster headache (CCH) is characterized by attacks occurring at least one year without remission or with remissions lasting less than one month (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0333102412473667">1</xref>).</p><p>CH belongs to a group of neurovascular headaches. Evidence, including limited human studies, indicates that CH pathophysiology could involve a cross-talk between trigeminal inputs and the cranial parasympathetic outflow from the superior salivary nucleus that is understood to be mediated primarily through the sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0333102412473667">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0333102412473667"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0333102412473667">4</xref>). The SPG is a large extracranial parasympathetic ganglion located in the pterygopalatine fossa (PPF). Post-ganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the SPG innervate facial structures and the cerebral and meningeal blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0333102412473667">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0333102412473667">6</xref>). When activated, these fibers release neurotransmitters and vasodilators that activate sensory trigeminal fibers causing further activation of the trigeminal pain pathway, which, in turn, causes further parasympathetic outflow, referred to as the trigeminal-autonomic reflex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0333102412473667">7</xref>).</p><p>The most effective treatments for CH attacks are injectable sumatriptan and oxygen inhalation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0333102412473667">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0333102412473667">9</xref>). The former is contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular disease; the latter is hampered by impracticability in everyday life, while neither decreases attack frequency. Preventive drug therapies for CH include several substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0333102412473667">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0333102412473667">11</xref>), but their use may be limited by intolerance or contraindications, and evidence of efficacy in CCH is poor. Moreover, 10&#x02013;20% of patients are not effectively treated by, or become resistant to, these therapies. Given the excruciating pain of this syndrome, alternative treatments are warranted.</p><p>Since 1908, when Sluder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0333102412473667">12</xref>) performed the first pharmacological SPG block by applying a 20% cocaine solution in its vicinity, various interventions have targeted the SPG, including alcohol injection within the PPF, transnasal injection of lidocaine and other agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0333102412473667">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0333102412473667">14</xref>), pulsed radiofrequency ablations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0333102412473667">15</xref>), and radiofrequency lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0333102412473667">16</xref>). Success rates vary from 46% to 85%, but benefits are transient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0333102412473667">17</xref>).</p><p>Neurostimulation-based therapies have been investigated for the treatment of refractory CCH patients, including hypothalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) and occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0333102412473667">18</xref>). The pioneering hypothalamic DBS work by Leone et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0333102412473667">19</xref>) was followed by electrode implantation in 64 refractory CCH patients worldwide with an overall favorable response rate reported to be 70% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0333102412473667">18</xref>). All of the DBS studies, however, were open studies with the notable exception of a study in 11 CCH patients that found no difference between sham and active DBS during the randomized phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0333102412473667">20</xref>). Unfortunately, DBS is associated with significant surgical risks including death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0333102412473667">21</xref>). ONS was studied in 91 CCH patients worldwide with a reported 67% of patients experiencing at least a 50% reduction in attack frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0333102412473667">22</xref>). However, all of the ONS studies were open, limited in size, and did not include a concurrent sham control. In addition, ONS is associated with a high frequency of lead migration, infection, battery depletion, and lead breakage with the consequence of repeated operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0333102412473667">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0333102412473667">24</xref>).</p><p>Recently, researchers have investigated the utility of SPG stimulation in CH. Ansarinia et al. published a proof of concept study on the response of CH patients to acute electrical stimulation of the SPG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0333102412473667">25</xref>). In six patients, effective abolition was reported in 11/18 spontaneous or induced CH attacks; partial (&#x0003e;50% reduction in pain score) response was reported in an additional three headaches.</p><p>Based on these pathophysiological and therapeutic data, we aimed to conduct a prospective, randomized, blinded, multicenter study to test the efficacy and safety of acute electrical stimulation of the SPG using the Autonomic Technologies, Inc. (ATI) Neurostimulation System (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0333102412473667">Figure 1</xref>).

Patients then underwent a therapy titration period during which stimulation parameters were adjusted bi-weekly as necessary; upon identification of efficacious parameters, or if efficacious parameters could not be identified and the neurostimulator lead positioning was considered correct, patients were moved into the experimental period. If the neurostimulator lead positioning was determined to be incorrect, a lead revision procedure was considered. Electrical stimulation parameters were adjusted according to provoked paresthesias in the root of the nose and/or treatment effect during an attack. The maximum amplitude was programmed to be slightly higher than the amplitude that provoked discomfort in each patient. Using the remote controller, the patient could apply stimulation and control the amplitude up to the highest level programmed by the clinician.

In this study GEE was used to account for the potential correlation of multiple headaches treated within the same patient. Thus the GEE model estimates the correlation within subjects and adjusts for it in the analysis of the outcome. A compound symmetric correlation structure was used. Pain relief and pain freedom estimates were obtained from the model for each of the three stimulation doses; data are presented as least square means (LSM) representing the proportion of doses achieving success and their 95% confidence intervals. All patients who received therapy during the experimental period, treated CH attacks with an initial CPS rating of moderate or greater, and provided responses to the 15-minute pain score and acute medication responses were included in the analysis.</p><p>The proportion of CH attacks treated with acute medication within 90&#x02009;minutes of initiating stimulation was compared, using a similar GEE model, across all three doses.</p><p>All patients who completed the experimental period, regardless of whether they treated any attacks during the experimental period, were included in the analysis of CH attack frequency reduction. Reduction in attack frequency during the experimental period was calculated relative to baseline frequency and the result analyzed with the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test. The latter test was also used to monitor changes from baseline to the end of the experimental period in disability and quality of life using the HIT-6 and SF-36v2 questionnaires.</p></sec><sec id="sec13-0333102412473667"><title>Role of funding source</title><p>The Pathway CH-1 study was funded by ATI, manufacturer of the SPG neurostimulator.

Three SPG neurostimulator lead revisions and two SPG neurostimulator explant procedures were classified as SAEs. Two of the three revision procedures were due to misplacement of the lead within the PPF during the original implantation. The third revision procedure was due to lead placement within the maxillary sinus. In this patient, the SPG neurostimulator was explanted in an outpatient procedure under local anesthetics prior to completing the second implantation.</p><p>Two other patients had SAEs that resulted in SPG neurostimulator explant. In one early implanted patient, within hours of completing the implant procedure, the SPG neurostimulator lead migrated superiorly and laterally, near the region of the maxillary nerve as confirmed by CT imaging. Since the SPG neurostimulator was not explanted immediately, the patient reported dysesthesias in the facial and oral territory of the maxillary nerve, which improved after explant but had not resolved completely at the time of this report. In the second patient, an incorrectly sized SPG neurostimulator lead migrated within two weeks post-operatively, confirmed by X-ray imaging, and was explanted under general anesthesia with no further AEs.</p><p>Cranial nerve exams were performed to proactively identify potential AEs. Sensory disturbance occurred in 81% of patients (35% of peri-operative AEs) with localized loss of sensation in distinct distributions of maxillary nerve being the most common (21 of 32 events, occurring in 19 of 32 patients). Fifteen events in 15 patients resolved with an average resolution time of 97 days (range: 31&#x02013;259 days). Six events had not resolved at the time of this report, but were reported to be mild or moderate.</p><p>Two patients suffered from infections, one at the incision site and another in the ipsilateral maxillary sinus. Both infections resolved with antibiotic therapy, and neither required SPG neurostimulator explant. Two patients reported mild paresis of the muscles around the nasolabial fold. Two patients had maxillary sinus puncture during the initial implantation or lead revision procedure, with no adverse clinical sequelae.

Other implantable devices have reported comparable responder rates solely for preventive treatment of refractory CCH, but none in a large, sham-controlled study. The Pathway CH-1 study showed two positive effects that may be independent: significant pain relief from acute stimulation and an observed significant reduction in attack frequency. The clinical and pathophysiological implications of these two effects will be considered.</p><p>The pain relief and pain freedom rates of 67.1% and 34.1% for full stimulation-treated CH attacks at 15&#x02009;minutes are close to those reported for injectable sumatriptan: 74% and 46%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0333102412473667">26</xref>), although the two trials are not completely comparable. In the sumatriptan study only 17 out of 39 included patients had CCH, and these patients were not defined as refractory to preventive medical treatment and in addition, the sumatriptan study was a single-attack study, compared to the multiple-attack study presented. An important advantage of electrical stimulation of the SPG is that it may be applied without daily limitations and cardiovascular contraindications as opposed to parenteral sumatriptan, which is restricted for safety reasons to only two daily uses and is contraindicated in patients with vascular disease and/or uncontrolled arterial hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0333102412473667">35</xref>). After injectable sumatriptan, oxygen inhalation is the most effective treatment of acute CH attacks, providing benefit in up to 78% of attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0333102412473667">8</xref>). However, in practice the effect of oxygen may take time and be transient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0333102412473667">36</xref>). In this study, a significant effect of SPG stimulation occurred within 15&#x02009;minutes and it was sustained, as suggested by the small difference (&#x02212;7.1%) in response rates between the 15-minute and 90-minute time points. Oxygen treatment can be difficult to prescribe in certain countries and, since high flow rates (i.e. gas cylinder) are warranted, it can be difficult to use by patients who are socially and professionally active.</p><p>Patients were generally compliant with instructions to treat CH attacks for 15&#x02009;minutes and applied electrical stimulation to the SPG on average for 14&#x02009;minutes when using full stimulation. Stimulation duration did not vary dramatically between the three different stimulation doses, indicating the robustness of the random insertion of the placebo study design. During the titration period, full stimulation was used to optimize the stimulation parameters, and most patients experienced sensation from stimulation during this period. Stimulation-provoked paresthesias coupled with pain response limited the amount of blinding that could be achieved in the study, a limitation that was overcome by utilizing two non-perceived stimulation doses and one perceived stimulation dose, applied in random order with concealed allocation, which is understood to be important in producing study results that accurately predict magnitude of clinical effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0333102412473667">37</xref>).</p><p>Although this study was designed and powered to test the acute effects on spontaneous CH attacks, a rather dramatic reduction of attack frequency was observed in some patients after repetitive attack stimulation. The reduction in attack frequency affected the number of CH attacks treated during the experimental period, and thus the number of attacks treated across patients was variable. While this phenomenon was a limitation of the study design, it was anticipated and addressed with the use of the logistic GEE for data analysis. Overall 43% of patients (12/28) experienced an attack frequency reduction of &#x02265;50% from baseline, although all patients had been suffering from the chronic form of CH for many years and had over time tried a number of preventive drugs without lasting benefit. The observed frequency reduction appeared strongly associated with the start of electrical stimulation to the SPG and not with effects from the surgical procedure, after which mean attack frequency increased (mean frequency at baseline 17.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;14.5 /week vs. 20.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;22.0 at the start of stimulation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0333102412473667">Figure 4</xref>). A preventive effect is not completely unexpected considering the reports of various injections into the PPF, including alcohol and steroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0333102412473667">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0333102412473667">14</xref>). The frequency reduction varies between patients and does not seem to depend on the number or duration of SPG stimulation attempts. In some patients, a short duration of stimulation resulted in sustained frequency reduction, whereas in others repeated stimulation that provided acute pain relief did not result in an attack frequency reduction. The possible influences of a placebo or regression to the mean effect cannot be excluded when considering the significant reduction in attack frequency observed. The apparent preventive effects of SPG stimulation, which may be clinically important, warrant further investigation.</p><p>As the treatment response varied between patients, we compared the clinical phenotype between acute responders, frequency responders and subjects who had both an acute and a frequency response. No clinical characteristic was found to be associated with response or type of response.</p><p>In addition to the significant findings of attack pain relief and CH attack frequency reduction, most patients had a clinically and statistically significant improvement in headache disability and quality of life with SPG stimulation. This result contrasts with an ONS study in CCH patients in which attack frequency and quality of life scores improved, but not significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0333102412473667">38</xref>).</p><p>Oral maxillofacial surgeries are inherently associated with standard peri-operative AEs, including pain, swelling, hematoma, seroma, and sensory disturbances in the vast majority of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0333102412473667">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0333102412473667">40</xref>). AEs associated with the surgical procedure in this study, including sensory disturbance localized to distinct areas innervated by branches of the maxillary nerve, are similar in number, severity, and duration to those observed in other procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0333102412473667">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0333102412473667">41</xref>). The Pathway CH-1 incidence of lead migration and lead misplacements was 6.3% (two of 32) and 12.5% (four of 32), respectively, and the incidence of reoperation was 18.8% (six of 32), an average of 1.19 procedures per patient. A review of ONS and DBS literature indicates a lead migration incidence of 15.4% or more and the DBS literature reports lead misplacement incidences of 8.5%, with a total of 473 surgical procedures for 372 patients (average 1.27 procedures per patient) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0333102412473667">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0333102412473667">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0333102412473667">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0333102412473667">43</xref>). The Pathway CH-1 study was the first surgical experience with the SPG neurostimulator across multiple surgical specialties. Over the course of the study, significant surgical experience was gained that led to improvements in surgical instrumentation and techniques as well as improved pre-operative planning and surgical targeting. Consequently, it is to be anticipated that surgery-related side effects will be less common than in the current sample.</p><p>Cardinal features of CH attacks are the prominent autonomic symptoms. They result from increased cranial parasympathetic outflow that is thought to activate trigeminal afferents via the trigeminovascular system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0333102412473667">2</xref>). Electrical stimulation of the SPG may physiologically block the parasympathetic efferents, thereby turning off the efferent arm of the trigeminal-autonomic reflex. The stimulation frequency is likely to be important for this effect. The average stimulation frequency used in this study was 120&#x02009;Hz, more than double the frequency found to result in pain relief and pain freedom in previous acute studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0333102412473667">25</xref>). This high-frequency stimulation is thought to act by causing depletion of stored neurotransmitter over time from the efferent parasympathetic fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0333102412473667">44</xref>). Low-frequency stimulation of the SPG causes dural plasma extravasation in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0333102412473667">45</xref>) and cortical blood flow peaks with stimulation at about 10&#x02009;Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0333102412473667">46</xref>). Even frequencies as high as 60&#x02009;Hz were able to activate the parasympathetic arm of the trigeminal-autonomic reflex, but the resulting effects on cortical flow were transient and peaked quickly after stimulation onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0333102412473667">46</xref>), suggesting that stimulation at high frequencies such as 120&#x02009;Hz may inhibit parasympathetic outflow or its effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0333102412473667">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0333102412473667">47</xref>). From a pathophysiological perspective, the positive results of this study confirm that the cranial parasympathetic system plays a crucial role in the occurrence as well as recurrence of CH attacks.</p><p>Electrical stimulation in the region of the SPG produces paresthesias in areas innervated by sensory fibers from the maxillary nerve that pass through the SPG en route to peripheral targets including the nasopharynx, soft palate, nasal cavity, and palatal gingiva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0333102412473667">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0333102412473667">48</xref>). In this study, programming of stimulation parameters was guided in most patients using the location of these provoked paresthesias. However, in one patient, paresthesias were not able to be provoked, and instead stimulation parameter adjustments were made during a spontaneous CH attack judging from the obtained therapeutic response.</p><p>The observed CH attack frequency reduction in our study is likely to be attributed to direct electrical stimulation of the SPG, indicating that acute stimulations may have prolonged clinical effects. Thus, the question of how stimulation of a peripheral autonomic ganglion may lead to a reduction of a centrally mediated disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0333102412473667">49</xref>) is of major interest. One possibility would be a repetitive depletion and hence exhaustion of parasympathetic neurotransmitters. Another could be a modulation of central structures via a parasympathetico-trigeminal feedback mechanism, which would be comparable to the activation of areas involved in descending pain control that are related to treatment efficacy after prolonged ONS in CCH patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0333102412473667">50</xref>). The mode of action may be different between acute and preventive effects of SPG stimulation and is further underlined by the absence of an obligatory association between the two effects in individual patients, although this effect may be underestimated, as many frequency responders could not be evaluated for acute response. Whatever the mode of action may be, the reduction in CH attacks was clinically meaningful and merits further investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec21-0333102412473667"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The multicenter European Pathway CH-1 study is the largest randomized, controlled neurostimulation study performed in CCH and confirms that patient-controlled electrical stimulation of the SPG is an effective treatment option for CCH sufferers with an acceptable safety profile. The efficacy data indicate that acute electrical stimulation of the SPG provides significant attack pain relief and in many cases pain freedom compared to sham stimulation. Adverse events associated with the ATI surgical procedure are similar to other trans-oral, gingival buccal surgical procedures. Electrical stimulation of the SPG was also observed to be associated with a significant and clinically meaningful reduction in CH attack frequency in some patients. The preventive effect is important in CCH and warrants further investigation. Overall, SPG stimulation significantly improves quality of life in these very disabled patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec22-0333102412473667"><title>Clinical implications</title><p><boxed-text id="boxed-text-0333102412473667" position="float"><list list-type="bullet" id="list2-0333102412473667"><list-item><p>This randomized, sham-controlled trial shows for the first time that stimulation of the ipsilateral sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) with a remotely controlled neurostimulator implanted in the pterygopalatine fossa is highly effective in aborting attacks in patients suffering from chronic cluster headache (CCH).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Repeated SPG neurostimulation may decrease the frequency of CH attacks, but this clinically important preventive effect warrants further investigation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The Autonomic Technologies, Inc.
