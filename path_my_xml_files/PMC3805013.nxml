rehabilitation. These voiding problems may result from medication, cognitive changes,
physical impairments, or neurological etiologies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients with spinal cord injury in the thoracic region were
selected for this study, and we monitored changes in their bowel function after performing
manual therapy along the colon. At the early stage of injury, the internal layer of the
rectum and the anal sphincter muscle are in a stage of complete incontinence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The reflex of the voiding function is
restored by recovery of the central lumbar-sacral spinal cord after the acute stage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Peristalsis of the intestine and right side
colon are maintained by innervation from the vagus nerve so that feces are transported to
the large intestine. After spinal cord injury, patients suffer from many kinds of problems
such as decreased muscle power and sensation, and impairment of the respiratory system and
other functions. Especially, spinal cord injury causes paralysis and high spasticity of the
anal sphincter, or results in problems of voiding dysfunction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, we selected patients with thoracic and lumbar spinal
cord injury for treatment with manual therapy, as an intervention for defecation function.
Our objective was to improve and enhance bowel function, to achieve the goal of patients&#x02019;
independence in activity of daily living (ADL).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> The data of subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean &#x000b1; SD</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (Y)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">39.7&#x000b1;2.25</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">168.8&#x000b1;7.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">66.1&#x000b1;9.01</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Twenty in-patients with spinal cord injury were selected at a hospital. There were 13 males
and 7 females (mean age 39.70 &#x000b1; 5.25). <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>
shows the basic characteristics of the participants.</p><p>The content of therapy included exercise therapy, setting up the habit of defecation (i.e.
have a bowel movement at a regular time every day), maintaining a stable psychological
status of patients, drinking a certain quantity of water, having food fiber, mechanical
stimulation and combination medication. Manual therapy was applied to the patients&#x02019; abdomen
to modulate tension and improve peristalsis of the colon. A secondary goal was to exercise
the pelvic floor muscles to help the patients to excrete. Each patient was positioned in
supine lying, with the hip and knee flexed at 90 degrees, with both legs on the therapist&#x02019;s
thigh to completely relax the patient&#x02019;s abdomen. Then, the therapist pressed down and pushed
along the colon ascendens, transverse colon, colon descendens and colon sigmoidem on the
surface of the abdomen. This massage was performed to improve the peristalsis of the large
intestine. Vibration stimulus was applied to the small intestine through the abdomen. If
tension or spasm appeared in the abdomen, the therapist inhibited two key points, one point
being 2 fingers above the patient&#x02019;s umbilicus, and the other point being to the right and
below, 1/3 of the distance between the umbilicus and anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS).
The fingers were pressed down on two points until the tension or spasm in the abdomen was
released. The duration of the treatment was 3 months. During this period, the dietary habit
did not change and the amounts of food and water taken were the same as before. The paired
t-test was used to compare excretion timing and dosages of glycerine enema before and after
treatment. A value of p&#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant. The software
package SPSS 17.0 was used for statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> Before and after of treatment comparison in of glycerine enema volume</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Before</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">After</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Glycerine Enema (ml) </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">68.1&#x000b1;8.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.5&#x000b1;11.8**</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Time of bowel (minutes)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">94.0&#x000b1;16.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.5&#x000b1;10.5**</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>**p&#x0003c;0.01</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>All the subjects enrolled in the study receiving manual therapy 5 times a week for 12
weeks. All the subjects in this study were included in the data analysis. All the subjects
seemed to be very comfortable after manual therapy for the abdomen after 2 days to 1 week.
Some patients reported their feces could be excreted in 2 hours after manual therapy was
implemented. The statistical analyses found significant differences in both timing of bowel
movement and dosage of glycerine enema. A statistically significant improvement was found in
the mean time of bowel movement; it decreased from 94.00 &#x000b1; 16.35 minutes to 60.50 &#x000b1; 10.50
minutes after receiving manual therapy for 3 months. The dosage of glycerine enema was
decreased from 68.05 &#x000b1; 8.90&#x02005;mL to 31.50 &#x000b1; 11.82&#x02005;mL (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, p&#x0003c;0.01). Therefore, the methods of manual therapy and stimulation of
key points on the abdomen effectively improved the bowel function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>According to the results, bowel function was improved by manual therapy. The main purpose
of the excretion therapy was to evacuate fecal matter from the colon in a regular interval
time. For spinal cord injury patients, the spinal reflex recovers gradually, so therapy for
bowel function is necessary during this period. The large intestine serves to desiccate the
fecal matter as it is transported from the ileum to the rectum<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, methods should be used to stimulate the colon sigmoideum
at a certain time for the patient. Clolxyl and dantron were usually administered to make
fecal matter soft. Besides this, in order to stimulate the stomach and the colon, patients
drank a hot drink slowly before recieving manual therapy for the abdomen. If the rectum
reflex was areflexic due to upper motor neuron injury, lubricant oil was applied inside the
anus to stimulate the rectum with a finger.</p><p>The kind of food and water content has great influence on bowel frequency and the hardness
of fecal matter. Some foods that are rich in vitamins, raw vegetables, fruit, cold water and
milk soften fecal matter and promote peristalsis of the gut. The quantity of food and the
meal time play very important roles in establishment of the habit of defecation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. They greatly help to increase patient&#x02019;s
ability of ADL and social participation. For example, it is necessary to teach patients to
establish regular habits, to control their bowel function, and to keep good habits in ADL,
they must maintain a certain exercise regime or do some exercises when they are sitting in a
wheelchair. We emphasize that plenty of water in the food must be taken by patients in each
meal everyday, otherwise there will be difficulty in defecation if the fecal matter becomes
over desiccated.</p><p>Although spinal cord injury patients want to have bowel movement everyday, they will
exhaust much energy and time, and also they will feel fatigue easily after they have
defecated. One evacuation every 2&#x02013;3 days is appropriate for such patients. It becomes
difficult to defecate if fecal matter is kept in the colon over 3 days. It is dangerous to
cause paralytic ileus if fecal matter is kept in the colon for a long time. The best timing
for evacuation is after breakfast, it can stimulate gastro-intestinal reflex hyperthyroid
activities to make evacuation easy. Moreover, a training plan for defecation should be set
according to the lifestyle habits of the patient and implementation of the plan for
defecation management<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Several kinds of ability for defecation free of joint motion, residual muscle power and
sensation (patient can look from mirror if no sensation around anus), sitting balance, hand
function (ability to use auxiliary device) and transfer ability, are needed for spinal cord
injury patients. If patients need to succeed at defecation independently, they must make
flexible use of the abilities mentioned above, as well as exercise rolling and taking off
and putting on clothes. In addition, patients should be trained to look in a mirror and
insert a turunda into the anus with an auxiliary device while lying on their sides. If
patients need to transfer to a sitting toilet, they must have the ability to take off their
trousers and transfer on the toilet pedestal within five minutes of inserting a turunda into
the anus. After the training process for the above, patients can achieve this independence
goal gradually, and they can check their bowel movements themselves as well as cleaning the
anus with an auxiliary device after a bowel movement.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Joel</surname><given-names>AD</given-names></name><name><surname>Bruce</surname><given-names>MG</given-names></name><name><surname>Nicholas</surname><given-names>EW</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: Principles and practice; In: Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.
