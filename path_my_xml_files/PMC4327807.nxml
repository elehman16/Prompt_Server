However, the success of all caries preventive programs has been impeded by its multifactorial nature. The disease is a result of demineralization, caused by the interactions of cariogenic bacteria, a diet rich in fermentable carbohydrates, and host components, such as tooth and saliva properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although many bacterial species can play a role in the caries process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], mutans streptococci (MS) have been considered major pathogens associated with early caries development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The main virulence properties of MS are acidogenicity, acid tolerance, biofilm formation and tooth adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Strong association between MS quantities and the pathogenesis of dental caries is demonstrated by several previous studies, reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Probiotic administration is considered a potential strategy for improving or maintaining oral health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), probiotics are &#x0201c;live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the probiotic action, including production of antimicrobial substances, competition with pathogens by preventing cellular adhesion and invasion, and modulation of local and systemic immune functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In a recent systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], several clinical trials have shown the capacity of probiotic supplementation to reduce MS counts, but the decreasing effect is variable and short-lasting. Moreover, only very few studies have so far investigated the quantities of lactobacilli (LB) and the prevention of new caries occurrence by probiotic supplementation.</p><p>Although LB, commonly used as probiotics, have been associated with caries progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], a recent study has revealed that only a certain species, <italic>i.e.</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus salivarius</italic>, is more related to caries development by its ability to produce high levels of acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In contrast to these cariogenic bacteria, <italic>Lactobacillus paracasei</italic> isolated from caries-free subjects possesses an ability to suppress MS growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In this study, <italic>Lactobacillus paracasei</italic> SD1 was introduced as a probiotic strain and used in the oral cavity because of its several previously-demonstrated properties, including inhibition of MS growth, less acid production than other LB, and good adherence to oral epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Human neutrophil peptides 1&#x02013;3 (HNP1-3) are small cationic antimicrobial peptides that provide the first line of host defense against a broad spectrum of microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. HNP1-3 are expressed in ductal epithelial cells of submandibular salivary glands and secreted into saliva [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. They are also produced by neutrophils and released into gingival crevicular fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The preventive role of HNP1-3 against dental caries has been suggested by the significantly higher salivary HNP1-3 levels in caries-free children than in those experiencing caries demonstrated by Tao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Since one of the probiotic mechanisms has been proposed to be involved with host immune regulation, we, therefore, hypothesized that probiotic supplementation might help prevent dental caries by augmentation of local host immunity via enhanced production of salivary HNP1-3. The aims of this study were to examine the effects of probiotic intervention on salivary HNP1-3 levels, MS counts, and LB counts, and to determine the correlations between these host and microbial parameters. Furthermore, new occurrences of carious lesions for the second permanent molars during a 12-month clinical trial were assessed and compared between the control and intervention groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Overview of study design</title><p>This trial was designed as a randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled method with two parallel groups. The study protocol was approved by the Human Experimentation Committees of the Faculties of Dentistry, Chiang Mai University and Prince of Songkla University, Thailand. Informed consent was obtained from the parents or guardians of each participant before the commencement of this study. Sixty eligible and healthy participants out of 246 children were allocated equally to either of the two groups, the control and probiotic groups, using a simple randomization procedure by means of drawing lots (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The inclusion and exclusion criteria are identified in Participants and in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. For the double-blinded method, the code was kept by an independent monitor. This code was not unveiled until all data had been analyzed. None of the researchers, the clinicians, the participants, the teachers, or the statistician knew whether the children received control or intervention milk throughout the entire course of this study. The trial was registered at the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.in.th/">http://www.clinicaltrials.in.th/</ext-link>, one of the primary WHO Registry Networks, Clinical Trials identifier TCTR20130904001. The whole experimental period lasted for 12&#x000a0;months, and the outcome measurement of this study consisted of four parameters: salivary HNP1-3, MS and LB levels at four different time points: T0 (baseline), T3 (three months of intervention), T6 (six months of intervention) and T12 (six months after cessation of the intervention), and the presence of carious or demineralized lesions at T0 and T12 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The <italic>priori</italic> sample size calculation was performed with a focus on mean differences of MS counts between two independent groups using G Power software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], with the effect size equal to 0.8 at 5% statistical significance level and 90% power of test. The calculation yielded no fewer than 28 participants in each group.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

The bacterial strain was identified by PCR-RFLP of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene and sodium dodecyl-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The probiotic intervention was manufactured in a form of milk powder by the spray drying technique. The culture conditions and the spray drying technique were performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Briefly, a culture of <italic>Lactobacillus paracasei</italic> SD1 was inoculated in a mixture of 1% probiotics and a 3-liter quantity of heat-treated (50&#x000b0;C for 30&#x000a0;min) and 20% reconstituted skimmed milk, and then spray dried with a spray dryer (model B191 Buchi mini spray dryer; Flawil, Switzerland). The final product was yellowish white powder with moisture contents of 3.44&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.85% and viable counts of 7.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.20x10<sup>8</sup> cfu/g, which was stored at 4&#x000b0;C. The viability of <italic>Lactobacillus paracasei</italic> SD1 in the inoculated milk powder was previously assessed in a six-month study by examining its growth in triplicate Man Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) pour plates under anaerobic incubation for three days at 37&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. It was demonstrated that the maximum survival rate of <italic>Lactobacillus paracasei</italic> SD1 in the skimmed milk powder was 99% if the milk powder was stored at 4&#x000b0;C for six months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, the survival rate declined sharply if the milk powder was stored at 25&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The milk powder in general appearance for both probiotic and control groups looked identical, except for the absence of the probiotic strain in the control group, and was packaged in the same clear plastic bags marked with a name of each participant. The packaging and delivering steps were performed by a research assistant who was blinded from every step of sampling and analyzing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants</title><p>The inclusion criteria were: (i) good oral health with caries in two or fewer teeth (ii) presence of four second molars in the mouth (iii) absence of untreated active deep carious lesions (iv) absence of periodontitis (v) non-smoking and (vi) daily tooth brushing habit using fluoride toothpaste. The exclusion criteria were teenagers with systemic diseases, receiving systemic antibiotics within six weeks, routine consumption of probiotics or xylitol, allergy to cows&#x02019; milk, lactose intolerance and severe food allergy. Prior to the commencement of the clinical trial, all participants were informed not to consume any products containing probiotics, such as yoghurt, drinking yoghurt, cheese, etc., throughout the entire duration of this trial. The participants in both groups were instructed to mix 5&#x000a0;g of milk powder in 50&#x000a0;ml water and drink once daily, except on the days of saliva collection, for six months under the supervision of instructors. On the holidays or the weekends, all children were informed to drink their milk at home and to return the empty plastic bags. The compliance was checked by their teachers who filled in a logbook every day with information on school attendance of children and on whether or not the children had been drinking the milk. It was apparent that no children participating in this study were absent from their classes due to sick leave during the first six-month intervention. All participants were asked to immediately report any side effects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Analyses of salivary HNP1-3 levels</title><p>A 2-ml quantity of unstimulated whole saliva was collected and equally divided in two aliquots, one for analysis of HNP1-3 levels and the other for analysis of microbiological levels. The first aliquot was added with Nonidet P-40 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to the final concentration of 0.1% (v/v), centrifuged at 15,000&#x000a0;rpm at 4&#x000b0;C for 10&#x000a0;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and the cleared supernatant was collected and stored frozen for further analysis of HNP1-3 levels by an HNP1-3 ELISA kit (HyCult Biotechnology, Uden, the Netherlands) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instruction. In brief, diluted saliva samples (1:200) were applied to a pre-coated plate in triplicate with the specific primary antibody to HNP1-3, and incubated for 1&#x000a0;h at room temperature. For a negative control, dilution buffer without addition of the saliva samples was added to the pre-coated plate. After washing four times with washing buffer, each well was incubated with the biotinylated tracer antibody for 1&#x000a0;h at room temperature. Then, the streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate was added and incubated for 1&#x000a0;h. After that, 3,3&#x02032;,5,5&#x02032;-tetramethylbenzidine, a chromogenic substrate, was added for 20&#x000a0;min, and the reaction was then stopped by the addition of 2% oxalic acid. The concentrations of HNP1-3 in saliva samples were calculated from a standard curve established by various known concentrations of an HNP1-3 standard, used as the ELISA system control. The concentrations of salivary HNP1-3 were then normalized by their total protein content using a BCA protein assay (Pierce Inc., Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instruction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Microbiological assays</title><p>The quantities of salivary MS and LB were evaluated by a typical colony counting method at T0, T3, T6 and T12.

The examination was performed by using a mouth mirror and an air syringe under an operating light. The caries data for each tooth surface, including occlusal (pit and fissure) and smooth surface (buccal, lingual, mesial and distal) caries, were recorded according to the criteria of the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The ICDAS codes consist of: 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;sound, 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;first visual change in enamel, 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;distinct visual change in enamel, 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;localized enamel breakdown, 4&#x02009;=&#x02009;underlying dentin shadow, 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;distinct cavity with visible dentin, and 6&#x02009;=&#x02009;extensive cavity within visible dentin. Caries risk assessment in this study was determined by the modified criteria previously described by Nase and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], which include both clinical caries status and MS quantities as follows.

Among these four major findings, the significant increase in salivary HNP1-3 levels by probiotic supplementation during the six-month intervention period is of great interest since it is probable that <italic>Lactobacillus paracasei</italic> SD1 may exert an immunostimulatory effect by enhanced production of innate immune effectors, especially HNP1-3, from ductal epithelial cells of submandibular salivary glands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], which are then secreted into the saliva. The possible immunostimulatory effect of <italic>Lactobacillus paracasei</italic> SD1 warrants further investigations. In addition, the innate immune activation by <italic>Lactobacillus paracasei</italic> SD1 is corroborated with the significant correlation between elevated salivary HNP1-3 levels and increased LB counts seen in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B. Activation of host immunity, particularly increased production of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), has been previously shown to be one of the principal mechanisms for probiotics in the gastrointestinal tracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and in the oral cavity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In this study, the rationale to investigate only the salivary HNP1-3 levels during probiotic intervention was based on the observation from a single previous study that demonstrated significantly higher HNP1-3 levels in the saliva samples from caries-free children than those from caries-susceptible children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, it is necessary to further determine the salivary levels of other immune-related effector molecules, especially other antimicrobial peptides besides HNP1-3, in a future study. It is noted that the levels of salivary HNP1-3 detected in our cohort were comparable to those measured by the same ELISA method performed by Tao and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Interestingly, the HNP1-3 levels were temporarily elevated during the six-month intervention period and gradually declined to the baseline levels after cessation of probiotic intake. The temporary induction of HNP1-3 levels was in line with the transient induction of sIgA levels in saliva by probiotic intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], indicating that daily consumption of probiotics seems to be required for a sustainable increase in host immune responses.</p><p>Nevertheless, the raised salivary HNP1-3 levels did not significantly correlate with the decreased MS counts, but the LB counts were instead correlated inversely with the MS counts, suggesting that the mechanism for probiotic action in the oral cavity may probably involve the competition and/or the interaction between two distinct microorganisms as previously shown by Teanpaisan and Piwat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] rather than enhanced production of HNP1-3. It is worthwhile to note that the inverse correlation between MS and LB counts was weak, so this suggests that other factors that were not tested in this study, such as different MS strains recovered from different individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], may play a role in the regulation of MS numbers by LB. In contrast to no significant change in MS counts in the control group, it was evident that the MS counts were transiently decreased in the probiotic group at T3 and T6, consistent with the finding from a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This, again, confirms the short-lasting effect of probiotics against MS numbers, similar to the transient increasing effect on HNP1-3 levels. It is interesting to note a prolonged increase in LB counts irrespective of the cessation of probiotic intervention, which may be explained by the ability of <italic>Lactobacillus paracasei</italic> SD1 to be retained in the oral cavity, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and by the counting method for total LB on MRS agar in this study, rather than the specific quantification of <italic>Lactobacillus paracasei</italic> SD1. Consequently, it is possible that the increased MS counts back to the baseline levels at 12&#x000a0;months were attributable to the absence of <italic>Lactobacillus paracasei</italic> SD1, although the total LB counts were still high. In this study, we did not examine the morphology of LB recovered from saliva samples in great detail with Gram stain, although some colonies of LB on MRS plates were randomly selected and checked for the presence of <italic>Lactobacillus paracasei</italic> SD1 by a qualitative assay like Arbitrarily Primed-Polymerase Chain Reaction fingerprints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Therefore, the inability to confirm the morphology of LB and to quantitatively compare the levels of <italic>Lactobacillus paracasei</italic> SD1 between the control and probiotic groups at each time point is a limitation of this study and this inability may preclude the possibility of <italic>Lactobacillus paracasei</italic> SD1 retention in the oral cavity.</p><p>In addition to the laboratory results regarding HNP1-3 levels and microbial counts in saliva, we extended our investigation into the clinical findings relating to caries increment in our cohort. The significant reduction by approximately 2.6 fold for caries increment within 12&#x000a0;months was observed for the pit and fissure caries in the probiotic group when compared with the control group (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B), suggesting that probiotic intervention in milk powder helps reduce the occurrence of new carious lesions for the pit and fissure surface. In addition to considering the pit and fissure surface alone, the sum of the percentages for caries increment in all five tooth surfaces was also significantly reduced in the probiotic group (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). These results differ from the findings from two previous studies, which demonstrated a low odds ratio for caries prevention on occlusal surfaces from milk containing <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> GG in preschool children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and lack of significant difference in new caries occurrence between the probiotic and control groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the participants in each of those studies were categorized as low caries risk, whereas half of the participants in our study were categorized as high caries risk, according to the modified criteria for caries assessment mentioned in the <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>. Therefore, as suggested by the results of those studies and ours, probiotic intervention may be beneficial to reduce the new occurrence of pit and fissure caries in children with high caries risk.</p><p>In this study, it was demonstrated that the probiotic intervention did not reduce new caries occurrence on the smooth surfaces. This may be explained by the fact that pit and fissure caries is more associated with MS quantities than is smooth surface caries, consistent with the critical role of MS in pit and fissure caries development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Moreover, it was apparent that the effect of probiotics on smooth surface caries varied among different smooth surfaces (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). Particularly, the probiotics appeared to have a caries-reducing effect on the distal and lingual surfaces, but not on the mesial and buccal surfaces. Nevertheless, such mixed effects did not reach a statistically significant level when sum of the percentages for caries increment in four smooth surfaces was determined (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). Some factors that can influence distinct outcomes between occlusal and smooth surface caries and then preclude statistical verification include the location of second permanent molars (whether in maxillae or in mandibles), the sample size, and the 12-month duration of this study. Therefore, it is suggested that a larger study with a longer follow-up duration and with special attention to the tooth location be further conducted to more precisely verify all of the statistically significant and non-significant findings and to define the extent and mechanism behind any observable beneficial effects from probiotic intervention.</p><p>Utilizing non-sweetened milk powder as a suitable vehicle to introduce the probiotics in this study provided several health benefits for the participants, including provision of more nutrients, good compliance, and additional caries prevention from some constituents in milk powder, such as casein, calcium and phosphorous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Moreover, among several different LB species that have been reported as probiotics, it has been previously shown that <italic>Lactobacillus paracasei</italic> exerted a maximum inhibitory effect on MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], possibly by its ability to produce paracasin SD1 that functions against MS in the oral cavity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Furthermore, compared with various probiotic strains used in other studies, predominantly isolated from the gastrointestinal tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], <italic>Lactobacillus paracasei</italic> SD1 used in our study was isolated from the oral cavity of caries-free volunteers. However, this probiotic strain could only exert a temporary effect on MS reduction and HNP1-3 induction despite a prolonged increase in LB counts in the saliva samples. This may be because the colony counting method on MRS agar cannot differentiate our probiotic strain from other LB strains that already reside in the participants&#x02019; mouths. Otherwise, it is probable that our probiotic strain can possibly increase the number of other LB strains, a possibility that warrants further investigations.</p><p>Although cariogenic progression varies between different individuals and sometimes lasts longer than a year, the 12-month randomized and double-blinded clinical trial was designed in order to control different inherent factors between the control and probiotic groups. Additionally, the ICDAS was chosen as a tool to assess carious lesions in this short period of study because it is sensitive enough to detect an early carious lesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Further studies into the underlying mechanisms of increased HNP1-3 production by our probiotics in different oral cell types are currently being investigated, and additional studies into the activation of other oral immune effectors classified in acquired and innate immunity are essential to verify the real potential benefits and applications of probiotics for good oral health, especially for caries prevention. Several confounding factors that were beyond our control in each individual, including variations in the baseline levels of salivary HNP1-3, in the different quantities and strains of MS, in the quantities of fermentable carbohydrate consumption, and in the quality of oral hygiene care, are noted and may affect the outcomes of this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Probiotic supplementation with <italic>Lactobacillus paracasei</italic> SD1 can temporarily enhance salivary HNP1-3 levels and decrease the numbers of MS.
