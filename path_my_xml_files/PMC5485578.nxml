The effectiveness of pharmacological treatments and the availability of psychological treatments in primary care are limited. A behavioural approach to depression treatment might be beneficial to many older adults but such care is still largely unavailable. Behavioural Activation (BA) protocols are less complicated and more easy to train than other psychological therapies, making them very suitable for delivery by less specialised therapists. The recent introduction of the mental health nurse in primary care centres in the Netherlands has created major opportunities for improving the accessibility of psychological treatments for late-life depression in primary care. BA may thus address the needs of older patients while improving treatment outcome and lowering costs.The primary objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of BA in comparison with treatment as usual (TAU) for late-life depression in Dutch primary care. A secondary goal is to explore several potential mechanisms of change, as well as predictors and moderators of treatment outcome of BA for late-life depression.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">Cluster-randomised controlled multicentre trial with two parallel groups: a) behavioural activation, and b) treatment as usual, conducted in primary care centres with a follow-up of 52&#x000a0;weeks.

Patients are excluded from the trial in case of severe mental illness that requires specialized treatment, high suicide risk, drug and/or alcohol abuse, prior psychotherapy, change in dosage or type of prescribed antidepressants in the previous 12&#x000a0;weeks, or moderate to severe cognitive impairment. The intervention consists of 8 weekly 30-min BA sessions delivered by a trained mental health nurse.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">We expect BA to be an effective and cost-effective treatment for late-life depression compared to TAU.

A study in Dutch primary care practices found that major depression was prevalent in 13,7% and minor depression in 10,2% of the elderly patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, most older patients with depression remain untreated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Often older adults attribute their depressive symptoms to the ageing process or declining physical health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], have low expectations about existing treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and/or feel adversity towards treatment in mental health clinics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A large 3-year longitudinal cohort study on late-life depression in 32 Dutch primary care centres (PCC&#x02019;s) showed the prognosis to be poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The direct economic costs of depression treatment as well as the indirect costs of depression associated with premature mortality and morbidity are high, as people with depression have a higher healthcare consumption than non depressed people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The increasing ageing population in the Netherlands will raise healthcare costs and un(der)treated older patients with clinical depression will add to the burden.</p><p id="Par30">Although late-life depression can be treated effectively, there is space for both improvement and development of alternative treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, especially in older adults, the use of psychoactive agents like antidepressants is associated with risks and adverse events, such as falls and adverse interactions with somatic medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Although older adults prefer psychological treatment over pharmacological treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], only 3% of older patients with minor depression and 10% of older patients with major depressive disorder are referred to a mental health professional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. There are several barriers that can explain this underutilization of mental health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Older adults report a fear of stigmatization and have difficulties identifying their need for help, believing that their symptoms are normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, there is a lack of psychotherapists trained in treating older adults and most facilities treating older patients for depression are located outside the PCCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Patients thus experience practical barriers such as transportation problems and are held back by the costs of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Many of these barriers could be overcome if an effective psychological treatment was available in primary care, one that acknowledges but does not medicalize the depressive feelings older adults experience. Behavioural activation (BA) might be that treatment.</p><p id="Par31">BA aims to create a personal environment of positive reinforcement by increasing functional and pleasurable behaviour, and by decreasing avoidant and depressed behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. BA protocols are less complex, easier to train and to implement than other psychological therapies, making them very suitable for implementation in primary care, as studies from the UK have already shown for non-older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Currently, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT) are the most frequently used treatments for depression, but research suggests that BA might be equally effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Recent introduction of the mental health nurse (MHN) in PCCs in the Netherlands has created major opportunities for the delivery of psychological treatments, such as BA, for late-life depression. The availability of BA in PCCs may improve accessibility and acceptability of psychological treatment for older patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. BA may thus address the needs of older patients while improving treatment outcome and lowering costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Effectiveness of BA</title><p id="Par32">Several meta-analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] as well as a recent RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] among depressed patients found BA to be at least equivalent to CBT in the acute phase and at follow-up, and more effective than control conditions and some other psychological therapies for depression in adults. Moreover, MHN-delivered BA is both feasible, effective and cost-effective in managing depression in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">Meta-analyses with respect to BA treatment for late-life depression confirm its benefits for this age-group, although included studies were small and had low methodological quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Furthermore, two small observational studies showed that BA delivered by master level students and by social workers is feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Further evidence for the effectiveness of BA for late-life depression stems from a large RCT on care management for patients with late-life depression that suggest that activity scheduling, which exhibits similarities with BA, could be a major contributor to treatment gains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This trial did not directly compare BA and TAU. In another RCT &#x02018;collaborative care&#x02019; BA was the principal treatment compared to TAU for older adults with subclinical depressive symptoms. The study found a small to medium effect of collaborative care on depressive symptoms compared to TAU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In both studies, BA was only a component of a new care management plan, so the direct effects of BA on depressive symptoms could not be determined.</p><p id="Par35">Despite the growing evidence of the effectiveness of BA in managing depression, no methodologically sound and well-conducted studies have evaluated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of BA by MHNs as a stand-alone treatment for older depressed adults in primary care. BA, delivered by MHNs, could increase the availability and accessibility of non-pharmacological treatments for late-life depression in primary care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Mechanisms, predictors and moderators</title><p id="Par36">As stated before, recent studies show that BA is non-inferior to CBT in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Several other studies suggest that most psychological interventions for depression are equally effective, a phenomenon also referred to as the &#x0201c;dodo-bird verdict&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This doesn&#x02019;t mean that all interventions are equally effective for all patients. Therefore we are specifically interested in the underlying mechanisms and predictors that can explain how therapeutic change comes about in BA.</p><p id="Par37">BA theory suggests that changes in activation cause and precede the decline of depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. This has been demonstrated in a recent small scaled study that found that changes in activation preceded or co-occurred with changes in depression in adults, while in TAU this pattern was not found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Another potential therapy-specific mechanism of BA is rumination. In BA, rumination is specifically targeted as a behavioural problem that can be actively tackled with behavioural interventions. BA attempts to change the act of rumination, thereby leaving more time for constructive and social behaviour, rather than challenging the content of the dysfunctional thoughts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Several non-specific factors that are potentially related to treatment gain in depression as well as potential predictors of the (differential) effects are also investigated, such as loneliness, physical activity, cognitive functioning, therapeutic alliance, behavioural limitations, general psychopathology and treatment expectations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Objectives and hypotheses</title><p id="Par39">In the current trial, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of BA, delivered by mental health nurses for older adults with moderate to severe depressive symptoms in PCCs. The study will investigate the effectiveness of BA in real life primary health care, with the aim to generalize results to primary care in the Netherlands and abroad.</p><p id="Par40">The second aim of this study is to investigate whether treatment gains in BA can be explained by treatment-specific factors based on BA-theory, such as the degree of activation, or non-specific factors, such as the therapeutic alliance or treatment expectations. An example of a possible mechanistic pathway that might explain the effectiveness of BA can be seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Theoretical framework for potential mechanisms of action</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12888_2017_1388_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

The treatment conditions are behavioural activation (BA), and treatment as usual (TAU). Data are collected at general practices in the South-Eastern region of the Netherlands. Only practices that employ a mental health nurse (MHN) are included. Currently, more than 80% of Dutch PCCs employ an MHN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. A list of currently participating PCCs can be found on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://beatdepressie.nl/voor-deelnemers/">http://beatdepressie.nl/voor-deelnemers/</ext-link>. We will report the study according to the SPIRIT guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The study has been approved by the local medical ethical committee of the Radboud University Medical Centre (CMO Arnhem-Nijmegen).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p id="Par48">General practitioners and mental health nurses are responsible of the recruitment of participants. They include eligible patients during consultations (see procedures for details). We will include 200 older adults (&#x02265;65&#x000a0;years). All patients presenting with depressive symptoms or depression are asked to participate. Those who have a PHQ-9 score&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;9 and have given informed consent will be included in the study. Patients will be excluded from the trial in the case of 1) current severe mental illness in need of specialized treatment, including bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, (history of) psychosis, high risk of suicide, drug and/or alcohol abuse, 2) psychotherapy in the previous 12&#x000a0;weeks or current treatment by a mental health specialist and 3) moderate to severe cognitive impairment. Patients with antidepressants are eligible provided that a stable dose has been maintained for at least 12&#x000a0;weeks before participating in the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Interventions</title><p id="Par49">BA aims to increase activation levels by helping patients engage in rewarding activities and reduce avoidance behaviour that diminishes distress in the short term but has adverse consequences in the long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Our BA protocol is based on the model developed by Martell and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This original BA model consists of 12 to 24 one-hour sessions and is designed for patients referred to specialised mental healthcare institutions for treatment. The patients eligible for treatment in PCCs will be a more mixed population suffering from clinically relevant depressive symptoms although less severe than patients referred to specialist care. In studies on collaborative care for depressed older adults, BA-treatment by MHNs is delivered in 8 to 10 15&#x02013;45&#x000a0;min sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. We decided to adjust BA intensity to a level that would fit the contemporary Dutch model for MHN-delivered care in PCCs.</p><p id="Par50">BA will be delivered in eight 30-min face-to-face sessions within eight weeks, with the first session lasting 45&#x000a0;min. All key elements of the original BA-protocol of Martell et al. are kept in, including a functional analysis, activity registration, activity scheduling and relapse prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Prior to the start of the study, all MHNs of the BA group received a two-day training by licensed specialists on the use of the BA protocol. While treating patients, MHNs receive two-weekly online (skype) supervision in groups of three, led by one of the BA specialists that provided the training. MHNs fill in a session checklist for every patient to check for therapy adherence.</p><p id="Par51">
<italic>Treatment as usual (TAU)</italic> will be unrestricted and involves the GPs treatment options consistent with the guidelines of the Dutch College of GPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. At baseline GPs indicate their intended treatment, such as pharmacological treatment, psychological treatment by a MHN or a psychologist, or watchful waiting. At post-treatment GPs confirm whether the intended treatment plan was followed and which changes were made. Although activation is addressed as an advice to patients suffering from depression or depressive symptoms in the before mentioned guidelines, it is not offered as a systematic and protocolised intervention and therefore not comparable to the BA protocol adopted in our study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Procedure</title><p id="Par52">Older adults that visit their GP with depressive symptoms, complaints of loneliness, reduced social functioning, medically unexplained symptoms, and/or frequent attenders without a clear somatic diagnosis will be screened for potential eligibility. If the GP or MHN suspects depressive symptoms or if the patient fulfils one of the aforementioned criteria, the GP or MHN will screen the patient with the first two questions of Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I. 5.0.0.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] on depressive symptoms. If one or both of the questions is answered affirmatively, the GP will provide the patient with basic information about the study and will ask whether (s)he agrees to be contacted by our research assistant.</p><p id="Par53">Eligible participants receive a letter with study information and are contacted by a research assistant to plan a baseline visit, that takes place approximately one week after they&#x02019;ve received the letter. This will allow them to make an informed decision about their participation. At the baseline visit a research assistant will visit the patient at home to assess whether (s)he fulfils the inclusion criteria and is willing to participate. During this visit, also several cognitive tests will be performed, and the presence of depressive disorder will be established with a semi-structured clinical interview M.I.N.I. 5.0.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. After the baseline meeting, the patient will receive the online or paper-pencil baseline questionnaire, which they will be asked to complete within the following week. Furthermore, the patient will wear an accelerometer for one week.

Although BA has been proven to be an effective treatment for depression in adults, the effectiveness of BA delivered by MHNs in older adults, as well as the possible mechanisms of change are not yet clear. The results of the study can be used to improve the quality and availability of treatments for depressed older adults in primary care.</p><p id="Par85">The main strength of this study is that procedures followed in this effectiveness trial closely match the daily practice of PCCs.

Furthermore, our BA protocol is adapted to a primary care setting, is very easy to train, and therefore easily implemented in other PCCs throughout the Netherlands and abroad.</p><p id="Par86">However, this study also has some limitations that will be taken into account. The main limitation derives from the fact that patients as well as some research assistants, GPs and MHNs are not blinded to patient allocation, due to cluster randomisation. This might influence their judgement of severity of depression of the patients. To prevent biased opinions on whether or not patients (still) have MDD post-treatment, the clinical interview will be performed by an independent research assistant that will be blinded to patient allocation.</p><p id="Par87">Furthermore, we realize that the recruitment of patients in primary care could be challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>].

It might be difficult for GPs to inform depressed older adults about the study in their 10&#x000a0;min sessions.

The main strategy for disseminating the results of this study, apart from congresses and scientific publications, is the incorporation of the trial results into the update of the Depression Guideline of the Dutch College of General Practitioners. Our research project group has direct access to the Dutch GP Depression Guideline (van Marwijk). The guideline has a national reach and is primarily directed at general practitioners and primary care nurses.</p><p id="Par92">The activities to actively change clinical practice consist of the initiation of an &#x02018;implementation working group&#x02019;, linked to the research group. Members of this group are patient and general practitioners of the trial sites and of the health plans paying for the treatment. A patient and professional member from the Dutch Association of Mental Health Nurses (Landelijke Vereniging POH-GGZ) will also join this implementation group, as well as a representative from the Dutch Depression Association (national patient organization). During the first three years of the study, the research group will consult the implementation group about barriers and facilitators related to the introduction BA in primary care centres.</p></sec><sec id="FPar9"><title>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</title><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></sec></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Luppa</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Age- and gender-specific prevalence of depression in latest-life--systematic review and meta-analysis</article-title><source>J Affect Disord</source><year>2012</year><volume>136</volume><issue>3</issue><fpage>212</fpage><lpage>221</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.jad.2010.11.033</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21194754</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Riedel-Heller</surname><given-names>SG</given-names></name><name><surname>Busse</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Angermeyer</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The state of mental health in old-age across the 'old' European Union-- a systematic review</article-title><source>Acta Psychiatr Scand</source><year>2006</year><volume>113</volume><issue>5</issue><fpage>388</fpage><lpage>401</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1111/j.1600-0447.2005.00632.x</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16603030</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Licht-Strunk</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Prevalence of depression in older patients consulting their general practitioner in The Netherlands</article-title><source>International journal of geriatric psychiatry</source><year>2005</year><volume>20</volume><issue>11</issue><fpage>1013</fpage><lpage>1019</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1002/gps.1391</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16250082</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><label>4.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Stek</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Prevalence, correlates and recognition of depression in the oldest old: the Leiden 85-plus study</article-title><source>J Affect Disord</source><year>2004</year><volume>78</volume><issue>3</issue><fpage>193</fpage><lpage>200</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0165-0327(02)00310-5</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15013243</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR5"><label>5.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Burroughs</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>'Justifiable depression': how primary care professionals and patients view late-life depression?
