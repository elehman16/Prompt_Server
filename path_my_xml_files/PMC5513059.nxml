However, it is uncertain whether tranexamic acid is effective in traumatic brain injury. The CRASH-3 trial is a randomised controlled trial that will examine the effect of tranexamic acid (versus placebo) on death and disability in 13,000 patients with traumatic brain injury. The CRASH-3 trial hypothesizes that tranexamic acid will reduce intracranial haemorrhage, which will reduce the risk of death. Although it is possible that tranexamic acid will reduce intracranial bleeding, there is also a potential for harm. In particular, tranexamic acid may increase the risk of cerebral thrombosis and ischaemia. The protocol detailed here is for a mechanistic sub-study nested within the CRASH-3 trial. This mechanistic sub-study aims to examine the effect of tranexamic acid (versus placebo) on intracranial bleeding and cerebral ischaemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The CRASH-3 Intracranial Bleeding Mechanistic Sub-Study (CRASH-3 IBMS) is nested within a prospective, double-blind, multi-centre, parallel-arm randomised trial called the CRASH-3 trial. The CRASH-3 IBMS will be conducted in a cohort of approximately 1000 isolated traumatic brain injury patients enrolled in the CRASH-3 trial. In the CRASH-3 IBMS, brain scans acquired before and after randomisation are examined, using validated methods, for evidence of intracranial bleeding and cerebral ischaemia. The primary outcome is the total volume of intracranial bleeding measured on computed tomography after randomisation, adjusting for baseline bleeding volume. Secondary outcomes include progression of intracranial haemorrhage (from pre- to post-randomisation scans), new intracranial haemorrhage (seen on post- but not pre-randomisation scans), intracranial haemorrhage following neurosurgery, and new focal ischaemic lesions (seen on post-but not pre-randomisation scans). A linear regression model will examine whether receipt of the trial treatment can predict haemorrhage volume. Bleeding volumes and new ischaemic lesions will be compared across treatment groups using relative risks and 95% confidence intervals.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The CRASH-3 IBMS will provide an insight into the mechanism of action of tranexamic acid in traumatic brain injury, as well as information about the risks and benefits.

According to the World Health Organization, TBI will continue to be a major cause of death and disability by 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. At least 200 per 100,000 people are killed or hospitalised each year after TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], resulting in over 10 million deaths or hospitalisations each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. TBI is the leading cause of death and disability in people below the age of 45 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">TBI patients can experience a loss in physical, behavioural or emotional functioning after the injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Severe TBI often results in motor impairment that persists for at least 3&#x000a0;years after the injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and cognitive impairments are present for at least 6&#x000a0;months after injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Problems with memory following TBI significantly affect an individual&#x02019;s quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Even with rehabilitation treatments, only 40&#x02013;50% of TBI patients completely recover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">The increasing incidence of TBI can be explained by the rising frequency of traffic accidents in developing countries and rapidly motorising middle-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Projections of global mortality and burden of disease suggest that road traffic accidents will be the third major cause of death and disability by 2030, assuming a faster rate of socio-economic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Falls in older adults are the leading cause of TBI in high-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Given the global scope of this life threatening and potentially disabling condition, it is important to identify the most effective clinical care in this patient group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Intracranial haemorrhage occurrence</title><p id="Par15">Intracranial bleeding is common after TBI and the larger the bleed the greater the risk of death and disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In patients with mild TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;13), although bleeding can continue for up to 24&#x000a0;hours after injury, most bleeds stop progressing within a few hours of hospital admission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Intracranial haemorrhage progression has been observed in half of moderate to severe head injury patients who had a median Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8 on admission and repeat computed tomography (CT) scans performed within 24&#x000a0;hours of injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Patients who were scanned earlier after injury (&#x02264;3.5&#x000a0;hours vs. &#x0003e; 3.5&#x000a0;hours) were more likely to have expanding haematomas on CT performed 24&#x000a0;hours after injury (57% vs. 28%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. If the initial CT scan was conducted more than 3.5&#x000a0;hours after injury, the percentage of patients with measurable changes in haematoma volume 24&#x000a0;hours after injury was reduced. In a subset of patients who had an intermediate scan (most of which were between 6 and 9&#x000a0;hours of injury), the mean volume change between the baseline and intermediate scan was 5.7&#x000a0;mL, whereas the difference in mean volume between the intermediate scan and the 24&#x000a0;hour scan was 0.03&#x000a0;mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Thus, the maximal change in intracranial haemorrhage volume occurs soon after injury.</p><p id="Par16">A meta-analysis of 34 studies that reported the frequency of coagulopathy after TBI found that one third of patients with TBI have laboratory evidence of abnormal coagulation based on parameters such as fibrinogen, fibrin degradation products and antithrombin levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">The risk of mortality in patients with coagulopathy after TBI is nine times higher than in TBI patients without coagulopathy (odds ratio (OR) 9.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.3&#x02013;11.6). The risk of unfavourable outcome as measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (score of 1&#x02013;3) is more than 30 times higher in TBI patients with coagulopathy (OR 36.3, 95% CI 18.7&#x02013;70.5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Decreased platelet counts, prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time, and high levels of fibrinogen and D-dimer levels are observed in patients within the first 3&#x000a0;hours of TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The highest D-dimer concentrations were found in the most severely injured patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], who have a higher risk of intracranial haemorrhage and mortality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Effectiveness of tranexamic acid in reducing haemorrhage</title><p id="Par18">Tranexamic acid reduces bleeding by inhibiting the enzymatic breakdown of fibrin blood clots. Plasmin binds to fibrin via lysine-binding sites and then splits fibrin into fibrin degradation products. Tranexamic acid is a molecular analogue of lysine that inhibits fibrinolysis by reducing the binding of plasmin to fibrin.</p><p id="Par19">A systematic review of 104 randomised trials of tranexamic acid in surgical patients found that it reduced the number of patients receiving a blood transfusion by one-third and halved the need for further surgery to control bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">A large randomised trial of tranexamic acid treatment within an hour of acute traumatic injury found that it reduced the risk of death due to bleeding by about one-third (relative risk (RR) 0.68, 95% CI 0.57&#x02013;0.82; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

There was no apparent increase in the risk of vascular occlusive events with tranexamic acid following acute trauma (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.44&#x02013;1.07; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.096).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Tranexamic acid as a potential treatment in TBI</title><p id="Par21">Tranexamic acid is able to penetrate the blood&#x02013;brain barrier and should be able to affect intracranial haemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. If tranexamic acid is effective following TBI, it should also be most effective when given soon after injury when intracranial bleeding is on-going [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, if early increased fibrinolysis exacerbates bleeding and increases the risk of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], we would expect tranexamic acid to be most effective during this period.</p><p id="Par22">However, there is also the potential for harm. In particular, tranexamic acid may increase the risk of cerebral thrombosis and ischaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Cerebral ischaemia is an important secondary injury mechanism after TBI that worsens neurologic outcome and increases mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It can be precipitated by raised intracranial pressure, which can lead to cerebral hypo-perfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In addition, thrombotic disseminated intravascular coagulation may increase the risk of cerebral micro-thrombi, which are often seen in the brains of TBI patients who die within 24&#x000a0;hours of injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. By inhibiting fibrinolysis, tranexamic acid might increase the risk of cerebral ischaemia and thrombosis in TBI patients.</p><p id="Par23">A systematic review identified two completed randomised trials of tranexamic acid in TBI patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The first randomised trial (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;249) examined the effect of tranexamic acid in patients with extra-cranial bleeding but who also had TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The second randomised trial (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;229) examined the effect of tranexamic acid in patients with polytrauma and TBI or isolated TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Both trials used information from pre- and post-randomisation CT scans to estimate the extent of bleeding and ischaemia. Both trials recruited patients who were within 8&#x000a0;hours of injury, yet they were not large enough to determine the balance of risks and benefits from tranexamic acid and whether this varies by time to treatment.</p><p id="Par24">When the two randomised trials were combined in a meta-analysis, there was a statistically significant reduction in intracranial haemorrhage (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58&#x02013;0.98; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03) and mortality (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.40&#x02013;0.99; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05) with tranexamic acid. In one trial, focal ischaemic lesions occurred in 5% of tranexamic acid-treated patients and 9% of placebo-treated patients (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.20&#x02013;1.32; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.17) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In the second trial, there were three strokes in the placebo group compared with none in the tranexamic acid group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, because the CIs for intracranial haemorrhage, death and ischaemic lesion outcomes are so wide, the quality of this evidence is low. Furthermore, the patients in the trials had extra-cranial bleeding in addition to intra-cranial bleeding. Because tranexamic acid reduces mortality in extra-cranial bleeding (CRASH-2), the mortality reduction seen in this trial could be from the extra-cranial injury rather than any effect on the brain injury. The effect of tranexamic acid on intracranial haemorrhage and thrombotic adverse effects, including stroke, remains uncertain.</p><p id="Par25">There are three ongoing randomised trials of tranexamic acid versus placebo in patients with isolated TBI (NCT02645552, NCT01990768, NCT01402882). These will evaluate the effect of tranexamic acid on death, disability, vascular occlusive events and other adverse events in TBI. The ongoing trials will inform whether tranexamic acid can be given to those with TBI. To date, the CRASH-3 trial, with a planned sample size of 13,000 patients, will be the largest randomised trial into the effect of tranexamic acid in TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The results from the three ongoing trials should provide clinicians with information about whether tranexamic acid is effective in reducing death and disability without increasing thrombotic events. The trials will also provide information about whether its effect varies by time to treatment.</p><p id="Par26">However, these trials will not provide information about the mechanism by which tranexamic acid might exert its effects in TBI. If tranexamic acid reduces mortality by reducing intracranial haemorrhage, we would expect there to be less blood on head CT scans of tranexamic acid-treated patients, particularly those treated soon after injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. If tranexamic acid increases the risk of cerebral ischaemia, we would expect to see more ischaemic lesions in tranexamic acid-treated patients, particularly in those treated after a more prolonged period following injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The CRASH-3 Intracranial Bleeding Mechanistic Sub-Study (CRASH-3 IBMS) will examine the effect of tranexamic acid on intracranial haemorrhage and cerebral ischaemia in a cohort of patients enrolled in the CRASH-3 trial.

This method assumes haematoma volume is approximately equal to an ellipsoid shape (i.e., three dimensional oval shape). For ease of assessment, the formula for calculating the volume of an ellipsoid (4/3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;&#x003c0;&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;(A/2)&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;(B/2)&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;(C/2)) can be simplified to ABC/2 if we assume &#x003c0; is equal to 3. This method selects a representative slice near the centre of the haematoma on which the bleed is most visible. On this slice, two measurements are taken: (A) the maximal diameter; (B) width perpendicular to A. For the measurement of depth, the maximal number of slices on which the haematoma is visible is multiplied by slice thickness (C). These three measurements are multiplied and the sum divided by two (ABC/2) to provide the volume measurement in cm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p id="Par43">Whilst some researchers have found that the ABC/2 method overestimates lesion volume compared to computer-assisted methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], others claim the opposite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Haemorrhagic lesions that have a regular shape are more accurately estimated using the ABC/2 method compared to lesions with irregular or multi-lobular shapes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Furthermore, a number of variations of the ABC/2 method adjust for the depth of a lesion. Whilst some have found that adjusting for depth significantly underestimates volumes because smaller slice volumes are eliminated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], others found that adjusting for depth is favourable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">Although the ABC/2 method is a less specific measure of haemorrhage volume and overestimation due to false positives would dilute the effect of the treatment towards the null, its low sensitivity and underestimation due to false negatives would not impact the effect of the treatment on haemorrhage. Furthermore, the more accurate method of estimating haemorrhage would have been more expensive and therefore administered in a smaller number of patients given the limited budget of a clinical trial. Although a more accurate method in a small trial would result in less measurement error, a less accurate method in a larger trial would result in less random error. We believe that the ABC/2 method is sufficiently accurate and therefore chose to use this method in a larger trial. Furthermore, the assessor rating the scans will be blind to treatment allocation and thus the bias from measurement error should be balanced between treatment groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Total haemorrhage volume</title><p id="Par45">The total haemorrhage volume on each scan will be calculated by totalling the volumes of intra-parenchymal, intra-ventricular, epidural and subdural haemorrhage.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Estimating intra-parenchymal, intra-ventricular and epidural haemorrhage volume using ABC/2</title><p id="Par46">Volume estimation of intracranial haemorrhage is aided by the characterisation of haematomas. The final shape of a haematoma is influenced by its location. Intra-axial (or intra-cerebral) haematomas include intra-parenchymal haematomas, which occur in the brain tissue, and intra-ventricular haematomas, which occur in the ventricles of the brain. These haematomas tend to have regular shapes that are clearly definable in every dimension (i.e., their length, width and depth can be measured on a CT scan). Extra-axial haematomas occur between the three membranes that surround the brain (dura mater, arachnoid mater and pia mater). Epidural haematomas are a type of extra-axial haematoma and occur between the skull and outer membrane of the central nervous system (dura mater). They have a clear shape that can be measured in every dimension. The ABC/2 method assumes the haemorrhage has an ellipsoid shape and has been validated in intra-parenchymal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], intra-ventricular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and epidural haematomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].

Subdural haematomas are crescent shaped as they follow the pattern of the brain&#x02019;s convexity. The exact limits of a subdural haematoma are not clearly definable in any dimension. This type of haemorrhage can theoretically occupy the entire subdural space. Given that the ABC/2 method assumes the haemorrhage has an ellipsoid shape, it would not provide an accurate volume estimation of subdural haemorrhage. Indeed, there have been reports of underestimation in subdural haemorrhage volume when using an adapted version of the ABC/2 method compared with computer-assisted volumetric analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p><p id="Par48">Some researchers and clinicians propose that it is more appropriate to estimate subdural haemorrhage volume using a formula which takes the difference between two spheres (representing the entire subdural space), divides by two (as subdural haemorrhage is usually unilateral) and divide by two again (as subdural haemorrhage tends to be thicker at the centre and thinner at the sides). This method has been tested at the Neurosurgical Trauma Unit at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham (UK) and has been shown to provide more clinically relevant estimates of haemorrhage volume than the ABC/2 method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Although this method overestimates subdural volume, it is less than the error provided by the ABC/2 method. The key measurement in determining the clinical significance of a subdural haemorrhage is its thickness (i.e., the B measurement when using the ABC/2 method) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. In the CRASH-3 IBMS, we will measure the maximum width of a subdural bleed, and compute its volume using the aforementioned formula.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Measurement of subarachnoid haemorrhage</title><p id="Par49">Subarachnoid bleeds are another type of extra-axial haemorrhage and occur in the area between the arachnoid membrane and the innermost membrane surrounding the brain (pia mater). The shape of the subarachnoid space resembles a spider&#x02019;s web and therefore haemorrhage in the subarachnoid space cannot be clearly measured in any dimension. Although there are a number of CT grading scales that include the characterisation of subarachnoid haemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], they are criticised for being subjective and not comprehensive enough to serve as a primary grading scale for this type of haemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. For example, the Fisher scale and its modified version do not consider subarachnoid haemorrhage in isolation but in combination with intraventricular haemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">In the CRASH-3 IBMS, the size of a subarachnoid haemorrhage will be characterised as small, medium or large. Each bleed will then be described as focal (localised to a specific location), multiple (not localised but not widespread) or diffuse (widespread). This method is also subjective and may have low sensitivity and specificity, therefore misclassification would bias the effect of the treatment towards the null value. We hope that, by using this method in a large trial, the bias from measurement error would be offset by a reduction in random error.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Petechial haemorrhage</title><p id="Par51">Petechial haemorrhage manifests as a very small dot on a CT scan.

However, given that clinical scans are performed for diagnostic purposes, it is not possible to carry out scans at set time points post-randomisation. Brain imaging techniques, including MRI diffusion weighted imaging, have higher sensitivity and specificity compared to CT in the early diagnosis of ischaemic infarction, and are often clinically warranted when there is a suspected stroke. Therefore, the assessor will examine all available brain scans performed within 28&#x000a0;days of randomisation and the accompanying radiology reports for evidence of focal ischaemic lesions and record the time from randomisation to detection.</p><p id="Par54">Furthermore, given that CT imaging is the first and most common neuroimaging examination performed for emergency assessment of suspected acute haemorrhage and stroke around the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], the majority of scans included in the CRASH-3 IBMS will be CT scans. Therefore, it is important to clarify how we will capture this endpoint when only CT scans are available. Cerebral infarction manifests as wedge-shaped low attenuation on a CT scan. Given that oedema also manifests as low attenuation on CT, the radiology reports that accompany CT scans should indicate whether the low attenuation is representative of oedema or infarction. Brain imaging reports often refer to cerebral infarction by the affected vascular territory (e.g., anterior cerebral artery, middle cerebral artery, posterior cerebral artery, lacunar, cerebellar, brainstem). The assessor will examine all available brain imaging to assess whether oedema or infarction can be excluded given the appearance of earlier scans. For example, some patients have oedematous haemorrhagic lesions, which on CT manifests as high density haemorrhage surrounded by low density oedema. In later scans the haemorrhage may resolve but the oedema may remain. If only considered alone, the later CT scan may have the appearance of infarction but could be representative of residual oedema. We will attempt to minimise such errors by comparing the appearance of cerebral infarction/oedema between consecutive scans, and consider the accompanying scan reports for radiological opinion. If the available scans and accompanying reports are unable to confirm the presence of an ischaemic lesion, we would seek further radiological and clinical opinion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Outcome measurement: mass effect and other CT endpoints</title><p id="Par55">Space-occupying intracranial lesions can displace brain tissue.

We hope that this trial will provide information about the mechanism of action of tranexamic acid in isolated TBI. An understanding of the mechanism of action of tranexamic acid and insight into factors that might affect this mechanism, is critical in the appropriate generalisation of trial results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. If patients who receive tranexamic acid have less intracranial bleeding on their CT scans compared to those who receive placebo, this information, along with the results of the main CRASH-3 trial, could inform the administration of tranexamic acid in TBI. If TBI patients who receive tranexamic acid soon after injury have less haemorrhage expansion compared to those who receive tranexamic later, then time between injury and treatment is a factor relevant to the mechanism of action which, with the results of the main CRASH-3 trial, should be considered when making treatment decisions. Furthermore, if we find evidence of cerebral ischaemia in patients who receive tranexamic acid and the effect varies by time to treatment, this information can be used to prevent adverse outcomes and ensure those receiving tranexamic acid are those most likely to benefit from it. Therefore, the knowledge gained from the nested CRASH-3 IBMS will add to the evidence base and could benefit the clinical management of patients with head injuries.</p><p id="Par75">Furthermore, the patients included in the CRASH-3 IBMS are likely to have more severe head injuries compared to patients in the CRASH-3 trial but not included in the CRASH-3 IBMS. The patients in the sub-study are not a random sample of patients in the CRASH-3 trial, nor will they be comparable. It is not necessary for the sub-study population to be representative of the CRASH-3 trial population because knowledge about a causal mechanism facilitates generalisation and not representativeness of the trial patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. If the sub-study used a random sample of patients from the CRASH-3 trial, the results would not necessarily apply to either more or less severe patients, but only to a hypothetical patient of average injury severity. Representativeness of trial patients does not help us to generalise our findings to other TBI patients. Knowledge about whether tranexamic acid reduces intracranial bleeding or increases cerebral ischaemia will inform the administration of tranexamic acid in TBI and allow us to appropriately generalise the trial results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Potential dangers of CRASH-3 IBMS: power and alternative mechanisms leading to death in TBI</title><p id="Par76">The CRASH-3 trial and CRASH-3 IBMS are based on the premise that intracranial haemorrhage is the mechanism that leads to death in patients with TBI. We hypothesise that tranexamic acid will reduce intracranial haemorrhage, which will in turn reduce the risk of death and disability. We assume that, by inhibiting fibrinolysis, tranexamic acid increases blood viscosity, reduces blood flow and slows the rate of haemorrhage (Poiseuille&#x02019;s Law [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]). However, it is possible that tranexamic acid does reduce intracranial haemorrhage but the CRASH-3 IBMS might not have sufficient power to detect such an effect. Our sample size calculation is based on a specific difference in haemorrhage volume between treatment groups. If receiving tranexamic acid results in a smaller reduction in haemorrhage volume than we have assumed, the CRASH-3 IBMS might not detect it and we may falsely conclude that tranexamic acid does not reduce intracranial haemorrhage. This is a limitation of conducting this nested sub-study in a smaller population of the main trial population. There is a trade-off between a larger sample, which would allow us to detect a smaller treatment effect and time, and resources; therefore, we have estimated a realistic sample size based on the best available evidence in this area.</p><p id="Par77">Furthermore, if tranexamic acid reduces intracranial haemorrhage in TBI patients and this is detected by the CRASH-3 IBMS, it is still possible that clinical outcomes may not improve. This could be because intracranial haemorrhage is not the mechanism that leads to death in TBI patients. It is also possible that the potential benefit of tranexamic acid in reducing intracranial haemorrhage may be offset by the increased risk of cerebral ischaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], particularly when administered several hours after injury when there is an increased risk of thrombotic disseminated intravascular coagulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

These committees approved the CRASH-3 IBMS to be conducted at the Royal London Hospital (London), Queen Elizabeth Hospital (Birmingham), University Hospital (Coventry) and Salford Royal Hospital (Salford), and in additional sites yet to be confirmed. The Royal London Hospital (London), Queen Elizabeth Hospital (Birmingham), University Hospital (Coventry) and Salford Royal Hospital (Salford) have provided local approvals and letters of access for the CRASH-3 IBMS to be conducted at their respective sites. All relevant local ethical approvals will be gained from additional sites.</p><p id="Par88">Favourable ethical opinion was received from the Observational/Interventions Research Ethics Committee at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine on 24 May 2016 (Reference 11535; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>). Important protocol modifications will be submitted to and reviewed by the Medical Research and Ethics Committee and Health Research Authority, and registries updated as appropriate.</p><p id="Par89">TBI patients are physically and mentally incapable of providing informed consent to participate in a clinical trial. As acknowledged in the Declaration of Helsinki, patients who are incapable of giving consent are an exception to the general rule of informed consent in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. In the CRASH-3 trial, patients are unable to provide consent and so consent is sought from the patient&#x02019;s relative, legal representative or the responsible clinician. If and when the patient regains capacity to provide informed consent, they are informed about the trial and written consent sought to continue their participation in the trial. If a patient or patient representative declines consent, they are withdrawn from the trial. For patients who were included in the trial but did not regain capacity, written informed consent is sought from a relative or legal representative. The requirements of relevant local and national ethics committees are adhered to at all times.</p><p id="Par90">The CRASH-3 trial includes consent to extract data from patient medical records. Collecting CT scan data for the CRASH-3 IBMS is consistent with the consent procedure used in the CRASH-3 trial. It would be impractical to re-consent patients or relatives/legal representatives to access CT scans, particularly for patients who have deceased or are disabled as a result of their injuries where re-consent would be distressing and unwelcome. The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and national Ethics Committees extended their approvals to extract CT data from the CRASH-3 trial without further patient consent. Patients who withdrew from the main CRASH-3 trial would not be included in the CRASH-3 IBMS.</p></sec><sec id="FPar15"><title>Consent for publication</title><p id="Par91">Not applicable.</p></sec><sec id="FPar16"><title>Competing interests</title><p id="Par92">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec id="FPar17"><title>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</title><p id="Par93">Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></sec></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hyder</surname><given-names>AA</given-names></name><name><surname>Wunderlich</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name><name><surname>Puvanachandra</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Gururaj</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Kobusingye</surname><given-names>OC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The impact of traumatic brain injuries: a global perspective</article-title><source>NeuroRehabilitation</source><year>2007</year><volume>22</volume><issue>5</issue><fpage>341</fpage><lpage>53</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18162698</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hancock</surname><given-names>CBHJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The global burden of traumatic brain injury: preliminary results from the Global Burden of Disease Project</article-title><source>Inj Prev</source><year>2010</year><volume>16</volume><fpage>A17</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/ip.2010.029215.61</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bruns</surname><given-names>J</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name><name><surname>Hauser</surname><given-names>WA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The epidemiology of traumatic brain injury: a review</article-title><source>Epilepsia</source><year>2003</year><volume>44</volume><issue>Suppl 10</issue><fpage>2</fpage><lpage>10</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1046/j.1528-1157.44.s10.3.x</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14511388</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><label>4.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Berkner</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Mannix</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Qiu</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clinical traumatic brain injury in the preclinical setting</article-title><source>Methods Mol Biol</source><year>2016</year><volume>1462</volume><fpage>11</fpage><lpage>28</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1007/978-1-4939-3816-2_2</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">27604710</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR5"><label>5.</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bunch</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Jennifer</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><source>Information and Resources Column.
