<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> in contrast to what was observed in adolescents after 20 min of aerobic exercise performed on a cycle ergometer at 60% of maximum heart rate (HR<sub>max</sub>).<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Cognitive performance after acute exercise seems to be dependent on the intensity.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In the meta-analysis of Chang et al.,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> the studies that used low intensity, &#x0003c;50% of HR<sub>max</sub>, had a negative effect on cognitive performance. On the other hand, in studies with intensities &#x0003e;64% of HR<sub>max</sub>, the effects were positive.</p><p>A possible physiological hypothesis that may explain the acute effect of exercise intensity on the IC is increased cerebral blood flow generated by exercise effort, which can have an impact on post-exercise cognitive performance.<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In the study by Yanagisawa et al.,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> there was an increase in cerebral blood flow (&#x02191; oxygenated hemoglobin) in the PFC and improved performance in the Stroop test in young adults after 10 min of aerobic exercise at 50% of the peak oxygen consumption (peak VO<sub>2</sub>). The same effect was observed in similar experiments carried out with young adults after 20 min of exercise between 60% and 70% of HR<sub>max</sub>
<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and after 15 min of exercise at 40% of maximum load, respectively,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and in children after 20 min of aerobic exercise between 65% and 75% of HR<sub>max</sub>.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
</p><p>However, there is still a gap of knowledge whether a vigorous aerobic exercise session can improve the IC in adolescents, which may be important, as their PFC is still undergoing the maturation phase. It is a period of structural, functional<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and blood perfusion<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> changes. The study hypothesis is that the use of a prescription of aerobic exercise with control of the intensity, volume and other confounding factors associated with cognitive improvement by acute exercise, may favor the physiological brain mechanisms induced by exercise and influence the post-exercise IC performance, as shown in children<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and young adults.<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the acute effect of vigorous aerobic exercise on the IC in adolescents. The intensity and volume of the exercise were prescribed according to vigorous exercise recommendations for adolescents from the World Health Organization<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and according to the best effect obtained by meta-analysis of Chang et al.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Other control factors, such as time of the exercise and the time interval to apply the post-exercise cognitive test, were also supported by the meta-analysis of Chang et al.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>

This test was performed in an indoor sports court (between 7 and 10 h) and consists of racing back and forth at a distance of 20 meters. The velocity was controlled by a metronome audio. The initial velocity was 8.5 km/h, followed by increments of 0.5 km/h at every one-minute stage. Heart rate (HR) was monitored throughout the test by a heart rate monitor (Beurer<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Germany). HR<sub>max</sub> was considered as the highest HR attained during the test, valid only when signs of intense effort were observed.<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Subjects were verbally motivated to endure as long as possible.

</p><p>The resting heart rate (HRrest) was measured with the subject at rest in the supine position for 5 min. It was considered the lowest HR obtained. The HR reserve (HRR) was the difference between HR<sub>max</sub> and HRrest (HRR=HR<sub>max</sub> &#x02212; HRrest). To determine the HR-target for exercise prescription, we used the percentage of HRR. The percentage of HRR was added to HRrest to determine the HR-target in exercise: HR-target = (%intensity (in decimal) &#x000d7; HRR) + HRrest.<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
</p><p>On a different day of the exercise session, subjects were familiarized with exercise intensity and how to stay on the HR-target. At the exercise session, a warm-up of 5min was performed through walking, followed by 20min of running at vigorous intensity (65-75% of HRR) and 5 min of cooling down, totaling 30 min. The HR was monitored throughout the session by a heart rate monitor (Beurer<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Germany), so that the participant remained in the HR-target. In addition to the individual control of the participants themselves, according to the guidelines given during the familiarization session, the HR was monitored and recorded every 3min. If necessary, verbal directions were provided to adjust the intensity. The exercise was performed on the beach sand (wet sand, low tide and flat terrain), with the subjects barefoot. The sessions were carried out between 7 and 10 AM with a temperature and air humidity between 26-30 &#x000b0;C and 52%-74%, respectively.</p><p>During the control session, the subjects remained seated for 30 min in the school computer lab watching an age-appropriate cartoon (Kung Fu Panda).

The test was applied before and after 10 min of each session. The instrument has three Phases, the first two congruent and the last one incongruent. The index and middle fingers of the right hand remained on the left (&#x02190;) and right (&#x02192;) arrow keys, respectively, which were activated according to each stimulus. In stage 1, rectangles in green, blue, black and red were individually shown in the center of the monitor. In the lower corners of the monitor, answers corresponding or not to the rectangle color were exhibited until the participant responded to the attempt by pressing the keys &#x02190; or &#x02192;. In stage 2, both stimuli and responses were shown as words, always in white color. The response was considered correct when the stimulus and response coincided. Finally, in stage 3, the word of one of the four colors was exhibited in incompatible color. The subject was instructed to press the key corresponding to the color of the word and inhibit the response to the word identity. At all stages the stimuli were presented automatically and randomly, 12 attempts per stage. The reaction time (RT) in milliseconds (ms) and the number of errors (<italic>n</italic>) made at each stage were recorded.</p><p>The Statistical procedures were performed with SPSS for Win/v.19.0 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences, Chicago, IL, USA) and G* Power version 3.1.9.2 (Institute for Experimental Psychology in Dusseldorf, Germany).

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study investigated the acute effect of vigorous aerobic exercise on the IC in adolescents. The main findings suggest that vigorous aerobic exercise acutely enhances the performance of the IC, as there was an improvement on the Stroop interference (inhibition of response) observed by the decrease in the RT of the incongruent phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>), with a focal effect considered large (<italic>r</italic>=0.75), accompanied by a smaller number of errors made (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>). These results can be very important to elucidate the influence of exercise on the IC efficiency and, therefore, contribute to the process of learning in the school environment.<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</p><p>The influence that exercise promoted on IC performance is in accordance with the evidence from studies carried out with children<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and young healthy adults.<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> As exercise intensity is an important factor to enhance post-exercise cognitive performance,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> this study adopted a vigorous exercise protocol, which in addition to being recommended by the World Health Organization for adolescents,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> would be adequate to induce the physiological mechanisms responsible for favoring the cognitive performance.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> For instance, in a meta-analysis, the intensity of the exercise had a significant influence so that the prescribed exercise &#x0003c;50% of HR<sub>max</sub> resulted in a significant negative effect (<italic>d</italic>=&#x02212;0.113) on cognitive performance, but when prescribed at 64-76% or 77-93% of the HR<sub>max</sub>, the results were positive, with an effect of 0.202 and 0.268, respectively.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
</p><p>In addition to exercise intensity, other controlled factors may have been equally important for the exercise to favor the cognitive benefits, including the volume and time of the exercise, as well as the time interval for the implementation of the post-exercise cognitive test. In this sense, the exercise volume was also adjusted according to the recommendations of the World Health Organization<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> on the volume of vigorous exercise for adolescents and, as other studies have shown, resulting in cognitive benefits after 20 min of aerobic exercise in children<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and young adults.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</p><p>The time interval to apply the cognitive test was defined between 10 and 20 min post-exercise, according to the best effect size obtained by the meta-analysis of Chang et al.,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> in which this control factor was considered a primary moderator of cognitive benefits. For instance, Chang et al.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> categorized the time to apply the cognitive tests in 0-10 min; 11-20 min or &#x0003e;20 min after the exercise and obtained an effect size of &#x02212;0.060, 0.262 and 0.171 respectively. That is, the post-exercise application time significantly influenced the effect size. The positive effects were observed only after 11 min post-exercise.</p><p>The statistical findings of the meta-analysis by Chang et al.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> on the time interval for the application of the post-exercise cognitive tests is consistent with reticular-activating hypofrontality model proposed by Dietrich and Audiffren,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> which suggests a decrease in brain activation in regions not directly associated with physical exercise (i.e., PFC) to supply directly associated regions. Corroborating this understanding, the study by Wang et al.<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> showed a decline in IC performance during vigorous aerobic exercise, which could influence IC efficiency immediately after the exercise. Thus, these studies and this theoretical model agree with the need for a time interval between the end of the exercise and the beginning of a cognitive task for homeostasis to occur at the brain level, more specifically in the PFC.</p><p>Our data show that aerobic exercise seems to have been a tool capable of acutely influencing the physiological mechanisms responsible for favoring IC performance. The mechanisms are still somewhat controversial and little explored, but the main physiological hypothesis that could explain these effects refer to the increase in cerebral blood flow, which can influence cognitive performance after exercise.<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> For instance, Yanagisawa et al.,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), evaluated the cortical activation during Stroop test performed before and after 10 min of aerobic exercise at 50% of peak VO<sub>2</sub> in 20 young adults. In fact, there was increased blood flow from the lateral PFC in both hemispheres (&#x02191;oxygenated hemoglobin) due to Stroop interference (incongruence). In contrast, this activation was significantly increased in the left dorsolateral PFC and coincided with improved performance on the cognitive task (&#x02193;RT).</p><p>As secondary analysis, we demonstrated an association of &#x00394;RT of the incongruent phase (stage 3) of the exercise condition with chronological age (<italic>r</italic>
<sup>2</sup>=0.404) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). That is, post-exercise IC improvement was reduced in older age groups. The regression analysis shows that 40.4% of the variability found in post-exercise IC performance can be explained by chronological age. In this sense, due to evidence that one of the physiological mechanisms responsible for the improvement of post-exercise IC can be increased cerebral blood flow,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> the variability in &#x00394; can be related to the maturation of the cerebral perfusion mechanism during adolescence.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Notably, Satterthwaite et al.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> observed a significant impact of puberty on cerebral perfusion development. The authors evaluated the cerebral blood flow of 922 young individuals aged eight to 22 years and found that, during adolescence, the brain flow throughout the cortex decreases considerably, including in the PFC. The cerebral blood flow of the middle gray matter undergoes a sharp decline in late childhood and early adolescence until about 16-18 years, followed by a slight increase during early adulthood.</p><p>Although original this study has limitations, one of which is the fact that it did not assess the IC performance combined with a neuroimaging technique, which could promote greater support in confirming the evidence. Nevertheless, several studies have confirmed that acute aerobic exercise can improve IC at the macroneural level, as it promotes significant impact on PFC brain activity during IC task making after 10-20 min of aerobic exercise in children<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and young adults.<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>

<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</p><p>The use of sexual maturation self-assessment procedure to distinguish the pre-puberty and puberty as an inclusion criterion is also considered a limiting factor. The evaluation by visual inspection by a trained evaluator is the most reliable indirect method.<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> However, it can be justified that the sample consisted mostly of adolescents at the pubertal stage.<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In the study by Rasmussen et al.,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> carried out with 898 children and adolescents, the self-assessment of sexual maturation showed to be a sufficiently accurate technique to simply differentiate simples between prepubertal and pubertal stages. Breast stage was correctly assessed by 44.9% of the girls (<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>=0.28; <italic>r</italic>=0.74; <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and the genital stage by 54.7% of boys (<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>=0.33; <italic>r</italic>=0.61; <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). Pubic hair was correctly assessed by 66.8% of girls (<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>=0.55; <italic>r</italic>=0.80; <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and 66.1% of boys (<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>=0.46; <italic>r</italic>=0.70; <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).</p><p>It is noteworthy that this study is a pioneer in investigating the acute effects of vigorous aerobic exercise on IC in adolescents and contributes to elucidate the effects of aerobic exercise in this population, which have an executive control performance<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and brain functions, structures<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and perfusion<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> still undergoing maturation. Additionally, the study had the premise of controlling the possible variables, such as the equal number of adolescents of both genders, obtaining the HR<sub>max</sub> through a maximal effort progressive running test, the intensity and volume of the experimental condition exercise, the time of physical exercise, the use of a computerized cognitive test that records the performance in milliseconds, and the time for application of the post-exercise cognitive test. Therefore, the study may provide subsidies for the applicability of this aerobic exercise protocol in the school context.<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
</p><p>In conclusion, a vigorous aerobic session performed for 20 min seems to promote improvement in IC capacity in adolescents. Additionally, the effect of exercise on the IC performance was associated with chronological age. This demonstrates that the benefits of exercise were reduced in older age groups. As practical implications, the findings of this study contribute to justify the inclusion of physical education classes during school hours, that is, among the other school subjects (i.e., Portuguese and mathematics), as well as the inclusion of a physically active interval/recess, as 20 min of vigorous aerobic exercise can favor the IC efficiency and therefore contribute to learning improvement after 10 min of post-exercise recovery.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>
