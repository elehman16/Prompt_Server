Internationally a major focus on understanding variations in cancer outcomes has been later presentation to healthcare and later diagnosis. Approaches to reducing time to diagnosis of symptomatic cancer include public symptom awareness campaigns and interventions in primary care to improve early cancer detection. This paper reports the protocol of a factorial cluster-randomised trial of community and general practice (GP) level interventions to reduce the time to diagnosis of cancer in rural Western Australia (WA).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The community intervention is a symptom awareness campaign tailored for rural Australians delivered through a community engagement model. The GP intervention includes a resource card with symptom risk assessment charts and local referral pathways implemented through multiple academic detailing visits and case studies. Participants are eligible if recently diagnosed with breast, colorectal, lung or prostate cancer who reside in specific regions of rural WA with a planned sample size of 1350. The primary outcome is the Total Diagnostic Interval, defined as the duration from first symptom (or date of cancer screening test) to cancer diagnosis. Secondary outcomes include cancer stage, healthcare utilisation, disease-free status, survival at 2 and 5&#x02005;years and cost-effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethics approval has been granted by the University of Western Australia and from all relevant hospital recruitment sites in WA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Results of this trial will be reported in peer-reviewed publications and in conference presentations.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR).

<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> International research suggests that the time taken to appraise symptoms and seek help (so-called &#x02018;patient delay&#x02019;) and management in primary care are also key determinants of cancer outcomes.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Time to diagnosis is associated with poorer survival for several common cancers.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>One of the approaches to reducing later presentation to healthcare has been community symptom awareness campaigns. These have formed a major component of the UK National Awareness and Early Diagnosis Initiative (NAEDI) as part of the policy to improve cancer outcomes.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> A systematic review of cancer symptom awareness campaigns published in 2009 found insufficient evidence about their effect on presentation to healthcare.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Since then further studies have begun to show potential effects on presentation and cancer diagnoses.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>A second approach has aimed at improving early recognition of patients in primary care with symptoms suggestive of cancer. A major challenge for general practitioners (GPs) is that the symptoms of many cancers are common in the community and overlap with prevalent benign conditions. GPs need to assess the risk, or diagnostic probability, of an underlying cancer and determine whether further investigation is justified. Until recently, there was little epidemiological evidence demonstrating how well symptoms predict risk of an underlying cancer from primary care populations.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Analysis of data in case&#x02013;control studies using large UK general practice databases, notably the CAPER (Cancer Prediction in Exeter) studies<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;22</xref> and QCancer research,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> has led to significant advances in our understanding of the epidemiology of cancer symptoms in primary care.</p><p>The CAPER studies have quantified the risk of individual and paired symptoms, signs and primary care investigations for a number of cancers including colorectal, lung and prostate. These have been evaluated as risk assessment tools (RATs) in paper versions<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and are currently undergoing evaluation as computerised decision support tools embedded in the electronic medical records of English general practices.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Various interventions including audit and feedback, educational visits, guidelines and decision support have been tested in general practice to improve cancer diagnosis.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> None of the 22 trials included in a systematic review of interventions to support cancer diagnosis in primary care examined effects on diagnostic delay, although audit and feedback was shown to improve clinical management.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>Conducting research in the field of &#x02018;diagnostic delay&#x02019; in cancer has many methodological challenges. The Aarhus statement discusses these and provides consensus guidelines on appropriate definitions and the conduct and reporting of such research.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> One recommendation is the application of theoretical models such as The Model of Pathways to Treatment<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014006156F1">figure 1</xref>). This model proposes four key intervals:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The Appraisal Interval: The nature of a person's symptoms is one of the most important factors determining the duration of the Appraisal Interval. Misattribution of symptoms either to a previous benign or concurrent condition or non-recognition of the seriousness of symptoms contribute to longer Appraisal Intervals.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The Help-Seeking Interval: Various factors may contribute to this interval including patient factors such as competing events (eg, holidays), and emotional ones such as fear. This includes fear of the consultation and examination, or of the diagnosis and treatment. Access to primary care and sanctioning help-seeking by family or friends, so that patients do not perceive themselves as wasting the doctor's time, are also important factors.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p></list-item><list-item><p>The Diagnostic Interval: Depending on the healthcare setting this may involve a series of healthcare visits, referrals and investigations and often represents a complex process. System factors including the role of primary care as a gatekeeper and access to investigations and specialist care are key factors determining this interval.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The Pre-Treatment Interval: The time from formal cancer diagnosis to initiation of treatment is also strongly influenced by several healthcare system factors such as access to staging investigations and specialised treatments.</p></list-item></list></p><fig id="BMJOPEN2014006156F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Model of pathways to treatment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2014006156f01"/></fig><p>Our research on rural cancer outcomes is applying the well-established Medical Research Council (MRC) methodological framework for the design and evaluation of complex interventions.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Our initial exploratory mixed-methods study aimed to explore the context of rural cancer diagnosis in WA and inform the development of our complex intervention. In summary, in-depth interviews with 66 people recently diagnosed with breast, lung, prostate or colorectal cancer from regional WA found longer duration of symptom appraisal for colorectal cancer compared with other cancers. Participants defined core characteristics of rural Australians as optimism, stoicism and machismo. These features, as well as poorer access to healthcare, contributed to later presentation of cancer.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In addition, there were significant overall differences between cancers in terms of time from presentation in general practice to referral, from GP referral to specialist appointment, and from specialist appointment to cancer diagnosis. These differences were due to the nature of presenting symptoms, access to diagnostic tests and multiple visits to specialists. Breast cancer was diagnosed more quickly because its symptoms are more specific and well recognised by the community, and due to better access to diagnostic tests and specialist one-stop clinics.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>These findings contributed to the development of the interventions and design of the Improving Rural Cancer Outcomes (IRCO) Trial: a factorial cluster-randomised controlled trial of community-based and general practice-based interventions which aims to reduce the time to diagnosis in rural patients presenting with prostate, breast, colorectal or lung cancer in Western Australia.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and trial design</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design and setting</title><p>This 2&#x000d7;2 factorial cluster randomised controlled trial is set in Western Australia, the largest Australian state geographically, with a population of 2.29 million (approximately 10% of the Australian population). Two-thirds of the WA population live in metropolitan Perth and the remainder are widely geographically dispersed. Two Trial Areas were matched for population size, demographics including age and Aboriginality, and similar cancer incidence, based on the most recent available data (from 2006) when the trial was planned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014006156F2">figure 2</xref> presents more recent data on population size from 2010).

In both Trial Areas general practices have been randomised to receive the education intervention or control, stratified by practice size (&#x02264;1&#x02005;GP; 2 to 4&#x02005;GPs; 5+ GPs). GPs who worked at more than one practice have been identified, and their practices have been treated as one practice for the purpose of randomisation to avoid contamination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014006156F3">figure 3</xref>).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2014006156F3" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>The 2&#x000d7;2 factorial cluster randomised controlled trial design.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2014006156f03"/></fig><p>Practices have been randomly assigned to intervention or control arm using a cluster version of Zelen's method of postrandomised consent: intervention practices have been invited to receive the educational package while control practices receive no information about the trial.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> This enables non-intervention practices to act as true controls by minimising the Hawthorne effect in a situation where placebo and double blind experimental conditions are impossible to achieve. The Hawthorne effect occurs when the researchers&#x02019; procedures and communications act as interventions in themselves that change behaviours, such as if the control cluster were to adopt the practices or policies promoted to the intervention cluster. This would destroy the trial's ability to identify a benefit of the intervention, if one exists. Furthermore, it allows a pragmatic delivery of the intervention and measure of its uptake in routine practice. Intervention practices which decline the invitation to receive the educational package will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Randomisation has been performed by the trial statistician. As the number of working GPs in a given practice varies, the randomisation has taken into account practice size. Each practice has been categorised into: one GP in the practice, 2&#x02013;4&#x02005;GPs or five or more GPs. A random sample proportional to the size of the practice has been used employing &#x02018;<italic>samplepps</italic>&#x02019; macro in Stata.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Patient recruitment and inclusion criteria</title><p>From 1 March 2012, 4&#x02005;months after the interventions started, all patients meeting the following criteria are being invited to contribute their data for the trial:

Feedback was obtained about the campaign logo, design, choice of images, locally acceptable language, and contact details. The campaign is named the Find Cancer Early campaign and the materials explicitly use the Cancer Council WA branding, recognising the strong community support and credibility of this organisation. Community members wanted the campaign to focus on the positives associated with early detection and the use of simple, non-medical terms when describing symptoms. A campaign message development meeting was then held between the project team, social marketing experts and health professionals to develop a framework for the campaign and message hierarchy.</p><p>The target of the campaign is men and women over the age of 40; it aims to raise awareness of the symptoms of bowel, lung, prostate and breast cancer and to help people overcome the barriers to seeking medical help.

For screen-detected cases we use the date of attendance for the screening test as the initial date in the patient pathway. Date of diagnosis is based on pathological diagnosis as reported to the WA Cancer Registry. We will divide the Total Diagnostic Interval further to include time from first presentation in general practice to referral (GP Interval), date of referral to first attendance at specialist (Specialist Access Interval), and time from first attendance at the specialist to date of diagnosis (Specialist Interval).<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> The GP Interval includes the time taken to order and respond to investigations available directly in primary care.

The survey is being conducted on a random sample of adults above 40&#x02005;years old from the campaign regions and control regions stratified by sex and age, and regions within Trial Area A. Questions measure exposure to the campaign, including unprompted and prompted awareness of campaign elements (ie, radio, print and campaign brand and logos). Respondents reporting any exposure to the campaign are asked additional questions about comprehension and perceived effectiveness.</p></sec><sec id="s3b3"><title>Measures of clinical outcomes</title><p>We will use the WA data sets<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> to provide linked hospital morbidity and administrative, cancer diagnostic and mortality data in order to examine trends across time on clinical outcomes at the level of the community and individual. We will obtain these data in three tranches:

Simple analyses such as t tests or more complex regression analyses will be undertaken. Time data are invariably skewed and bounded by the absence of negative times. We will apply a log transformation prior to conducting general linear modelling to compare intervals accounting for exposure to the community and GP interventions within the model, accounting for clustering effects at the practice level. Where appropriate, comparisons of arithmetic or geometric means will be performed. The aim of statistical modelling is to identify the main factors that explain variation in the outcome for example, patient and practice characteristics. The primary aim is to adjust for the effect of covariates before the effect of the intervention is tested as well as &#x02018;intervention &#x000d7; phase&#x02019; interaction with premeasurements and postmeasurements comparison. We will conduct a series of sensitivity analyses to account for:
<list list-type="alpha-upper"><list-item><p>Symptoms reported with a duration of greater than 2&#x02005;years which will be excluded from the primary analysis.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Vague first symptoms such as fatigue and &#x02018;feeling different&#x02019;.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Using cancer registry, hospital morbidity and death data we will compare patterns of hospitalisation and treatment, pseudostaging at diagnosis using established methods where full staging data are not available,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>

The comparisons will relate to patients diagnosed with one of the four target cancers in the 6&#x02005;years prior to the interventions (2005&#x02013;2010) and during the 2&#x02005;years of intervention (late 2011&#x02014;late 2013). This will enable the effects of the community-level intervention to be evaluated as a spatial contrast. The same analyses will be conducted after 5&#x02005;years of follow-up. These analyses will entail all patients with cancer in WA during the specific time periods to assess the effects of the community intervention. In addition, we will conduct analyses of all participants who have given their consent to measure the effects of exposure to the GP intervention and combined effect of community and GP interventions on clinical outcomes at 2 and 5&#x02005;years.</p><p>All analyses will be conducted by trial statisticians blinded to participant allocation.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Health economic evaluation</title><p>A health economic evaluation from a health system perspective will be undertaken to determine whether the resources committed to the trial between the four intervention arms represent a worthwhile investment in terms of the measured outcomes. This will include a cost-analysis of each intervention and a cost-effectiveness analysis which will compare costs with related outcomes. Cost components include: campaign intervention costs (eg, staffing, travel, campaign resources, media, events, in-kind support); GP intervention costs (eg, staffing, travel, education programme, resources); additional staff costs; non-intended costs of non-cancer diagnoses (hospital utilisation); in-kind personnel contributions from project partners. Resource units and cost per unit will be applied to calculate total cost.</p><p>Outcome data will be matched to cost data. In the first instance, cost per change in TDI will be calculated for each of the four arms of the trial. Longer term cost-effectiveness will also be calculated to estimate net cost per life year gained for each intervention. The TDI will provide a surrogate outcome for longer term outcomes using modelling techniques. Once longer term follow-up data are available, cost-effectiveness ratios will be calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Sample size</title><p>The original sample size required for 80% power and &#x003b1;=0.05 to detect a halving of long-delay risk of 30% to 15% was 840 participants.

We have achieved approximately a 50% accrual rate into the trial which was much higher than our original estimates. Our final estimated recruitment is 1359 participants. Based on the distributions of TDIs from our previous research, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> this sample will provide 80% power to detect a 10% difference in TDI between intervention groups for all four cancers combined, and a 20% difference in TDI for breast, colorectal and prostate cancer separately, but not lung cancer as this would require a sample of 2600 participants.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e377" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-006156.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the following for their contributions to this trial: Find Cancer Early Project Officers (Lisa Barr, Pam Foulkes-Taylor, Libby Foster, Karen Hansen, Amanda Harding, Kerryn Keating, Tracey Price, Jo Woodall), Cancer Council WA staff and associated staff, Cancer Council WA Lodges, participants, GPs and Hospital specialists, Cancer Research UK, AH Crawford Treatment Society, Department of Health WA, WA Cancer and Palliative Care Network, WA Country Health Service, National Health and Medical Research Council, Cancer and Palliative Care Research and Evaluation Unit, Val Lishman Health Research Foundation, WA Cancer Registry Staff, WA Data Linkage Branch, Pat Booth, Rhonda Coleman, Hooi Ee, Dickon Hayne, Laura Keith, Andrew Kirke, Mike Mears, Leanne Monterosso, Violet Platt, Iain Steve Pratt, David Preen, Babu Simon, Craig Sinclair, Hayley Staples, Simon Towler, Clare Willix.
