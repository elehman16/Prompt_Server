However, whether 5-HT6R is involved in the development of vascular dementia (VD) remains unclear. To evaluate the role and mechanism of 5-HT6R in VD, this study established a rat VD model to evaluate the effect of selective 5-HT6R agonist on the expression of 5-HT6R mRNA and neurotransmitter.</p></sec><sec><title>Material/Methods</title><p>Eighty healthy male SD rats (7 weeks old) were randomly assigned to sham, model, 5-HT6R agonist, and placebo groups (N=20 each). A rat VD model was generated by permeant bilateral ligation of the common carotid artery. 5-HT6R agonist, placebo, or saline were given intraperitoneally for 4 weeks. The Morris water maze was utilized to test learning and memory function. Brains were extracted to separate the cortex and hippocampal tissues, in which glutamate and &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels were analyzed. mRNA and protein levels of 5-HT6R were determined by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Model rats had longer escape latency and fewer crossing platform times.

The prevalence of VD increases linearly with age and varies greatly from country to country, ranging from 1.2% to 4.2% in people over 65 years old. It mainly manifested as impaired memory or cognitive functions, accompanied with motor, language, visual-spatial, and personality disorders [<xref rid="b3-medscimonit-23-818" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-medscimonit-23-818" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Its pathogenesis mechanism is related to neurodegeneration, apoptosis, or necrosis caused by ischemic brain damage [<xref rid="b5-medscimonit-23-818" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-medscimonit-23-818" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. No effective treatments are available in treating VD, during which neurotransmitter plays a critical role [<xref rid="b7-medscimonit-23-818" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-medscimonit-23-818" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Some studies showed lowered neurotransmitter levels in the hypothalamus, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus in the pathogenesis of VD, along with decreased neural activity [<xref rid="b9-medscimonit-23-818" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-medscimonit-23-818" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. VD is possibly related with decreased levels of monoamine and acetylcholine neurotransmitter in the cortex, as it can lead to dysfunctional release of various neurotransmitters, further affecting neural functions. 5-HT plays a critical role during the formation of memory and learning, and can bind with receptors and interact with other neurotransmitter receptors. Receptor subtypes include 5-HT1A, 5-HT6, and 5-HT2 [<xref rid="b11-medscimonit-23-818" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-medscimonit-23-818" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Among these, 5-HT receptor belongs to the G-protein-coupled superfamily, and is mainly expressed inside the brain, especially cognition-related regions such as the hippocampus and frontal cortex. 5-HT receptor agonists include non-selective agonists such as lysergide, and selective agonists such as EMDT. There are many choices for a 5HT6R-selective agonist, including SB-271046, SAM513, and SB-399885. Animal model research revealed the improvement of cognitive function by 5-HT6R agonist [<xref rid="b13-medscimonit-23-818" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14-medscimonit-23-818" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The receptor agonist and antagonist of 5HT6R are closely correlated with central nervous system levels of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine (Ach), dopamine (DA), glutamate (Glu), &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid (GABA), norepinephrine (NE), and epinephrine (E) through modulation or stimulation of neurotransmitter release. In the guinea pig hippocampus, stimulation of 5-HT4 receptors (probably located on cholinergic neurons) increases ACh release, which in turn bidirectionally modulates GABA release; these are also involved in treating learning deficits and depression. Stage II clinical trials have been initiated on some 5HTR antagonists in the study of cognitive dysfunction [<xref rid="b15-medscimonit-23-818" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-medscimonit-23-818" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The present study generated a rat VD model by permeant ligation of the bilateral common carotid, and observed 5-HT6R mRNA level and neurotransmitter levels in various brain regions. We aimed to analyze the effect of selective 5-HT6R agonist on neurotransmitter expression and mRNA level of 50HT6R to investigate the related mechanism of 5-HT6R in VD pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Animal grouping</title><p>Healthy male SD rats (7 weeks old, body weight 220~250 g) were provided by Shandong University (Certificate number: SYXK-2013-0025) and were kept in an SPF-grade facility with food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Animals were randomly divided into a sham group, model group, 5-HT6R agonist group, and placebo group (N=20 each). 5-HT6R agonist (3.0mg/kg) was given intraperitoneally once per day after successfully generating a VD model for 4 consecutive weeks (1 ml/100 g).

In brief, rats were fasted for 8 h before surgery, and were anaesthetized using 10% chloral hydrate via intraperitoneal injection. Rats were fixed in supine position and we made 1 middle incision along the neck skin to expose the bilateral common carotid artery without touching major nerves. Double ligation was made using 0-surgical silk with suture. The remaining 20 rats were recruited into the sham group with blood vessel separation but not ligation. Anal temperature was kept between 36.5~37.5&#x000b0;C during the surgery. Focal application of penicillin sodium solution was performed, along with intramuscular injection of penicillin (200 000 U/d) for 3 consecutive days. At 6 weeks after surgery, the Morris water maze was used to screen a total of 60 rats as judged by (average escape latency &#x02013; escape latency in control group)/average escape latency in this group &#x02265;20%. All 60 rats were then randomly divided into either the model group, 5-HTR agonist group (3.0 mg/kg), or placebo group (N=20 each).

Acetylcholine is synthesized by choline acetyl transferase and can be hydrolyzed by cholinesterase. In VD rats, the activity of cholinesterase and choline acetyl transferase was decreased, with lower acetylcholine metabolic rate. An animal study revealed that 5-HT6R agonist can increase acetylcholine level inside the brain [<xref rid="b18-medscimonit-23-818" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The present study showed that 5-HT6R agonist could increase acetylcholine content of cortical and hippocampal tissues, and improve the metabolism of cholinergic neurotransmitter. Monoamine neurotransmitter plays an important role in memory formation and maintenance. DA can regulate learning and memory, in addition to autonomic neurons. After brain ischemia, the content of monoamine neurotransmitter was decreased. 5-HT6R agonist can improve memory and learning functions of VD rats via elevating DA levels in cortical and hippocampal tissues. Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter and has excitotoxicity at high concentrations via intracellular calcium overloading and mitochondrial dysfunction, causing neuronal apoptosis. Studies have shown the elevation of excitatory amino acid in VD brain tissues, along with higher peripheral glutamate concentration during the acute phase of brain ischemia, followed by recovery to normal level with prolonged ischemia time [<xref rid="b18-medscimonit-23-818" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19-medscimonit-23-818" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Results of the present study showed lower Glu and GABA levels in VD model rats in cortical and hippocampal tissues, while in the drug treatment group both neurotransmitters showed elevated expression. This was probably due to initial excitotoxicity caused by the release of large amounts of GABA, followed by metabolic disorders resulting from persistent ischemia decreasing Glu and GABA levels. 5-HT6R agonist thus can improve learning and memory functions and enhance neural electrical activities via increasing Glu and GABA contents in the brain.</p><p>5-HT6R is widely distributed in GABAergic interneurons, and participates in the modulation of learning and memory processes via modulating synaptic transmission efficiency [<xref rid="b20-medscimonit-23-818" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21-medscimonit-23-818" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We established a VD rat model in which the improvement of 5-HT6R agonist on learning and memory function of VD rats was observed. Results showed that model rats had elongated escape latency and reduced crossing platform times compared to sham group rats. VD rats also had depressed expression of 5-HT6R mRNA and proteins. Compared to the placebo group, agonist treatment shortened escape latency and increased the time of passing through the platform, and increased the expression of 5-HT6R mRNA but not receptor protein expression, further substantiating that 5-HT6R agonist can significantly improve learning and memory function of VD rats, possibly via weakening the inhibition effect of GABAergic neurons on glutamatergic and cholinergic neurons. Moreover, long-term application of 5-HT6R agonist caused receptor resistance and increased mRNA expression of 5-HT6R. As the altered internal environment and injury factors underlying mRNA expression of 5-HT6R, the receptor expression requires post-translational splicing and modification, which lag behind mRNA expression, causing the time mismatch between mRNA and protein expression of 5-HT6R. Due to the relatively longer duration of this experiment, the down-regulation of 5-HT6R in the model group after long-term cerebral ischemia may be related with the protective mechanism in CNS against ischemia. In this study, the elevation of mRNA in the drug treatment group is related with long-term use of receptor agonist and consequent resistance. In the drug treatment group, the expression of 5-HT6R was not different from that of the placebo group. The hippocampal CA1 zone is important for information storage and memory, and is a sensitive region for brain ischemia. It has been shown that dementia caused by ischemic cerebrovascular disease is related to late-onset apoptosis in CA1 neurons [<xref rid="b22-medscimonit-23-818" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This study observed the morphology of hippocampal CA1 region in VD rats treated with 5-HT6R agonist. HE staining showed certain improvements of hippocampal CA1 neuronal damage. Some studies have shown that 5-HT6R agonist can facilitate the connection between synapse, and increase synaptic plasticity, suggesting a neural protection role of 5-HT6R agonist in VD rats.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The role of 5-HT6R agonist in treating VD is related to the modulation of cholinergic/monoamine neurotransmitter, and
