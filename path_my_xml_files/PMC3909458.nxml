Previous studies suggest that substantial amounts of essential amino acids (EAA), whey protein and leucine are beneficial for stimulation of acute muscle protein synthesis in older adults. However, these studies supplied only proteins, and no bolus studies have been done with dairy products or supplements that contained also fat and carbohydrates besides proteins. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a specifically designed nutritional supplement in older adults stimulates muscle protein synthesis acutely to a greater extent than a conventional dairy product. Moreover, the combined effect with resistance exercise was studied by using a unilateral resistance exercise protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Utilizing a randomized, controlled, double blind study design, healthy older adults received a single bolus of a high whey protein, leucine-enriched supplement (EXP: 20g whey protein, 3g total leucine, 150kcal; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;9) or an iso-caloric milk protein control (Control: 6g milk protein; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10), immediately after unilateral resistance exercise. Postprandial mixed muscle protein fractional synthesis rate (FSR) was measured over 4h using a tracer infusion protocol with L-[ring-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]-phenylalanine and regular blood and muscle sampling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>FSR was significantly higher overall after EXP (0.0780&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.0070%/h) vs Control (0.0574&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.0066%/h (EMM&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SE)) (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.049). No interaction between treatment and exercise was observed (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.519). Higher postprandial concentrations of EAA and leucine are possible mediating factors for the FSR response, while plasma insulin increase did not dictate the FSR response. Moreover, when the protein intake from the supplements was expressed per kg leg lean mass (LLM), a significant correlation was observed with resting postprandial FSR (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.48, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.038).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Ingestion of a high whey protein, leucine-enriched supplement resulted in a larger overall postprandial muscle protein synthesis rate in healthy older subjects compared with a conventional dairy product. This acute effect is promising for long-term effects on parameters of muscle mass, strength and function in sarcopenic older people, which requires further study.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This trial is registered in the Dutch Trial Register under number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregistry.nl/NTR1823">NTR1823</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Muscle</kwd><kwd>Protein synthesis</kwd><kwd>Older people</kwd><kwd>Leucine</kwd><kwd>Whey</kwd><kwd>Exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Muscle mass, strength and function decreases with aging, and can evolve into sarcopenia, i.e. low muscle mass and function, if the loss is sufficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It has been hypothesized that a decreased ability of the muscle to respond to anabolic stimuli, such as essential amino acids (EAA) and leucine in a meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] or exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], is part of the underlying mechanism explaining the muscle decrements in older adults.</p><p>Stable isotope studies have demonstrated that ingestion of amino acids can stimulate muscle protein synthesis in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. EAA in particular are able to stimulate muscle protein synthesis, whereas non-EAA (NEAA) are of less relevance for muscle anabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, older adults required a higher dose of EAA to stimulate muscle anabolism than younger individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This suggests that the anabolic response to amino acids at low doses is blunted in older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In addition to increasing the total dose of amino acids, diminished anabolic responsiveness with aging could also be overcome by increasing the proportion of leucine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], especially at low protein intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Moreover, a protein source such as whey, that is digested rapidly and absorbed with a rapid elevation of plasma leucine, could stimulate muscle protein synthesis rate to a higher level than casein or casein hydrolysate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Therefore, dietary strategies with a mixture of whey protein and additional leucine that significantly increase plasma EAA and leucine are hypothesized to be beneficial for a greater acute muscle anabolic response in older adults than other proteins alone and in an amount that is present in a conventional dairy product.</p><p>Resistance exercise is another stimulus for muscle protein synthesis. However, since exercise also activates muscle protein breakdown, net muscle protein balance remains negative, i.e. with net protein breakdown, in the absence of nutrient intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The combination of exercise prior to amino acid supply enhanced muscle protein synthesis further than exercise alone and resulted in net muscle protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The interactive effect of amino acids and exercise was likely due in part to exercise-stimulated blood flow and increased amino acid delivery to the muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. It is also possible that activation of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway by exercise primed the muscle to respond more prominently than when amino acids were ingested alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. On the other hand, older adults apparently have impaired contraction-induced activation of mTOR signaling and muscle protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Nonetheless, protein or amino acids in combination with exercise has additive effects on muscle protein synthesis in older adults although the response may be somewhat delayed with aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The primary objective of our study was to evaluate muscle protein synthesis in healthy older adults after intake of a specifically designed high whey protein, leucine-enriched nutritional supplement, compared with a control product containing milk protein in an amount that is typical for a single serving of a conventional dairy product, e.g., a glass of milk. Both products contained besides protein also carbohydrates and fat and thus are more representative of conventional products or a &#x02018;mixed meal&#x02019;, in contrast to previous studies in which only intact protein or free amino acids were supplied. To account for a potential impact of energy density, both products were isocaloric. Secondly, the combined effect on muscle protein synthesis of nutritional supplementation with resistance exercise was compared to nutritional supplementation without exercise, by using an unilateral resistance exercise protocol. We hypothesized that the nutritional supplement high in whey protein and enriched in leucine would be more effective than a typical dairy product to stimulate muscle protein synthesis in healthy older adults. Moreover, we hypothesized that exercise would further enhance postprandial muscle protein synthesis. These objectives are relevant for the ultimate use of nutritional supplementation and exercise intervention in the management and prevention of sarcopenia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Twenty-three healthy older adults were screened and a total of 20 healthy older adults were enrolled in the study.

Men and women were excluded from participation if they had any (history of) gastrointestinal disease, were diagnosed and actively treated for diabetes mellitus type I or II, had a history of congestive heart failure or recent hospitalization for heart disease or myocardial infarction, or had a history of hypoglycaemia. Other exclusion criteria were: systolic blood pressure &#x0003e;180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure &#x0003e;110 mmHg, infection or fever in the last 7 d, medication use (antibiotics within 3 wk prior to study visit, current use of corticosteroids, growth hormone or testosterone), known allergy to milk and milk products, lactose intolerance and known galactosaemia, as well as blood haemoglobin &#x0003c;9 g.dL<sup>-1</sup>.

After having signed for informed consent at screening visit, participants underwent a blood draw for Complete Blood Count analysis. Eligible participants underwent a DEXA-scan (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry), and determination of 1-RM (1-repetition maximum) for leg extension, and received instructions and a diet diary for the 3-d standardization phase preceding the study visit. At the study visit, participants were randomly allocated to receive one of the two study products, using stratification for sex to account for possible sexual dimorphism in muscle protein synthesis response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. A 7&#x000be;-h isotope infusion protocol with sampling of muscle biopsies and blood was followed to determine postprandial mixed muscle protein synthesis over 4 h after bolus intake of the study product. A unilateral leg resistance exercise protocol, performed 15 min before ingestion of the nutritional product, enabled measurement of muscle protein synthesis in both the resting and the exercising leg. Two follow-up phone calls, at 1&#x02013;3 d and 5&#x02013;10 d after the study visit, were scheduled for identification of adverse events and evaluation of tolerance.

This was followed immediately by a continuous infusion (0.07 &#x003bc;mol.kg<sup>-1</sup>.min<sup>-1</sup>) of L-[ring-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]-phenylalanine and maintained throughout the experiment. Blood was taken from the sampling forearm at T&#x02009;=&#x02009;-105, -75, and -45 min, respectively, for the determination of plasma phenylalanine enrichment and concentrations of amino acids, glucose and insulin.

During a short break of maximum 2 min, the load was set at 80% of the subject&#x02019;s 1-RM. Participants performed 4 sets of 8&#x02013;10 repetitions of leg extensions at 80% of 1-RM, with counter-resisted flexion movement back to the starting position. Duration ratio of extension and flexion movement was 1:2. Resting interval between sets was 2 min. The protocol lasted about 15 min. A trained instructor supervised the exercise procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample processing and analyses</title><p>Blood samples were collected in pre-chilled heparinized tubes (Becton Dickinson Vacutainer system, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, USA) and kept on ice to minimize enzymatic reactions. All plasma samples were stored at -80&#x000b0;C until further analyses. Muscle samples were prepared and processed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Muscle free intracellular, protein-bound, and plasma L-[ring-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]-phenylalanine enrichments were determined using the tert-butyldimethylsilyl derivative and GCMS (Agilent Technologies model 5973) with electron impact ionization as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Glucose concentrations were measured using an YSI glucose auto-analyzer. Amino acid concentrations in plasma were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry using the internal standard approach for each individual amino acid, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Serum CRP and insulin concentrations were measured by ELISA. Serum albumin and pre-albumin were analyzed using validated methods.</p></sec><sec><title>Calculations</title><p>The tracer-tracee ratio (t/T) was calculated from the difference in the area counts of the mass fragments from 234 and 240. Enrichment as MPE was then calculated as (t/T)/(t/T&#x02009;+&#x02009;1).</p><p>The primary endpoint of the study was the FSR (in %.h<sup>-1</sup>) of mixed muscle protein. FSR is calculated by dividing the increment in the enrichment in muscle protein-bound <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-phenylalanine over time (&#x02206;MPEp) by the enrichment of the precursor and the length of time between biopsies. The mean plasma enrichment (MPE as area/time) of <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-phenylalanine (Eplasma) between the two biopsies was considered as the most representative precursor under this non-steady state situation, anticipating that the different phenylalanine content of the study products would affect steady-state differently. Even more so because no L-[ring-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]-phenylalanine was added to the study products to keep the blinded character of the study. This approach has also been used in previous studies with bolus product intake, yielding comparable results to the traditional intracellular precursor enrichment for calculation of FSR, although absolute FSR levels are generally lower with the plasma precursor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. FSR was thus calculated as (&#x02206;MPEp)/(Eplasma*t) * 60 *100, where t represents the time interval between the two biopsies and the factors 60 and 100 are used to express FSR values in percent per hour. FSR was calculated separately for the resting leg and the exercising leg, based on the increment in enrichment from the first biopsy to the second biopsy in either of the 2 legs.</p><p>Since only one biopsy was taken in the postabsorptive state, basal FSR could not be calculated according to the traditional 2-biopsy method. In an attempt to calculate basal FSR, the so-called single-biopsy calculation was applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] by using above equation of FSR where &#x02206;MPEp now represents the difference in <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-phenylalanine enrichment between (a) muscle bound mixed protein from the muscle biopsy taken at 180 min after the start of tracer infusion and (b) plasma albumin protein from the plasma sample taken before the start of tracer infusion and reflecting background or natural protein enrichment. However, since 6 out of 20 participants had participated in a previous tracer infusion study, and recent publications indicate that nontracer naive state results in unreliable muscle protein FSR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], we decided to not include basal FSR values in the statistical analyses. Therefore, the analysis on the primary parameter FSR was performed on the postprandial data only, unadjusted for basal FSR. Basal FSR values, calculated with data from tracer naive participants, are only used as a reference to estimate the increase in FSR after product intake.</p><p>For plasma leucine and EAA (sum of histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine), the maximum (or peak) plasma concentration, the maximum increment from baseline and the iAUC (from baseline, during 4 h after product intake) were calculated. For plasma AA (i.e. sum of all amino acids), the iAUC was calculated. NEAA was calculated as AA minus EAA. The postabsorptive amino acid concentrations were only measured at -45 min, but will be indicated as T0. For plasma glucose and insulin the maximum (or peak) and iAUC values were calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Mixed model analysis was used to compare postprandial FSR values between the two groups; the model included fixed effects for treatment, exercise and sex, a fixed interaction effect for treatment * exercise and subject as random factor. To compare postprandial values for other parameters, the mixed model additionally included the baseline pre-exercise values as a covariate. The check for possible confounding factors was performed for the primary parameter by including one-by-one (independently) BMI, body fat mass, LLM, age, physical activity, mean daily dietary protein intake, or serum CRP concentration in the basic model. For amino acids, glucose and insulin, the serum CRP concentration was added to the basic model as a potential confounder. A check for possible mediating factors was performed for the primary parameter by including one-by-one (independently) iAUC for AA, EAA, NEAA, leucine, glucose, and insulin, as well as maximum concentrations for EAA and leucine in the basic model and comparing the effect size of the treatment effect in the model versus the effect size in the model without possible mediator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficients were calculated to analyse a correlation between variables. Sample size calculation (10 per group) was based on an anticipated difference in change in FSR from baseline between EXP (50% estimated increase) and Control group (11% estimated increase), using a variance (SD<sup>2</sup>) of difference of 0.0003%/h (based on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]), an average within subject correlation over time (&#x003c1;) of 0.7, an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for nested structure of 0.05, a significance level &#x003b1; of 0.05, and a power of 80%.</p><p>SAS 9.1.3 (SAS Institute) software was used for all statistical analyses.

In this study using the unilateral resistance exercise model, we did not observe a further enhanced postprandial muscle protein synthesis response.</p><sec><title>Postprandial FSR response and product-related factors</title><p>In line with our hypothesis, a nutritional supplement containing 20 g whey protein with added free leucine to a total amount of 3 g leucine resulted in a greater overall mixed muscle protein synthesis rate during the 4-h postprandial period (0.0780&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.0070%/h) than 6g milk protein in an iso-caloric product (0.0574&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.0066%/h). Previous studies showed greater stimulation of postprandial muscle protein synthesis with a higher amount of total leucine (~2.8-3.5 g leucine in a mixture of 6.7 g EAA or added to 20g casein protein) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], a higher dose of EAA (~10-15 g) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], or a higher amount of whey protein (~20-35 g) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], when compared to a low amount of EAA (7 g), a lower amount of whey protein (10-20 g) or 20 g casein protein alone. Our data extend on this previous work by showing that a combination, i.e. 20 g whey protein, 11 g total EAA and 3 g total leucine, is effective for stimulation of overall muscle protein synthesis in the context of a nutritional supplement that contained also fat and carbohydrates besides protein. In line with previous findings we also observed that an increase in plasma EAA and leucine likely dictates the extent of stimulation of muscle protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] while plasma NEAA attribute much less to postprandial muscle protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The larger amount of carbohydrates in the iso-caloric Control product resulted in a rapid increase of plasma glucose to a higher peak concentration and iAUC compared with the EXP product that contained fewer carbohydrates. However, the insulin response to both products was similar, which is likely due to leucine-stimulated insulin secretion in the EXP product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and stimulation of insulin release by the high carbohydrate content in the Control product. Adding insulin as a possible mediator in the statistical model indicated that the FSR response was not related to alterations in serum insulin in our study, which confirms that the observed difference in muscle protein synthesis response between the products is at least not due to a difference in endogenous insulin release. The role of insulin on muscle protein synthesis is somewhat debated and inhibition of muscle protein breakdown by insulin may be even more important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In existing studies in healthy older participants, the addition of carbohydrates has not been shown to augment muscle protein FSR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], and one study demonstrated a blunted FSR response with carbohydrates added to a mixture of amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It can also be hypothesized that a decrease of protein breakdown lowered amino acid availability if no nutrients were given and FSR would then have likely decreased, even though net balance might have improved. An important limitation of the present study design therefore is the absence of protein breakdown measures. In particular in the context of a mixed meal, the total anabolic response to protein is ultimately a function of muscle protein synthesis and protein breakdown as also reflected by a linear relation between protein intake and net protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Postprandial FSR response at rest</title><p>The postprandial FSR response was significantly higher after intake of the high whey protein, leucine-enriched product in the overall comparison, but the difference was not significant for the resting condition as such. Lack of statistical power and inter-individual variation in FSR are, at least partly, accountable. Increasing the sample size to 25 participants per group would have increased the power from 40% to 80% to show a postprandial FSR difference between the two groups in rest. A cross-over design or comparison between the groups of the FSR increase (i.e. change from baseline) could have reduced the variation, favoring statistical significant difference between the two groups.</p><p>The estimated 3% increase of postprandial FSR with the Control product suggests that a conventional dairy product is not adequate to acutely stimulate muscle protein synthesis in older people, as expected from the protein/EAA content of the dairy product that is below 7 g EAA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The 28% estimated increase of postprandial mixed muscle FSR with the high whey protein, leucine-enriched nutritional supplement seems somewhat less than previously observed values with 2.8 g leucine in a mix of 6.7 g EAA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], 15 g EAA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], or compared with the difference in postprandial FSR between 20 g whey and 20 g casein protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, the effect is in line with the 16% increase from basal with 20 g whey protein in a recent study in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. While our study products contained also carbohydrates and fat to mimic conventional nutrition, all previous studies referred to above used supplementation of protein only without the addition of carbohydrates or fat. The combined effect of additional macronutrients on postprandial FSR response to protein intake therefore needs further investigation to define the effect of added carbohydrates and fat.</p></sec><sec><title>Postprandial FSR response with combined exercise</title><p>Combined exercise showed a similar effect in both groups (no interaction) in our study, but the variation in FSR response to the combined exercise-nutrition intervention was large. It has previously been observed that the muscle protein synthesis response to exercise alone is impaired in older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. But when combined with ingestion of 20 g casein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] or 90 g beef protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], resistance exercise increased mixed muscle protein FSR to a higher level than dietary intervention alone, similar to the young. A recent dose&#x02013;response study with whey protein (0, 10, 20 and 40 g) in older men showed that at least 20 g of whey was required to increase myofibrillar FSR above exercise alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Moreover, resistance exercise-stimulated myofibrillar FSR was greater after ingestion of 20 g whey protein than after 20 g casein protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. It is possible that a higher protein amount in the supplement or measuring the synthesis of myofibrillar proteins, which are affected to a greater degree by resistance exercise than other muscle proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], would have resulted in a significant effect of combined exercise. Another aspect demonstrated by Drummond et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] is that, in contrast to young, resistance exercise before ingestion of 20 g EAA only stimulated muscle protein synthesis at 3&#x02013;6 h post-exercise and not during the first 3 h post-exercise in older people. It is therefore possible that the 4-h interval for studying muscle protein synthesis in our study was too short to show an effect of combined exercise.</p></sec><sec><title>Subject characteristics that potentially influence the FSR response</title><p>Interestingly, the inclusion of LLM in the mixed model increased the statistical power in our study. When the protein intake from the supplements was then expressed per kg LLM, a significant correlation was observed with resting postprandial FSR. It is therefore likely that the degree of muscle anabolic response to product supplementation is also dependent of the LLM of the subject. The data seem indicative of a dose&#x02013;response relation between protein and FSR when LLM is taken into account. However, various dosages of the same protein source and different protein sources should be tested to discriminate between protein amount and source in such relationship. Moreover, we observed that both habitual protein intake (as en%) and physical activity level reduced the statistical power when included in the mixed model. Although both variables were not strong confounders (i.e. <italic>P</italic> value below 0.2 after inclusion in the mixed model), it may point toward potential relevance of these factors in the muscle anabolic response. Physical activity level and composition of the habitual diet have both been suggested to be related to a blunted muscle protein synthesis response to nutritional stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Therefore, the relevance of LLM, habitual dietary protein intake (as en%) and physical activity level for the acute muscle anabolic response in older people needs further study. Especially in sarcopenic older adults, since this group is generally characterized by lower LLM, lower dietary protein intake and a lower physical activity level.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A specifically designed nutritional supplement high in whey protein and enriched in leucine is more effective than a conventional dairy product to stimulate postprandial muscle protein synthesis overall in healthy older subjects. This effect is attributable to the higher plasma levels of leucine and EAA after intake of the high whey protein, leucine-enriched supplement, while changes in plasma NEAA are of less relevance and plasma insulin increase does not dictate the FSR response. Moreover, the effects on protein breakdown and the impact of other macronutrients on the anabolic effect of protein needs further study, as well as the effect of subject characteristics leg lean mass, habitual protein intake and physical activity level. Finally, this acute effect on postprandial muscle protein synthesis is promising for potential long-term effects on parameters of muscle mass, strength and function in sarcopenic older people. This requires further study.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>This study was financially supported and study products were provided by Nutricia Advanced Medical Nutrition, Danone Research, the Netherlands.</p><p>All authors have made substantial contributions to the conception and design of the study, acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation of data, drafting and critically revising the article for intellectual content.
