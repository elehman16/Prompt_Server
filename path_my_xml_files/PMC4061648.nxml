Due to ease of implementation, effectiveness, availability and low costs of financing needed as a current challenges in health care system, would recommend the use of such program as a safe and free of any risk for the mother and the child and family.</p><p>There are several limitations involved in this study which must be addressed. Initially, the more serious concern is about the validity and accuracy of self-reported data regarding postpartum depression; further researches must use combination of self-report and clinical interview used to diagnose postpartum depression. Due to the small sample size, generalization of the results must be interpreted with caution and continued research should include larger sample sizes to draw more accurate conclusions. Another limitation of this study is not addressing the underlying factors of postpartum depression; future studies should focus on life crises, social support and marital satisfaction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Based on the results of this study, Fordyce happiness program was effective in reducing postpartum depression.
