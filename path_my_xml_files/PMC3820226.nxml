postural balance adjustment and muscular response patterns in chronic low back pain (CLBP)
patients. [Subjects and Methods] Sixteen CLBP patients participated in this study. They
were randomly and equally assigned to group I, whose members received ordinary physical
therapy (40 minutes per time, four times per week), and group II, whose members performed
a lumbar stabilization exercise using the Neurac sling after ordinary physical therapy (40
minutes per time, four times per week). The visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry
Disability Index (ODI) were used to evaluate exercise effects. BioRescue and
electromyography were utilized for the measurement of changes in postural balance
adjustment and muscular response patterns, respectively. [Results] Both groups saw their
VAS and ODI decrease significantly. There were significant decreases in both groups in
posturography as well, but group II recorded a greater decrease. There were significant
increases in the flexion&#x02013;relaxation ratio in both groups, and there were significant
increases in the extension&#x02013;flexion ratio in the left L1&#x02013;2 of group I and in all elements
of group II. [Conclusion] Lumbar stabilization exercise using the Neurac sling is
effective in decreasing pain, improving damaged postural balance adjustment, and
normalizing muscle response patterns of CLBP patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Chronic low back pain (CLBP)</kwd><kwd>Neurac sling exercise</kwd><kwd>Postural balance adjustment</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Fifty to eighty percent of the population experiences low back pain, and this influences
ordinary life and task performance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Ninety percent of low back pain patients recover within 6 weeks. When low back pain is
sustained for more than 12 weeks, it is called chronic low back pain (CLBP)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Relative to people without pain, CLBP
patients suffer from diverse problems with motor control, such as damage in postural
adjustment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, delay in muscular
response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, damage in perception
capability during trunk movement<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
increase in errors during postural recovery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, that are related to low back pain.</p><p>Low back pain patients' motor control damage provides inaccurate proprioceptive input. In
addition, loss of normal sensory information creates a strategy of postural adjustment for
compensatory modification<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular,
proprioceptive input from the lower extremities and the trunk plays an important role in
body stability and movement adjustment. Such proprioceptive disorders trigger restriction in
range of motion (ROM) and postural balance adjustment together with chronic pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In other words, damage in postural balance
adjustment delays postural response patterns and response time<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Danneels et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup> observed that uncoordinated patterns of the multifidus muscle (a
deep muscle of the lumbar spine) and the trunk muscles occurred, and Silfies et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup> observed abnormal mobilization patterns in
which mobilization of global muscles increased and activity of deep muscles decreased. These
changes placed a load on and moved the spine, triggering recurrent low back pain.</p><p>A lumbar stability exercise using a sling has recently been applied to treat low back pain.
Sling exercise enables proprioceptive exercise training on an unstable ground for recovery
of neuromusculoskeletal damage and strengthens deep muscles that engage in stability, which
is effective in normalizing muscle response patterns<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, the Neurac treatment method among sling exercises
focuses on tonic stabilizers largely located near joints that play a crucial role in the
mechanism of feed forward and is efficient in retraining motor units of muscles and
reoperating inhibited actions through dynamic-static contraction of high intensity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Neurac treatment method utilizes passive
fluctuations or mechanical vibrations, and Fontana et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that when vibrations of low frequency were applied to the
entire body, the proprioceptive sense of the lumbosacral area recovered. Muceli et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup> observed that vibrations for a short time
period were effective in increasing deep muscle strength and stabilization of chronic pain
patients. In this study, we applied the Neurac lumbar stabilization sling exercise to CLBP
patients and measured its effects on postural balance adjustment capabilities and muscle
activity, thereby examining its effects on abnormal muscle response in lumbar pain
patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Characteristics of study participants</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Parameters</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group I (n=8)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group II (n=8)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">46.6 &#x000b1; 19.7</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">48.6 &#x000b1; 9.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sex (male/female)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/4</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3/5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.3 &#x000b1; 10.4</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">57.9 &#x000b1; 4.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">165.7 &#x000b1; 4.0</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">164.6 &#x000b1; 4.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.3 &#x000b1; 3.3</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.3 &#x000b1; 0.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Duration onset (months)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.7 &#x000b1; 3.0</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18.7 &#x000b1; 12.2</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>All data are expressed as means with SD</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>The subjects were 16 CLBP patients.

group I, in which they received ordinary physical therapy, or group II, in which they
performed the Neurac sling exercise. For ordinary physical exercise, a hot pack (20
minutes), ultrasonography (1.5&#x02005;W/c<sup>2</sup>, 5 minutes, Jireh Medical, Korea), and
transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (4 pps, 15 minutes, Hanawoo Medical, Korea) were
applied to L1&#x02013;2 and L4&#x02013;5, 40 minutes per time, four times per week. Lumbar stabilization
exercise using the Neurac sling was conducted for 40 minutes per time, four times per week
using the following four methods: First, a weight load exercise was performed under the
Sling system. Second, passive fluctuation or mechanical vibration was selectively applied
to body parts by using a stimulator (Redcord Stimula; Redcord). Third, the load was
gradually increased. Fourth, treatment was adjusted so that pain was not triggered<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the specific method of exercise.</p><p>For postural adjustment ability, center of pressure (COP) was measured using BioRescue
(RM Ingenierie Co., France). The COP elements of sway area, sway length, and sway speed
were measured and analyzed. In order to measure static balance ability, the subjects
stared straight ahead for 60 seconds on a foothold with their eyes open. In order to
measure dynamic balance ability, the subjects rotated 180&#x000b0; on the foothold and stared
straight ahead for 60 seconds<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Muscle activity was measured with electromyography (EMG) (Pocket EMG; BTS Co., Italy).
Electrodes were attached to the right and left sides, 3&#x02005;cm from L1&#x02013;2 and L4&#x02013;5. The
frequency bandwidth was set at 20 to 500&#x02005;Hz; the data, which were collected through
filtering, were computer processed and the root mean square was calculated. For the first
3 seconds, the subjects were in a standing position and flexed the lumbar vertebrae to the
maximum ROM as if picking up an object; they then maintained a completely relaxed
condition for 3 seconds and then extended the waist for 3 seconds in a neutral standing
position. The flexion&#x02013;relaxation ratio (FRR) was derived by dividing the 1 second maximum
RMS (mV) during flexion by the 1 second maximum RMS (mV) during flexion&#x02013;relaxation. The
extension&#x02013;flexion ratio (EFR) was calculated by dividing the 1 second maximum RMS (mV)
during extension by the 1 second maximum RMS (mV) during flexion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. During clinical evaluation, subjective pain was
evaluated using a VAS, and functional performance ability was evaluated using ODI.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 12.0 for Windows. The normality test result
did not show a normal distribution, and therefore nonparametric statistics were used. We
used the Wilcoxon test for intra-group analysis and the Mann&#x02013;Whitney U test for
between-group analysis prior to and after the exercise. A statistical significance level
was set at &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title> Changes in VAS and ODI scores between Group I and Group II (mean &#x000b1; SD)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Parameters</td><td align="center" valign="middle" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Group I</td><td align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Group II</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">VAS</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.9 &#x000b1; 0.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.3 &#x000b1; 1.1***</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.0 &#x000b1; 0.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.3 &#x000b1; 1.3***<sup>#</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ODI</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.0 &#x000b1; 4.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.4 &#x000b1; 2.1***</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.4 &#x000b1; 3.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.0 &#x000b1; 2.4***</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>The Wilcoxon test was conducted to compare differences between before and after

addition, damaged sensory receptors and changed muscular adjustment patterns trigger
instability in postural balance and limited trunk movement adjustment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the recovery of balance ability, damaged proprioceptive
senses of the lower extremities and the trunk should be improved, and muscle strengthening
exercises for the entire lumbo-pelvic-hip complex should be conducted<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Lumbar stabilization exercise using the Neurac sling resolves this problem and provides
unstable ground, enabling sensorimotor training, and may simultaneously strengthen muscles
that engage in stability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, we examined the effects of ordinary physical therapy and lumbar
stabilization exercise using the Neurac sling on CLBP patients by measuring VAS, ODI,
posturography, and surface EMG. There were significant differences in VAS and ODI scores in
the two groups after the exercise. This result suggests that ordinary physical therapy and
the Neurac sling exercise reduce pain and improve functional performance ability. In
particular, the VAS score of group II had a significantly greater decrease compared with
group I. We conclude that the sling exercise reduces load on the spine, reducing delivery of
stimulation to ligaments and articular cavities, which are tissues sensitive to pain. We
consider the sling exercise effective in reducing pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In order to look at changes in damaged postural balance adjustment ability in CLBP
patients, the center of pressure was measured using posturography<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. We found significant decreases in sway area, sway length,
and sway speed with regard to static balance ability in the two groups. However, with regard
to dynamic balance ability, there were significant decreases in all elements in group I
except for sway area. Decreases in sway area, sway length, and sway speed were greater in
group II under dynamic conditions that required more balance recovery ability. This suggests
that lumbar stabilization exercise using the Neurac sling reduces pain, enables
proprioception&#x02013;motor exercise and promotes activation of nerve roots<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup> and thus is effective in recovering damaged postural
adjustment capabilities.</p><p>A method to measure trunk muscle activity of CLBP patients using surface EMG has been used
but showed an abnormal FRP as a result of damage to muscle response patterns<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. This phenomenon is a disorder in which
eccentric contraction of the erector spinae muscle decreases during flexion of the trunk,
the muscle is not relaxed due to pain during complete flexion, there is some muscle
contraction, and concentric contraction decreases during extension. It has previously been
quantified by analysis with the FRR and EFR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. In our study, both groups showed significant differences in FRR.
In terms of the EFR, all items significantly increased only in group II. Given that the FRR
in group I aimed at pain reduction increased, the erector spinae relaxed during complete
flexion of the trunk as a result of a decrease in pain. In group II, pain was reduced and
activity of concentric and eccentric contraction of the erector spinae was increased,
increasing the FRR. A rehabilitation exercise program to activate nerve roots using a sling
alleviates pain and activates global muscles and deep muscles, increasing lumbar muscular
strength. Shumway-Cook et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref><sup>)</sup> observed
that while conducting exercise on an unstable base of support, muscle activity exerted by
muscles increased. When deep muscles are strengthened, anticipatory postural adjustment in
which muscles maintaining stability respond in advance is activated, increasing stability in
CLBP patient movement<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Sling exercise
using the Neurac treatment method promotes activation of nerve roots, smoothing coordination
between the trunk and the hip joint and reducing abnormal flexion&#x02013;relaxation phenomenon<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. When lumbar stabilization exercise using
Neurac sling is used, it has a positive effect on muscle responses and on improving
anticipatory postural adjustment ability.</p><p>Our study results showed that patients with recurrent CLBP had pain together with imbalance
in postural balance adjustment and muscle response patterns and that these problems
influenced their functions. Lumbar stabilization exercise using the Neurac sling is
considered to reduce pain, improve damaged postural balance adjustment ability, and
positively influence normalization of muscle response patterns.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Marras</surname><given-names>WS</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Occupational low back disordered causation and
