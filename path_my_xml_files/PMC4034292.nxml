especially high concentrations in mammary breast milk. Moreover, it is also known to be
found in tears and saliva in mammals. LF is a multifunctional protein with antibacterial,
antiviral, immunostimulatory and antioxidant activity and has a cancer-preventive potential
[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It has been approved as a food additive in Japan and
is included in the &#x0201c;generally recognized as safe&#x0201d; (GRAS) category in the USA.</p><p>Recently, we have found that one of the many functions of LF is visceral fat-decreasing
action. The ingestion of enteric-coated tablets that contain LF (300&#x02005;mg/day) for an 8-week
period significantly decreased human visceral fat [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].
Moreover, growth-promoting action on bifidobacteria in addition to antibacterial activity is
reported for LF [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Thus, researchers have been
studying the functions of lactoferrin for potential use for health conditions.</p><p><italic>Lactobacillus brevis</italic> subsp. <italic>coagulans</italic> FERM BP-4693 (LB)
is a lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional pickles called &#x0201c;Suguki&#x0201d; of Kyoto, Japan.
The immunopotentiating action [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and probiotic function [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] of <italic>L. brevis</italic> have been reported, and it has been used as an
active ingredient of a sour milk beverage and supplement.</p><p>A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial was conducted to elucidate the
effects of LF and LB on the intestinal function and microbiota in Japanese women with a
tendency for constipation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Preparation of lactoferrin hydrolysates</title><p>Tryptic and peptic hydrolysates of LF were prepared as described previously [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Briefly, tryptic hydrolysates of LF were prepared
by digestion with trypsin (trypsin diphenyl carbamyl chloride-treated type XI from bovine
pancreas, T1005-250MG, Sigma-Aldrich Japan, Tokyo, Japan) at 37&#x000b0;C for 24 hr with the pH
adjusted to 7.0 with NaOH. The reaction was terminated by heating at 80&#x000b0;C for 15&#x02005;min.
Peptic hydrolysates of LF were prepared by digestion with pepsin (pepsin 1:10,000, from
porcine stomach mucosa, 162-20 752; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Limited, Tokyo, Japan)
at 37&#x000b0;C for 24 hr with the pH adjusted to 2.5 with HCl. The reaction was terminated by
heating at 80&#x000b0;C for 15&#x02005;min, and the pH was adjusted to 7.0 by the addition of NaOH.</p></sec><sec><title>Strain of bifidobacterium, culture conditions and measurement of growth</title><p>The bifidobacterial strain used in this study was <italic>Bifidobacterium longum</italic>
ATCC 15707. Prior to use, the bifidobacterial strain was cultured for 24 hr anaerobically
at 37&#x000b0;C in MRS broth using an anaerobic chamber (Anaerobic Box ANK-1, Hirasawa Works,
Tokyo, Japan). Ten microliters of activated culture (5.0&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> cfu/ml) were
freshly inoculated into 3&#x02005;mL of MRS broth. Fermentations in the test tubes were performed
anaerobically using an anaerobic chamber at 37&#x000b0;C. LF and hydrolysates of LF were filter
sterilized (pore size 0.22 &#x003bc;m) and added to the autoclaved medium to give a final
concentration of 5&#x02005;mg/ml. Control incubations of bifidobacterium in MRS were performed
without adding hydrolysates of LF. The growth of bifidobacteria was monitored by measuring
the optical density at 550&#x02005;nm using a calorimeter (Calorimeter ANA-7S; Tokyo
Photo-Electronic Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at defined time intervals. Values for each
sample were determined in triplicate.</p></sec><sec><title>Enteric-coated tablets</title><p>We used enteric-coated tablets containing LF (100&#x02005;mg/tablet; LF tablet) and tablets
containing both LF (100&#x02005;mg/tablet) and LB (6&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> bacteria/tablet; LF+LB
tablet). The LF tablets contained the same weight of lactose in place of the LB contained
in a LF+LB tablet. The placebo tablets contained an amount of lactose equivalent to the
weight of the LF plus LB in a LF+LB tablet. The other constituents of each tablet were
crystalline cellulose, calcium carboxymethylcellulose, sucrose ester, silicon dioxide,
shellac, sorbitol, arginine, and dextrin as described previously [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In this formulation, LF molecules are protected from proteolytic
digestion in the stomach, since the tablets are coated with an acid-resistant material,
shellac, which dissolves easily under the neutral pH conditions in the intestine. The
enteric-coated properties of this formulation were checked by the standard disintegration
test to satisfy the criterion for the Japanese Pharmacopoeia.</p></sec><sec><title>Subjects and study design of a preliminary clinical trial</title><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p> Study design of preliminary clinical trial.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmfh-32-013-g001"/></fig><p>Fifteen Japanese adults (3 males, 12 females) from 20 to 50&#x02005;years of age with a tendency

into two groups. Following the observation period for 2 weeks from week I to week II, the
placebo tablets were administered daily for 2 weeks, from week III to week IV. Then either
the LF+LB or placebo tablets were administered daily for two weeks from week V to week VI.
After a 4-week wash-out period, from week VII to week X, we replaced the LF+LB tablets
with the placebo tablets and vice versa, which were administered daily for two weeks from
week XI to week XII. All subjects were requested to stop consuming other lactoferrin
supplements, other lactic acid bacteria supplements and dietary supplements that might
have effects on the intestinal microbiota, such as oligosaccharides or dietary fiber.
Antibiotics, cathartics, antidiarrheals, enemas and digestive medicines were restricted
from being prescribed except at times of necessity. When the subjects used these
medicines, the data of the subjects were excluded from the analysis. The subjects filled
out a daily questionnaire on defecation frequency, stool output, defecation days,
prescriptions and health remarks throughout the entire study period.</p></sec><sec><title>Fecal microbiota analysis by anaerobic culture method</title><p>Fecal samples were collected at the end of weeks IV, VI, X and XII. Whole fecal samples
were stored anaerobically (AnaeroPack-Anaero; Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company Inc, Tokyo,
Japan) at 4&#x000b0;C and used for fecal microbiota analysis within 24 hr after defecation.
Decimal dilution series of fecal samples were prepared by adding the samples to the
dilution solution. From an appropriate dilution, 50&#x02005;&#x000b5;L of samples were plated onto the
media, and the bacteria were analyzed according to Mitsuoka&#x02019;s method [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Two nonselective media (blood liver, CDC anaerobe
sheep blood agar) and three selective media (bifidobacteria-selective, cycloserine
cefoxitin fructose agar, CW Egg-yolk agar with kanamycin) were used. Bacterial species
were identified by colonization, Gram staining, morphology, lecithinase reaction, aerobic
growth and sporulation. The bacteria were incubated for 3 to 7 days at 35&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (T-RFLP analysis)</title><p>Fecal samples were kept in guanidine thiocyanate solution (100&#x02005;mM Tris-HCl [pH 9.0],40&#x02005;mM
EDTA [pH 8.0],4&#x02005;M guanidine thiocyanate) in sample tubes (Becton, Dickinson and Company,
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Fecal microbiota analysis by the T-RFLP method was performed by
Techno Suruga Laboratory Co., Ltd. T-RFLP analysis was performed as described in previous
reports [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The length of the terminal restriction fragments was determined using an
ABI PRISM 3130xl genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems,Carlsbad, CA, USA) and GeneMapper
(Applied Biosystems).</p></sec><sec><title>Fecal color score</title><p>During the study, fecal color at every defecation was recorded in journals by the
subjects. Fecal color was determined by the subjects themselves, who compared the fecal
color with the tones corresponding to five stages on a card. The scores for the tones of
the five stages were 1, yellow (No. 241): 2, ocher (No. 321): 3, pale ocher (No. 308): 4,
brown (No. 311): and 5, dark brown (No. 647), according to a color sample book (Color
Guide, 19th edition, Dainippon Ink and Chemicals, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The difference
between the mean fecal color score during two weeks of the LF+LB tablet ingestion period
(weeks XI and XII for group A and weeks V and VI for group B) and that during the two
weeks before the ingestion period (weeks IX and X group A and weeks III and IV for group
B) for each subject was calculated. The mean of the differences with the standard error is
indicated in the figure. Similarly, the difference between the mean fecal color score
during the placebo tablet ingestion period (weeks V and VI for group A and weeks XI and
XII for group B) and that during two weeks before the ingestion period (weeks III and IV
for group A and weeks IX and X for group B) was calculated, and the mean with the standard

that ingestion of enteric-coated tablets containing LF and LB promoted the intestinal health
of Japanese women with a tendency for constipation, in terms of an increase in defecation
frequency and the increased number of bifidobacteria in feces. Since LF and LF tryptic
fragments promoted the growth of bifidobacteria <italic>in vitro</italic>, it was suggested
that growth of bifidobacteria was promoted in the intestine by ingesting the tablets, which
possibly caused the improvement of the defecation function of the intestines.</p><p>We paid attention to the antibacterial activity [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]
of LF on harmful bacteria and growth promotion effects on typical good bacteria,
bifidobacteria. There are reports that peptic and tryptic hydrolysates of LF promoted the
growth of <italic>B. bifidum</italic>, <italic>B. breve</italic> and <italic>B. infantis in
vitro</italic> [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and for <italic>B. bifidum</italic> in particular, the growth stimulatory
effects of the tryptic hydrolysate of LF were higher than those of the peptic hydrolysates;
no effects of LF and the tryptic hydrolysate on the growth promotion of <italic>B.
longum</italic> were observed. However, afterwards, growth promotion effects were reported
for <italic>B. longum</italic> by the same research group [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These growth promotion effects of LF were dose and strain dependent. In the
present study, we observed that LF and the tryptic hydrolysate of LF, but not the peptic
hydrolysate of LF, promoted the growth of <italic>B. longum</italic>. The possible reason
was presumed to be that the concentration of LF and hydrolysate of LF in culture media was
higher than reported previously [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition, there is a report that the peptic
hydrolysate of LF was degraded to many small peptides but that the trypsin hydrolysate of LF
was degraded to four fragments that included full-length LF when checked by SDS-PAGE [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These seem to be the reasons why the trypsin
hydrolysate maintained the growth promoting function. There are many reports concerning the
bifidobacterium growth-promoting effects of LF <italic>in vitro</italic>, but research
results for humans are limited to the studies performd for infants [<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The reason for this is
presumed to be because intact LF reaches the intestines in infants with undeveloped
digestive functions of the stomach but not in adults. Balmar et al. [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] reported that administering LF to infants for 14 days did not
influence the pattern of fecal microbiota. However, it was presumed that the administration
period was too short for the effect to be observed. In the present study, it was possible to
make intact LF reach the intestines in adults using the enteric-coated LF. Moreover, it is
presumed that the LF or hydrolysate of LF that reached the intestines activated
bifidobacterium inhabiting the large intestine. However, ingestion of the tablet containing
LF but not LB did not significantly improve defecation frequency in humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p>There are reports that <italic>L. brevis</italic> improves the immunostimulatory action by
increasing interferon (IFN)-&#x003b1; secretion and natural killer (NK) activity [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], ameliorates
the development of dermatitis atopic dermatitis [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]
and exerts phylactic action [<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition to
these reports, <italic>L. brevis</italic> was shown to be a promising probiotic candidate by
an <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> feeding trial study [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig.
4</xref>, oral administration of enteric-coated tablets containing LF and <italic>L.
brevis</italic> improved the fecal properties of adults with a tendency for constipation
compared with enteric-coated tablets containing LF without <italic>L. brevis</italic>. The
number of fecal bifidobacteria significantly increased in the LF+LB tablet intake group
compared with the placebo tablet intake group. The number of fecal bifidobacteria
significantly increased during the LF+LB tablet ingestion period. It seems that LF and the
tryptic digest of LF escape digestion in the stomach due to the enteric coating, and promote
the growth of bifidobacteria in the intestines. The defecation frequency and defecation days
per week increased in the LF+LB tablet intake group compared with the placebo tablet intake
group. Accurate consideration of these results cannot be done with the present study. Ogata
et al. [<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] reported that the defecation frequency
increased even when there was no drastic change in the microbiota. They consider that
improvement of the total intestinal environment, which is influenced by fecal microbiota
including bifidobacteria, putrefactive substances, enzyme activities and other
characteristics comprising water content, organic acids and acetic acid, is possibly
effective for easing defecation.</p><p>Recent reports clearly demonstrated that ingested bifidobacteria [<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] or lactobacilli [<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] reached
and increased in the intestine using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method in addition to
a culturing method. In these reports, the total number of intestinal bifidobacteria was
shown to increase 2&#x02013;3-folds, which was considered to result in an increased defecation
frequency. Similar to these previous reports, we observed an increase in the number of
bifidobacteria in feces as a result of ingestion of LF+LB tablets. Therefore, it can be
presumed that the increased defecation frequency observed in this study was the consequence
of the increase in bifidobacteria in the intestines.</p><p>In conclusion, the results obtained in this study suggest that enteric-coated LF tablets
containing <italic>Lactobacillus brevis</italic> subsp. <italic>coagulans</italic> have an
efficacy for improving the intestinal microbiota and intestinal function by the
bifidobacterium growth-promoting effects of LF and some effects of <italic>L.
