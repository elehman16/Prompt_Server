Vacc-4x is a peptide-based therapeutic HIV vaccine corresponding to conserved regions of Gag p24 <xref rid="pone.0112556-Asjo1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Intradermal Vacc-4x with recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor as adjuvant has been shown to enhance HIV-specific cellular immune responses in patients on ART <xref rid="pone.0112556-Kran1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, induce long lasting vaccine-specific T cell memory <xref rid="pone.0112556-Lind1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and lower viral load set-points after interruption of ART <xref rid="pone.0112556-Pollard1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Furthermore, no viral mutations within the conserved HIV p24 sequences were found in vaccinated patients <xref rid="pone.0112556-Kran2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>The primary and secondary objectives of this randomized controlled pilot study were to explore safety and immunogenicity of intranasal administration of Vacc-4x at different doses. Intranasal administration may open for a new and easier means of HIV vaccine delivery, which may be of special interest in resource limited settings. Less trained personnel can administer such vaccines, as has been demonstrated with the oral polio vaccine. In this phase I trial, HIV- infected patients on effective ART were vaccinated by application onto the nasal mucosa with Vacc-4x dissolved in Endocine, an adjuvant developed for mucosal administration <xref rid="pone.0112556-Falkeborn1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112556-Maltais1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Endocine has previously been shown to be safe and tolerable in humans and the Endocine-adjuvanted whole virus vaccine fulfilled the EMA/CHMP HAI criteria for a seasonal influenza vaccine <xref rid="pone.0112556-Hinkula1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>Mucosal vaccination may induce both systemic and mucosal immune responses <xref rid="pone.0112556-Falkeborn1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112556-Pavot1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112556-Brave1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The latter is relevant for HIV, which is transmitted via mucosa through sexual contact, and later resides and replicates in mucosal tissues. In contrast to other mucosal delivery routes that mostly induce local immune responses, intranasal immunization may generate IgA and IgG antibody responses at distant sites such as cervicovaginal mucosa <xref rid="pone.0112556-Holmgren1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112556-Mann1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Although Vacc-4x was designed to primarily induce systemic cellular immune responses, this study explored whether systemic as well as nasal and rectal humoral responses would be induced following intranasal vaccine delivery.</p><p>In chronic HIV infection, HIV-specific T cell responses may be strongly regulated <xref rid="pone.0112556-Kaufmann1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112556-Wherry1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, and immune regulatory mechanisms may therefore be important to consider in therapeutic HIV vaccination <xref rid="pone.0112556-Macatangay1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. As a secondary objective, we therefore assessed vaccine-specific immune regulation mediated by cytokines that potently inhibit Th1 responses as recently described by Lind et al <xref rid="pone.0112556-Lind2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.

Mild flu-like symptoms, upper respiratory infections and viral gastroenteritis were occasionally noted but were not related to the vaccine. Overall, the vaccine was well tolerated with no major changes in vital signs, laboratory parameters, HIV RNA, CD4+ or CD8+T cell counts.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0112556-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0112556.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Cohort characteristics.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0112556-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0112556.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Adjuvant (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Vaccine (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;17)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">p</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male: Female</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6&#x02236;0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16&#x02236;1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Caucasian: Black</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6&#x02236;0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16&#x02236;1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">43.7 (39.7&#x02013;56.4)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt101">*</xref>

Vacc-4x CD8+T cell proliferative responses increased among low dose patients from baseline to end of study and Vacc-4x DTH infiltrates were larger after vaccination than among patients in the adjuvant group. Furthermore, the low dose induced better distal (rectal) Vacc-4x humoral responses, although at lower levels than in nasal secretions. In contrast, the high dose generated higher local (nasal) IgA and serum IgG levels.

From a therapeutic HIV vaccine perspective, targeting chronic HIV infection in the mucosa may be important <xref rid="pone.0112556-Brenchley1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.

Since Vacc-4x reduces viral load set points after treatment interruption <xref rid="pone.0112556-Pollard1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, future vaccine studies should provide an opportunity to study mucosal biopsies and viral load measured by an ultra-sensitive HIV RNA assay.</p><p>In chronic infection, HIV-specific T cell responses are often dysfunctional <xref rid="pone.0112556-Wherry1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112556-Demers1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and hampered by early clonal T cell loss <xref rid="pone.0112556-Davenport1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Therefore, many chronically infected patients have insufficient <italic>in vitro</italic> T cell responses to Gag. Results from our present study also showed weak responses to the Vacc-4x Gag p24 consensus peptides. The T cell responses induced by intranasal administration of Vacc-4x were generally weaker than in former trials, but patients in the former studies were given more immunizations as well as boosters.

<xref rid="pone.0112556-Kvale1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>T cell proliferation was the main <italic>in vitro</italic> outcome in accordance with former Vacc-4x trials. Proliferation is fundamental for effective immune responses and is a standard and robust method for characterizing T cell functionality <xref rid="pone.0112556-Chattopadhyay1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112556-Hawkins1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. We have presented proliferation as raw data that resulted in some cases of negative proliferative responses, i.e. negative net responses were obtained when adjusting for background proliferation in unstimulated control cultures. There are several possible explanations for these negative values. First, toxic byproducts from the peptide synthesis process could be present, but this is unlikely because even positive responses were obtained with the same peptide batches. Second, assay variation around zero may occur among patients with low vaccine-specific responses. However, negative responses were repeatedly found in the same patients. Alternatively, Vacc-4x T cell responses in some patients are strongly regulated by mechanisms that reduce even the background proliferation in Vacc-4x-stimulated cultures, resulting in negative net proliferation relative to the corresponding unstimulated control culture. This is in accordance with variable frequencies and suppressive functions of specific regulatory T cells after therapeutic vaccination with autologous dendritic cells loaded with HIV peptides <xref rid="pone.0112556-Macatangay1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Based on recent observations <xref rid="pone.0112556-Lind2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112556-Lind3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, we therefore tested immune regulation by blocking IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, and TGF-&#x003b2;, a regulatory protein, in Vacc-4x-stimulated cell cultures. This regulatory parameter has been associated with rapid disease progression in untreated individuals <xref rid="pone.0112556-Lind3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and might explain the inconsistent effects observed following two Vacc-4x booster doses in patients on ART <xref rid="pone.0112556-Lind2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In the present study we found that Vacc-4x-induced regulation could explain most cases of negative proliferation.</p><p>Vacc-4x regulation was predictive in other respects as well. Vacc-4x DTH infiltrates were inversely correlated with concurrent regulation after vaccination. Moreover, patients who showed the greatest improvement in proliferative T cell responses had higher levels of regulation at baseline. This may indicate that the balance between Vacc-4x-induced T cell activation and regulation may be altered by intranasal administration of Vacc-4x. Given that our exploratory regulatory parameter is clinically relevant, patients with vaccine-induced regulation at baseline might profit from intranasal therapeutic vaccination. In contrast, we observed cases of enhanced regulation after late boosters in intradermal immunization <xref rid="pone.0112556-Lind2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Altogether, our observations indicate that it might be advantageous to select candidates for therapeutic vaccination trials based on both specific T cell responses and regulation at screening. Furthermore, these parameters might be valuable in monitoring vaccine responses and thereby individualize therapeutic vaccination.</p><p>The choice of Vacc-4x doses given was based in part on experience from previous Vacc-4x trials with intradermal injections even though the low dose in this study was only 1/5 of the intradermal low dose <xref rid="pone.0112556-Kran1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The finding that low dose generated the best proliferative T cell responses but no increase in local IgA antibody levels may indicate that this dose induced a more Th1-like response than the higher doses of Vacc-4x. The potential for different antigen doses to direct immune responses in nasal therapeutic vaccination remains to be determined.</p><p>In conclusion, we showed that intranasal administration of Vacc-4x with Endocine as adjuvant was safe and induced dose-dependent vaccine-specific T cell responses and both mucosal and systemic humoral responses. The clinical significance of these findings should be addressed in larger cohorts. The impact of vaccine antigen doses and immune regulatory mechanisms warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0112556.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
