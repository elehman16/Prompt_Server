Natural environments facilitate unstructured PA and children report a preference for play in nature. Thus, play on the school field might encourage children to be more active during playtime. The primary aim of this study was to examine the impact of the school playing environment on children's PA. Descriptive data and fitness were assessed in 25 children aged 8&#x02013;9 years from a single primary school. Over two consecutive weeks participants were allocated to either play on the school field or playground during playtime. The order of play in the two areas was randomised and counterbalanced. Moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) was assessed during playtime on the last two days of each week using accelerometers. There was a significant interaction of environment and sex on MVPA during morning play (F(1,22)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6.27; P&#x0003c;0.05; n<sub>p</sub>

During morning play boys were significantly more active than girls on the playground (t(23)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.32; P&#x0003c;0.01; n<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.291), but not on the field (P&#x0003e;0.05; n<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.071).

<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.371). MVPA was higher on the field and boys were more active than girls. Play on the field leads to increases in MVPA, particularly in girls. The promising trend for the effect of the natural environment on MVPA indicates that interventions aimed at increasing MVPA should use the natural environment and that schools should encourage greater use of their natural areas to increase PA.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors have no support or funding to report.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="5"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>The authors confirm that all data underlying the findings are fully available without restriction.

Participation in PA in youth is of great importance as PA may track into adulthood where adequate levels of PA are protective against many chronic diseases <xref rid="pone.0108701-Pretty1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, in the UK approximately 75% of boys and 80% of girls aged 5&#x02013;10 years are not meeting the daily recommendation of 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) <xref rid="pone.0108701-Health1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Unstructured play is also an essential part of childhood which enables children to develop a relationship with their surrounding environment and enhances social skills, co-ordination and strength <xref rid="pone.0108701-Bird1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Outdoor environments facilitate play and are associated with increased levels of PA <xref rid="pone.0108701-Burdette1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108701-Ridgers1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Thus, children should be provided with daily opportunities to play outdoors. The school environment provides such an opportunity through the provision of playtime. Playtime normally takes place on the concrete school playground and lasts for at least one hour per day <xref rid="pone.0108701-Ridgers1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. However, universally playtime is reported to make relatively small contributions to children's overall daily activity requirements <xref rid="pone.0108701-Ridgers2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In the UK, only one known study has reported the contribution of playtime to overall activity requirements, with contributions being as low as 4.5% <xref rid="pone.0108701-Stratton1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>A number of studies have successfully increased playtime PA through the introduction of interventions such as sports or games equipment <xref rid="pone.0108701-Verstraete1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, playground markings <xref rid="pone.0108701-Stratton2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108701-Stratton3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, fitness breaks <xref rid="pone.0108701-Hurbety1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108701-Howe1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and playground structures <xref rid="pone.0108701-Ridgers3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However, these types of interventions tend to facilitate structured rather than unstructured PA <xref rid="pone.0108701-Hyndman1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Unstructured PA is essential to childhood development <xref rid="pone.0108701-Bird1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and therefore needs to be encouraged during playtime.</p><p>Natural environments can encourage unstructured play and may therefore play a role in facilitating unstructured PA during playtime <xref rid="pone.0108701-Hyndman1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Natural environments provide large open spaces which encourage individuals to be active, whilst areas lacking nature may restrict PA due to limited space and parental fears over crime and road traffic <xref rid="pone.0108701-Wells1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0108701-Brockman1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Children report a preference for play in natural environments <xref rid="pone.0108701-Bird1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, with nature facilitating more imaginative and inventive play <xref rid="pone.0108701-Bird1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108701-Wells1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108701-Bowler1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Furthermore, adolescents living in urban settings with access to green spaces such as parks are more likely to be physically active than their peers without park access <xref rid="pone.0108701-Babey1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, indicating that all forms of nature can be used as a tool for engaging youth in PA. Thus, if school playtime were performed on the school field it is possible that children's PA levels would be increased. To date, there is a lack of data quantifying the impact of natural environments on levels of PA in children, particularly within the school setting.</p><p>Performing PA in a natural environment (&#x0201c;Green Exercise&#x0201d;) has also been demonstrated to provide improvements in self-esteem in adults <xref rid="pone.0108701-Pretty2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0108701-Barton1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, whether participants are simply viewing scenes of nature or directly interacting with natural environments. Studies in adolescents and children suggest that Green Exercise has no such additive effect on self-esteem compared to exercise in other environments <xref rid="pone.0108701-Wood1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0108701-Barton2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. However, the only known study in children examined the impact of a green playtime intervention consisting of orienteering <xref rid="pone.0108701-Barton2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The task orientated, structured nature of orienteering may not facilitate the green exercise effect <xref rid="pone.0108701-Wood2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Unstructured free play in a natural environment may allow greater interaction with the environment, thus benefiting self-esteem. Low self-esteem is a common occurrence in many forms of mental illness <xref rid="pone.0108701-Watson1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, thus methods of improving self-esteem in children are important for mental health.</p><p>The primary aim of this study was to examine the impact of the school playing environment on children's PA using a counterbalanced, randomised cross-over design. The secondary aim was to determine whether the playing environment influenced short term changes in self-esteem.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The University faculty ethical review committee approved the study. Participants from one urban primary school were recruited to take part. The school holds 575 children aged 3 to 11 years and has extensive outdoor areas, including three playgrounds, a garden area, an environmental area, an outdoor classroom and large grassed field. The school was selected for this study due to its large natural and built areas, and their comparative sizes. Twenty five children from one class volunteered, including 12 boys (mean&#x000b1;SD) aged 8.7&#x000b1;0.3 years and thirteen girls (mean&#x000b1;SD) aged 8.5&#x000b1;0.2 years.

Body Mass Index (BMI) and BMI z-scores relative to the individual's age and sex were also calculated <xref rid="pone.0108701-Cole1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Participants also completed a version of the FITNESSGRAM pacer test, which is a valid method by which to assess aerobic fitness in this age group <xref rid="pone.0108701-Meredith1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>Over two consecutive weeks participants were allocated to either play on the school field or the playground during morning and lunch playtime. Participants were first grouped according to whom they would normally play with during playtime. The order in which these groups played in the two areas was then randomised and counterbalanced to eliminate any order effects, with approximately half of the group playing in each area at any one time. In order to randomise playing groups to the two playing areas a representative from each group selected a piece of paper from a bag, numbered with either 1 or 2. Participants who selected number 1 were allocated to the field first, whilst participants who selected number 2 were allocated to the playground first. The school field was surrounded by trees and bushes, whilst the playground consisted of concrete areas surrounded by school buildings. Participants could not see the playground from the field; however the boundary of the field was visible from some areas of the playground. Participants were instructed to play as normal and were free to engage in their chosen activities. Morning playtime lasted for 15 minutes, whilst lunch playtime lasted for one hour including the time taken to eat lunch (approximately 30 minutes).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Measurement of Physical Activity</title><p>PA was monitored during morning and lunch playtime on the final two days of each week using Actigraph GT1M accelerometers. Accelerometers were placed on the right hip and set to record at a 1 second EPOCH. Data was downloaded using the Actilife programme (V4.4.1) and data reduction and transformation took place via Actisci (V0.99b5). Accelerometer cut points developed by Trueth et al <xref rid="pone.0108701-Trueth1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, with the Corder adjustment <xref rid="pone.0108701-Corder1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> were applied to the raw accelerometer counts in order to determine the amount of time spent in MVPA.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Assessment of Self-esteem</title><p>Self-esteem was assessed prior to the start of the project and after lunch time on the final monitoring day of each week using the one-page 10-item Rosenberg self-esteem scale <xref rid="pone.0108701-Rosenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The scale was slightly modified to ensure the language could be understood by the age-group involved. Participants are normally asked how they feel about themselves and whether they strongly agree, agree, disagree or strongly disagree with a list of 10 statements. This was amended to very true, true, not true or definitely not true. Some statements were also modified to make the language more comprehensible, for example &#x0201c;I am able to do things as well as most other people&#x0201d; was changed to &#x0201c;I can do things as well as most other children&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0108701-Wood2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.

Despite the fact that natural environments facilitate unstructured PA <xref rid="pone.0108701-Hyndman1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and that children have a preference for play in nature <xref rid="pone.0108701-Bird1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>; the impact of the playing environment on PA in children has not been established.</p><p>The findings of our single school repeated measures experiment indicated that simply altering the playtime environment could result in an increase in MVPA. In fact, 61.6% of the variance in MVPA was due to the playing environment (indicating a large effect size) and participants engaged in 40% more MVPA when playing on the field compared to the playground, with play on the playground and field contributing 20% and 29% towards the daily activity requirement respectively. School playtime provides one of the most substantial opportunities for children to be active on a daily basis <xref rid="pone.0108701-Ridgers1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, yet research including this study suggests that it is largely underutilized <xref rid="pone.0108701-Ridgers2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and that more PA could be accumulated during school playtimes. It is suggested that 40% of playtime should be spent in MVPA <xref rid="pone.0108701-Ridgers1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. If we take into account the time taken to eat lunch (approximately 30 minutes) participants were provided with approximately 45 minutes of daily playtime. On the playground 28% of playtime was spent in MVPA compared to 39% on the field, resulting in an 11% increase. Some structured playtime interventions have resulted in increases in MVPA as low as 4.5% <xref rid="pone.0108701-Ridgers3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The results of this study therefore indicate that by simply altering the play environment school playtime can be more effectively used for its intended purpose. However, this study was conducted in a single school. Replication of the research in schools throughout the UK would be required to further explore this idea. Furthermore, if playtime interventions were to take place in a natural environment it is possible that playtime could make an even greater contribution to the daily activity requirement.</p><p>In addition to increasing the time spent in MVPA; play in the natural environment also closed the gap between the differences in boys and girls activity levels. It is widely acknowledged that boys engage in more PA than girls <xref rid="pone.0108701-Health1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and this pattern was evident on the playground and field during all playtime periods. However during play on the field boys only engaged in an extra 0.4 minutes, 2.3 minutes and 2.7 minutes of MVPA during morning, lunch and all of playtime respectively, compared to 1.8, 4.2 and 5.8 minutes on the playground respectively. Whilst the interaction effect between the environment and sex was only significant during morning playtime; there was a trend for higher increases in girls MVPA when playing on the field. Girls engaged in an extra 59% MVPA during morning play, 72% during lunch play and 68% for all of playtime combined when playing in nature. Thus for girls, playtime interventions which take place in natural environments are likely to be the most effective at increasing MVPA. However, participants were not given an option as to which environment they wanted to play in. It would be interesting for future research to establish children's environmental preferences and whether preferred environments are associated with increased MVPA.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Secondary Aim</title><p>The secondary aim of this study was to determine whether playing in a natural environment provided additive benefits for children's self-esteem. The benefits of Green Exercise for self-esteem are widely acknowledged in adults <xref rid="pone.0108701-Bowler1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108701-Barton1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>; however there are no additive benefits for adolescent's self-esteem <xref rid="pone.0108701-Wood1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108701-Reed1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108701-Wood2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Whilst PA alone improves self-esteem in children <xref rid="pone.0108701-Ekeland1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>; the results of this study indicate that PA in natural environments does not have an additive effect. These findings support those of Barton et al <xref rid="pone.0108701-Barton2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, who found no additive benefit for self-esteem of a nature-based playtime intervention. This lack of effect can be attributed to children's low levels of interaction with nature. The current generation of youth spend less time interacting with nature than previous generations <xref rid="pone.0108701-Bird1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>; with only 10% of children having regular contact with nature compared to the 40% of adults who did so 30&#x02013;40 years ago <xref rid="pone.0108701-Natural1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Young people spend more of their time indoors and may have developed a disconnection and lack of understanding as a consequence <xref rid="pone.0108701-Bird1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. For benefits to occur it is proposed that an individual needs to be &#x0201c;connected&#x0201d; to nature in some way <xref rid="pone.0108701-Bratman1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Thus children, like adolescents, might not have received additive benefits from the green exercise as they do not experience the same level of connection to the natural world as adults. This idea is only speculative; but would go some way to explaining the lack of additive benefits for self-esteem in both children and adolescents <xref rid="pone.0108701-Wood1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108701-Reed1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. However, it is possible that children need more direct interaction with nature to receive benefits. Simply playing within a natural environment is unlikely to promote direct engagement.</p><p>In a previous school-based Green Exercise study in adolescents it was also proposed that the school environment may not provide a suitable condition for participants to receive benefits from green exercise <xref rid="pone.0108701-Reed1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Self-esteem is suggested to be enhanced through the ability of natural spaces to provide a distraction from daily stresses <xref rid="pone.0108701-Pretty2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108701-Reed1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The school environment may actually provide a direct source of stress for children, thus performing green exercise within school may not have the same impact on self-esteem as performing green exercise outside of the school day.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Limitations and Recommendations</title><p>The current study has a number of limitations. The Rosenberg Self-esteem scale is open to what is known as a ceiling and floor effect. Participants may rate themselves as having a high self-esteem at the start of the study, but feel better following the PA. As a high score has already been achieved; it may be difficult to quantify this improvement. In the current study the starting self-esteem score was 28.8, out of a possible 40. Participants were therefore experiencing a relatively high initial self-esteem, limiting the possible magnitude of improvements. Rosenberg's self-esteem scale is also typically used as a trait scale and may have reduced the studies sensitivity. Future research would benefit from the use of a state self-esteem scale <xref rid="pone.0108701-Reed1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108701-Heatherton1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. The novelty effect of wearing the accelerometers also needs to be considered, however the playing conditions were randomised in order to eliminate this effect. Furthermore, activity was measured at the end of each playing week to address the novelty of the change in playing area. The process of randomisation might have also introduced a degree of bias into the study as the participants were grouped according to whom they would normally play with prior to randomisation. However, if this had not been part of the randomisation process, the inability to play with normal friendship groups may have adversely affected MVPA and impacted on the ability of the study to assess the effect of the change in playing area on MVPA.</p><p>The use of one primary school could also be considered as a study limitation. It would be beneficial for future research to examine the impact of Green Exercise in schools from contrasting areas of the UK including urban, rural and sub-urban as research indicates that activity levels may vary between children from different areas <xref rid="pone.0108701-Sandercock1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Interventions requiring direct interaction with and use of nature would also be beneficial, as they may result in children developing a relationship with nature, which could in turn result in enhanced self-esteem.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The current study assessed the impact of the playing environment on the PA and self-esteem of children from one primary school. The natural environment led to increases in MVPA during all playtime periods, and particularly in girls. However, the effects of green exercise on children's self-esteem were no greater when playing on the field. The promising trend for the effect of the natural environment on MVPA indicates that interventions aimed at increasing MVPA in line with recommendations should incorporate the use of natural environments. We therefore suggest that schools should encourage greater use of the school field and natural areas of the school in order to promote greater participation in PA amongst their students.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0108701.s001"><label>Raw data S1</label><caption><p>
