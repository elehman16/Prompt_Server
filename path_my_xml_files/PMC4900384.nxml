Due to cardiac problems of patients, in catheter laboratories, drugs which provide adequate sedation besides the ones with least adverse effects on hemodynamic and respiratory functions are preferred. However, in many clinical conditions of sedation practices, the brain may be exposed to hypoxia due to the supply demand imbalance of oxygen. Moreover, during sedation, events that can disturb the cerebral oxygen delivery consumption balance may develop without any changes observed with the routine intraoperative monitoring techniques, thus these changes are generally not noticed. Cerebral oximetry provides an indirect assessment of cerebral tissue perfusion. One of the devices used for this purpose is Foresight<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (CAS Medical Systems, Branford, Connecticut) which is a bedside device that can monitorize cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (SctO<sub>2</sub>) continuously and noninvasively.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] It doesn&#x02019;t need to measure the initial value. Measuring the oxygen saturation value below 50-55% is, independent to the initial value, considered to be high-risk.</p><p>In children, propofol is one of the drugs commonly used for sedation procedures; on the other hand, dexmedetomidine has also been recently appeared in the literature. There are studies that evaluate the effects of both drugs on cerebral oxygenation during sedation practices, separately. Since there has been no comparative study appeared so far, this study seems to be initial to compare the effects of both drugs on cerebral oxygenation in catheter laboratories in children.</p><p>Mainly, the aim of the study is to compare the effects of dexmedetomidine and propofol, which are preferred agents for pediatric catheterization procedures, on cerebral oxygen saturation by using Foresight<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A prospective, randomized study was designed on children with planned diagnostic cardiac catheterization, following approval of Mersin University Medical Faculty, Evaluation Committee for Scientific Research. The informed consents were obtained, as well. Randomization was performed by a statistical expert who was unaware of the designed study by randomization software developed by the Biostatistics Department. A total of 44 patients (ages between 1 and 18) who admitted for diagnostic cardiac catheterization to the Pediatric Cardiology Unit of Mersin University Medical Faculty, Health Research and Practice Center and with the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) clinical scores of I-II were included to the study. In addition, all the patients have noncyanotic heart disease.</p><p>Neurological problems (cerebral palsy, mental retardation, etc.,), sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobin disorders, hemodynamic instability, cyanotic heart diseases, history of hypersensitivity against the applied sensor were determined as exclusion criteria of the study.</p><p>Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients (age, gender, body weight, ASA score, Hb value, and duration of the procedure) were recorded.</p><p>Diagnosis of the patients is showed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Diagnosis of the patients</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Diagnosis</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>n</italic></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">VSD</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ASD</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PDA</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MVP</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PS</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PH</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MVP</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">VSD + ASD</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">VSD + AVP</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">VSD + PDA</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">VSD + PH</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">VSD + aortic coarctation</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">VSD + TF</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ASD + MVP</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ASD + PS</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ASD + PH</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>VSD: Ventricular septal defect, ASD: Atrial septal defect, PDA: Patent ductus arteriosus, MVP: Mitral valve prolapse, PS: Pulmonary stenosis, PH: Pulmonary hypertension, AVP: Aortic valve prolapse, TF: Tricuspid failure</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>In all cases, cardiac catheterization was performed by the same pediatric cardiologist and the average durations of the procedure were also recorded. During the catheterization procedure, heart rate, noninvasive blood pressure (mean), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), and respiratory rates of the patients were also monitorized. Five minutes after catheterization, arterial blood gas analysis was performed by the sample obtained from the femoral artery.</p><p>All patients were followed up in the mode of spontaneous respiration, breathing room air. Oxygen supplementation when SpO<sub>2</sub> fell under 90% and respiratory support in case of hypercapnia were planned. In both groups, local infiltrative anesthesia with 1% lidocaine was performed by the pediatric cardiologist before catheterization. As for the process of the sedation; propofol/midazolam and dexmedetomidine/midazolam were given. Group propofol (group P), (<italic>n</italic> = 22) consisted of patients whose induction of sedation was made by midazolam 0.5 mg intravenous (iv) + propofol 1 m/kg (iv), and the sedation of group dexmedetomidine (group D), (<italic>n</italic> = 22) was made by midazolam 0.5 mg (iv) + dexmedetomidine 1 mcg/kg (iv).</p><p>Sedation levels of the patients were assessed by using the quantitative sedation scale and they were considered to be sufficient when the sedation score permitted 2&#x02013;3 interventions. Following the procedure, patients were taken to the recovery room and assessed by the recovery score created by the Connecticut Children's Medical Center. Throughout the recovery period, vital signs were aimed to be kept stable within acceptable limits and consciousness level to be returned to the pre-procedure level. Patients are having recovery scores of 7&#x02013;10 were sent to the pediatric cardiology inpatient service.</p><p>Cardiac side effects that occurred during sedation procedures were determined as more than 30% increase in heart rate or 30% decrease in blood pressure, according to the definitions used by pediatric sedation research consortium.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Respiratory depression was considered as hypoxia (SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c;93%), hypercapnia, airway obstruction/apnea. Other side effects occurring during sedation procedure (nausea, vomiting, agitation, seizures) were also recorded.</p><p>SctO<sub>2</sub> was monitorized by cerebral oximetry device (Foresight<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) (CAS Medical Systems, Branford, Connecticut, USA) throughout the sedation. Foresight<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> fiber-optic sensors were placed at the right and left frontal regions, 1 cm above the eyebrows of the patients. To avoid problems possibly caused by ambient lighting, sensors were covered with opaque plastic clothing. After right and left SctO<sub>2</sub> measured, average values were used for data analysis. Any changes of cerebral oxygen saturation more than 20% compared to the baseline values were considered as desaturation.</p><p>The hemodynamic and SctO<sub>2</sub> values of the patients and their sedation levels were assessed at five separate points of duration:</p><p>

On the basis of the distribution, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test and Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-test were used in order to test the mean difference between two groups.

Because decreases in cerebral oxygen saturation may not cause any changes in routine intraoperative monitoring techniques (heart rate, blood pressure, pulse oximetry).[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In sedation practice, as in many other clinical conditions, the brain may be exposed to ischemia due to disorders in oxygen supply-demand balance. In this study, there has been a statistically significant but clinically insignificant decrease in SctO<sub>2</sub> in dexmedetomidine group compared to propofol group that undergoing pediatric cardiac catheterization.</p><p>In the literature, 15&#x02013;20% decrease in the baseline value of SctO<sub>2</sub> has been suggested as the best threshold value to predict cerebral ischemia; however, performed studies have shown that SctO<sub>2</sub> values decreasing below 50, even for a short period of time, resulted in significant cognitive or neurological damage, extended morbidity, and increased hospital costs.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] In this study, no SctO<sub>2</sub> value defined as cerebral desaturation (&#x0003c;50) was detected in both groups during sedation procedure.</p><p>Propofol leads to an increase in cerebrovascular resistance while it decreases cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] It has also been demonstrated by transcranial Doppler study with dexmedetomidine, in a dose depended on manner, leads to decrease in cerebral blood flow. However, studies concerning the effects of both drugs on cerebral oxygen saturation have conflicting results in the literature. For instance, Michenfender[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] showed that following propofol administration, the relationship between cerebral flow and metabolism was preserved, and SctO<sub>2</sub> saturation remained unchanged. Nevertheless, in another study, it was demonstrated that propofol changed the flow-metabolism relationship in favor of metabolism and decreased the SctO<sub>2</sub> value dependedly.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] LeBlanc <italic>et al</italic>., in the study on children having cardiac surgical operation, showed that propofol did not interfere with cerebral oxygenation and metabolism which was suggested due to the effect of propofol on stabilization of energy balance in mitochondrial level.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] On the other hand, Drummond measured cerebral tissue oxygenation during the administration of dexmedetomidine for neurovascular surgery and determined that dexmedetomidine neither decreased cerebral oxygenation nor disturbed cerebral metabolism.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] On the contrary, Rooyen <italic>et al</italic>., found out that dexmedetomidine decreased cerebral tissue oxygenation, but they reported that this situation was clinically insignificant. This result seems to be remarkably parallel to our study. In previous studies, the effect of dexmedetomidine on alpha-adrenoceptors located on vessels of cerebral pia and related vasoconstriction were demonstrated.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Hence, it was assumed that the difference of SctO<sub>2</sub> between two groups was probably due to cerebral arterial vasoconstriction created by the alpha-2 effect of dexmedetomidine and consequent changes in cerebral oxygen consumption.</p><p>Decrease in SctO<sub>2</sub> in group D compared to group <italic>P</italic> may be considered due to a decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) which can affect cerebral oxygen consumption. However, in our study, when compared to baseline values, neither decrease nor increase of MAP over 30% affecting autoregulation was observed during the post-induction period in patient groups. In addition, though a similar decrease in MAP was observed in group P, only SctO<sub>2</sub> decreased in group D. Consequently, propofol might be assumed to be more effective on cerebral metabolic rate comparing to dexmedetomidine.</p><p>Padmanabhan <italic>et al</italic>., have evaluated cerebral oxygenation levels in children during sedation practice out of the operation room using near infrared spectroscopy and have not detected any decrease in cerebral oxygenation in children with administered propofol and dexmedetomidine.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Besides, they have determined that, as a side effect, hypercapnia was more effective than hypoxia on cerebral oxygenation. In their study, they have detected cerebral desaturation in five patients, with 2 of them having only hypercapnia and 3 of them having both hypercapnia and hypoxia. However, they found out that cerebral oxygenation was normal in two patients having hypercapnia.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In our study, a total of three patients had hypercapnia, with 2 of them in group D and one of them in group P. However, cerebral desaturation was detected in none of these patients. This situation may be related to the short duration of these side effects which is also stated in the literature. The most remarkable point in our study is the detection of a decrease in SctO<sub>2</sub> in especially 5<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> min compared to baseline values in group D without any hemodynamic and respiratory disturbances at similar sedation levels.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kazan</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Bracco</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Hemmerling</surname><given-names>TM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Reduced cerebral oxygen saturation measured by absolute cerebral oximetry during thoracic surgery correlates with postoperative complications</article-title><source>Br J Anaesth</source><year>2009</year><volume>103</volume><fpage>811</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19918024</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cravero</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name><name><surname>Blike</surname><given-names>GT</given-names></name><name><surname>Beach</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Gallagher</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Hertzog</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name><name><surname>Havidich</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Incidence and nature of adverse events during pediatric sedation/anesthesia for procedures outside the operating room: Report from the Pediatric Sedation Research Consortium</article-title><source>Pediatrics</source><year>2006</year><volume>118</volume><fpage>1087</fpage><lpage>96</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16951002</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pollard</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Prough</surname><given-names>DS</given-names></name><name><surname>DeMelo</surname><given-names>AE</given-names></name><name><surname>Deyo</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Uchida</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Stoddart</surname><given-names>HF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Validation in volunteers of a near-infrared spectroscope for monitoring brain oxygenation <italic>in vivo</italic>
