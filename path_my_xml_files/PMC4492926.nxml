The volume of diagnostic tests performed in the UK National Health Service (NHS) has increased dramatically in recent years due to technological innovation and an ageing population [<xref rid="pone.0128637.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Doctors order diagnostic tests for a variety of reasons other than for making a diagnosis [<xref rid="pone.0128637.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Research using cognitive psychology suggests that sensitivity and specificity are generally poorly understood by clinicians [<xref rid="pone.0128637.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128637.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and are often confused with predictive values [<xref rid="pone.0128637.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128637.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128637.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Clinicians tend to overestimate the impact of a positive test result on the probability of disease [<xref rid="pone.0128637.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128637.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and this overestimation increases with decreasing pre-test probabilities of disease [<xref rid="pone.0128637.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The most informative measures for clinicians may be estimates of the post-test probability of disease, which can be presented as a range corresponding to different pre-test probabilities. However, there has been little research into the most appropriate graphical, tabular and statistical summaries of test characteristics, and whether these have any influence on clinical management. Graphical displays (such as forest plots, (summary) receiver operator characteristics (S)ROC plots, likelihood ratio nomograms and probability modifying plots) are under-used in both primary diagnostic accuracy studies and systematic reviews [<xref rid="pone.0128637.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Clinicians and medical students find interpretation of natural frequencies [<xref rid="pone.0128637.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the joint frequency of two events i.e. number of people with disease who have a positive test, easier than simple percentages or probabilities such as sensitivity or specificity [<xref rid="pone.0128637.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Six previous trials [<xref rid="pone.0128637.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128637.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128637.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] have compared health professionals&#x02019; ability to estimate post-test probability for different methods of presentation of diagnostic information. Four of these were small (&#x0003c;300 participants) and only one evaluated of a graphical method of presenting diagnostic information. In all but one of these studies the primary outcome was the ability to derive a post-test probability rather than the influence of the presentation on clinical care. The single study evaluating effects on clinical care [<xref rid="pone.0128637.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] only provided data on sensitivity and specificity with and without definitions, and did not evaluate graphical presentations.</p><p>We conducted the first large randomised controlled trial (RCT) assessing the influence of different formats for presenting diagnostic test results on clinicians&#x02019; understanding and on reported clinical management.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><p>The study received ethical approval from the Frenchay Research Ethics Committee (10/H0107/8). Participants were recruited via a UK-based online network for medical doctors. Participants who completed the module were also given the option of completing a further tutorial (slide presentation, short video, or long video) on diagnostic tests, for which they could download a certificate of completion to add to their Continuing Professional Development (CPD) portfolio.</p><sec id="sec007"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Our study was advertised on the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doctors.net.uk">doctors.net.uk</ext-link> website from July to November 2012 using a banner headline. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Doctors.net.uk">Doctors.net.uk</ext-link> is the UK&#x02019;s largest online network for medical doctors, with a total membership of 198,000 of whom approximately 49,000 access the network during any one week. Dr Wendy Peek (general practitioner) also wrote a blog about the pros and cons of ordering diagnostic tests and included a link to the module. This blog is emailed to around 10,000 doctors. In addition, a banner advert was created which directed the individual doctors to a brief explanation of the study and a link to the module. Before proceeding with the web-based module, participants were asked to give their consent for their data from the study to be stored and used for research purposes by clicking a box on the web form. This was felt to be an appropriate method of obtaining consent by the ethics committee as there was no direct contact between the researchers and the participants. They were also given the option of providing contact details for entry into a prize draw. Participants were randomly allocated to one of four data presentation formats by means of an algorithm embedded in the web page source code using simple randomization. Participants were unaware (&#x0201c;blinded&#x0201d;) that they were randomly allocated to one of these formats.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Nature of the intervention</title><p>We designed an interactive web-based module based on a case-vignette approach that has been used successfully elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0128637.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128637.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. All participants were presented with a hypothetical scenario (<bold><xref rid="pone.0128637.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>) that we constructed. We chose this approach rather than using a real medical condition so that the participants could not be influenced by previous knowledge, experience or guidelines for any specific real clinical condition.

We repeated analyses using a multivariable model to adjust for any imbalance in baseline covariates (gender, age group, postgraduate education, self-rated confidence and professional status). We also estimated effects of presentation on management after conditioning on the post-test probability modelled as a continuous variable (estimates were similar when conditioning for tertiles of post-test probability). Answers to questions were coded as correct (allowing 1% in either direction for rounding errors and because given the resolution of the probability-modifying plot, we felt most people who did this correctly would read 85% rather than 86%), incorrect, or blank/don&#x02019;t know. We did a post-hoc sensitivity analysis allowing a greater margin of error (+/- 3%). A pre-study sample size calculation estimated that we would need a sample size of 800 participants (200 per arm) to detect differences of 11&#x02013;15% in preference for treatment if the probability of treatment ranged between 20 to 80% with 80% power at 5% significance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec014"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec015"><title>Participants and randomisation</title><p>We do not know precisely how many doctors viewed the banner advert, but we do know that 2,510 out of around 10,000 doctors opened the email from Dr Wendy Peek.

The effects of these presentations on doctors&#x02019; intention to treat actively (rather than order a more invasive biopsy procedure or not treat) appeared mediated by their effects on doctors&#x02019; ability to calculate the post-test probability of disease. We believe that this is the first study to demonstrate such an effect on reported clinical behaviour. If the responses to this hypothetical example also apply to real-world clinical decisions, then these results suggest that presentation of clinical diagnostic data could be easily improved with the use of computer assisted decision support algorithms that present test characteristics in more accessible ways.</p><p>We have shown, like other previous studies, that doctors are generally poor at using the results of a diagnostic test in relation to pre-existing information on a patient to calculate the post-test probability of disease. Younger age, hospital doctor status, and postgraduate education were all associated with better baseline knowledge. Self-rated confidence was positively associated with better baseline knowledge but doctors who scored worse on the knowledge quiz were less likely to undertake the optional tutorial, thereby contributing to the &#x0201c;inverse knowledge&#x0201d; gap.</p><p>We have undertaken a systematic review of the interpretation of diagnostic test studies by health professionals and identified six previous randomised controlled trials, of which two tested doctors&#x02019; ability to use Bayesian reasoning and four compared other presentation formats (see <bold>Appendix 2</bold>) [<xref rid="pone.0128637.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128637.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128637.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. They generally tested knowledge or the ability to correctly predict the post-test probability either comparing different measures of accuracy or different presentation formats (probability versus natural frequency). Providing further information was better than not doing so, with natural frequencies out-performing simple percentages. One study showed that a visual aid was better regardless of what data were presented [<xref rid="pone.0128637.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Only one study [<xref rid="pone.0128637.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] also went on to test how this information may change clinical behaviour. It did not find that the presentation of data on sensitivity and specificity, with or without definitions, altered reported clinical management but participants with a lower post-test probability for pertussis infection in a 5 month old girl were more likely to stop erythromycin therapy and discharge the patient form hospital. In this study we found that the probability modifying plot slightly out-performed the natural frequencies both in terms of the correct estimation of the post-test probability and importantly influencing clinical behaviour.</p><sec id="sec020"><title>Strengths &#x00026; weaknesses</title><p>The relatively large sample size allowed us to compare four different intervention arms. We used a hypothetical disease example because we wished to avoid any influence of pre-existing attitudes or knowledge towards existing tests and clinical conditions. We chose a scenario where failure to treat a true case could result in long-term serious disability but alternative diagnostic measures required an invasive biopsy with obvious morbidity and potential mortality. Because the scenario was artificial, participants may not have applied the same reasoning as they would for a real clinical condition. However, as there was no &#x0201c;correct answer&#x0201d; to our management question we have no reason to believe that the doctors completing the module were biased or altered their treatment threshold compared to a real world clinical problem. It is possible that participants did not take the scenario seriously. This should have biased our results to the null. A potential limitation of our study is that participants were self-selected and most likely represent doctors most interested in continuing education. However the finding that particular ways to present information on text accuracy are more helpful to doctors is likely to be generalizable to less knowledgeable or motivated groups. We only tested the different types of presentation at a fixed pre-test probability of 50%. We cannot therefore be certain that our findings would generalize to lower or higher pre-test probabilities though in these scenarios diagnostic information is less likely to alter a clinical diagnosis or treatment decisions.</p><p>Whilst doctors vary in their individual trade-offs between treatment benefits and harms, greater diagnostic accuracy is likely to improve the quality of their treatment decisions. With the advance of sophisticated clinical support systems [<xref rid="pone.0128637.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], future randomised controlled trials should compare real care decisions based on the provision of additional diagnostic data to routine test ordering behaviour. Medical schools and the Royal Colleges should ensure that medical students and doctors are assessed in their ability to interpret diagnostic data. Such skills are not merely of academic interest but also influence patient care and health care costs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0128637.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Appendix 1: Second- post-tutorial test; Appendix 2: Summary of six previous RCTs that have tested the interpretation of diagnostic test data.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0128637.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0128637.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Table A: Evaluation of baseline knowledge of diagnostic concepts, by trial arm; Table B: Odds ratios for answering 3+ <italic>versus</italic> 0&#x02013;2 questions correctly, by participant characteristics; Table C: Results of post-tutorial test, by choice of tutorial.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0128637.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Dr. Virginia Knight (ILRT, University of Bristol) for writing the code for the web-based module.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0128637.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
