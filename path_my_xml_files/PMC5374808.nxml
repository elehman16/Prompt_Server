This goal is best-accomplished with a multimodal approach.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Regional and neuraxial technique can provide superior analgesia compared to systemic drugs. Spinal anesthesia using only local anesthetics is associated with relatively short duration of action and thus early analgesic intervention is needed in the postoperative period. A number of adjuvants such as midazolam, clonidine, dexmedetomidine etc. have been used to prolong the duration of spinal anesthesia. Fentanyl is a potent, short-acting, highly lipophilic, synthetic opioid. It has been commonly used as an adjuvant for postoperative analgesia in neuraxial block.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Clonidine is a alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist with a predominant alpha-2 action (a<sub>2</sub>:a<sub>1</sub>: 200:1).[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Neuraxial placement of clonidine inhibits spinal substance <italic>P</italic> release and nociceptive neuron firing produced by noxious stimulation.

Three hundred twenty eight female patients of 30-50 years, weighing between 45-65 kg, belonging to American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I or II and scheduled for abdominal hysterectomy were included in the present study. Patients with a contraindication to spinal anesthesia or major neurological, cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, renal disease, or coagulation abnormalities were excluded from the study.</p><p>The procedure was explained to the patient, and written informed consent was taken. In the holding room, the concept of a visual analog scale (VAS),[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] which consists of a 100 mm line with zero denoting no pain at all and 100 denoting the worst possible pain, was introduced to the patient. Randomization was done by chit in box method. Patients were divided into four groups each consisting of 82 patients. (<italic>n</italic> = 82).</p><p>Group bupivacaine (group B) received 15 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine (HB) intrathecally, group bupivacaine clonidine (group BC) received 15 mg of hyperbaric 0.5% bupivacaine plus 25 &#x000b5;g clonidine hydrochloride intrathecally, group bupivacaine fentanyl (group BF) received 15 mg of 0.5% HB plus 25 &#x000b5;g fentanyl citrate intrathecally, and group bupivacaine clonidine fentanyl (group BCF) received 15 mg of 0.5% HB plus 25 &#x000b5;g clonidine hydrochloride and 25 &#x000b5;g fentanyl citrate intrathecally. In all four groups, normal saline was added to make the total volume 4 ml.</p><p>In the operating room, fasting status, consent, PAC were checked, and intravenous access was secured. After the establishment of intravenous (IV) line and attachment of standard monitors [non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), electrocardiography (ECG), and pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>)], all patients were premedicated with midazolam 1 mg intravenously. Hydration consisted of 10 ml/kg Ringer lactate solution preoperatively and 10 ml/kg/hr after spinal anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia was performed in the operating room at the L<sub>3</sub>-L<sub>4</sub> interspace, with the patient in the left lateral position. A volume of 4 ml of the study drug was injected over 30s through a 25-gauge spinal needle. The patient was placed in the supine position with a 15&#x000b0; head down tilt immediately after spinal injection to achieve a block level of T5-T6. The drug combination was prepared by one anesthetist and administered by another anesthetist who was unaware of the nature of drug solution. All the observations were done by the second anesthetist.</p><p>Intraoperatively the level of sensory block, onset of motor block, patient's hemodynamic parameters, and sedation score were recorded. The level of sensory block was assessed using a 22-gauge needle and recorded as a loss of sensation to pin prick, checking in a caudal to cephalic direction. Motor block was recorded according to the Bromage scale.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] NIBP was recorded at 5 min interval throughout the surgery and HR and SPO<sub>2</sub> were recorded continuously. Fluid administration was continued intraoperatively, and a decrease in mean arterial pressure &#x0003e;15% below the preanesthetic baseline value was treated with incremental doses of injection mephenteremine 5 mg intravenous (IV). A decrease in HR below 50 beats/min was treated with incremental doses of atropine 0.3 mg IV. Intraoperative nausea was treated with ondansetron 4 mg IV.</p><p>Postoperatively, time for two segment regression and total duration of motor block was recorded. VAS was assessed at 2 h interval and at the time of giving rescue analgesia. Adverse effects (hemodynamic changes, respiratory depression, shivering, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and headache) were observed over 24 h. The duration of effective analgesia was defined as the time from intrathecal drug administration to the patient's first request for rescue analgesic. This constituted the primary end point of the study, though the patients were kept under observation for a total period of 24 h. Patients were allowed to receive rescue analgesics on demand. Gluteal intramuscular diclofenac (75 mg) was given as rescue analgesic. The duration of motor block was defined as the time of attainment of Bromage grade IV block (onset) until reversal to Bromage grade II.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The expected mean VAS among A, B, and C group were 23 (&#x000b1;71), 17 (&#x000b1;6), and 2 (&#x000b1;1), respectively, and the expected mean duration of time for the request of first analgesic in (A), (B) and (C) were 137 (&#x000b1;35), 183 (&#x000b1;80), and 215 (&#x000b1;79) min, respectively (as per seed article).[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The sample size required to determine these differences in three groups at 95% confidence interval and 80% power would be 82 in each group.

Khanna and Singh[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] reported an increase in duration of sensory block, improvement in intraoperative analgesia, and good pain relief in the postoperative period along with high incidence of pruritus and desaturation with fentanyl added to intrathecal bupivacaine in geriatric patients.</p><p>Dobrydnjov <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] concluded that the addition of clonidine 15 &#x003bc;g and 30 mg to bupivacaine prolonged time to first analgesic request and decreased postoperative pain with minimal risk of hypotension.
