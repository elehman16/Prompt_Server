Subjects were randomized 2:1 to CMC-HA (n = 244) or CMC alone (n = 121) with dosage at least four times per day, along with their habitual lens care system. At baseline and at days 7, 30, 60, and 90, subject-completed questionnaires, bulbar conjunctival staining, LWE, contact lens distance visual acuity (CLDVA), and standard safety measures were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At day 90, CMC-HA performed significantly better than CMC in ocular symptoms including dryness throughout the day (p = 0.006), and burning/stinging throughout the day (p = 0.02) and at the end of the day (p &#x0003c; 0.001). CMC-HA also performed numerically better for dryness at the end of day (p = 0.06). LWE staining was improved in the CMC-HA group at day 90 whereas it increased slightly in the CMC alone group, with a significant between-group difference (p = 0.009). CMC-HA also demonstrated greater reduction in conjunctival staining compared with CMC alone at day 90 (p = 0.08). No differences in CLDVA, contact lens wear time, acceptability, and product use were observed, and safety outcomes were similar between groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The addition of HA to a standard CMC rewetting drop improves clinical performance.

Estimates indicate that more than 39 million individuals use contact lenses in the United States, with approximately 90% wearing daily soft contact lenses.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> However, ocular discomfort and dryness are commonly reported as significant side effects and main reasons for discontinuation.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Several factors may contribute to or exacerbate discomfort and dryness symptoms while wearing lenses, such as trapped debris, reduction of tear flow, excessive evaporation on the surface of contact lenses, long periods of wear, and use of certain medications (e.g. contraceptives).<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Varying effects on tear film quality and ocular surface dryness have been reported with both hard (rigid gas permeable [RGP] materials) and soft (hydrogels and silicone hydrogels) contact lenses.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Individuals with dry eye are particularly vulnerable to discomfort and episodes of visual complaints while wearing contact lenses.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Contact lens wear can also affect the accuracy of the tools used in dry eye diagnosis and evaluating severity. For example, conjunctival and corneal staining with lissamine green and fluorescein dyes are key measures in identifying dry eye signs in symptomatic non&#x02013;contact lens wearers.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> However, in contact lens wearers, conjunctival staining has been shown to have better specificity than corneal staining.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Water content, composition, density, area coverage and depth, as well as deposition and the length of time of lens wear can affect corneal staining, making the test less robust in contact lens wearers.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Lid wiper epitheliopathy (LWE) is a clinical condition characterized by alteration of the epithelium of the portion of the marginal conjunctiva of the eyelid that wipes the ocular surface, diagnosed by staining with fluorescein or lissamine green dyes.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Korb et al. first described the condition in soft contact lens wearers, where 80% of subjects with dry eye symptoms and only 13% of asymptomatic subjects displayed LWE.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In two studies of dry eye subjects and asymptomatic control subjects, the frequency of LWE was six times greater in dry eye subjects compared with asymptomatic controls.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In a study by Yeniad et al., more LWE was detected in contact lens wearers and subjects with dry eye symptoms but no clinical signs than in control subjects.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Both symptomatic and asymptomatic contact lens wearers demonstrated signs of LWE, and the authors concluded that the lid wiper may traumatize and increase the sensitivity of the cornea, resulting in symptoms of dry eye in contact lens wearers without significant clinical signs (i.e. reduced tear break-up time, low Schirmer&#x02019;s score, or significant fluorescein corneal staining).<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>Rewetting drops are typically used to hydrate and lubricate contact lenses and the ocular surface before and during contact lens wear, as well as preventing drying by stabilizing the tear film and reducing surface tension.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Over the past 5 years, a number of topical lubricating formulations containing a variety of ingredients, including polyethylene glycol 400 0.4% and propylene glycol 0.3%,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> biopolymer tamarind seed polysaccharide&#x02013;hyaluronic acid,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and azithromycin ophthalmic solution 1.0%,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> have been studied for alleviating dryness and discomfort associated with contact lens wear.

The study was carried out in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice and International Organization for Standardization 14155:2011 (Clinical investigation of medical devices for human subjects&#x02014;good clinical practice) guidelines. Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval was obtained by each investigator and all subjects provided written informed consent before initiating any study procedures.</p><p>Subjects were recruited via IRB-approved emails, office flyers, and newspaper advertisements. Adapted daily-wear contact lens subjects, 18 years of age or older, using one of six types of FDA-approved contact lenses (Vistakon Acuvue 2; Bausch &#x00026; Lomb PureVision; Ciba Vision Air Optix; Vistakon Acuvue Oasys; CooperVision Biofinity; Bausch &#x00026; Lomb Boston EO, XO, Menicon Z, or equivalent RGP material) were eligible for enrollment. Subjects used an approved lens care system appropriate for insertion, cleaning, and disinfection of the specific type of contact lenses they were wearing, and did not change care systems during the study. Subjects were excluded if they had recent ophthalmic surgery, were using a topical ocular medication other than rewetting drops, or had any ocular or systemic condition that the investigator deemed might interfere with study results or subject participation in the study. Female subjects of childbearing potential and pregnant subjects were allowed to enroll if they met all inclusion/exclusion criteria and agreed to be followed throughout the term of their pregnancy.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Visits and Treatment</title><p>The following six study visits were scheduled: screening (1&#x02013;14 days before baseline), baseline (day 1), and days 7, 30, 60, and 90 follow-up visits. At the baseline visit in each contact lens group, subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive treatment with CMC-HA (Optive Fusion; Allergan plc, Dublin, Ireland) or CMC (Refresh Contacts; Allergan plc). Subjects were instructed to use one to two drops of the study drops in each eye a minimum of four times per day, with one use allowed for preparation of the contact lens by placing one or two drops onto the lens before insertion.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome Measures</title><p>Ocular symptoms associated with contact lens wear were graded on a visual analog scale ranging from 0 (none) to 100 (maximum). The extent of burning/stinging, grittiness/foreign body sensation, dryness, difficult/uncomfortable vision, light sensitivity, and overall ocular pain/discomfort symptoms was assessed for throughout the day and at the end of the day.</p><p>Conjunctival staining and LWE were measured in each eye utilizing lissamine green stain following the Oxford Scheme for the bulbar conjunctiva<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and the method described by Korb et al. for LWE.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Briefly, lissamine green was instilled and staining was evaluated using white light of low-to-moderate intensity (with a diffuser for LWE observation). Conjunctival staining represented by punctate dots was assessed immediately and the sum of nasal and temporal zones graded on a scale of 0 (no dry eye) to 5 (severe dry eye) for each was used as the score for each eye. For LWE assessment, the upper eye lid was everted, carefully avoiding contact with the region of the lid wiper. Individual scores for the horizontal length involved graded from 0 (&#x0003c;2 mm) to 3 (&#x0003e;10 mm) and the sagittal height involved graded from 0 (&#x0003c;25%) to 3 (&#x0003e;75%) were averaged for a final lid wiper staining grade for each eye.</p><p>Additional efficacy measures included contact lens distance visual acuity and contact lens wearing time. Safety was assessed by adverse events monitoring, biomicroscopy (including corneal staining), and reporting of symptoms, problems, and complaints. Study product acceptability and usage were evaluated at each study visit by the Contact Lens Wearing Questionnaire (assessing the subject&#x02019;s contact lens replacement, wearing time, and ocular symptoms associated with contact lens wear), the Study Product Experience Questionnaire (evaluating the subjective experience with the study eye drops in comfort, vision, and tolerability associated with contact lens wear), and the Study Product Usage Questionnaire (reporting the subject&#x02019;s average number of times and how often each day they instilled the study product over the past week and when they last used the study product).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Data Analysis and Statistical Methods</title><p>The analysis sample consisted of all randomized subjects. For ocular symptoms, the analysis of variance model with fixed effects of treatment and contact lens type was used for between-group comparisons and paired <italic>t</italic>-tests were used for within-group comparisons of change from baseline. For conjunctival staining and LWE, baseline and change from baseline at each visit were analyzed as continuous variables for the worse eye at baseline using parametric or nonparametric methods. Post hoc analyses were conducted of all subjects in both the CMC-HA and CMC alone groups combined to assess relationships between LWE severity grade and subject-reported ocular symptoms at baseline. Additional analyses were performed evaluating LWE severity grade among contact lens types in all subjects or within the CMC-HA and CMC treatment groups.</p><p>For other efficacy measures, continuous variables were analyzed using either parametric or nonparametric methods and nominal variables were analyzed using the Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel general association test stratified by contact lens type for between-group comparisons. Adverse events were summarized and tabulated for each treatment group. For all analyses performed, p &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Subjects and Baseline Characteristics</title><p>A total of 365 subjects were enrolled (244 subjects in the CMC-HA group; 121 subjects in the CMC alone group).

In contrast, the change from baseline symptoms scores for CMC alone was significant in only 4 of the 12 comparisons. In addition, the improvement in symptoms was numerically greater in the CMC-HA group compared with the CMC alone group in 11 of the 12 instances.</p><p>Based on analyses of subjects&#x02019; worse eyes at baseline, conjunctival staining and LWE severity were similar between the treatment groups in early follow-up study visits. By day 90, the CMC-HA treatment group demonstrated improvement in conjunctival staining and significantly better LWE staining grade (p = 0.009) compared with the CMC alone treatment group. Although conjunctival and corneal staining are common outcome measures in studies evaluating the efficacy of lubricating eye drops in dry eye, conjunctival staining was a focus in this study, as it has been reported that corneal staining is affected by contact lens&#x02013;related factors such as water content, composition material, wearing time and deposition, as well as the extent (area of coverage), density, and depth of contact lenses.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Subjects enrolled in our study were permitted to wear one of six different FDA-approved soft (hydrogels and silicone hydrogels) and hard (RGP materials) contact lenses, which would have confounded corneal staining results. Corneal staining was assessed as part of the biomicroscopy examination for safety, but due to the above factors, no formal analysis was performed.</p><p>Post hoc analysis revealed some associations between LWE severity and subject-reported ocular symptoms at baseline, where higher LWE grades were correlated with more grittiness/foreign body sensation, dryness, overall ocular pain/uncomfortable vision, and light sensitivity scores (correlation coefficient &#x02248; 0.6&#x02013;0.8) although the correlations did not reach statistical significance. This may be due to limitations of correlation analysis for discrete grading scales such as LWE (there were only seven possible values in the current study).</p><p>No strong correlation between LWE severity and burning/stinging was observed. Lin et al. reviewed published literature on mechanical effects of silicone hydrogel contact lenses and surmised that mechanical irritation likely contributes to LWE and other ocular complications including corneal erosions and papillary conjunctivitis.<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Our findings are consistent with this concept that LWE may be a result of mechanical irritation of the lid wiper from the contact lenses rather than a reaction to irritating chemicals on the ocular surface.</p><p>In addition, analysis of changes in LWE severity among contact lens type demonstrated that by day 90, improvements in LWE were generally observed in subjects wearing all lens types (group IV hydrogel, silicone hydrogel, or RGP) in the CMC-HA group though subjects wearing Acuvue 2 showed better improvement almost reaching significance (p = 0.05) compared with PureVision silicone hydrogel lens wearers. In contrast, subjects wearing RGP contact lenses demonstrated more significant improvements in LWE compared with those wearing silicone hydrogel lens types, as well as subjects wearing Acuvue 2 lenses compared with Air Optix lenses in the CMC alone group. These findings suggest that perhaps RGP lenses benefit more from reduced mechanical irritation from a lower viscosity eye drop (18 centipoise for CMC-HA vs. 2&#x02013;4 centipoise for CMC alone; data on file), but further investigations are required to fully elucidate underlying mechanisms.</p><p>Lid wiper epitheliopathy has been established as a diagnostic sign of dry eye in subjects with dry eye disease and in contact lens wearers,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and LWE severity has been reported to vary depending on lens type.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> To date, there have been no previous studies reported that have specifically investigated the use of rewetting drops and effects on LWE. Although the present study suggests some differences in LWE response in different contact lens types, there was no consistent pattern observed. The previous study by Schulze et al. was a single assessment of LWE in wearers of daily disposable contact lenses,<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> which were not investigated in the current study. The overall level of LWE staining in this successful contact lens wearing population was relatively low and the baseline levels of LWE staining were slightly different between groups, so the clinical significance of the present results is limited. Additional studies are warranted to further characterize effects of contact lens types on LWE, and also among patients selected for higher baseline levels of LWE staining, to better characterize the efficacy of rewetting drops in reducing LWE severity in contact lens wearers.</p><p>Both CMC-HA and CMC rewetting drops were safe and well tolerated; approximately 4% of subjects discontinued during the course of the study. A similar proportion of subjects withdrew from the study due to adverse events in either treatment group. Overall, results from the present study suggest that regular daily use of a rewetting drop containing both CMC and HA polymers reduces ocular symptoms and associated signs in a wide variety of contact lens wearers. Additionally, results of the LWE evaluation and the relationship between LWE severity and subject-reported ocular symptoms further support the utility of LWE as a tool for diagnosing ocular dryness and monitoring effectiveness of lubricating agents.</p></sec><sig-block><sig><bold>Jason J.
