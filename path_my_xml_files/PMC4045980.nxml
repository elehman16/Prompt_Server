This study was designed as a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of Tribulus terrestris in women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder during their fertile years. Sixty seven women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder were randomly assigned to Tribulus terrestris extract (7.5&#x000a0;mg/day) or placebo for 4&#x000a0;weeks. Desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain were measured at baseline and after 4&#x000a0;weeks after the end of the treatment by using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). Two groups were compared by repeated measurement ANOVA test.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Thirty women in placebo group and thirty women in drug group completed the study. At the end of the fourth week, patients in the Tribulus terrestris group had experienced significant improvement in their total FSFI (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), desire (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), arousal (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.037), lubrication (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), satisfaction (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) and pain (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.041) domains of FSFI.

HSDD is a common sexual complaint affecting approximately 1 in 10 adult women in the USA
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and its prevalence appears to be similar in Europe (7%-16%)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and Australia (16%)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. According to some scientific reports the prevalence in Iran is 30%
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Currently there are two therapeutic modalities for women who suffer from the lack of libido: psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. Several drugs have been suggested for treating women&#x02019;s loss of libido including estrogen, methyl testosterone

According to the Iranian Traditional Medicine (ITM) deregulation and disorders of libido in both sexes is considerably common. It is worthy to mention that, ITM is based on principles of Humorist school and four humors (black bile, yellow bile, phlegm and blood), but the mentioned herbal medicine, Tribulus terrestris, has been classified as an experimental remedy because it affects all four humors and boosts the libido.</p><p>Recent scientific studies on medicinal herbs have referred to Tribulus terrestris as an effective drug of women&#x02019;s sex drive

Then a phone interview was scheduled for all 96 women who were selected; and subsequently they were invited for a screening visit after verification of their disorder. The inclusion criteria of the study were: being married and actively living with a partner at least 15&#x000a0;days per month, being in childbearing age, lack and or loss of libido which causes distress, having normal pelvic exam, negative pap smear test conducted at least within past six months, and having normal breast exam. The exclusion criteria were: lack of steady sexual partner, suffering from a serious medical condition (any disease which may force the participant to use drugs during the study), any history of genital tract or breast cancers, suffering from major depression disorder or other psychiatric disorders, menopause, pregnancy, husband&#x02019;s sexual problems and active plans for divorce.

Drug Product Information Form (DPIF) was inscribed on a label attached to the bottle. The specific code was recorded on both questionnaire and participant&#x02019;s data sheet. The DPIF instructions included this information: 7.5&#x000a0;ml of the drug should be used two times a day for four full weeks since the day after the completion of menstruation period. Two days after submitting the drug, the patient was checked by a physician through a phone call in order to make sure that the drug was used correctly. Again, after a week a second phone call was made to make sure of continuity of the mentioned order. Patients, who forgot to use more than three doses of their drugs, were excluded. Another interview according to the DSM-IV-TR criteria for HSDD was made four weeks after completion of the drug therapy, side effects (if any) were checked and FSFI questionnaire was refilled. The participants were allowed to call their therapist during the treatment period.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>The participants filled the FSFI questionnaire

The questionnaire have 19 questions with six domains included desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction and pain, and a general score in which higher scores reflected better sexual activity. Questions 1 and 2 were related to the sexual desire and its score varied between 1.2 and 6. Questions 3, 4, 5 and 6 analyzed arousal of the patient. Another domain of the questionnaire was lubrication which covered questions 7, 8, 9, and 10. The orgasm domain included questions 11, 12 and 13. Questions 14, 15 and 16 all were related to the sexual satisfaction and finally questions 17, 18 and 19 analyzed pain.</p><p>The initial outcome was the assessment of desire and total score of our samples with FSFI before and after intervention. Likewise, different subscales including arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction and pain were compared as the secondary targets using the questionnaire before and after treatment. The FSFI question contained 19 questions which analyzed five domains of women&#x02019;s sexual function.

Compound symmetry assumption was tested using Mauchley&#x02019;s Sphericity test. The time groups cross-product (interaction term) was considered as group differences in their response over time with the baseline values as a covariate in this model.

According to the code recorded on the questionnaire, (before taking drug) it was turned out that two women were from the placebo group and another one was from the drug group. Their reasons for stopping participating at the studying included very sweet taste of the drug (one woman) and anxiety due to using an investigational drug (two women). Another two women were not available after getting off the study; they signed the consent form, but there was no drug available at that time when they were in the center, and they never came back to receive their ration. Between June 2012 and July 2013, participants took part in an interview and then they filled the FSFI questionnaire; then they were assigned randomly in drug and placebo groups. There was a second visit a week after starting pharmacotherapy and third visit was made four weeks after termination of the treatment which was accompanied with the filling of the questionnaire for the second time.

Since the basic findings of two groups were similar, the improved score of the Tribulus group can be attributed to libido boosting effects of the plant. Our findings confirmed what has already been described in the Iranian Traditional Medical textbooks about libido boosting effects of Tribulus. There is also more recent evidence that Tribulus can be used as a libido booster plant in women
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. There may be a possible synergy between Tribulus and FSH-LH mechanism. For instance, one animal experiment showed that mice, injected with 10&#x000a0;mg Tribulus extract, developed thicker theca internal layer and more follicles in comparison with control mice in the same period of time
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Prescribing Tribulus extract for women can increase desire score in women who suffer from loss of sex desire. However, according to our knowledge there has not been any similar research on the impact of Tribulus extract in improving women&#x02019;s sex desire in childbearing age. The effect of testosterone in improving desire in menopausal women has been confirmed by studies that have looked at women&#x02019;s sex drive and how to boost it
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The role of conjugated testosterone in treating lack of sex drive has been emphasized
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Currently testosterone is the only approved drug for treatment of HSDD in menopausal women, particularly for those have surgically-induced menopause
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In one study on women with SSRI induced desire disorder, it was shown that Saffron was an effective herbal remedy which could improve desire
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Another study showed that Bupropion was effective in improving women&#x02019;s desire
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, Tribulus is the only drug which not only improves the sexual desire in women but also it does not have any unexpected side effects in patients.</p><p>Our study showed very clearly through acquired scores of the FSFI questionnaire that patients had significant increase in their scores related to questions about desire, arousal and satisfaction. Our results indicated a considerable improvement in scores of desire. Thus, Tribulus had apparent boosting effects on desire, and it was able to improve sexual satisfaction and sexual behavior.</p><p>Although our study showed the effect of Tribulus on improving the desire, it must be noticed that Iranian women are generally modest and shy because of their cultural beliefs about sexual concepts, and our sample size was small. In order to produce consistent results and more reliable evidence, more studies with a large sample size must be carried out.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Tribulus terrestris may safely and effectively improve desire in women with HSDD.
