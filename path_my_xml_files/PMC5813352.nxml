Patients were randomized to receive 14 days of treatment with <italic>L. brevis</italic> CD2 lozenges, <italic>L. brevis</italic> CD2 lozenges with oral doxycycline (100 mg tablet once daily), or doxycycline alone.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The <italic>L. brevis</italic> CD2 lozenges (Inersan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, VSL Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Towson, MD, USA) contain 10<sup>9</sup> colony-forming units per lozenge, sweetening agents such as mannitol, aspartame, and fructose, anticaking agents including talc, silicon dioxide, and magnesium stearate, and having banana flavoring.</p><p>Saliva samples were taken on day 0, after which patients underwent scaling and root planing.

The samples of saliva were cultured to determine the counts of lactobacilli and <italic>A. actinomycetemcomitans</italic>. Clinical variables were recorded as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation. For both bacterial and clinical outcome measures, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare data from the different groups at each time interval.

Counts peaked at 2 months in the probiotic groups. The <italic>L. brevis</italic> CD2 alone group showed the highest peak counts, and counts in this group remained above baseline at 5 months [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Lactobacilli counts in the <italic>L. brevis</italic> CD2 plus doxycycline group peaked at just under 60% of the levels seen with <italic>L. brevis</italic> CD2 alone and had returned to baseline at 5 months. Lactobacilli counts were close to 0 at 5 months in the doxycycline alone group.

This effect appears to be equivalent to that produced by doxycycline. No synergy was observed when the two agents were administered concomitantly. Concentrations of lactobacilli remained elevated 5 months after treatment with <italic>L. brevis</italic> CD2 alone, but not when <italic>L. brevis</italic> CD2 was administered with doxycycline. Comparing probiotics with antibiotics, probiotics could be used as an alternative to antibiotics in the treatment of patients with aggressive periodontitis, without the risks of promoting antibiotic resistance and/or disturbing the body microflora.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This study was funded by CD Pharma Pvt., Ltd.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>We express our sincere thanks to Mr. Kanwaldeep Chadda, Country Manager, CD Pharma Pvt., Ltd., for providing the Inersan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> lozenges which were needed for the study.
