The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) sponsored a multicenter, randomized clinical trial to address treatment and progression of youth-onset type 2 diabetes. The primary objective of Treatment Options for type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) was to compare the ability of three treatments to maintain glycemic control. Treatment with metformin plus rosiglitazone (M+R) was superior to metformin alone (M) in preventing loss of glycemic control in youth with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Metformin plus an intensive lifestyle program (M+L) was not different from M or M+R. Neither BMI at baseline nor BMI over time was a determinant of treatment failure, although BMI (up to 60 months of treatment) increased most in M+R and least in M+L (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Analyses of the differential effects of treatment on fat and lean mass showed that subjects treated with M+R had the greatest increase in fat mass between baseline and 24 months. The current report presents a more in-depth analysis of BMI and other markers of adiposity by treatment group, including subgroup comparisons by sex and race/ethnicity. The analysis addresses whether changes in measures of body composition, including adiposity and bone, were associated with changes in measures of durable glycemic control in response to treatment.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>TODAY sample and study design</title><p>The TODAY study rationale, design, and methods have been reported in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) and are described briefly. Between July 2004 and February 2009, 699 youth were enrolled that met the following criteria: 10&#x02013;17 years of age, diagnosed with type 2 diabetes &#x0003c;2 years according to American Diabetes Association (ADA) diagnostic glucose criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), BMI &#x02265;85th percentile, and negative for diabetes autoantibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Subjects also had to successfully complete a 2&#x02013;6 month prerandomization run-in period in which they demonstrated mastery of standard diabetes education, were weaned from nonstudy diabetes medications, demonstrated tolerance of metformin up to a dose of 1,000 mg twice daily but no less than 500 mg twice daily, attained glycemic control (HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;8% [64 mmol/mol] monthly for at least 2 months) on metformin alone, and demonstrated adherence to study medication and visit attendance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The primary objective was to compare the three treatment arms (M, M+R, and M+L) on time to treatment failure, i.e., loss of glycemic control defined as either HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;8% (64 mmol/mol) over a 6-month period or inability to wean from temporary insulin therapy within 3 months after acute metabolic decompensation. After treatment failure, rosiglitazone was stopped, if applicable, and participants continued on metformin plus insulin for diabetes management. The protocol was approved by an external evaluation committee convened by the NIDDK and the institutional review board of each participating institution. All participants provided both informed parental consent and minor child assent.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Anthropometric outcomes</title><p>Staff were trained and certified to perform all measures. Height and weight were collected at all visits and waist circumference and abdominal height annually. Height measurements were made using a clinical stadiometer, and weight was measured in duplicate using a Seca scale (model 882; seca, Hanover, MA) with a third measurement obtained if the first measurements differed &#x0003e;0.2 kg. Scales and stadiometers were calibrated at least every 8 weeks, and scale accuracy was checked against 150-lb weights every 4 weeks. BMI was calculated as weight (kg)/height<sup>2</sup> (m<sup>2</sup>). Waist circumference (cm) was measured at the iliac crest during maximum exhalation using a nonstretch, nontension fiberglass Gulick II tape measure positioned horizontally to the floor according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III Anthropometric Procedures (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2004/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2004/</ext-link>). Abdominal height (cm) was measured laterally with the patient supine using a Holtain Kahn abdominal caliper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Measurements were taken midabdominally between the right and left iliac crest.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Dual X-ray absorptiometry outcomes</title><p>Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans were performed using the existing densitometry system at each clinical center (models QDR4500A, Discovery A, Discovery W/Wi, Delphi W, and Delphi A from Hologic Inc., Bedford, MA; models Prodigy and iDXA from GE Lunar Corp, Madison, WI; model DPX-IQ from Lunar Corp, Madison, WI). All scans were performed according to study-specific guidelines for subject positioning standardized across the different DXA systems. DXA quality assurance procedures included phantom cross-calibration and longitudinal monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Although there are well-known systematic differences in the absolute values of these systems, the change in the Hologic and GE-Lunar body composition values (i.e., relative results to baseline) is comparable because of the demonstrated linear relationship across a wide range of ages for both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). All scans were analyzed centrally at the TODAY DXA Central Reading Center (University of California at San Francisco) by study-trained personnel using software according to manufacturer guidelines. The software versions for analyzing the scans were Hologic Discovery 12.3 for the Hologic scans, Prodigy 11.4 for the Prodigy and iDXA scans, and GE-Lunar 4.7e for the DPX-L scans. About one-quarter of the DXA scans could not be used in the analysis; scans were invalidated due to either weight and size limitations set by the equipment manufacturers or because a body part (e.g., arm or leg) was completely or partially off the scanner, there was hand-hip overlap, or there was movement during the scan (specific reasons for missing scan data were not recorded during the trial).</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Analyses were performed on data collected at baseline (<italic>n</italic> = 699), month 6 (<italic>n</italic> = 596), and month 24 (<italic>n</italic> = 403), which were the major outcome data collection visits including DXA. Only data collected prior to the occurrence of the primary outcome (failure to maintain glycemic control) were included since management with insulin, which was started after treatment failure, is known to change measures of body composition.</p><p>A mixed effects repeated measures analysis that appropriately accounted for the longitudinal data structure was used to analyze change from baseline. The method used all data available for each participant at time points prior to treatment failure. The model included treatment, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, with the value of the outcome at baseline as a covariate. Models of bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) also adjusted for height and age at the time of visit. If the treatment-by-visit interaction was significant, we examined pairwise treatment differences at 6 and 24 months. Model-adjusted means (least squares means [LSmeans]) and SEs of the change from baseline are reported in the tables and the graphs. Subgroup differences across treatments were modeled, including an interaction term for treatment by sex or treatment by race/ethnicity. Results are given for the three categories of race/ethnicity with acceptable sample size (non-Hispanic black [NHB], Hispanic [H], and non-Hispanic white [NHW]). The relationships between change from baseline insulin sensitivity (1/fasting insulin in &#x003bc;U/mL) or HbA<sub>1c</sub> and measures of body composition included the baseline value of either insulin sensitivity or HbA<sub>1c</sub> as a covariate.</p><p>All analyses were considered exploratory, with statistical significance defined as <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 and no adjustment for multiple testing; the study was powered for the primary study outcome only.

Data presented herein indicate that the treatment group differences reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) in the primary outcome analysis (superiority of M+R in sustaining glycemic control compared with M, with M+L intermediate) are not explained by concordant differences in BMI or whole-body adiposity. These data also indicate that treatment with M+R was associated not merely with weight gain but also with more fat deposition than M or M+L treatment. Although treatment with M+L was associated with reductions in most measures of adiposity at 6 months after the start of treatment, these effects generally were modest and no longer detected at 24 months.</p><p>It was not surprising that increases in measures of adiposity were observed in the M+R group during the course of treatment, since similar effects of thiazolidinediones (TZDs, the drug class that encompasses rosiglitazone) are well described in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). These observations in adults suggest that the beneficial effects of TZDs on glycemia are not mediated through an improvement in insulin sensitivity expected from reduced adiposity. Indeed despite its superiority in maintaining durable glycemic control, treatment with M+R in this study resulted in substantially more adiposity, as indicated by a variety of measures (with an absolute mean increase in BMI of 2.93 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in the M+R group over 24 months), compared with treatment with the other modalities. It should be noted, however, that increased weight and fat gain with TZD treatment have not been universally found in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>Nor was it surprising that improved indices of body composition in the M+L group were most evident during the first 6 months of treatment, a time of frequent and close contact between the participant and the TODAY lifestyle intervention team. These data are similar to those from other adult and pediatric cohorts in which lifestyle treatment has been shown to be most effective during the initial, high-contact phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>It is less clear why the significant improvements in most measures of body composition during M+L did not translate into sustained glycemic control. As noted, the changes in all measures of adiposity were small, and the favorable changes in the M+L group at 6 months were no longer significantly different at 24 months. It is possible that the favorable changes in body composition observed in the M+L group simply were not of sufficient magnitude or duration to be translated into maintenance of glycemic control. Although the amount of weight loss required to effect glycemic control in growing adolescents is not known, the observed losses in measures of adiposity in the M+L treatment group were below thresholds reported to have an effect on HbA<sub>1c</sub> in the adult literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><p>BMD and BMC accretion occurred in all treatment groups over time as expected in this age-group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Worth emphasizing, however, is the fact that the change in BMD from baseline to 24 months was less in the M+R group than in the M+L group, with a similar but nonsignificant trend seen in BMC. Since TZD treatment has been associated with increased rate of bone loss and fractures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), it is possible that these relative reductions in BMD, albeit small, may translate over time to reduced bone strength. It is unknown whether TZD effects on bone are confined to the period of treatment, or whether effects continue after TZD exposure is stopped.</p><p>Indices of adiposity generally were associated with inverse changes in insulin sensitivity, confirming that adiposity is a key modulator of insulin sensitivity. Indices of adiposity also were associated with concordant changes in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, effects that could be partially overcome by M+R treatment. Whether these relationships between treatment and adiposity are common to all youth with type 2 diabetes or reflect in some way the extreme adiposity of our cohort (mean 97.7 BMI percentile at baseline) remains unclear.</p><p>Several limitations in our data are worth noting. First, all indices of adiposity measured were moderately to strongly correlated; thus it was not surprising that most treatment group effects were consistent for all measures. However, the various measures selected do provide slightly different reflections of adiposity, and this analysis gives no clear indication of selective regional effects. Second, it is well known that visceral adiposity is more predictive of cardiovascular risk and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) than total body fat, and visceral fat was not measured directly in this study. However two surrogate markers (waist circumference and abdominal height) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) were measured and both increased the most in the M+R group. In this regard, our data closely resemble those from A Diabetes Outcome Progression Trial (ADOPT) study in which rosiglitazone treatment was associated with better glycemic control than metformin alone, despite increases in total body weight, body fat, and waist circumference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Although speculative, a redistribution of abdominal fat by TZD treatment from visceral to subcutaneous fat depots, as suggested in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), cannot be discounted. Third, &#x0223c;25% of DXA scans were invalid or could not be performed for a variety of reasons, including weight limitations, thus possibly introducing some degree of sampling bias. It is likely, however, that such bias would only have reduced our ability to discriminate between treatment group differences in body composition, especially since the M+R participants were heavier, and thus more likely to have been excluded from DXA measurements because of weight restrictions. Finally, it is important to consider the magnitude of the differences noted in this manuscript. Although statistically significant, the absolute magnitude of all changes reported is very small, which raises the question of biological relevance despite statistical significance in these measures of body composition.</p><p>In summary, these findings indicate that the variable times to glycemic failure by treatment group observed in the TODAY trial were not explained by concordant treatment effects on measures of body composition. In the primary outcome analysis, the treatment failure rate for NHB (52.9%) was greater than that for NHW (36.9%) or H (44.8%), with the highest failure rates observed in NHB participants treated with M alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). From the current analysis, it is evident that race/ethnicity differences in changes in adiposity measures do not account for these race/ethnicity differences in treatment responses, since the rates of fat accumulation in NHB participants, including those treated with M, were no greater than those of the other race/ethnic groups. It can be concluded that additional factors other than reductions in BMI or adiposity are responsible for some of the differences observed between treatment groups in the TODAY study in maintaining glycemic control. We have shown previously that adherence to treatment did not account for the primary outcome results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Future studies, including the long-term follow-up of the TODAY cohort, may help clarify whether the differential effects of diabetes treatment seen in this study are most related to the basic underlying mechanisms of the drugs used, or to genetic, social, biological, or lifestyle factors.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
