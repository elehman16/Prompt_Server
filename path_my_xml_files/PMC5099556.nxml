</p></sec><sec id="bcp13094-sec-0008"><title>Introduction</title><p>Therapies based on biologics are increasingly important in treating many diseases due to their success in addressing previously unmet medical needs. In particular, biologics have greatly improved the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), demonstrating efficacy and safety in alleviating symptoms, inhibiting bone erosion and preventing loss of function <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>. However, access to biologic medicines can be limited, particularly in resource&#x02010;constrained countries <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>. Biosimilars, biologic products that are highly similar to a reference product in terms of quality, biological activity, safety and efficacy, are expected to be an essential component in reducing health care costs and enhancing patient access to these important, often lifesaving medications <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>. In the USA, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 established an abbreviated pathway for US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure of products that are biosimilar to a licensed reference product <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>. Similar regulatory pathways for biosimilar applications have been established elsewhere <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>. A key component of the abbreviated pathway is extrapolation of clinical data to one or more additional indications <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>.</p><p>The role of clinical pharmacology studies in demonstration of biosimilarity is emphasised in the FDA's guidance for industry <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>. These studies provide data that describe the degree of similarity in drug exposure, also referred to as pharmacokinetic (PK) similarity, between the proposed biosimilar and reference product(s). In addition, clinical pharmacology studies often include pharmacodynamic (PD) end points and pharmacometric analyses to assess whether clinically meaningful differences exist between the proposed biosimilar and reference product(s). Clinical pharmacology data can add to the totality of the evidence and reduce residual uncertainty, thus guiding the need for, and design of, subsequent clinical testing. Furthermore, clinical pharmacology data can provide scientific justification supporting extrapolation of clinical data to one or more additional indications.</p><p>Rituximab is a chimeric anti&#x02010;CD20 monoclonal antibody that selectively targets and depletes B cells and has demonstrated significant clinical benefit in patients with RA and non&#x02010;Hodgkin's lymphoma <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>. PF&#x02010;05280586 has the same primary amino acid sequence as rituximab, with similar physicochemical and <italic>in vitro</italic> functional properties, and is under development as a potential biosimilar to rituximab <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>. The PK similarity of PF&#x02010;05280586 to rituximab sourced from the European Union (rituximab&#x02010;EU) and US (rituximab&#x02010;US), as well as PK similarity of rituximab&#x02010;EU to rituximab&#x02010;US, was demonstrated in a multicentre, multinational, randomised double&#x02010;blind, controlled trial in patients with active RA on a background of methotrexate who had an inadequate response to one or more tumour necrosis factor antagonist therapies <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>. Use of reference products sourced from different regions (i.e. EU and US) is part of standard PK similarity study design for not only meeting the reference&#x02010;specific PK similarity requirement but also for providing scientific justification for use of a single reference product in subsequent trials <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>.</p><p>This trial was designed to demonstrate PK similarity, yet clinical response end points were also collected during the 24&#x02010;week study period. The study was therefore not powered for standard statistical evaluation of efficacy. Using a population PK/PD (PopPK/PD) modelling approach that was planned prospectively, analysis of clinical end points was conducted to assess any potential clinically meaningful difference between the proposed biosimilar and a reference product. The approach took advantage of the multiple repeated measurements for each clinical end point and variability observed between the two reference products using the assumption that differences in clinical responses between the two reference products would not be clinically meaningful if PK similarity was established. The key aspect of this approach was to utilise data from the two reference arms for constructing a reference range of &#x02018;no clinically meaningful difference&#x02019; for comparative assessments of PF&#x02010;05280586 to the reference products. We present this PopPK/PD modelling analysis as a case study for utilizing clinical response data from a clinical pharmacology study to add to the overall demonstration of biosimilarity.</p></sec><sec id="bcp13094-sec-0009"><title>Methods</title><p>This study is registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT01526057) and was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and with all International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines. In addition, all local regulatory requirements were followed, in particular, those affording greater protection to the safety of trial participants. The final protocol, amendments and informed consent documentation were reviewed and approved by Institutional Review Boards and/or Independent Ethics Committees at each participating centre. A signed and dated informed consent was required from each patient before any screening procedures were conducted.</p><sec id="bcp13094-sec-0010"><title>Study design</title><p>The study was a randomised, double&#x02010;blind, controlled trial in patients with active RA on a background of methotrexate who had inadequate responses to one or more tumour necrosis factor antagonist therapies <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>. The primary objective was to demonstrate PK similarity of PF&#x02010;05280586, rituximab&#x02010;EU and rituximab&#x02010;US. The secondary objectives included those described herein, which were to use PopPK/PD modelling approaches to integrate PK and PD data for the purpose of detecting potential differences in PK/PD profiles. Other secondary objectives included evaluation of overall safety, tolerability and immunogenicity. The results of this study, except for those from the PopPK/PD modelling, have been presented elsewhere <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>.

Briefly, eligible participants were adults (aged &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years) with confirmed diagnosis of RA based on 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism classification criteria <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>. Patients were required to: meet class I, II or III of the ACR 1991 revised criteria for Global Functional Status in Rheumatoid Arthritis <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>; have RA seropositivity, as documented by a screening assessment for rheumatoid factor; and/or anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies; active disease, as defined by the following: at least six tender/painful joints (of 68 assessed) and six or more swollen joints (of 66 assessed) at screening and baseline, high&#x02010;sensitivity C&#x02010;reactive protein (CRP) greater than the upper limit of normal, or Patient's Global Assessment of arthritis score&#x000a0;&#x02265;50 at screening, and Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28)&#x02013;CRP &#x0003e;3.2 at screening; be on a stable dose of oral or parenteral methotrexate 10&#x02013;25&#x000a0;mg per week (or as low as 7.5&#x000a0;mg per week, in the case of prior poor tolerance) for at least 3&#x000a0;months and receiving the stable dose for at least 4&#x000a0;weeks prior to first dose of study drug; and have inadequate response, in the opinion of the investigator, to one or more approved TNF&#x02010;antagonist therapies, defined as failure to achieve adequate clinical response during prior TNF&#x02010;antagonist therapy, relapse following clinical response to TNF&#x02010;antagonist therapy or an adverse event resulting in discontinuation of TNF antagonist. A sample size calculation based on standard bioequivalence determined that up to 210 subjects were to be enrolled to ensure at least 195 subjects (65 subjects in each treatment arm) completed the study procedures per protocol. The PopPK/PD analysis population was defined as all randomised subjects who receive full doses of the assigned study treatment and had at least one protocol&#x02010;specified measurement for drug concentration and the PD response of interest collected after receiving study treatment, as well as the respective baseline values. Patients received 1000&#x000a0;mg of PF&#x02010;05280586, rituximab&#x02010;EU or rituximab&#x02010;US by intravenous infusion on days 1 and 15.

DAS28 is a function of four components: tender joint counts 28 (TJ28) and swollen joint counts 28 (SJ28), CRP and patient's global assessment of arthritis (PGA). The ACR responder criteria are a function of a core set of seven components: TJ68, SJ66, CRP, PGA, Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index, patient's assessment of arthritis pain, and physician's global assessment of arthritis. A patient was considered a responder on the ACR20 assessment if &#x0003e;20% improvement in tender and swollen joint counts was observed with &#x0003e;20% improvement in three of the five other component variables; ACR50 and ACR70 were defined similarly, with 50% and 70% thresholds, respectively. Components of DAS28 and ACR responder status end points were collected at predose (baseline) and at 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24&#x000a0;weeks after start of treatment.</p><p>An enzyme&#x02010;linked immunosorbent assay for determining concentrations of rituximab and PF&#x02010;05280586 in human serum samples was developed and validated by QPS, LLC (Newark, DE, USA; see <xref rid="bcp13094-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Methods</xref>).

The models were implemented in NONMEM (Icon Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD, USA), version 7.1.2 or higher, using first&#x02010;order conditional estimation for continuous end points and Laplace estimation for categorical end points. The models were similar to those described for characterization of the time&#x02010;course of both continuous <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> and categorical <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>, <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>, <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>, <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref> measures of clinical response in patients with RA. As previously described, these models provide a semi&#x02010;mechanistic framework to describe the effect functions for both placebo and drug, each of which can include parameters related to the effect onset and maximum. This is more intuitive for continuous end points. For categorical end points, an underlying unobservable &#x02018;latent variable&#x02019; (LV) is mapped into binary or ordered categorical response through the probability mass between thresholds. In this way, the threshold parameter is a numerical value on the unobservable continuous scale, which determines positivity on the binary scale. The LV is often assumed to be a function of an indirect response mechanism (e.g. reduction of inflammation) and any acting placebo effects (e.g. a patient's perception of their disease) which may be aggregated into a single clinical response end point (e.g. ACR response rate). Constructing the LV as a function of the indirect response thus yields a pharmacologically interpretable type of model and therefore may be useful for assessing similarity of response between two drug products. In addition, for a more efficient use of ACR response data, simultaneous modelling of ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 end points were implemented, assuming that ACRm, where m&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;20, 50 or 70, was achieved when an m% improvement form baseline was observed <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>.</p><p>Covariate effects were modelled focusing on components of baseline disease activity appropriate for each clinical response end point, which are centred on their median observed values, and product specific parameters applied to three key model components and were estimated simultaneously. Detailed mathematical descriptions of structures for DAS28 change from baseline (DAS28cfb) and ACR responder models, and procedures for their suitability evaluations and applications for comparative assessments are provided in <xref rid="bcp13094-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Methods</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="bcp13094-sec-0013"><title>Reference range for comparative assessments</title><p>The rationale for using the reference range to define &#x02018;clinically meaningful effect&#x02019; relied on the assumption that differences in clinical responses between the two reference products would not be clinically meaningful if PK similarity was established. This assumption is based on the following: two rituximab reference products, while sourced from different regions, share the same prescribing practice for the indications approved in the regions, consistent with the biosimilarity definition based on the principle of no clinically meaningful differences between two biologic products under consideration; and confirmation that equivalent exposures were achieved in the two reference products ensuring that any difference in clinical response between the two are not due to differing exposure.</p><p>The 90% confidence interval (CI) of the model&#x02010;predicted difference between area under effect curve (AUEC) means of rituximab&#x02010;EU and rituximab&#x02010;US treatments defined the reference range for a given clinical response end point. The model predictions of AUEC differences between means for PF&#x02010;05280586 and rituximab&#x02010;US and between PF&#x02010;05280586 and rituximab&#x02010;EU were compared with the reference range.

A smoothed parametric bootstrap procedure was used to generate the Monte Carlo replicates in which vectors of parameters were drawn for each simulated replicate from a multivariate normal distribution, with mean vector equal to the population model estimates and uncertainty incorporated via the estimated covariance matrix of these population estimates. Additionally, a covariate vector for each individual within the replicate was sampled from the empirical distribution of the study using a bootstrap technique with replacement of patients during resampling. The bootstrap technique was not stratified by treatment to ensure covariate distributions were balanced on average across the groups over the simulated replicates. From these simulated data, population AUEC means were computed across the individual and the covariate distribution per replicate and per arm to derive the prediction for the replicate. The predictions were not dependent upon the individual covariate effects, because these were integrated from the population mean prediction. Thus, differences between treatments were based on fixed effects of treatment differences and their uncertainties. The 90% CI was calculated using the 5th and 95th percentile from the distribution of the AUEC differences between the test and reference products.</p></sec><sec id="bcp13094-sec-0015"><title>Case&#x02013;control analysis</title><p>A <italic>posthoc</italic> case&#x02013;control analysis was performed as an orthogonal approach to verifying the impact of the imbalance in baseline patient disease characteristics among groups on the comparative assessments. Multivariate and propensity score matching was implemented using the Matching package in R Software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>. Variables selected for inclusion in the propensity score model were based on those that showed an imbalance in the original dataset while also considering observed correlations between different variables. Matching was performed without replacement of subjects using a calliper of one&#x02010;quarter the standard deviation of the propensity score. For a given propensity score model, matching was performed first to balance the two reference groups (rituximab&#x02010;EU vs. rituximab&#x02010;US) using 1:1 matching. The two matched reference groups were then compared for how well balance was achieved. If adequate, matching was then performed using the same propensity score model to balance the reference group (rituximab&#x02010;EU/US) to the test group (PF&#x02010;05280586) using 2:1 matching. The matched groups were then compared for how well balance was achieved. This process was repeated for various models, which included either a single or multiple variables. Performance was assessed at each step graphically and statistically. Graphical comparison of clinical response measures (DAS28cfb and ACR20 responder rate) between the three balanced treatment groups was performed to show the effects of matching.</p></sec></sec><sec id="bcp13094-sec-0016"><title>Results</title><sec id="bcp13094-sec-0017"><title>Baseline characteristics</title><p>A total of 214 patients were included in the PopPK/PD modelling analysis population (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="bcp13094-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap">1</xref>).

The comparative reference range was &#x02212;0.05 to 0.57 for DAS28cfb and &#x02212;0.16 to 0.023 for ACR20 which were approximately similar and somewhat larger, respectively, than the range of clinical responses observed in historic trials <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref>, <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>, <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>. The asymmetry (i.e. reference range not centred on zero) was a result of the use of fixed effects in the models to describe clinical response profiles for the two reference products, rather than pooling the two reference arms. The resulting reference range was considered adequate for comparative assessments based on the objective of the analysis. As an alternative approach, which emphasised the absolute differences between the covariate corrected means of the AUEC, an absolute comparative reference range (or boundary) was also established as the 90th percentile of the absolute difference between the covariate corrected means of the AUEC of the two reference arms. This boundary was 0.50 for DAS28cfb and 0.14, 0.13 and 0.099 for ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="bcp13094-sec-0020"><title>Comparative assessments</title><p>Comparative assessment for the standardised DAS28cfb AUEC mean difference and absolute mean difference between PF&#x02010;05280586 and rituximab&#x02010;EU (0.076 and 0.083, respectively) and between PF&#x02010;05280586 and rituximab&#x02010;US (0.32 and 0.33, respectively) showed that the differences were within the comparative reference range and absolute comparative reference range (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="bcp13094-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

This approach was designed to take advantage of multiple repeated measurements for each clinical end point and variability observed between the two reference products used in the PK study. A procedure for determining the criteria as to whether a meaningful difference between PF&#x02010;05280586 and reference products was observed in the study was prospectively defined, providing a framework for the comparative assessments. Based on these criteria, any mean difference within the reference range would not be considered meaningful. Establishing the reference range relied on the assumption that both reference products had equivalent potency and that, given PK similarity was established, any difference in clinical responses observed between the two references in a single trial are due to study design attributes (not product&#x02010;related), such as between&#x02010;subject variability or imperfect randomization in baseline disease characteristics among treatment groups. Thus, emphasis is placed on the distribution of differences between references that may be expected between two similar products in a PK trial setting with ~70 subjects per arm. In comparison to historical data extracted from several randomised clinical trials, reference ranges established in this trial are similar in size to those observed across trials for DAS28 but somewhat larger than those for ACR20 <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref>, <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>, <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>.</p><p>The traditional approach &#x02013; using ACR clinical response rate at the end of a specified period as the primary end point in randomised clinical trials to distinguish active treatment from placebo &#x02013; may not be optimal for the biosimilarity assessment between two active treatments especially when the clinical dose is located on the plateau of the dose response curve <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>, <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref>. This limitation was a motivating factor for utilizing the repeated clinical response measurements for the model&#x02010;based comparative assessments, along with assessment of another clinical response endpoint (i.e. DAS28), in an attempt to improve detection of a potential difference and add to the totality of evidence for demonstration of biosimilarity. Integrating all PK/PD (clinical response) measurements over time using the model&#x02010;based approach allowed examination of onset of effect and magnitude of response along with precise estimation of AUEC, a parameter of interest for clinical comparability assessments consistent with the FDA draft guidance on clinical pharmacology data to support demonstration of biosimilarity <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>.</p><p>In this study, an underlying imbalance in the rituximab&#x02010;EU and rituximab&#x02010;US groups was evident from baseline patient disease characteristics. To adequately characterise response profiles for each group, separate fixed&#x02010;effects were estimated for each reference group, in addition to inclusion of covariates to account for the imbalance. The aim was to evaluate whether treatment differences could be explained or predicted by the covariates through the imbalance between groups. Therefore, the simultaneous estimation approach was preferable to forward selection of covariates which may introduce bias in the estimated values <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref>, <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref>. Incorporation of covariates in the models assuming a pooled rituximab&#x02010;EU/US population (data not shown) did not account for all the imbalance, indicating unmeasured covariates also may have contributed to the underlying imbalance. In addition to the pooling approach, an attempt to incorporate group&#x02010;specific random effects to provide correlation within the groups was conducted. This confirmed that it was not possible to estimate a precise between&#x02010;group variability term with the small number of groups to characterise the remaining difference between the two reference products after inclusion of covariates in the model. As may be expected, comparative assessments between two reference products conducted with fixed effects resulted in an asymmetric comparison. That is, the distribution of mean estimated differences between two reference products is shifted, resulting in a nonzero mean. Details of this particular finding, while insightful, may not be easily understood without evaluation of simulation of various hypothetical scenarios. An alternative perspective, which is included in our analysis, was to evaluate each assessment using absolute difference. Since the emphasis of similarity is on the magnitude of difference, the absolute difference is consistent with the objectives of the given analysis and offered an intuitive interpretation of the analysis results. Lastly, imbalances in baseline disease characteristics, which tend to occur in PK trial settings, can be addressed to a great extent in the mixed&#x02010;effect modelling framework through a typical covariate analysis. In this regard, the models developed in this analysis included the individual components of baseline disease activity and elucidated potential confounding factors. In particular, the ACR model indicated that patients with a higher swollen joint count had a higher probability of being an ACR responder, while those with a higher tender joint count had a lower probability. As others have described, joint tenderness might indicate chronification of the pain reaction rather than ongoing inflammation and could therefore be a confounding factor <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref>. That is, a disconnection between the number of swollen and tender joints may appear in RA patients who have developed widespread pain syndromes or other hyperalgesic conditions <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref> and consequently could result in somewhat different populations with respect to their potential to respond to treatment.</p><p>Still, as found in this analysis, there may be unaccounted imbalances in the data presumably due largely to the randomization with small sample sizes and no stratification based on disease activity. In verifying this, an orthogonal approach using case&#x02013;control analysis to match patients based on one or more variables may be useful, as described for an exposure&#x02013;response analysis <xref rid="bcp13094-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref>. This approach is often used to account for imbalance in nonrandomised studies and typically with much larger sample sizes. Applied here, this approach helped identify two important measures of disease activity, swollen joint count and patient's assessment of pain, which, when used for matching, resulted in balanced baseline disease activity among treatment groups. The resulting balanced groups all had similar clinical response profiles.</p><p>In conclusion, no point estimates of mean differences were found outside the reference ranges for either DAS28 or ACR20 scores. Furthermore, the estimated probabilities that the predicted differences for the given comparisons, PF&#x02010;05280586 <italic>vs.</italic> rituximab&#x02010;EU or PF&#x02010;05280586 <italic>vs.</italic> rituximab&#x02010;US, lie outside the boundaries of the respective reference ranges of absolute differences are low. Our analysis provided a case study where a model&#x02010;based PK/PD approach was utilised for biosimilarity assessment using clinical response data from the PK similarly study comparing a proposed biosimilar against two reference products. The results may therefore be used as a PK/PD demonstration of no clinically meaningful differences in support of overall biosimilarity determination. This case study offers an example for additional applications of clinical pharmacology studies and approaches aimed for efficient biosimilar development that are essential for improving patient access to the important, often lifesaving, biologic therapies.</p></sec><sec id="bcp13094-sec-0023"><title>Competing Interests</title><p>All authors have completed the Unified Competing Interest form at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf">http://www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf</ext-link> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf">http://www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf</ext-link>) (available on request from the corresponding author) and declare the following financial relationships with organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work in the previous 3&#x000a0;years: BG, LAM, DY, RL and XM are employees of Pfizer Inc., JHW, MLZ, and GSG were employees of Pfizer Inc at the time of the study, MMH and J&#x02010;CB were paid consultants of Pfizer Inc.</p><p>
