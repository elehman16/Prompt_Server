As people's awareness on sexual attitudes changes, more attention has been paid to the impact on quality of life for patients and their sexual partners with PE. Both the patients and their partners complain about decreased sexual self-confidence and self-esteem and an overall reduction in their quality of life<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>.</p><p>PE is classified as primary (lifelong) or secondary (acquired) if it is present at almost every intercourse from the first sexual encounter on wards. While the pathophysiology of primary premature ejaculation (PPE) is not fully understood, nowadays it is clear that both organic and psychosocial factors play a role in the etiology<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, glans penile hypersensitivity and hyperexcitability is the general reason for PPE<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. Studies found that patients with PPE have more dorsal nerves of the penis than healthy adults, this abnormal distribution of dorsal nerves possibly leads to glans penile hypersensitivity, lowering the threshold value as well as shortening the ejaculation latency time<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. They also generally have other abnormal autonomic reflex pathways for the ejaculatory process, including shorter bulbocavernosal latency time and higher bulbocavernosal evoked potentials<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. Thus therapy of reducing glans penile hypersensitivity should be effective for the treatment of PPE.</p><p>Herbs have long been used in the traditional Chinese and Indian systems of medicine for the treatment of sexual dysfunction in men<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. Many kinds of herbs have the effect of local anesthesia, vaso-activation and so on. <italic>Radix Aconiti (Chuanwu)</italic> was used for the treatment of a &#x0201c;peripheral uncomfortable feeling of cold&#x0201d; in Japan<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, its active ingredients could affect peripheral vascular function via the nitric oxide (NO) system<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. Studies showed that nitric oxide (NO) might be a neurotransmitter involved in the central and peripheral control of ejaculation<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. <italic>Herba Asari (Xixin)</italic> is a traditional herb medicine used as remedies for aphthous stomatitis, toothache, gingivitis and as a local anesthetic agent in Korea and China<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. <italic>Pericarpium Zanthoxyli (Chuanjiao)</italic> is a kind of medicinal and edible herb, the component of volatile oil has a strong effect of local anesthesia<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. <italic>Syzygium aromaticum (Dingxiang)</italic> is not only used in China to treat male sexual dysfunction, but also used in India as an aphrodisiac to treat erectile dysfunction, the active ingredients may have ROCK-II inhibitory potential which can result in relax of corpus cavernosum, thus it is effective for sexual dysfunction<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. Some of the above traditional herbs have been studied for the treatment of PE, others have not, we united eight kinds of traditional Chinese medicine (4 mentioned above, other 4 not mentioned) according to traditional Chinese medicine theory, and we aimed to evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy of the ethanol extract from the eight kinds of medicine for the treatment of PPE.</p><p>Because PE involves both psychosocial and physiologic determinants, a combination psychosocial and pharmacologic therapy may be the best choice to optimize efficacy and minimize relapse<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. Behavioral therapy is the main content of psychosocial treatment. Behavioral strategies mainly include the &#x0201c;stop-start programme developed by Semans<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, and its modification, the &#x0201c;squeeze&#x0201d; technique, proposed by Masters and Johnson<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> (several modifications exist), however, it needs the partner's cooperation for a long time and its difficult on a large degree<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Domestic scholars reported that Weili Multifunctional Andrologic Disease Diagnosis And Treatment workstation (WLZZ-9999, made by weili new century science &#x00026; tech. Co. Ltd, Beijing, China) can obtain a good effect of treatment for PE with desensitization training therapy<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. The automated machine can help patients complete the behavioral therapy instead of the patients and their partners themselves. The course of the treatment is as follows: first, the machine gives a small stimulation to the patient's penis to the point just before ejaculation, and then stops. Once the sensation has subsided, then starts again. When the patient develops relatively longer time of ejaculation control, stronger intensity of stimulation is given to the penis gradually, then the above treatment is repeated. Generally, treatment is given 3 times a week, six times as a course of treatment.</p><p>In summary, traditional medicine has long been used to treat sexual dysfunction in many countries in Asia and should be fully exploited. In this study, we united eight kinds of traditional Chinese medicine together and made them into a spray, and explored the safety and clinical efficacy of this traditional Chinese medicine spray (TCMS) and combined TCMS with premature ejaculation desensitization therapy (PEDT) for the treatment of PPE.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>A total of 90 heterosexual men complaining of PPE were recruited from the out-patient clinic of Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture nationality Hospital Department of Urology, Enshi, China, from April 2012 to April 2013.

In this study, we employed IELT as the main measure for comparing different treatment options as it is the most universally accepted tool. Data from previous studies indicated that IELT measurement alone is not sufficient for accurately determining the PE status<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, so another useful index CIPE-5 was employed for the evaluation of ejaculation control, sexual satisfaction of patients and partners, as well as personal distress.

Additionally, clinical efficacy rate in TCMS plus PEDT group (89.7%) was also significantly higher than that in TCMS group (65.5%) and PEDT group (67.9%) (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Figure 2</xref>). The results demonstrated that a combination of TCMS and PEDT therapy was more efficient for the treatment of PPE than TCMS or PEDT monotherapy.</p><p>All the patients were satisfied with their tolerance to the treatment in each group, no side effect was reported by the subjects in each group during the treatment course. It is worth mentioning that the combination therapy as well as the single TCMS therapy should not be used for the patients allergic to alcohol. Present therapies for the treatment of PE mainly include systemic pharmacological agents, topical agents and behavioral therapy, none of them seems to be ideal. Systemic pharmacological agents like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors all have systemic side effects, such as dry mouth, nausea, decreased libido, erectile dysfunction and so on<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. Topical agents including severance secret-cream(SS-cream), dyclonine/alprostadil cream, lidocaine spray, prilocaine-lidocaine spray, all of them can reduce the sensitivity of the glans penis meanwhile the side effect cannot be ignored. The most common side effects of these agents' use are associated with localized irritation, including pain, burning, delayed ejaculation, loss of penile sensation<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, wiping off before intercourse or condom use is necessary to avoid the side effect of decreased vaginal sensitivity of the partners. However, in our study, no serious systemic or local side effect occurred except that slight burning sensation presented on part of patients, but this slight discomfort was tolerable. Therefore, we believed that the self-made TCMS was safe and could obtain a good compliance.</p><p>Traditional herbs have long been used for the treatment of PE in China, India and several other countries. From the traditional Chinese medicine point of view, kidney yang failure is one of the main reasons for premature ejaculation, therefore the herbs with hot property such as <italic>Radix Aconiti, Herba Asari, Syzygium aromaticum</italic> and <italic>Pericarpium Zanthoxyli</italic> were selected to warm the kidney yang. <italic>Ootheca Mantidis, Galla Chinensis, Fructus Rosae Laevigatae</italic> and <italic>Fructus Rubi</italic> have the property of convergence, so we used them to prevent premature ejaculation. Modern researches show that <italic>Radix Aconiti</italic> has a wide range of therapeutic effects, active components are alkaloids such as aconitine, these alkaloids have pain-relieving effects, cardiotonic and vasodilator actions<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, the vasodilator action may be induced by the increased yield of nitric oxide<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, the latter has been detected as a neurotransmitter involved in the central and peripheral control of ejaculation, so <italic>Radix Aconiti</italic> may inhibit seminal emission by increasing the production of nitric oxide.</p><p><italic>Herba Asari</italic> is rich in volatile oils, as the characteristic components, methyl eugenol and safrole may have local anesthetic and analgesic effects<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>. Studies show that <italic>Pericarpium Zanthoxyli</italic> has an obvious effect of local anesthesia and the main active ingredient is amide compounds, volatile oil. Water soluble matter of <italic>Pericarpium Zanthoxyli</italic> can reversibly block nerve impulse conduction and lower neural stem excitability of toad sciatic nerve, this may be the physiological basis of local anesthesia induced by <italic>Pericarpium Zanthoxyli</italic><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>. <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> has long been used in China and India to treat male sexual dysfunction, animal experiments showed that low dose of <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> might have androgenic effect which could increase the motility of sperm and stimulate the secretory activities of epididymis and seminal vesicle<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>. The active ingredients of <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> may also have ROCK-II inhibitory potential which could result in relaxation of corpus cavernosum, thus it has an effect on sexual dysfunction<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. <italic>Galla Chinensis</italic> is rich in tannic acid which can lead to protein precipitation<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>. <italic>Galla Chinensis</italic> may treat PE through thickening skin and mucous membranes of the glans thus reducing its sensitivity.</p><p>Overall, the referring herbs may treat PE from different angles, both <italic>Radix Herba Asari</italic> and <italic>Pericarpium Zanthoxyli</italic> have local anesthesia effect, <italic>Galla Chinensis</italic> can lead to proteins precipitation, so they may treat PE by reducing the sensitivity of glans. <italic>Radix Aconiti</italic> has vasodilator action and <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> can inhibit corpus cavernosum relax so as to promote penis hyperemia, <italic>Radix Aconiti</italic> may also inhibit the function of the sympathetic nervous system activity through increased NO and then inhibit ejaculation. <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> may have androgenic effect. These herbs may play a role of superposition for the treatment of PE. There were also other desensitising agents which were promising for the treatment of PE. Dinsmore et al<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> carried out a phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled study and showed that PSD502 (three actuations of spray each containing 7.5 mg lidocaine and 2.5 mg prilocaine) improved ejaculatory latency, control and sexual satisfaction when applied topically 5 min before intercourse in men with PE. IELT in that study increased by 6.3-fold of baseline level after 3-month treatment. In another two double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study carried out by Carson et al<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, PSD502 applied topically to the glans penis 5 minutes before intercourse also showed significantly improved ejaculatory latency, ejaculatory control, sexual satisfaction and distress, and no severe side effects occurred. The baseline levels of IELT in our study was much higher than that in the above studies, and the fold of increase for IELT was also different, this may be due to the duration of treatment and also the dose of treatment. Both the two therapies were promising for clinical use since they were effective and safe.</p><p>In this study, we used PEDT therapy supported by Weili Multifunctional Andrologic Disease Diagnosis And Treatment workstation (WLZZ-9999) instead of behavioral therapy completed by the patients and their sexual partners. The results showed that both PEDT and TCMS were effective for the treatment of PPE, however the combined therapy is far more effective than the mono-therapy. This study is only a preliminary exploration for the effect of self-made TCMS as well as combined TCMS with PEDT, we just provided an idea for the development of new therapeutic agent for the treatment of PPE, components in TCMS are complex and mechanism may be multifaceted, further research should be carried out to sieve the good from the bad and optimize the formula, deeply explore the mechanism of action.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study confirmed that the self-made TCMS was safe and effective, the combination of TCMS and PEDT therapy was more effective than the TCMS or PEDT mono-therapy. However, components in TCMS are complex and mechanism may be multifaceted. Further research should be carried out to clarify the active ingredients in TCMS and their interaction.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors wish to thank the staff
