However, there is little evidence for efficiency of physicians due to CDS assistance. In this article, we report a pilot study for measuring the impact of CDS on the time spent by physicians for deciding on preventive services and chronic disease management. <bold>Methods:</bold> We randomly selected 30 patients from a primary care practice, and assigned them to 10 physicians. The physicians were requested to perform chart review to decide on preventive services and chronic disease management for the assigned patients. The patients assignment was done in a randomized crossover design, such that each patient received 2 sets of recommendations&#x02014;one from a physician with CDS assistance and the other from a different physician without CDS assistance. We compared the physician recommendations made using CDS assistance, with the recommendations made without CDS assistance. <bold>Results:</bold> The physicians required an average of 1 minute 44 seconds, when they were they had access to the decision support system and 5 minutes when they were unassisted. Hence the CDS assistance resulted in an estimated saving of 3 minutes 16 seconds (65%) of the physicians&#x02019; time, which was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .0001). There was no statistically significant difference in the number of recommendations. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our findings suggest that CDS assistance significantly reduced the time spent by physicians for deciding on preventive services and chronic disease management. The result needs to be confirmed by performing similar studies at other institutions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>preventive health services</kwd><kwd>clinical decision support systems</kwd><kwd>task performance and analysis</kwd><kwd>time motion study</kwd><kwd>chronic diseases</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-2150131914546325"><title>Introduction</title><p>The quality of preventive care delivered in the United States is suboptimal.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2150131914546325" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-2150131914546325" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Recent studies have shown that many patients do not get the recommended best preventive services<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2150131914546325" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>&#x02014;mammography, pap, and colonoscopy screening rates are 72%, 83%, and 59%, respectively.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2150131914546325" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Adult vaccination rates are also low&#x02014;pneumococcal vaccination coverage among high-risk adults is 20% and tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) coverage of adults is 13%.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2150131914546325" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Several studies have identified provider,<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2150131914546325" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-2150131914546325" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> patient,<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2150131914546325" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> practice,<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2150131914546325" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-2150131914546325" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and environmental factors<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2150131914546325" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="bibr12-2150131914546325" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr13-2150131914546325" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr14-2150131914546325" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> that affect care quality.

Several other studies have reported mixed effect of health information technology on time efficiency of physicians, but none of them have specifically reported on the time savings for deciding on preventive services and chronic disease management due to CDS.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2150131914546325" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="bibr26-2150131914546325" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr27-2150131914546325" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p><p>Yarnall et al<sup><xref rid="bibr28-2150131914546325" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> have estimated the time for delivering preventive services, but they assume zero time for deciding on the recommendations. However, our study shows that physicians spend considerable time for deciding on the recommendations.</p><p>During patient consultation, the physician&#x02019;s time is divided into addressing the current patient complaints and carrying out services for preventive care and for management of chronic conditions. Although physician can order the services and delegate the administration of the services to assistants, the lack of time to perform chart review for deciding on the services, can itself pose as an obstacle for delivery of the services.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2150131914546325" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> By reducing the time requirements for deciding the services, CDS may augment the delivery of the applicable service and improve the quality of care.</p><p>Time utilization of the clinician<sup><xref rid="bibr29-2150131914546325" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> for different tasks has been previously reported using methodologies like work sampling,<sup><xref rid="bibr30-2150131914546325" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> surveys,<sup><xref rid="bibr31-2150131914546325" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> and continuous observation.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-2150131914546325" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bibr32-2150131914546325" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> The methodology of continuous observation is considered a gold standard. Although observational studies can provide a detailed perspective of how the clinicians distribute their time, they are resource intensive. Our aim was to measure the time component specific for decision making, which is difficult to determine by independent observation. Hence, we resorted to the approach of self-timing.</p><p>The time savings from decision support may seem counter intuitive, since the CDS reminders represent additional information that the physicians need to consider for deciding on the recommendations. The physicians are indeed expected to confirm the validity of decision support before acting on it, which entails chart review. As a special case, CDS interventions that generate explanations or summarization can reduce the chart review effort, by identifying the reports that are relevant for the decision.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-2150131914546325" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> However, such explanations or summarizations were not supplied in this study. Hence, the likely explanation for the time savings is that the physicians acted on the CDS reminders without performing the verifications, possibly because of the trust developed in the CDS system.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2150131914546325" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr34-2150131914546325" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup></p><p>Although there was a statistically significant difference in the time required for deciding on the recommendations, there was no significant difference in number of recommendations between the 2 groups. This suggests that CDS assistance may have greater benefits in terms of time savings as compared to improvements in service delivery.</p><p>The need of services for preventive care and chronic disease management is expected to vary substantially across patients, and the physician characteristics are known to influence the delivery of preventive care.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2150131914546325" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,36</sup> Hence, we used a crossover design, to ensure equal representation of the physician characteristics and patients in the study groups.</p><sec id="section8-2150131914546325"><title>Limitations</title><p>As the physicians in the study were not previously familiar with the assigned patients, the study may not reflect the real-world setting of a longitudinal physician&#x02013;patient relationship, wherein previous knowledge about the patient reduces the need for chart review. Also, the chart review was not synchronous with the patient visit, and thereby excludes patient participation in the decision making. For instance, some patient data resulting from care obtained outside the institution may not be recorded in the EHR system, but may be provided by the patient. In addition, patients may refuse particular services. These factors could cause an over estimation of the efficiency resulting from the use of CDS. Moreover, our study sample is modest in size and is from a single institution. Hence, the time savings measured in this study need to be confirmed by similar studies at other institutions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section9-2150131914546325"><title>Conclusion and Future Work</title><p>Clinical decision support interventions for primary care have been shown to improve screening rates, and projected to reduce costs. However, the evidence for efficiency of physicians due to decision support is sparse. In our pilot study, the CDS assistance was found to significantly reduce the time spent by physicians for deciding on preventive services and chronic disease management. Further research is required to confirm the time savings at other institutions.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded by the Mayo Clinic foundation.
