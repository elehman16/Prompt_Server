The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the safety profile of exenatide twice daily and to compare its profile with that of a pooled comparator (placebo and insulin) in patients with type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Data from 19 completed, randomized, controlled clinical trials of exenatide twice daily (5 &#x003bc;g and 10 &#x003bc;g) were pooled and analyzed; the pooled data included 5594 intent-to-treat patients who were followed for 12&#x02013;52 weeks. Incidence rates, exposure-adjusted incidence rates, and 95% confidence intervals around risk differences between groups were calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Baseline demographics and exposure time were comparable between groups (exenatide, N = 3261; pooled comparator, N = 2333; mean exposure time 166&#x02013;171 days). Transient, mild- to-moderate nausea was the most frequent adverse event with exenatide (36.9% versus 8.3% in the pooled comparator). The incidence of hypoglycemia (minor or major) with concomitant sulfonylurea (exenatide 26.5%, pooled comparator 20.7%) was higher than that without sulfonylurea (exenatide 3.1%, pooled comparator 2.7%) in all groups. Serious adverse events, discontinuations due to serious adverse events, and deaths were reported with similar frequency in the exenatide and pooled comparator groups. Composite exposure-adjusted incidence rates were not statistically different between groups for pancreatitis, renal impairment, or major adverse cardiac events; there was a difference in incidence rates for benign thyroid neoplasm (0.3% versus 0%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overall, this analysis, representing over 1500 patient-years of exposure, demonstrated that exenatide twice daily was safe and generally well tolerated in patients with type 2 diabetes. The incidence of most adverse events, including serious adverse events, was similar in both exenatide-treated and comparator-treated patients. The most distinct differences between groups were in gastrointestinal-related adverse events, which is consistent with other therapies within the glucagon-like peptide class.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>exenatide</kwd><kwd>safety</kwd><kwd>adverse events</kwd><kwd>risk difference</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 receptor agonist, exenatide, administered twice daily was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2005 for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Adverse events were also analyzed by serious adverse events, frequently occurring adverse events, study drug-related adverse events, and adverse events of interest (eg, gastrointestinal-related adverse events, hypoglycemia, thyroid neoplasm, pancreatitis, and cardiovascular adverse events). Mild-to-moderate nausea was defined as an event of nausea with an intensity of mild or moderate as determined by the investigator.</p><p>Hypoglycemic episodes were classified as minor if the event was associated with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia and a blood glucose concentration of &#x0003c;54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L); events were considered major if the event resulted in loss of consciousness, seizure, coma, or other change in mental status consistent with neuroglycopenia (as judged by the investigator or physician) in which symptoms resolved after administration of intramuscular glucagon or intravenous glucose, or the event required third-party assistance because of severe impairment in consciousness or behavior and was accompanied by a blood glucose concentration of &#x0003c;54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L).</p><p>For the analysis of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), 3945 patients from eight randomized placebo-controlled and four active comparator-controlled trials were included.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-dmso-5-029">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-dmso-5-029">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-dmso-5-029">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-dmso-5-029">22</xref> A customized MACE definition included terms reflective of cardiovascular mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, and revascularization procedures.

Although 81% of exenatide-treated patients and 69% of placebo/comparator-treated patients experienced an adverse event, few patients discontinued due to adverse events (8% in the exenatide group and 2% in the pooled comparator group). Study drug-related adverse events occurred in 48% of patients treated with exenatide compared with 16% of patients in the pooled comparator group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-dmso-5-029">Table 1</xref>).

Of the gastrointestinal-related adverse events, nausea (37% versus 8%; RD 29; 95% CI: 26.6&#x02013;30.6), vomiting (14% versus 3%; RD 11; 95% CI: 9.3&#x02013;12.0), and diarrhea (11% versus 5%; RD 5; 95% CI: 3.8&#x02013;6.6) occurred at a significantly greater frequency in the exenatide group than in the pooled comparator group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-dmso-5-029">Table 3</xref>).

One serious adverse event each of nausea and vomiting were determined to be related to the study drug by the investigator at the time of the event (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-dmso-5-029">Table 4</xref>). Gastrointestinal-related adverse events were also among the most common adverse events associated with study withdrawal in the exenatide group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-dmso-5-029">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The incidences of nausea and vomiting decreased over time in the exenatide group, regardless of dose. The occurrence of nausea decreased from 23.1% during the interval from week 0 to week 4 to 2.2% after week 28, with a substantial reduction in incidence rate after 8 weeks of treatment (6.5% during the interval from week 8 to week 12, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-dmso-5-029">Figure 3A</xref>). Vomiting decreased from 6.1% during the interval from week 0 to week 4 to 1.0% after week 28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-dmso-5-029">Figure 3B</xref>). There were few recurrences of nausea and vomiting events. An analysis of the duration of nausea and vomiting demonstrated that the nausea and vomiting events associated with exenatide treatment twice daily were dosedependent and that these events generally resolved in 1&#x02013;2 days in most patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-dmso-5-029">Figure 3C and D</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Hypoglycemia</title><p>The incidence of hypoglycemia was similar between the groups without sulfonylurea use. In a separate analysis of hypoglycemic events by concomitant sulfonylurea use, the incidence of hypoglycemia was low in patients who did not use a concomitant sulfonylurea (exenatide 3.1%, pooled comparator 2.7% [RD 0.4; 95% CI:&#x02212;1.1&#x02013;1.9] vs. with sulfonylurea use, 26.5% and 20.7%, respectively [RD 5.8; 95% CI: 3.0&#x02013;8.6]). Analysis by placebo-controlled or comparator-controlled groups and concomitant sulfonylurea showed significant differences between the exenatide and placebo subgroups in patients who received a sulfonylurea (25% versus 12%; 95% CI: 9.8&#x02013;16.2) and between the exenatide and insulin subgroups who did not receive a sulfonylurea (0.9% versus 3.4%; 95% CI: &#x02212;4.7 to &#x02212;0.2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-dmso-5-029">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, of the patients who experienced hypoglycemia, 99% of patients in the exenatide group and 93% of patients in the pooled comparator group were receiving sulfonylurea or insulin at the time of the hypoglycemia event. Major hypoglycemia was rare in all treatment groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Renal impairment, thyroid neoplasm, and pancreatitis</title><p>Renal impairment-related adverse events, including acute renal failure, were infrequently reported (1.6 per 100 PY for both groups) and there was no significant difference between groups (95% CI: &#x02212;1.0 to 1.0, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-dmso-5-029">Figure 5</xref>). Thyroid neoplasms, including benign and malignant, were rare. There was a difference in the exposure-adjusted incidence rate of thyroid neoplasms between groups, ie, 0.3 per 100 PY (incidence rate &#x0003c; 0.1%) in the exenatide group and 0 per 100 PY in the pooled comparator group (RD 0.3; 95% CI: 0.01&#x02013;0.53, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-dmso-5-029">Figure 5</xref>).

A patient was defined as having treatment-emergent anti-exenatide antibodies if antibodies were present after the first exenatide injection following absence of antibodies or missing antibody measurement at baseline, or if the titer increased by at least three dilutions from a detectable baseline measurement. The incidence of positive antibody titer was 35% (31% low titer [&#x02264;125] and 5% higher titer [&#x02265;625]) at endpoint (12&#x02013;52 weeks). Antibody titers peaked early (between weeks 6 and 16) and declined over time (25% of patients had positive titers for antibodies at 52 weeks and 17% had positive titers at 3 years). Overall, there was no difference in the incidence of all potentially immune-related adverse events between treatment groups (7.9% in the exenatide group and 7.4% in the pooled comparator group). A subset of patients had a slightly greater incidence of general disorders and administration site conditions associated with a positive antibody titer (2.8%) than with a negative titer (0.7%).</p><p>Analysis of the incidence rates of injection-site-related adverse events in the full analysis (19 studies) indicated that these reactions were rare in both groups (data not shown); injection site erythema (0.6% versus 0%; RD 0.5; 95% CI: 0.3&#x02013;0.8), injection-site pruritus (0.8% versus 0.1%; RD 0.7; 95% CI: 0.4&#x02013;1.0), injection-site urticaria (0.1% versus 0%; RD 0.1; 95% CI: 0.0&#x02013;0.2), injection-site rash (0.4% versus 0%; RD 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2&#x02013;0.6), and injection-site reaction (0.3% versus 0%; RD 0.3; 95% CI: 0.1&#x02013;0.5) were greater in the exenatide group compared with the pooled comparator group.

Overall, exenatide twice daily was safe and generally well tolerated. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events associated with exenatide treatment were gastrointestinal, and were mild and transient. The rate of serious adverse events and discontinuations due to serious adverse events were low overall and occurred at a similar rate in both the exenatide and pooled comparator groups. The results of long-term extension studies of exenatide twice daily (up to 3 years of treatment)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-dmso-5-029">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-dmso-5-029">29</xref> and postmarketing surveillance (over 1.6 million PY of exposure since launch) support these findings.</p><p>The present analysis included only randomized, controlled clinical trials of exenatide twice daily versus placebo or insulin, but several uncontrolled, open-label extension studies of exenatide twice daily have reported similar safety outcomes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-dmso-5-029">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-dmso-5-029">29</xref> In these open-label extension studies, gastrointestinal-related adverse events, particularly nausea and vomiting, were frequently reported and were the most common adverse events leading to study discontinuation. Further, these studies showed a low rate of serious adverse events and infrequent occurrence of hypoglycemia in the absence of concomitant sulfonylurea use. Of these trials, detailed, comparable safety data were reported for the 3-year endpoint of a large, open-label extension trial of 527 intent-to-treat patients treated with 10 &#x003bc;g exenatide twice daily.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-dmso-5-029">26</xref> In this trial, 11% of patients discontinued the study due to adverse events; in the present pooled analysis, 8% of exenatide patients discontinued due to adverse events. Nausea was reported by 59% of patients in the extension trial compared with 36.9% of patients in the current analysis, and most discontinuations due to adverse events were attributed to nausea in both the extension trial and our analysis. Hypoglycemia was reported by 40% and 30% of patients in the extension trial and current analysis, respectively (regardless of concomitant sulfonylurea use), but most cases were mild-to-moderate in severity. These findings were also reported in a 2009 systematic review by Norris et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dmso-5-029">1</xref> which also assessed safety results from eight of the studies included in the current analysis.</p><p>Mild-to-moderate nausea was the most frequently occurring treatment-emergent adverse event in this analysis; there was only one case of severe nausea. The GLP-1 receptor agonists are generally associated with increased gastrointestinal-related adverse events, and it is known that gastrointestinal symptoms are generally more frequent in patients with diabetes than in those without diabetes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-dmso-5-029">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-dmso-5-029">33</xref> The sensation of nausea with exenatide use is thought to be due to slowed gastric emptying, appetite suppression, or stimulation of neural GLP-1 receptors. However, with continued exenatide use, the frequency and severity of nausea and vomiting typically decreases over time, and dose titration moderates some of these events.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dmso-5-029">1</xref> As in the present analysis, studies of long-term use of exenatide twice daily have shown that nausea generally subsides with continued treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-dmso-5-029">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-dmso-5-029">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-dmso-5-029">34</xref> Studies of the GLP-1 receptor agonist, liraglutide, have produced similar results with regard to the prevalence of gastrointestinal-related adverse events and the transient occurrence of nausea.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-dmso-5-029">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-dmso-5-029">33</xref> The ability of antiemetics to mitigate nausea associated with antidiabetic agents is unknown given the paucity of data available on this subject in the literature. However, a recent analysis indicated that predosing with an oral antiemetic before a single 10 &#x003bc;g exenatide dose is associated with significant reductions in treatment-emergent nausea and vomiting in premedicated patients (17% and 7%, respectively) compared with nonpremedicated patients (62% and 38%, respectively).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-dmso-5-029">35</xref></p><p>Although the goal of achieving nearly normal HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels decreases many of the risks of hyperglycemia-related complications in diabetes, achieving this goal may be hindered by the occurrence of hypoglycemia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-dmso-5-029">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-dmso-5-029">37</xref> The incidence of hypoglycemia was low, overall, and the rate of these events was similar between exenatide-treated patients and placebo-treated patients. Most events of hypoglycemia occurred with concomitant sulfonylurea use. In the absence of concomitant sulfonylurea use, exenatide-treated patients experienced rates of hypoglycemia similar to those in patients treated with placebo, and lower rates of hypoglycemia than patients treated with insulin. Major hypoglycemia was rare in all treatment groups.</p><p>In addition to an increase in pancreatitis in the general population in recent years, which may be due to the greater rates of obesity, hyperlipidemia, and obstruction of the common bile duct by gall stones,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-dmso-5-029">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-dmso-5-029">43</xref> concerns about pancreatitis with antihyperglycemic agents have been emphasized by postmarketing safety surveillance and case reports.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-dmso-5-029">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48-dmso-5-029">48</xref> In 2007 and 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a safety alert and update based on postmarketing surveillance that reported a total of 36 cases of acute pancreatitis in patients treated with exenatide.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-dmso-5-029">44</xref> However, a definitive diagnosis of pancreatitis was not available in all of these cases, because many of the patients in the reports did not have a computed tomography scan (or other imaging) to confirm the diagnosis; further, most of these patients had at least one other risk factor for pancreatitis. In contrast, large postmarketing studies found no evidence to support an association between exenatide and increased risk of pancreatitis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-dmso-5-029">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52-dmso-5-029">52</xref> One study of a large cohort of patients (exenatide n = 27,996 and an approximately equal number of matched comparators) from a health insurance claims database found no association between exenatide and pancreatitis; the incidence of acute pancreatitis (0.13%) was comparable for initiators of exenatide relative to the comparator group (0.12%; RR 1.0; 95% CI: 0.6&#x02013;1.7).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-dmso-5-029">49</xref> Additionally, results from an analysis of a national integrated claims database showed that patients with type 2 diabetes had a two-fold higher risk of pancreatitis and that there was no definite association between exenatide use and increased incidence of pancreatitis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50-dmso-5-029">50</xref> Other antidiabetic therapies have also been associated with the development of pancreatitis, but such occurrences have been rare.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51-dmso-5-029">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53-dmso-5-029">53</xref></p><p>Obesity and dyslipidemia have been associated with an increased risk of developing pancreatitis and are risk factors for further morbidity and mortality in patients who have pancreatitis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-dmso-5-029">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-dmso-5-029">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-dmso-5-029">42</xref> Moreover, patients with type 2 diabetes appear to be at increased risk for pancreatitis, as shown by two large studies of health care databases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54-dmso-5-029">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55-dmso-5-029">55</xref> The first, a study of a large US health insurance claims database demonstrated that patients with type 2 diabetes were at 2.8-fold greater risk (95% CI: 2.61&#x02013;3.06) of pancreatitis compared with a nondiabetic cohort.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54-dmso-5-029">54</xref> In the second study of a European health database, the risk of developing acute pancreatitis was elevated in patients with type 2 diabetes, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.5 (95% CI: 1.31&#x02013;1.70).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55-dmso-5-029">55</xref></p><p>Events of exenatide-associated renal impairment or renal failure are reported infrequently in published studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-dmso-5-029">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57-dmso-5-029">57</xref> In the current analysis, the exposure-adjusted incidence rate of renal impairment was 1.6 per 100 PY in both the exenatide and pooled comparator groups. These data are consistent with the results of an analysis of six clinical trials<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58-dmso-5-029">58</xref> that found no association between exenatide twice daily or placebo in renal adverse events and similar changes in kidney function between patients in both groups. However, because exenatide is primarily cleared via renal mechanisms,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59-dmso-5-029">59</xref> a labeled warning remains stating that exenatide twice daily should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &#x0003c; 30 mL/minute) or end-stage renal disease, should be used with caution in patients with renal transplantation, and caution should be exercised when initiating or escalating doses of exenatide in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL/minute). Additionally, because exenatide may induce nausea and vomiting with transient hypovolemia, treatment may worsen renal function.</p><p>Thyroid cancers have become a topic of interest with the GLP-1 receptor agonists, because sustained GLP-1 agonism has been associated with an increased incidence of C-cell adenomas and carcinomas in rodents,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60-dmso-5-029">60</xref> although the clinical relevance of the animal data is unknown. In particular, there appears to be a species-specific difference in thyroid C-cell response to GLP-1 receptor agonists that causes C-cell secretion of calcitonin and hyperplasia in rodents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60-dmso-5-029">60</xref> In the present analysis, all occurrences of thyroid neoplasm were benign and very rare; the exposure-adjusted incidence rate of any thyroid neoplasm was 0.3 per 100 PY with exenatide compared with no occurrences of thyroid neoplasm with placebo/insulin (RD 0.3; 95% CI: 0.01&#x02013;0.53). Thyroid neoplasm has also rarely been reported with liraglutide, and studies monitoring calcitonin have indicated similar levels with liraglutide and comparators.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61-dmso-5-029">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63-dmso-5-029">63</xref></p><p>Overall, major adverse cardiovascular events were uncommon in this analysis. Recently, an association has been suggested between use of GLP-1 receptor agonists and improvement in cardiovascular risk factors. In an analysis of cardiovascular-related events from a large insurance database, exenatide treatment twice daily was associated with a lower 10-year risk of cardiovascular-related adverse events and hospitalizations than were other antidiabetic treatments.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64-dmso-5-029">64</xref> However, data from controlled, adequately powered clinical trials with prospectively blinded adjudication of cardiovascular events are needed to evaluate whether exenatide has cardioprotective effects; one such trial is underway (EXSCEL trial, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01144338).</p><p>During treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists, antibodies to treatment may develop in some patients, as has been observed with other peptide therapeutics.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61-dmso-5-029">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65-dmso-5-029">65</xref> Antibody formation to therapeutic peptides is common, even when the peptide is identical to the endogenous human form. Analysis of antibodies showed that 37% of exenatide-treated patients developed antibodies to exenatide after 30 weeks of treatment; this rate fell to 17% after 3 years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-dmso-5-029">23</xref> In studies of liraglutide, antibodies developed in approximately 8% of patients who received liraglutide treatment for up to 26 weeks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66-dmso-5-029">66</xref> Analysis of cross-reactivity in a subset of antibody-positive patients showed that treatment-emergent antibodies to exenatide did not cross-react with human GLP-1 or glucagon. In the LEAD-6 trial of liraglutide, 4.4% (five of 113) of antibody-positive samples cross reacted with GLP-1. However, because no baseline data were provided for the LEAD-6 patients, it is unknown whether the cross-reactivity was pre-existing or treatment-emergent.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67-dmso-5-029">67</xref></p><p>It should also be noted that previous studies have indicated that a low antibody titer is not predictive of safety or efficacy issues.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-dmso-5-029">23</xref> However, results of the subanalysis presented in this manuscript indicate that there was no difference between groups in potentially immune-related adverse events overall, and only a slight increase in the occurrence of some injection-site-related adverse events in patients with a positive antibody titer to exenatide.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>There are several strengths of this analysis, ie, a large number of patients were included in the pooled data set, the trials were randomized and controlled with centralized monitoring and laboratory analyses, and the results were derived from individual patient data. Limitations were that adverse events were not independently adjudicated; the design of this analysis was not adequately powered to detect very rare adverse events (incidence rate &#x0003c; 0.01%), and the duration of the trials may not have been long enough to observe some adverse events, eg, cancers. Additionally, because the pooled comparator included blinded placebo and open-label active comparator (insulin) groups, specific adverse events associated with the active comparator may have been under-represented when combined with placebo-related adverse events, affecting direct comparisons between the exenatide and pooled comparator groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This integrated analysis of adverse event data for 5594 patients representing over 1500 PY of exenatide twice daily exposure provided a comprehensive evaluation of the safety and tolerability of exenatide twice daily. The rates of serious adverse events were low overall, and incidences were similar in both the exenatide and pooled comparator groups. Discontinuations due to adverse events occurred more frequently in the exenatide group and were often due to gastrointestinal-related adverse events. The greatest differences in incidences between the exenatide and comparator groups were in gastrointestinal-related adverse events, which were also the most frequently occurring adverse events with exenatide, a commonality among therapies in the GLP-1 receptor agonist class. The occurrence of nausea and vomiting may be perceived as treatment-limiting, but these events were generally mild in intensity, occurred most frequently upon initiation of treatment, and decreased over time. In the absence of concomitant sulfonylurea use, exenatide-treated patients experienced a low incidence of hypoglycemia, with rates of hypoglycemia similar to those in patients treated with placebo and lower than in patients treated with insulin. Exposure-adjusted adverse event rates for pancreatitis, renal-related adverse events, and MACE were low and generally similar between groups; thyroid neoplasm was also rare with exenatide but the incidence was higher than that of the comparator because there were no occurrences of thyroid neoplasm with placebo or insulin. Taken together, the results of this analysis showed that exenatide twice daily was safe and generally well tolerated in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the patients and investigators who participated in the included studies.
