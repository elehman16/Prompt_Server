Following a phase III trial concerning the effect of palliative CRT in inoperable poor prognosis patients, this analysis was performed to explore how tumor size influenced survival and health-related quality of life (HRQOL).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 188 poor prognosis patients recruited in a randomized clinical trial received four courses intravenous carboplatin day 1 and oral vinorelbine day 1 and 8, at 3-week intervals. The experimental arm (N = 94) received radiotherapy with fractionation 42 Gy/15, starting at the second chemotherapy course. This subset study compares outcomes in patients with tumors larger than 7 cm (N = 108) versus tumors 7 cm or smaller (N = 76).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among those with tumors larger than 7 cm, the median overall survival in the chemotherapy versus CRT arm was 9.7 and 13.4 months, respectively (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001). The 1-year survival was 33% and 56%, respectively (<italic>p</italic> = 0.01). Except for a temporary decline during treatment, HRQOL was maintained in the CRT arm, regardless of tumor size.

Because we considered PS 2; weight loss larger than 10% and tumor size 8 cm or larger to be negative prognostic factors, the high percentage of patients with large tumors in this material is caused by the aim of the original study.</p><p>The original phase III trial (the Conrad study), on which this substudy is based, confirmed a significant benefit from palliative CRT compared with palliative chemotherapy alone, with a median survival of 12.6 months versus 9.7 months, respectively.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Palliative CRT increased OS time regardless of tumor size, and the survival gain was most prominent for patients with tumors larger than 7 cm (1-year survival 56% versus 33%; 2-year survival 32% versus 6.1%). The median survival time for patients with tumors larger than 7 cm was comparable with the findings in other studies,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> where better prognosis patients received definitive CRT or radiation alone. In a smaller retrospective material, Wiersma et al.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> found that approximately one of five patients with large tumors survived 3 years when given treatment with definitive CRT containing a cisplatin doublet. In our material, we observed a slightly better 3-year survival (20%) in the larger than 7 cm tumor group receiving palliative CRT.</p><p>Several authors have reported a strong sex-dependent difference in survival among patients with NSCLC.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Weight loss at time of diagnosis is also a factor known to have impact on survival.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Sex and weight loss were not significant predictive factors in our study. However, there were somewhat less weight loss and more women in the tumor larger than 7 cm group, and especially for those treated with CRT. This may possibly have contributed to the increased survival in the group of tumors larger than 7 cm. In contrast, poor PS 2, being one of the strongest prognostic factors in NSCLC,<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> was overrepresented in the tumor larger than 7 cm group and especially for the CRT treated.</p><p>The CRT patients experienced a significantly increased incidence of esophagitis and had significantly more hospitalizations attributable to side effects regardless of tumor size. Beyond this, the hematological toxicities were modest, and no serious pulmonary toxicity was observed. This may be explained by chemotherapy doses and radiation being adjusted to a palliative intent. Besides, the relatively large percentage of CRT patients who developed esophagitis may be diminished by modern radiation techniques in the future.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p><p>A large tumor is expected to give more symptoms than a smaller one. CRT may relieve these symptoms. However, radiation and chemotherapy are related to certain side effects that will influence symptoms and quality of life during and shortly after the treatment period.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> In this study, profiles of the HRQOL recordings demonstrate an increase in dysphagia and a decline in functional values during treatment. As expected, this was most pronounced for those receiving CRT. However, the post-treatment beneficial HRQOL changes for those treated with CRT were most evident for patients with larger tumors (&#x0003e;7 cm).</p><p>The lack of available positron emission tomography-CT scanning in Norway at the time of inclusion may imply that the study group does not reflect the current stage III NSCLC population. By using CT alone, one may underestimate nodal involvement and/or overestimate tumor size by unintentionally including atelectasis. Considering that approximately 80% of our patients had N3 disease, this will not weaken the argument for CRT to patients with tumors larger than 7 cm.</p><p>Several authors have found the TNM classification system inaccurate or insufficient in predicting the treatment effect on survival in nonoperable NSCLC patients, especially with respect to the impact of tumor size.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> An unfortunate lack of distinction between predictive and prognostic factors may be one reason.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> It should be noted that a prognostic factor provides information on the likely outcome of a cancer disease in an untreated individual, whereas a predictive factor provides information about the likely effect of a treatment.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p><p>Morgensztern et al.,<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> who examined 12,315 patients with locally advanced stage III NSCLC N2-3 disease from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry, included patients strictly on the basis of TNM staging, regardless of the treatment. They found tumor size to be an independent prognostic factor. Ball et al. recently published the results data on 868 patients of all TNM stages included in The IASLC Staging Project. The tumor diameters were known, and the cancers were subjected to radical radiotherapy or combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The authors found that tumor size smaller than 3 cm was associated with a longer survival than larger tumors, but evidence on the prognostic effect by increasing size above the 3-cm cutoff was weak. The assessments have been made on comparisons with treatment effect on smaller tumors. Accordingly, they do not tell us much about how treatment on larger tumors compares with no treatment or best supportive care.</p><p>Werner-Wasik et al.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> specifically addressed treatment effect on different tumor volumes in a small study published in 2008. They found that larger tumor volumes were associated with larger risk of local failure, and smaller tumors were associated with improved OS. But these findings were not compared with a control group. Several other authors have addressed tumor size and volume as a prognostic factor for survival.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> All these studies have dealt with patients who received definitive treatment. But while these authors, to a varying degree, demonstrate that a large tumor may be a negative prognostic factor, the treatment effect was not specifically addressed. A poor prognosis does not preclude an excellent treatment effect. These studies cannot be used as an argument against treating bulky tumors.</p><p>Aup&#x000e9;rin et al.<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> found that CRT has a significant effect on locoregional control. This is consistent with the findings in our study: Regardless of tumor size, patients receiving CRT had a significant reduction in lung recurrence and progression. However, the percentages of recurrence and progression in the lungs after CRT in our study (approximately 40%) were considerably larger than those in the limited material of Alexander et al.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> (11%). This may reflect that the radiation dose in our study was too low.<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Further research should be performed on bulky NSCLC tumors, employing modern, more advanced, radiation techniques.</p><p>To our knowledge this is the first study to explore the effect of CRT compared with chemotherapy alone in poor-risk NSCLC patients with bulky tumor masses. Our results demonstrate that, although a large tumor may be considered a negative prognostic factor, it is not a negative predictive factor. Patients with large NSCLC tumors seem to benefit notably from concomitant chemoradiation.</p></sec><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This research was supported by unrestricted grants from the North Norway Regional Health Authority and Pierre Fabre.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>Disclosure: Dr. Str&#x000f8;m has received payment for lectures from Glaxo Wellcome and support for travel to meetings from Perre Fabre and Glaxo Wellcome.
