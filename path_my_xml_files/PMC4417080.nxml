There is evidence that altered serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission are both associated with impaired attentional control. Specifically, phasic alertness is one specific aspect of attention that has been linked to changes in 5-HT and DA availability in different neurocircuitries related to attentional processes. The present study investigated the impact of short-term reductions in central nervous system 5-HT and DA synthesis, which was achieved by dietary depletion of the relevant precursor AA, on phasic alertness in healthy adult volunteers; body weight&#x02013;adapted dietary tryptophan and phenylalanine&#x02013;tyrosine depletion (PTD) techniques were used.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods</title><p>The study employed a double-blind between-subject design. Fifty healthy male and female subjects were allocated to three groups in a randomized and counterbalanced manner and received three different dietary challenge conditions: acute tryptophan depletion (ATD, for the depletion of 5-HT; <italic>N</italic>=16), PTD (for the depletion of DA; <italic>N</italic>=17), and a balanced AA load (BAL; <italic>N</italic>=17), which served as a control condition. Three hours after challenge intake (ATD/PTD/BAL), phasic alertness was assessed using a standardized test battery for attentional performance (TAP). Blood samples for AA level analyses were obtained at baseline and 360 min after the challenge intake.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results</title><p>Overall, there were no significant differences in phasic alertness for the different challenge conditions. Regarding PTD administration, a positive correlation between the reaction times and the DA-related depletion magnitude was detected via the lower plasma tyrosine levels and the slow reaction times of the first run of the task. In contrast, higher tryptophan concentrations were associated with slower reaction times in the fourth run of the task in the same challenge group.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study is the first to demonstrate preliminary data that support an association between decreased central nervous system DA synthesis, which was achieved by dietary depletion strategies, and slower reaction times in specific runs of a task designed to assess phasic alertness in healthy adult volunteers; these findings are consistent with previous evidence that links phasic alertness with dopaminergic neurotransmission. A lack of significant differences between the three groups could be due to compensatory mechanisms and the limited sample size, as well as the dietary challenge procedures administered to healthy participants and the strict exclusion criteria used. The potential underlying neurochemical processes related to phasic alertness should be the subject of further investigations.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>dietary challenge procedures</kwd><kwd>amino acids</kwd><kwd>acute tryptophan depletion</kwd><kwd>phenylalanine&#x02013;tyrosine depletion</kwd><kwd>serotonin</kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>phasic alertness</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Attention is one of the most widely studied topics within the experimental and clinical neurosciences. Regarding the underlying neurobiological and neurochemical properties, attentional processes have been linked to changes in central nervous dopaminergic (DA) and serotonergic (5-HT) neurotransmission. Of note, the central nervous system availability of these particular neurotransmitters can be manipulated by changing the intake of their respective precursor amino acids (AA) using dietary depletion strategies (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>); this approach enables short-term manipulations of these neurotransmitters within experimental settings. As a consequence, the assessment of attentional performance after dietary depletion of central nervous system DA and 5-HT synthesis enables conclusions to be drawn regarding the impact of these neurotransmitters on different aspects of attention.</p><p>Current evidence suggests that the attention system in humans consists of various anatomical networks, which are specified into different functions (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), and must be differentiated from processing systems, which are responsible for memory storage, decision-making and problem-solving activities (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Posner and Petersen (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) described three different networks that comprised the attention system: orienting, executive, and alerting. The main task of the orienting network is to prioritize all sensory inputs. When processing information, a selection for a modality or a location occurs. The executive network is primarily involved in target detection. Different targets can be monitored at the same time; however, the moment of detection causes interferences, which lead to a slower detection of other stimuli (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Alertness, which is the subject of the present study, can be subdivided into two domains, tonic and phasic. Tonic alertness is described as a particular form of vigilance. In contrast, phasic alertness is required to be prepared for an expected stimulus. The performance is better if a warning signal, such as a cued stimulus, is provided, depending on the interval between the warning signal and signal detection (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>The anatomical correlates of alertness include a variety of different brain regions. The dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) exhibits activation during phasic alertness tasks that are characterized by the use of a warning signal (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Another region, which is of particular importance in the context of alertness and attention, is the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>); the ACC is rich in dopaminergic projections and plays a critical role in attentional processes. Research has identified ACC dysfunctions in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by inattention, impulsiveness, and hyperactivity (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). PET and fMRI studies have identified activations in the frontal, parietal, thalamic, and brain-stem networks and have primarily demonstrated the right hemisphere to be involved in phasic alertness tasks (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>The normal function of the alertness network is influenced by many neurotransmitters with complex interactions, including transport mechanisms and degradation pathways. The central nervous system availability of neurotransmitters that are relevant for attentional processes (i.e. alertness) include, among others, 5-HT, DA, and noradrenaline (NE) (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). These particular neurotransmitter systems can be modulated through a variety of different mechanisms: polymorphisms in monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), one of the most important enzymes in the brain, and the degradation of biogenic amines (including the key neurotransmitters 5-HT, DA, and NE) significantly influence reaction times in the attention network test (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The same effect applies for catechol-<italic>O</italic>-methyl-transferase COMT, an enzyme that inactivates catecholaminergic neurotransmitters and impacts the dopaminergic signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The SNR refers to local cortical microcircuits which are essential to cortical representation of external and internal stimuli (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Moderate DA elevations thereby improve signaling to a certain extent (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Furthermore, the perception of external stimuli is subject to top-down control associated with the prefrontal cortex, which receives ascending information from the major neurotransmitter systems, such as DA, 5-HT, acetylcholine (Ach), and noradrenaline (NA) (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>The efficiency of the alerting network is primarily manipulated by NE, whereas the alerting and orienting networks are thought to be related to cholinergic and DA-related modulations, with evidence that originates from research involving pharmacological manipulations (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Research on neuropharmacological mechanisms often uses the strategy of changing the central nervous availability of neurotransmitters by manipulating the availability of their relevant precursor AAs, which, in turn, can be changed by established dietary depletion strategies using established procedures (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>)
.</p><p>In general, plasma concentrations of AAs are not only regulated by the amount of food ingested but also by the composition of macronutrients that determine the ratio of AAs to each other in plasma, and thus can affect their availability in the brain through a variety of mechanisms. Because the underlying enzymes for neurotransmitter synthesis are not fully saturated, changes in the concentrations of the relevant precursor AAs are one possible mechanism to impact neurotransmitter synthesis. Changes in the ratio of carbohydrates to proteins ingested can cause differences in plasma tryptophan and LNAAs ratios. Meals rich in proteins cause a decrease in the ratio of plasma tryptophan to LNAAs, in particular as they provide less TRP than LNAAs and thus facilitate influx of AAs other than TRP into the brain.</p><p>In contrast, insulin secretion after a carbohydrate-rich meal will likely increase the ratio of plasma TRP to LNAAs via an increased AA uptake into the liver and muscles. In the central nervous system, insulin is involved in weight control and regulation through the reduction of energy intake (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Those two mechanisms (insulin secretion after carbohydrate intake and AA metabolism in the liver) are almost balanced if carbohydrates and proteins are ingested in a ratio of 5:6 (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The same applies to changes in tyrosine concentrations. However, it needs to be mentioned that the effects of tyrosine on central nervous dopamine synthesis are thought to be less pronounced than the effects of TRP for brain 5-HT synthesis, the reason for this being related to the activity of the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase whose catalytic activity does not only depend on enzyme saturation but also on the availability of its cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Finally, disorders like premenstrual syndrome, seasonal depression and affective disorders are characterized by disturbances in mood and appetite, possibly associated with craving for carbohydrates. Moreover, research suggests that carbohydrates consumed can increase 5-HT availability in the brain and can thus impact mood (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).
</p><p>The present work focuses on phasic alertness and its neurochemical underpinnings modulated by the neurotransmitters 5-HT and DA and the dietary availability of their respective precursor AAs. Tonic and phasic alertness, which are the two main components of the alertness construct, are closely related to arousal in humans. As previously discussed, these neurotransmitter systems are thought to be related to the attention system in the human brain. The present study investigates the effects of diminished central nervous system 5-HT and DA synthesis, which was achieved by dietary acute tryptophan depletion (ATD, which decreases central nervous system 5-HT synthesis) and phenylalanine&#x02013;tyrosine depletion (PTD, which decreases DA synthesis in the brain), on phasic alertness in healthy adult volunteers. This research is of particular importance to gain further understanding of the underlying mechanisms related to attentional processes and to develop novel strategies for interventions in patients with attentional problems, which potentially use neurodietary concepts and related approaches. Although the results of studies that have focused on the effects of ATD on memory, attention, and executive functions are somewhat inconsistent, we expected that reduced serotonergic inhibition on monoaminergic and cholinergic systems would improve attentional control (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Deficiencies in attention, memory, and motivational and behavioral processes have been identified in patients with ADHD, a neuropsychiatric disorder with an etiology most likely associated with changes in dopaminergic turnover. The most common treatment for ADHD is methylphenidate, which increases extracellular DA in the brain and thereby reduces impulsiveness and inattentiveness. A correlation between DA and alterations in attentional processes has been demonstrated (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>); however, mixed findings have been reported in studies that used PTD or systematic administration of selective DA receptor agonists and antagonists. Therefore, we expected that PTD would lead to impaired attentional control and subsequently slower reaction times in a phasic alertness task.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S0002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S0002-S20001"><title>Study sample</title><p>In the present study, data from a sample that comprised 50 healthy adult subjects were analyzed.

A screening procedure for mental disorders (SCID; Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV axis I disorders) was implemented to exclude DSM-IV Axis I disorders known to be associated with changes in neurotransmitter systems of the human brain. This study was part of a larger testing battery that included an fMRI-experiment on social decision-making, which is the subject of a different publication. In addition to the standard contraindications of an MRI examination, an IQ below 85, substance abuse and pregnancy were exclusion criteria. Moreover, the individual BMI of every subject was calculated as surrogate for possible pathological differences in the metabolism of AA. All subjects came from the same catchment area, and most of the participants were students of similar educational and socio-economic background. In this way, the study sample kept as homogenous as possible to avoid further factors influencing behavioral and biological testing results.</p><p>A body weight&#x02013;adapted dietary depletion procedure termed Moja-De was used (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). One major advantage of the body weight&#x02013;adapted dietary depletion procedure is its improved tolerability, which also enables its use in children and adolescents (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). In addition, the Moja-De procedure also considers baseline plasma TRP concentrations because of a positive correlation between baseline TRP and body weight (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Moreover, the ATD challenge procedure has recently been validated in an animal model (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) and demonstrated a significant decrease in TRP influx into the brain following administration in healthy adults (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In addition, a recent study demonstrated that a PTD challenge administration in accordance with body weight affected DA synthesis and reduced TYR and HVA concentrations in the brain (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S20002"><title>Study design</title><p>A randomized, double-blind, between-subject design was used (the reason for this was that some of the behavioral testing batteries administered to the subjects are difficult to be used in a repeated measures design because of learning effects; these data are subject to different publications). The subjects were assigned to three groups in a randomized and counterbalanced manner: dietary depletion of 5-HT (ATD), depletion of DA (PTD), and a control group (BAL). Testing was conducted on one study day for each subject. The present publication focuses on the behavioral data related to aspects of phasic alertness. AA administration and the assessment of attentional performance as indexed by phasic alertness were followed by an fMRI experiment, which examined aspects of social decision-making performed 300 min after AA administration (the data from this experiment are the subject of a different publication).</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S20003"><title>Depletion procedure</title><p>ATD is a neurodietary method used to achieve a short-term reduction in central nervous system 5-HT synthesis, which induces short-term serotonergic dysfunction. This method enables the examination of the underlying effects of 5-HT on different behavioral, affective and biological parameters. 5-HT, which cannot cross the blood&#x02013;brain barrier, must be synthesized in the brain. The essential AA tryptophan (TRP) serves as the biological precursor of 5-HT, and TRP must be obtained with daily nutrition intake. TRP uptake into the brain across the blood&#x02013;brain barrier is mediated by a transport protein called L-1, which facilitates AA influx across the blood&#x02013;brain barrier. In addition to TRP, L-1 is also utilized by tyrosine ([TYR], which serves as a precursor for DA) and other large neutral amino acids (LNAAs). As a consequence, changes in the concentrations of AAs that use L-1 can impact AA influx and biological precursor availability for neurotransmitters in the brain. The rate-limiting step in central nervous system 5-HT synthesis is the hydroxylation of TRP into 5-hydroxytryptophan, which is controlled by the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH-2). Under physiological conditions, this particular enzyme is only saturated up to 50%. Thus, dietary changes in physiological 5-HT-related precursor availability (in terms of TRP) automatically lead to altered enzyme saturations, which can then lead to changes in the synthesis rate (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). In ATD, participants are provided a TRP-free mixture of LNAAs for oral intake. The resulting diminished TRP influx into the brain is attributed to combined effects: First, the administered AAs compete with TRP for uptake into the brain. Second, a stimulated protein biosynthesis in the liver, where endogenous TRP is consumed and removes TRP from plasma stores, must also be considered. Moreover, a passive diffusion of TRP across the blood&#x02013;brain barrier contributes to the overall TRP balance in the central nervous system. PTD is based on the same underlying principle as ATD. The corresponding AA mixtures used for PTD are lacking in the catecholamine precursor phenylalanine (PHE). Although PHE belongs to the group of essential AAs, it is the lack of TYR (a dispensable or nonessential AA) that reduces DA synthesis because of reduced substrate availability for the key regulatory enzyme in catecholamine synthesis, tyrosine hydroxylase, which is normally not fully saturated (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). As previously discussed, both DA precursors use the same transport system as TRP to cross the blood&#x02013;brain barrier.

However, a dimensional analysis indicated that in the PTD challenge group, lower TYR concentrations as a surrogate for decreased DA-related precursor availability were correlated with slower reaction times in the first run of the task. In contrast, a higher TRP concentration in the same group was correlated with a slower reaction time in the fourth run of the task, whereas other runs of the task did not exhibit this association. Overall, the study findings are largely negative, which could be because of the sample size, as supported by the data obtained from the post-hoc power analysis. However, the lack of differences in alertness performance between the three challenge groups could also be because of functional and intact compensation mechanisms. This concept appears plausible from biological and, in part, genetic viewpoints because none of the subjects had a personal or family history of a psychiatric disorder, which has been shown to influence mood, motivational processes and neural reward pathways after monoamine depletion (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Moreover, phasic alertness is one of the most basic aspects of human attention. A basic requirement of such important and basic functions is stability against external effects. Changes in the plasma TRP ratio occurring after a carbohydrate-rich meal may slightly modify 5-HT synthesis. However, an increase in circulating TRP in the periphery cannot be equated to equivalent changes in brain TRP concentrations, in particular because brain TRP availability depends on the ratio of TRP to LNAAs. Factors possibly influencing TRP supply are therefore frequency, size, and composition of meals ingested and the resultant insulin secretion (of note, no subject had diabetes, and all subjects participated after an overnight protein fast and also had a standardized breakfast, which is a standard procedure in ATD-related research).
</p><p>Attentional performance is somewhat more vulnerable to dietary depletion of DA, whereas 5-HT is more responsible for impulsive behavior (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). There is evidence that the ascending serotonergic system has inhibitory effects on other monoamine and cholinergic neurotransmitter systems, in particular, regarding behavioral inhibition and cortical de-arousal (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Similar to DA, 5-HT plays an important role in many physiological functions. Hence, 5-HT depletion may improve attentional control in the short term. This particular finding could explain the identified correlation between TRP and RT<sub>mdn</sub> in the PTD group, with the elevated TRP concentrations serving as a potential cause of the slower reaction times. However, higher TRP concentrations cannot be the sole explanation for the slower reaction times identified because they cannot explain the negative findings in the balanced group with similar TRP concentrations after AA ingestion. These observations could be explained through a declined SNR in the participants of the PTD-challenge group. In particular, DA optimizes signal processing via the augmentation of the SNR (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Mehta et al. demonstrated that MPH may have improved response to signals with concomitant suppression of background noise and thereby improved the task results of participants, which depended on the individual baseline levels in the task (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Although DA and 5-HT have distinct and even partially opposed functions regarding attentional control, both systems significantly interact because their functions in prefrontal cortical networks are inextricably related (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). The interactions between these two neurotransmitter systems have been emphasized in several other studies. Harrison demonstrated that increased impulsiveness in 5-HT-depleted rats, which was caused by brain lesions, was blocked through the administration of a D1-receptor antagonist (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Regarding the detected preliminary associations, if these findings are replicated in larger studies, the findings of the present study together with previous research may suggest that short-term decreases in the synthesis rates of central nervous system DA and 5-HT, which are achieved by dietary depletion strategies, lead to dysfunctional interactions between these two ascending neurochemical systems.</p><p>The dietary depletion challenge administration (ATD, PTD) resulted in significantly lowered TRP, PHE, and TYR concentrations and TRP, PHE, and TYR ratios, respectively. ATD decreased the TRP ratio by 65%, whereas PTD lowered the PHE ratio by 65% and the TYR ratio by 82%. Overall, these data indicate that the neurochemical depletion paradigms had the intended effect. Recent studies in mice that used the same Moja-De AA-mixtures as humans confirmed the reduced brain 5-HT and DA synthesis after challenge administration (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Moreover, indirect evidence originates from studies in humans that used plasma concentrations of relevant AAs (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), the prolactin response to fenfluramine administration (<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) or corresponding metabolites (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) as markers for successful depletion. It must be mentioned that in the past, multiple and quite diverse dietary depletion formulas have been used to alter serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission, which complicates a detailed comparison (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Furthermore, PTD-treated mice exhibited changes in brain TRP in the frontal cortex compared with the BAL condition (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). These results are of particular importance specifically because prefrontal cortical functions play a major role in attentional control, which is mediated through the ascending dopaminergic and serotoninergic projections (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>).</p><p>Deficiencies in attentional control, motivational processes, memory, and behavioral processes are present in different clinical populations, such as in patients with ADHD. The present study is the first study to identify preliminary data that indicates lower plasma TYR levels after PTD were correlated with slower reaction times in specific runs of the task used. A decrease in reaction time tasks has been demonstrated in previous research using dietary depletion of TYR and PHE to attenuate central nervous system DA function, which suggests a role for DA in motor readiness and other cognitive functions (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Further work has identified baseline-dependent improvements in cognitive function after the administration of D1 receptor agonists in rats (with individual differences in performance) (<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). With regard to a review of the effects of ATD administration on memory, attention, and executive functions, our findings are somewhat conflicting because no effect of dietary ATD administration on sustained or divided attention was identified (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In contrast, it was shown that involuntary attention shifting was altered after ATD administration, which was indexed by effects on EEG data (<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>).</p><p>Increased TRP influx across blood&#x02013;brain barrier can be observed after both BAL and PTD challenges (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). An effective TRP-loading can be achieved with doses of TRP in relation to the competing AAs and an even lower dose than used in this study (<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Overall, if confirmed by future larger studies, the preliminary results from the dimensional analysis could suggest that in subjects with an altered DA synthesis, TRP loading may positively affect attentional control. However, at this stage, this finding remains speculative and must be further investigated.</p><p>Some advantages of this study should be highlighted. The dietary depletion method (Moja-De) used is advantageous because of its acceptable tolerability, which enables its use even in children and adolescents (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). The body weight&#x02013;adapted dosing is likely to reduce side effects without affecting the depletion magnitude, which has been demonstrated in rodents and humans. As expected, depletion resulted in significantly lowered TRP, PHE, and TYR concentrations.</p><p>The present study also has several limitations. The limited sample size and the between-subjects design must be considered confounders. Moreover, the challenge conditions (ATD and PTD) used are thought to affect the whole brain, which raises the likely problem of regional differences in ATD and PTD induced changes in central nervous system neurotransmitter synthesis. Using the outlined depletion paradigms, it is not possible to elucidate specific dopaminergic or serotonergic functions related to different brain regions and isolated neurocircuits. Depletion may vary from one brain region to another region (<xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Studies that combine functional neuroimaging techniques and depletion and other neurochemical concepts are of particular value to examine the impact of different neurotransmitters in healthy and vulnerable populations regarding different brain regions (<xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>).</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effects of dietary ATD and PTD administration on phasic alertness in healthy adult volunteers. Overall, the results were primarily negative. However, if confirmed by future research, the results of the conducted dimensional analysis of the present pilot study may support the complex nature of serotonergic and dopaminergic interactions in the regulation of phasic alertness, which may have implications for the better understanding, and consequently, treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders related to monoaminergic dysfunctions. Future research with larger samples is necessary to further disentangle the relationship between the central nervous system availability of 5-HT and DA, with the potential use of dietary depletion protocols that aim to alter neurotransmitter synthesis with regard to related dietary precursor availability.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="S0005"><title>Conflict of interest and funding</title><p>This study was funded by the Excellence Initiative of the German federal and state governments.
