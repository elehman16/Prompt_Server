Programmes that attract and retain high numbers of parents provide an enhanced opportunity to improve public health and are also likely to be more cost-effective than those that do not. We have developed a theory-informed optimisation intervention to promote parent engagement within an existing childhood obesity prevention group programme, HENRY (Health Exercise Nutrition for the Really Young). Here, we describe a proposal to evaluate the effectiveness of this optimisation intervention in regard to the engagement of parents and cost-effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The Optimising Family Engagement in HENRY (OFTEN) trial is a cluster randomised controlled trial being conducted across 24 local authorities (approximately 144 children&#x02019;s centres) which currently deliver HENRY programmes. The primary outcome will be parental enrolment and attendance at the HENRY programme, assessed using routinely collected process data. Cost-effectiveness will be presented in terms of primary outcomes using acceptability curves and through eliciting the willingness to pay for the optimisation from HENRY commissioners. Secondary outcomes include the longitudinal impact of the optimisation, parent-reported infant intake of fruits and vegetables (as a proxy to compliance) and other parent-reported family habits and lifestyle.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This innovative trial will provide evidence on the implementation of a theory-informed optimisation intervention to promote parent engagement in HENRY, a community-based childhood obesity prevention programme. The findings will be generalisable to other interventions delivered to parents in other community-based environments. This research meets the expressed needs of commissioners, children&#x02019;s centres and parents to optimise the potential impact that HENRY has on obesity prevention. A subsequent cluster randomised controlled pilot trial is planned to determine the practicality of undertaking a definitive trial to robustly evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the optimised intervention on childhood obesity prevention.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02675699">NCT02675699</ext-link>.

Childhood obesity impacts physiological and psychological health, which tracks into adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], increasing the risk of morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It imposes significant costs on the U.K. economy, with an expected sevenfold increase in related NHS costs by 2020 and a forecasted &#x000a3;2 billion annual spend by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Tackling obesity is a national public health priority in terms of both treatment and prevention. Establishing healthy behaviours in early childhood is critical for optimum growth and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Further, poor eating patterns developed early can persist and are associated with chronic diseases in adulthood (e.g., cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]). Once established, obesity is difficult to reverse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], strengthening the case for primary prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. To reverse trends in obesity, there is a clear need to engage parents in shaping healthy weight-related behaviours in their children.</p><p>Design, implementation and evaluation of interventions to prevent or treat obesity may be expensive and time-consuming, and researchers often report a lack of effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Within the literature on childhood obesity, low parent enrolment and attendance at group-delivered programmes, along with a lack of reported behaviour change, are commonly described to have had a substantial impact on group dynamics, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>There is a need for pragmatic, &#x02018;real-world&#x02019; evaluations of interventions to understand the generalisability of the interventions across everyday practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Further, in order for interventions to be accurately implemented and interpreted, the underpinning behaviour change techniques need to be clearly defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Implementation optimisation strategies can then be adopted to target a specific intervention component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It is imperative that parent engagement be improved across all parenting interventions delivered in community settings to optimise their impact and so that the degree to which they are effective can be assessed with confidence. In contrast to conventional pathways, in which implementation research is conducted following trials for clinical effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], it is argued that there is a need for comprehensive early-phase (evidentiary) evaluation and enhancement of complex interventions such as those designed to prevent childhood obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], prior to the conduct of large randomised controlled trials (RCTs). This novel approach ensures that factors which limit trial outcomes, such as low adherence, are minimised prior to dedicating the resources required to conduct a large trial which may identify no evidence of effectiveness, perhaps as a result of poor compliance.</p><p>The present trial involves the evaluation of an implementation enhancement &#x02018;optimisation intervention&#x02019; of an existing preschool obesity prevention group programme, HENRY (Health Exercise Nutrition for the Really Young), to promote parent enrolment and attendance prior to establishing its clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. HENRY is an 8-week group-delivered programme provided to parents of preschool children. It was developed in 2006 with joint funds from the Department of Health and the Department for Education (then called the <italic>Department of Children, Schools and Families</italic>) and is currently commissioned and delivered across the United Kingdom by 32 local authorities providing more than 150 programmes each year. It is delivered in community settings, often in children&#x02019;s centres by children&#x02019;s centre staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. HENRY uses a responsive approach to provide practical guidance and improve parenting skills aimed at enhancing family lifestyle and children&#x02019;s centre environments. Preliminary data indicate that HENRY may be effective at preventing childhood obesity and improving family health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], although there is not yet evidence from an RCT.</p><p>Despite some indications of success of HENRY from audit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and qualitative data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], process evaluation indicates implementation targets are often not met. Lack of involvement by some parents may be a threat to the viability of this programme and other, similar community-based interventions. The effectiveness of interventions in real-world conditions may not match the efficacy found in research studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This may be particularly relevant to population-based prevention programmes, in which parents may be less likely to be motivated to attend because their children show no clinical symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Thus, it is imperative to create tailored methods to maximise parent participation and enhance successful implementation in childhood obesity prevention programmes.</p><p>Failure to attend interventions is complicated by issues of health inequalities; socio-demographic attributes; and, in some cases, challenges related to safeguarding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Literature on non-attendance in other areas (clinical appointments) indicates that attendance is lower in certain populations and may be an indicator of vulnerability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This is pertinent to obesity because prevalence rates continue to rise in children in lower socio-economic or ethnic minority groups. In addition to the anticipated public health benefits, the economic benefits of implementation optimisation in programmes such as HENRY are substantial, with one parenting intervention calculating an extra &#x000a3;800 cost per child in programmes that run with 8 parents compared with those running at the intended capacity of 12 parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p>Unlike the development of other robust behaviour change interventions, initiatives to improve parental attendance at clinical appointments have been confined largely to simple approaches such as text reminders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. To promote behaviour change, enhance the transparency of interventions and guide their generalisability, it is recognised that a systematic approach is used during intervention development, which is underpinned by theories of behaviour change and guided by an intervention-planning framework such as the Behaviour Change Wheel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Lessons can be learnt from child mental health research, in which many interventions have been developed and tested using robust theory-based approaches which carefully consider parent engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Research in this field has explored perceived barriers to participation with suggested strategies to engage parents, including promotion of self-efficacy and treatment motivation. Such strategies perceive parents as the central agents of change and aim to modify the pre-treatment experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. RCTs evaluating parent engagement in mental health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and drug misuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] indicate that parental engagement can be increased with a dedicated optimisation component, although a further trial focused on cultural relevance for child behaviour problems to optimise engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] did not find any increase.</p><p>To our knowledge, there are no theory-based, multi-component optimisation interventions that have been developed to optimise parent engagement in obesity prevention programmes, and which have been evaluated using an RCT design. To meet this need, we developed a parent engagement optimisation intervention following Medical Research Council (MRC) guidance for development of complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research was used to understand contextual factors associated with the implementation of HENRY and their impact on parent engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The Behaviour Change Wheel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] provided guidance for the development of the intervention, which features use of the &#x02018;COM-B&#x02019; model (capability, opportunity and motivation) to dissect behaviours into their individual and interacting components and consider which of these should be targeted in an intervention to bring about the desired behaviour change. A rapid ethnography was conducted in five children&#x02019;s centres to understand the environmental, social, psycho-social, political and economic factors associated with parent engagement in HENRY. This study gathered data from approximately 190&#x000a0;h of observations, 22 interviews with children&#x02019;s centre managers and staff, HENRY commissioners, and HENRY coordinators and facilitators. Six focus groups were also conducted with parents who had attended the programme. We convened an intervention development team consisting of experts in intervention development, obesity, applied health and behaviour change, a local authority representative, a HENRY parent champion, a parent who has attended the programme, and a representative from the HENRY team. The intervention team used evidence from the ethnography, from the literature, and from their own experiences and expertise to develop a multi-component optimisation intervention which attempts to promote parent engagement and positive behaviour change in families by supporting local authorities, children&#x02019;s centres, HENRY staff, and parents using candidate implementation and delivery strategies (Career Development Fellowship CDF-2014-07-052). Here we report the protocol of our cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) (using routine process data) to evaluate the optimisation intervention for its ability to engage parents in HENRY prior to conducting a further evaluation of its clinical effectiveness.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>This study is a two-arm, multi-centre cRCT across 24 local authorities (local governments) (supporting approximately 144 children&#x02019;s centres) in the United Kingdom to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an optimisation intervention to promote parent engagement in the HENRY programme compared with standard HENRY practice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Although the children&#x02019;s centres deliver the HENRY programme, owing to the multi-component and interactive nature of the optimisation intervention, local authorities will be the units of randomisation (i.e., clusters) to prevent contamination between the randomised groups. Outcomes will be assessed through routinely collected data available for each HENRY programme at the parent and children&#x02019;s centre levels. Information on commissioners&#x02019; willingness to pay (within local authorities) related to the optimisation intervention will be elicited. A process evaluation will be conducted alongside the cRCT in accordance with the MRC guidance on evaluating process in complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Trial design flow diagram. <italic>HENRY</italic> Health Exercise Nutrition for the Really Young, <italic>ITT</italic> Intention to treat</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2016_1732_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

Those meeting the eligibility criteria will be contacted by invitation letter (postal and electronic) issued jointly by the HENRY central office and the University of Leeds. HENRY is currently commissioned across the whole of the United Kingdom, with most sites situated within England.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Recruitment/opt-out process. <italic>HENRY</italic> Health Exercise Nutrition for the Really Young, <italic>LA</italic> Local authorities</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2016_1732_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>
</p><p>Explicit consent will not be sought. Instead, opt-out consent will be sought at the cluster level (local authorities) and from the centres within each local authority. It will be possible for centres to decline participation in the randomisation, even if they are based within a consenting local authority. However, if a local authority declines to take part in the trial, none of its centres will be eligible to take part. Exclusion criteria related to further commissioning of HENRY (local authorities) and plans to run HENRY programmes (centres) will be self-reported by commissioners and centres, respectively. This opt-out method has been chosen because this is a low-risk trial in which anonymised data will be extracted remotely. It has been advocated to promote a simple and efficient trial design, and literature suggests that it is acceptable to participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. It also replicates, as far as possible, the &#x02018;real-life&#x02019; conditions under which such quality improvement initiatives are usually conducted in public health. The Leeds Institute of Clinical Trials Research (LICTR) has experience in using an opt-out approach and has found that it (1) is more likely than opt-in methods to provide a more representative or &#x02018;typical&#x02019; participating sites; (2) appears more effective and efficient in promoting research participation by sites; and (3) is acceptable, provided that sufficient sensitivity and safeguards are applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In this instance, individual-/family-level consent is not required, because all patient-level data will be unlinked and anonymous and is routinely collected by centres and submitted to the central HENRY office. Centres will not be asked to conduct any additional data collection from parents for the purposes of this trial. Our parent advisory panel (patient and public involvement group) and trial steering committee (TSC) have both approved this process.</p><p>Local authorities and children&#x02019;s centres will be given 30&#x000a0;days from the date on which the initial information letter is sent to decline participation (confirmed by recorded delivery).

Randomisation will be performed for all local authorities at a single time point after baseline data are transferred, prior to the implementation of the intervention. All possible enumerations of allocation to the trial arms will be generated, and an imbalance statistic will be calculated for each allocation. A set of optimal allocations which minimise the imbalance will be provided, and, in accordance with the principles of International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use guidance on randomness, the final allocation will be randomly selected from among this optimal set [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Results of the randomisation procedure will be sent by the LICTR statistician to the HENRY central office, which will be responsible for informing local authorities of their treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Blinding</title><p>Owing to the nature of the intervention, it will not be possible to blind allocation within intervention sites or of those involved in the optimisation intervention training. Families attending the HENRY programme have been made aware that HENRY uses data anonymously for research, but they have not been told explicitly about the Optimising Family Engagement in HENRY (OFTEN) trial or whether their local authority has been assigned to the optimisation. HENRY is coordinated by a central team that is responsible for coordinating training and for providing support and QA to areas that commission HENRY. Because the HENRY central office is integral to the delivery of the optimisation intervention, it will not be possible to blind the HENRY central office (as it will communicate the randomisation allocation to all those responsible for its implementation); however, staff who are responsible for collating data and transferring it to LICTR will remain blinded to allocation. The chief executive officer of HENRY will be blinded to treatment allocation and will not attend TSC meetings. In addition, for the duration of the trial, the HENRY QA team have agreed to reallocated areas that they are responsible for, so that only one person will have contact with areas allocated to the optimisation intervention. Other QA staff will be aware that they have standard QA responsibility (e.g., answering questions, providing encouragement, checking on progress) for areas not randomised to the optimisation, but will not know the details or content of the optimisation intervention. To further avoid contamination, the details of the optimisation intervention will not be published until after the final analysis. Unplanned masking (unblinding) will be monitored and reported to the TSC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Intervention</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>HENRY</title><p>HENRY is an 8-week programme delivered in children&#x02019;s centres with the aim of providing parents with skills, knowledge and confidence to support healthy lifestyles among their preschool children and their families, including parenting skills, emotional well-being and activity. The programme was set up in 2006 with the aim of reversing rising trends in school entry age obesity. HENRY is currently delivered within 32 local authorities across England and Wales by trained health and community practitioners who undergo two stages of training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Stage 1, centre-level training, is a 2-day workshop designed to equip centre staff with knowledge and skills to promote and provide healthy nutrition within early years settings and support parents to provide healthy family lifestyles and nutrition for their families. The theoretical underpinning combines proven models of behaviour change, including the Family Partnership Model, motivational interviewing and solution-focused support. Stage 2, practitioner-level training to deliver the HENRY programme to families, is provided to approximately four practitioners per centre after completing Stage 1 to deliver the 8-week HENRY programme. The aim of this stage is to build parents&#x02019; skills, knowledge and confidence to change old habits, provide healthier nutrition for their young children, and encourage healthier lifestyles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Programme content includes sessions on lifestyle and eating habits (e.g., family meals), balancing healthy meals and snacks, child-appropriate portion sizes, parenting, physical activity and emotional well-being.</p><p>Current HENRY QA practice involves the review of process data by dedicated individuals in the HENRY central office with provision of written and oral feedback. This QA will continue in both trial arms and will be monitored.

The optimisation intervention consists of interacting components delivered to local authorities, children&#x02019;s centres and HENRY facilitators. It includes additional support to stakeholders, modification of HENRY marketing to clarify perceptions of the programme, and methods to modify the pre-programme experience for parents. Strategies have been developed to increase parent motivation to enrol in HENRY and promote parent self-efficacy to continue to attend. Implementation of the optimisation intervention will begin immediately following randomisation. All components of the optimisation intervention will be implemented within 6&#x000a0;months following randomisation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>HENRY as standard</title><p>Local authorities randomised to the control arm will continue to deliver HENRY programmes as per standard practice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Outcomes</title><sec id="Sec16"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>The effectiveness of the optimisation intervention will be determined by comparing parent engagement in HENRY&#x02009;+&#x02009;optimisation intervention vs HENRY alone. The co-primary outcomes are (1) the proportion of centres enrolling at least eight parents per programme and (2) the proportion of centres with at least 75% of parents attending five of eight sessions per programme. Both will be evaluated 12&#x000a0;months post-randomisation.

<italic>Parenting self-efficacy</italic> (assessed via four parenting confidence items with 5-point Likert scales, modified from the validated Parenting Self-Agency Measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]). This measure assesses the parents&#x02019; estimate of their ability to influence their child and environment to lead to positive development, which is a key goal of the HENRY approach. In order for the questionnaire to be feasible to administer as part of the service, HENRY chose to reduce the number of items to a single scale of parenting confidence. Internal consistency of these items in a previous HENRY evaluation was high, and internal consistency in this sample was high (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.82 at baseline, 0.74 at completion) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic>Eating behaviours</italic> (based on the Golan Family Eating and Activity Habits Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]). This validated measure is sensitive to change and demonstrates high levels of reliability and validity. HENRY facilitators routinely administer six items related to family behaviours, included parent report of family sitting together for meals, watching television during mealtimes, consuming take-out meals, consumption of home-cooked foods, stopping eating when full and choosing healthy meals. Individual evaluation of these items will be undertaken because reliability for the scale was poor when previously tested using HENRY families (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.52 at baseline, 0.56 at completion).</p></list-item><list-item><p>

Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will describe the probability that the optimisation intervention is cost-effective for a range of maximum monetary values that a decision-maker might be willing to pay for a particular unit change in outcome. Cost-effectiveness analysis leaves it to decision-makers to form their own view of the relative importance of these results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]; therefore, in a second part of the work, we will conduct a meeting with commissioners to determine their willingness to pay per additional unit of effectiveness (parent engagement) before concluding whether the optimisation intervention can be considered cost-effective. We will use contingent valuation techniques and design an experiment to estimate the point at which commissioners consider that the costs of the programme are acceptably offset by the benefits of engaging effectively with parents.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Sample size</title><p>We assumed that 25% of the 32 local authorities currently running HENRY will not be eligible or will opt out of the study, leaving 24 local authorities (12 per arm). Power calculations for this fixed sample size (with all eligible centres in the United Kingdom invited to take part) were therefore conducted to examine anticipated power for various intervention effects, at the 5% significance level, in each of the primary outcomes and for the composite endpoint (enrol at least eight parents per programme and retain &#x02265;75% of parents attending five of eight sessions) (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for scenarios). On the basis of data from previous HENRY programmes (all terms in 2014), we assumed an average of 6 children&#x02019;s centres per local authority providing a total of 144 children&#x02019;s centres (72 per arm), an intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) between 0.05 and 0.1, a coefficient of variation in cluster size of 0.54, and the following estimates of the outcomes in the control sites (HENRY alone): 55% of centres will enrol at least eight parents per programme; 50% of centres will retain &#x02265;75% of parents attending five of eight sessions; and 25% of centres will enrol at least eight parents per programme and retain &#x02265;75% of parents attending five of eight sessions. Thus, with the anticipated number of centres (24 local authorities, 144 children&#x02019;s centres), we will have at least 80% power to detect meaningful improvements in differences of between 25% and 30% in either of the primary endpoints or the composite endpoint at the 5% significance level, assuming the ICC is no greater than 0.05.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Power calculations for enrolment and attrition endpoints for various estimates of the intervention effect and a fixed sample size of 144 children&#x02019;s centres in 24 local authorities</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Outcome in the control</th><th>Percentage point increase in intervention</th><th>Power for ICC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.1</th><th>Power for ICC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="4">Enrolment (&#x02265;8 parents per programme)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="6">&#x02003;55%</td><td>5%</td><td>6%</td><td>7%</td></tr><tr><td>10%</td><td>15%</td><td>18%</td></tr><tr><td>15%</td><td>29%</td><td>35%</td></tr><tr><td>20%</td><td>49%</td><td>58%</td></tr><tr><td>25%</td><td>70%</td><td>79%</td></tr><tr><td>30%</td><td>87%</td><td>93%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Attrition (&#x02265;75% of parents attending five of eight sessions)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="6">&#x02003;50%</td><td>5%</td><td>6%</td><td>7%</td></tr><tr><td>10%</td><td>15%</td><td>17%</td></tr><tr><td>15%</td><td>28%</td><td>34%</td></tr><tr><td>20%</td><td>47%</td><td>55%</td></tr><tr><td>25%</td><td>67%</td><td>76%</td></tr><tr><td>30%</td><td>84%</td><td>91%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Enrolment and attrition (at least eight parents per programme and 75% of parents attending five of eight sessions)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="6">&#x02003;25%</td><td>5%</td><td>7%</td><td>8%</td></tr><tr><td>10%</td><td>17%</td><td>19%</td></tr><tr><td>15%</td><td>31%</td><td>37%</td></tr><tr><td>20%</td><td>49%</td><td>58%</td></tr><tr><td>25%</td><td>67%</td><td>76%</td></tr><tr><td>30%</td><td>82%</td><td>89%</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>

This resounds with literature exploring the difficulties of recruiting parents to attend population-based programmes in the absence of health problems in their children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Early childhood provides an opportunity to intervene to establish healthy behaviours that are critical for optimum growth and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], but the failure to attract parents to programmes such as HENRY (particularly in populations theorised to have the greatest benefit) is a threat to the success and viability of such programmes. Our work has developed a theory-based intervention specifically targeting parent engagement with HENRY, with clear, transferable components for community-based interventions delivered to parents of young children. The early-phase evaluation of this optimisation intervention is described here, including methods to estimate the willingness of commissioners to pay for any additional costs borne by additional engagement activities. Ultimately, the true value of the optimised intervention will be ascertained following these discussions with the commissioners.</p><p>Implementation research is usually focused on the implementation of interventions of known effectiveness into routine practice and policy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, we intend to evaluate an approach to optimising the implementation of HENRY prior to a further evaluation of its clinical effectiveness. This approach is relatively novel and follows literature suggesting that complex intervention components should ideally be optimised and tested in evidentiary research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Such an approach ensures that the future clinical effectiveness data relate to the impact that interventions can have once components have been enhanced. Similarly to other interventions (particularly prevention programmes), we recognised a need to increase parent engagement to enrol and attend HENRY programmes in order to improve the chances of a more successful, cost-effective definitive trial of clinical effectiveness. However, other components within complex interventions, such as content or delivery aspects, could warrant optimisation prior to effectiveness testing. A future pilot RCT is planned to test the feasibility of conducting a definitive trial of the effectiveness of HENRY to prevent childhood obesity (also within the National Institute for Health Research [NIHR] under Career Development Fellowship CDF-2014-07-052). This will occur regardless of the outcome of the present optimisation trial because there remains a need to establish an evidence base of an intervention that is already widely commissioned.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment and randomisation of local authorities is complete. Implementation is on-going and family enrolment (providing data on enrolment and attendance to the HENRY programme) was started in September 2016 and will continue until April 2017.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>COM-B model</term><def><p>Capability, opportunity and motivation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>cRCT</term><def><p>Cluster randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HENRY</term><def><p>Health Exercise Nutrition for the Really Young</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICC</term><def><p>Intra-cluster correlation coefficient</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p>Intention to treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LA</term><def><p>Local authorities</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LICTR</term><def><p>Leeds Institute of Clinical Trials Research</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRC</term><def><p>Medical Research Council</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIHR</term><def><p>National Institute for Health Research</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OFTEN</term><def><p>Optimising Family Engagement in HENRY</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QA</term><def><p>Quality assurance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TSC</term><def><p>Trial steering committee</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge our parent advisory team for their support in developing the intervention and ongoing advice in study design and recruitment (Amal Najlat, Chloe Anderson, Kelly Milner, Claire Donkin, Sarah Young, Terri Francis and Rachael Baptista).
