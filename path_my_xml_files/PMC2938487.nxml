In the United States, approximately 1.8 million patients present with acute asthma in the ED every year, of which nearly 500,000 patients are hospitalized.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref>] According to the National Family Health Survey-2 (NFHS-2) report, the estimated prevalence of asthma in India is 2,468 per 100,000 persons.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref>] Evidence from previous studies suggests that systemic corticosteroid therapy in addition to standard therapy should be administered promptly to patients with features of severe asthma.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref>]</p><p>Most studies conducted on patients with acute exacerbation of bronchial asthma used intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone (MP) initially, followed by oral glucocorticoids (usually MP) for the next 1&#x02013;8 weeks. The practice patterns in India strongly favor the use of hydrocortisone (HC) followed by oral prednisolone, as this regimen costs lower than the IV MP/oral MP regimen. However, as MP is known to have beneficial pharmacological properties, such as lesser mineralocorticoid potency,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref>] greater inhibition of inflammatory cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref>] and better penetration into lung tissue,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref>] in comparison to HC and prednisolone, it is highly desirable to study these two regimens in patients with acute asthma. Published literature addressing this scientific question is very limited and conflicting. Although the role of IV corticosteroids in acute asthma is well established, we aim to compare corticosteroids that are most often used in acute asthma in different countries. Therefore, the present study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of IV MP followed by oral MP with IV HC followed by oral prednisolone in the management of patients with acute exacerbation of asthma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The study was conducted over a period of 6 months (from Jun. 2008 to Nov. 2008) in the ED of a tertiary care hospital in North India. The annual patient attendance in the ED is more than 120,000. Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee. The patients&#x02019; written informed consent was taken before enrolling them in the study. The consent form was made available in both Hindi and English.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>The study was a randomized pilot study comparing two regimens of glucocorticoids. The patients were blinded to the initial treatment received in the ED, i.e. IV MP or IV HC. However, they were not blinded to the treatment given at the time of discharge, i.e. oral MP or oral prednisolone. One hundred patients were recruited in this pilot study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>Patients between 13 and 60 years of age who, during the study period, presented to the ED with moderate [peak expiratory flow (PEF) 50&#x02013;70% of the predicted value or an asthma score of 8&#x02013;11] or severe (PEF &#x0003c;50% of the predicted value or an asthma score of 12&#x02013;15) exacerbation of bronchial asthma were included in the study. Patients below the age of 13 years were managed in the pediatric emergency unit while in patients who were above the age of 60 years, distinguishing between chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and bronchial asthma might have been difficult at times.</p><p>Patients were considered to be asthmatic if they had been previously diagnosed to have bronchial asthma or if the medical history and examination findings were suggestive of bronchial asthma, as defined by the British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines and the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report 3 guidelines.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref>] Patients with any of the following conditions were excluded: first episode of wheeze, temperature &#x0003e;38&#x000b0;C, patients with comorbid conditions such as pneumonia, congestive heart failure or interstitial lung disease, use of systemic glucocorticoids within the last 30 days, failure to get consent from patients for participation in the study, requirement of assisted ventilation within one hour of arrival to the ED, failure to use a PEF meter, mild exacerbation (PEF &#x0003e;70% of the predicted value or an asthma score of 5&#x02013;7) and pregnancy.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Initial assessment</title><p>Patients were assessed within the first 5 min of their arrival to the ED to confirm whether they fulfilled the criteria for inclusion and exclusion. Informed consent was obtained from either the patient or the patient&#x02019;s relatives. Baseline parameters such as pulse rate (PR), blood pressure (BP), respiratory rate (RR), presence or absence of cyanosis, oxygen saturation, arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, PEF and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) were obtained. PEF and FEV<sub>1</sub> were recorded using an electronic PEF/FEV<sub>1</sub> meter (Piko<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>-I; Ferraris Respiratory Europe Ltd., Hertford, UK). Two recordings were taken at each time point (e.g., at baseline, 1 h, 3 h and 6 h, at every 6 h until discharge or admission and then at 2 weeks of follow-up), of which the higher value at each time point was recorded. The ABG analysis was performed using a blood gas analyzer NOVA CCX 1+ (Nova Biomedical Corporation, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA).</p><p>Assessment of the &#x0201c;severity of exacerbation&#x0201d; was based on the measurement of PEF and asthma score.

A prompt corticosteroid therapy is therefore desirable at this stage,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref>] although its action may be delayed by at least 4 h.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT14">14</xref>] International guidelines such as the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT14">14</xref>] and the BTS guidelines[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>] recommend early use of systemic corticosteroids in acute asthma as it has been shown to reduce the hospital admission rate, length of hospitalization and relapse rate after discharge. A short course of oral corticosteroids is recommended in acute bronchial asthma patients after discharge from the ED as it reduces the relapse rate and the need for using reliever inhalers with no major adverse effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT15">15</xref>]</p><p>There are inconsistencies in the various reported studies regarding the role of different corticosteroids in bronchial asthma as the efficacies of corticosteroids may vary due to their dissimilar antiinflammatory potencies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT16">16</xref>] While MP may have a greater antiinflammatory potency, longer duration of action and lesser sodium-retaining properties as compared to prednisolone and hydrocortisone,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref>] there are very few studies in the published literature comparing different corticosteroid regimens in acute exacerbation of asthma.</p><p>Gordon <italic>et al</italic>. (1984) evaluated the effects of two doses of MP of 125 mg or 60 mg against HC of 100 mg on serum immunoglobulin E levels (IgE). IgE levels decreased significantly in patients treated with the higher dose of MP (125 mg), while there was not much of a decrease in the IgE levels in patients treated with either HC or with a lower dose of MP (60 mg).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT17">17</xref>] In another study, 14 patients with acute bronchial asthma were treated with HC (100 mg IV q 6-hourly), MP (20 mg IV q 6-hourly) or dexamethasone (3.75 mg IV q 6-hourly). No difference was found in the efficacies of any of these three drugs up to 72 h.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT18">18</xref>] In a study by Hall <italic>et al</italic>. (1996), HC was found to be more effective than MP in reducing stay in the asthma unit in patients with acute severe asthma.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref>] However, HC was administered at the dose of 200 mg IV 4-hourly, while MP was given at the dose of 125 mg IV 12-hourly. None of these studies have compared the effects of sequential regimen of intravenous steroids in ED followed by a short course of oral steroids, which is the recommended practice.</p><p>The present study aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of two treatment regimens &#x02013; IV HC followed by oral prednisolone and IV MP followed by oral MP in acute asthma patients. The study showed that there was a significant improvement in the lung functions within few hours of administration of IV corticosteroids in the ED. However, there was no significant difference in the improvement observed during the first 6 h between the two groups. At 2 weeks of follow-up, the improvement in lung function with oral MP was significantly greater than with oral prednisolone. This difference at the end of 2 weeks could be explained by multiple properties of MP. Methylprednisolone is known to have a greater antiinflammatory potency, with lesser mineralocorticoid action as compared to prednisolone.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref>] Specifically, it has been shown to have much greater effects on specific cells involved in inflammation (e.g., peripheral blood mononuclear cells) as compared to prednisolone.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref>] Similarly, some animal studies have shown that MP attains much higher concentrations in lung tissue as compared to prednisolone over a period of time after a single dose. This may lead to increase in the availability of the drug at its site of action.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref>] Patients in Group B had a slightly shorter duration of stay in the ED as compared to those in Group A, although the difference was not significant.</p><p>In the present study, blood glucose values increased in both the groups at 2 weeks of follow-up; however, this increase was more significant in Group A as compared to Group B (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001 vs. <italic>P</italic> = 0.031). This increase could be attributed to administration of oral prednisolone for 2 weeks in Group A. This finding supports the findings from various other studies that have shown the hyperglycemic effects of prednisolone.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT19">19</xref>] Adverse events data showed that IV MP/oral MP may be comparatively safer than IV HC/oral prednisolone, although this can be confirmed only with the inclusion of a larger sample size in further studies. In Group A, three patients reached the primary endpoint, of which two patients had relapsed within 2 weeks, and one died.</p><p>There are some limitations to the present study. The sample size of the study was small; however, as mentioned, it was a pilot study. The second limitation is that this study was not double-blinded and there could have been some bias by the physicians involved in conducting the study. The study was performed in the emergency unit with an average staff of 10 physicians per emergency shift with rotation of shifts on a daily basis. Except for the steroid use, other treatments were decided by the emergency physicians who were not part of the study. They were also responsible for deciding about admission or discharge of patients and, therefore, individual physician&#x02019;s bias is unlikely to have affected the study results. The third limitation is the doses of MP and HC/prednisolone used in the study. Bowler <italic>et al</italic>. (1992) showed, in their study, that a lower dose of IV HC (50 mg) four times a day for 2 days followed by a low-dose oral prednisone is as effective in resolving acute severe asthma as are 200 mg or 500 mg doses of HC, followed by higher doses of prednisone.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT20">20</xref>] The BTS guidelines[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>] also recommend a lower dose of HC (100 mg IV 6-hourly) followed by 40&#x02013;50 mg of prednisolone for 5 days or until recovery of acute asthma. The HC and prednisolone doses used in the study were based on the recommended doses by Taylor (2003).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT21">21</xref>] Methylprednisolone was used in doses equivalent to HC doses. Based on the BTS guidelines, lower doses for HC/MP and shorter duration of oral MP/prednisolone could have been considered in this study as, apart from the problem of high cost, high doses of corticosteroids may cause more steroid-related side-effects than low doses. Another limitation of the study was the exclusion of patients below 13 years of age, although pediatric patients constitute a major group who present with acute exacerbation of asthma. Therefore, the sample population considered for the study might not be an appropriate sample to effectively represent the true population of acute asthma patients.</p><p>To conclude, the present study has shown a higher efficacy and safety of IV MP followed by oral MP as compared to IV HC followed by oral prednisolone in acute asthma patients. Based on the results of this pilot study, IV MP followed by oral MP, despite its higher cost, may form the treatment of choice among the two regimens for acute bronchial asthma. Nevertheless, the plasma and biological half-life of MP is two&#x02013;three times more than HC,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT22">22</xref>] so less-frequent dosing schedule could be considered for MP to conceivably reduce the total cost of treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The project was funded by Pfizer Pharmaceutical Limited, India.
