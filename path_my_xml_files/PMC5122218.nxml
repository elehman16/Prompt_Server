It was previously shown that PLA2 group 2A (PLA2G2A) messenger RNA (mRNA) expression is associated with less frequent metastasis and longer survival in gastric adenocarcinoma. This study intends to investigate the effect of PUFAs on the expression of PLA2G2A in patients with gastric cancer.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Thirty-four patients with gastric cancer (GC) were randomly divided into two groups. The first group received cisplatin medication. The second group received cisplatin medication and supplements of &#x003c9;-fatty acids for three courses. The total RNA was extracted from the tissues and cDNA was synthesized. The gene expression of PLA2G2A was evaluated by the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. To confirm the changes in gene expression, frozen section was utilized. The frozen tissue samples were sectioned and stained using the immunohistochemistry technique.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>After chemotherapy and chemotherapy plus supplement, the relative mean of PLA2G2A gene expression increased 1.5 &#x000b1; 0.5-fold and 7.4 &#x000b1; 2.6-fold, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = 0.006). The relative mean of gene expression in patients who received cisplatin and &#x003c9;-fatty acids supplement increased more significantly (7.5 &#x000b1; 3.3-fold) than in patients who received only cisplatin (<italic>P</italic> = 0.016).</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>It was found that PUFAs increased the gene and protein expression of PLA2G2A in gastric cancer. Concerning the fact that studies reveal protective function of PLA2G2A in gastric cancer, it is suggested that increased expression of PLA2G2A is helpful. Furthermore, PUFAs can be considered as a useful therapeutic supplement for patients with gastric cancer.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Gastric cancer (GC)</kwd><kwd>&#x003c9;-fatty acids</kwd><kwd>phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (PLA2)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Gastric cancer (GC) is considered to be the fourth frequent human malignancy and the second cause of deaths from cancer throughout the world.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] More than 0.93 million new cases are diagnosed yearly.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The pathogenesis of GC is not exactly known.

The effect of PUFAs on the PLA2G2A expression in various diseases has been poorly studied. PUFAs increased the production of PLA2G2A in ectopic endometrial cells sampled from endometriosis patients.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>There are few clinical experiments about the PLA2G2A expression in GC.

The findings of this study are consistent with Khanaki <italic>et al</italic>., which showed that PUFAs exposure results in an increase in the PLA2G2A level within the ectopic endometrial cell. PUFAs and especially high &#x003c9;-3:&#x003c9;-6 notably enhanced the production of PLA2G2A level in ectopic endometrial cells sampled from their endometriosis patients.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Hughes-Fulford <italic>et al</italic>. showed that exogenous arachidonic acid increased the mRNA and protein expression of cPLA2 in a human prostate cancer cell line in a dose-dependent manner.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In the HCT116, CaCo2, and SNU-C5 colon cancer cells and SK-BR3 and MCF7 breast cancer cells, treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) markedly increased phospholipase D1 (PLD1) mRNA and protein expression.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Previous studies reported that interleukin-1 beta (IL-1&#x003b2;) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) induce PLA2G2A expression and secretion over a long period in different animal cell systems.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] IL-6 has been reported to stimulate gene expression and synthesis of PLA2G2A in HepG2 liver hepatoma cells.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Exposure to proinflammatory cytokines can stimulate PLA2G2A transcription and secretion of intracellular storage or <italic>de novo</italic> synthesized PLA2G2A in a temporary or sustained form.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>Studies have suggested that PLA2G2A expression may have a protective effect versus the progression of carcinomas.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Chen <italic>et al</italic>. found a reciprocal relationship between PLA2G2A expression and vascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Expression of PLA2G2A has also been shown to be significantly associated with longer survival after surgery in pancreatic cancer.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] These results each support the hypothesis that PLA2G2A plays a direct role in suppressing GC progression. Leung <italic>et al</italic>. indicated that PLA2G2A mRNA expression was associated with less frequent metastasis and longer survival in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The results of a large cohort study strongly suggested that the expression of PLA2G2A is protective for patients with GC.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] PLA2G2A catalyzes the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids. Arachidonic acid can induce apoptosis in diverse cells including human colon cancer cells. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that inhibit the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins by cyclooxygenases apparently confer significantly lower risk of both colorectal cancers and GCs.

</p><p>Hughes <italic>et al</italic>. provided evidence that arachidonic acid regulates gene expression and protein synthesis.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Studies show that rat PLA2G2A promoter contains peroxisome proliferator responsive elements (PPREs),[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] suggesting that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) activation in rat mesangial cells may be involved in the induction of PLA2G2A by exogenously added sPLA2s, and also by rat PLA2G2A endogenously produced after cytokine treatment. Considering this and because PPARs may be activated by PLA2 lipid products, Beck <italic>et al</italic>. postulated that PPARs might be involved in the upregulation of PLA2G2A expression by sPLA2s. Also they showed that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or linoleic acid (LA) as potential PPAR&#x003b1; agonists have strong stimulatory effects on the rat's PLA2G2A promoter activity in mesangial cells. On testing specific PPAR&#x003b1; activators for PLA2G2A induction, they found that PPAR&#x003b1; activators such as unsaturated long chain fatty acids had a potentiating effect.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>According to these findings and theories, it has been proposed that PUFAs as potential activators of PPAR&#x003b1; may have strong stimulatory effects on the human PLA2G2A promoter activity. This suggestion should be examined closely in future studies. In addition, PUFAs may induce production of certain cytokines, resulting in increased PLA2G2A expression. There is a possibility that some special PUFAs such as arachidonic acid have an important role in PLA2G2A gene expression and protein synthesis regulation.</p><p>The exact mechanism of PUFAs on gene expression of PLA2G2A and the function of this enzyme in the pathogenesis and treatment of GC should be explored in future studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>It was found that PUFAs increased the gene and protein expressions of PLA2G2A in GC. Regarding the fact that studies show a protective role of PLA2G2A in GC, it is suggested that increased expression of PLA2G2A helps to control GC. Furthermore, PUFAs can be considered as a useful therapeutic supplement for patients with GC.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHOR'S CONTRIBUTION</title><p>M Sh took part in the experiments and prepared the manuscript.
