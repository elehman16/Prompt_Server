After switching to fingolimod (M0&#x02013;12 vs M13&#x02013;EOS), patients initially treated with IFN had a 50% reduction in ARR (0.40 vs 0.20), reduced MRI activity and a lower rate of brain volume loss. In a post hoc analysis, the proportion of IFN-switch patients with no evidence of disease activity increased by approximately 50% in the first year after switching to fingolimod treatment (44.3% to 66.0%).

Patients randomised to fingolimod in the core phase continued with the original dose (continuous-fingolimod 0.5&#x02005;mg (n=356) or 1.25&#x02005;mg (330) groups). Patients receiving IFN&#x003b2;-1a in the core phase were re-randomised (1:1) to receive fingolimod 0.5&#x02005;mg or 1.25&#x02005;mg in a blinded manner (IFN&#x003b2;-1a/fingolimod 0.5&#x02005;mg (n=167) or IFN&#x003b2;-1a/fingolimod 1.25&#x02005;mg (174)). The eligibility criteria have been described previously.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> All patients provided written informed consent prior to study entry. The protocol was approved by the respective institutional review board, independent ethics committee or research ethics board of each centre.

<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In the extension phase, patients were evaluated monthly until the M24 visit and every 3&#x02005;months thereafter. We present the outcomes for those patients who received continuous therapy with fingolimod 0.5&#x02005;mg, during both the core (M0&#x02013;12) and extension (M13&#x02013;EOS) phases. Owing to the low patient numbers in the IFN to fingolimod switch groups (IFN-switch 0.5 and 1.25&#x02005;mg), we present pooled data for both the fingolimod doses (IFN-switch group) for efficacy outcomes. To avoid bias in data interpretation, adverse events (AEs) are presented for the continuous-fingolimod 0.5&#x02005;mg and IFN-switch 0.5&#x02005;mg groups. Safety outcomes of patients in the continuous-fingolimod 1.25&#x02005;mg and IFN-switch 1.25&#x02005;mg groups are presented in the online supplementary material.</p><p>The annualised relapse rate (ARR) was calculated based on the number of confirmed relapses (new, worsening or recurrent neurological symptoms lasting for at least 24&#x02005;h in the absence of fever (&#x0003c;37.5&#x000b0;C) or infection) and total number of days in the study. Disability progression was evaluated using changes in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) scores. Disability progression was defined as either a 1-point increase in the EDSS score for patients with an EDSS score of 0 to 5.0 or a half-point increase for patients with a baseline score of &#x02265;5.5, which was confirmed at 3 and 6&#x02005;months. MRI measures of efficacy included the number of new/newly enlarged T2 lesions, gadolinium-enhanced (Gd+) T1 lesion count and per cent brain volume change (PBVC) measured by the Structural Image Evaluation, using Normalisation, of Atrophy (SIENA) methodology. All patients underwent MRI at screening, and then annually with central reading at the Image Analysis Centre (Amsterdam, The Netherlands).</p><p>Safety assessments included recording of all AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) with monitoring of haematology, blood chemistry and urine values; physical examinations and vital signs; ECG; monitoring following first dose administration of fingolimod; ophthalmological assessments; pulmonary function tests; and dermatological examinations.</p><p>Post hoc efficacy analysis included assessment of ARR up to M48 for completers versus non-completers of the study. For non-completers, ARR was calculated up to the point of discontinuation and is reported by interval. The interval for non-completers, M0&#x02013;24, summarises the aggregate ARR from M0 to M24 for patients who discontinued during the interval of M12&#x02013;24. Similarly, the intervals of M0&#x02013;36 and M0&#x02013;48 summarise the aggregate ARR for patients who discontinued during the intervals of M24&#x02013;36 and M36&#x02013;48, respectively.</p><p>To assess the impact of fingolimod treatment on disease activity over time, an exploratory analysis, using a model similar to that developed by Rio <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> was performed. The presence (positive) or absence (negative) of measures of disease activity such as confirmed relapses, sum of active MRI lesions (defined as the sum of new/newly enlarged T2 lesions and Gd+ T1 lesions at M12 that was &#x0003e;2 compared with baseline) or 3-month confirmed disability progression, during the TRANSFORMS core phase, was related to clinical outcomes over the duration of the extension phase (M13&#x02013;EOS). All patients were classified into four groups based on the number of positive measures for disease activity during year 1 (no positive, 1, 2 or 3 positives). Furthermore, the proportions of patients with no evidence of disease activity (NEDA, defined as no relapses, no 3-month disability progression and no MRI activity) were calculated for years 1 and 2 to evaluate the impact of fingolimod treatment 1&#x02005;year after the switch from IFN&#x003b2;-1a.</p><p>Odds ratios (ORs), computed by logistic regression, were generated to evaluate the association between disease status after 1&#x02005;year of treatment and clinical NEDA outcomes (defined as no relapses and no 6-month disability progression) during the extension phase (M13&#x02013;EOS). Firth's penalised likelihood method was used to improve the reliability of the estimates because of the small number of patients in some subgroups. Detailed definitions are presented in the online supplementary data. Data for both the fingolimod dose groups (0.5 and 1.25&#x02005;mg) were pooled for this analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The baseline of the extension phase was defined as the last assessment made before the administration of the first dose of study medication in the extension phase. Methods for the analysis of relapse, disability progression and MRI variables (new/newly enlarging T2 lesions, Gd+ T1 lesions, mean PBVC) have been presented elsewhere.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Between-group analyses were performed on the core intention-to-treat population for the continuous-fingolimod 0.5&#x02005;mg versus IFN-switch groups; all p values were based on the two-sided tests and statistical significance was set at the 0.05 level with no adjustment for multiplicity. Descriptive statistics were used to present baseline demographic data.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>The extension phase baseline patient demographics and disease characteristics are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="JNNP2015310597TB1">table 1</xref>. Of the 1027 patients who received treatment in the TRANSFORMS extension, 772 (75.2%) completed the extension phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JNNP2015310597F1">figure 1</xref>). The mean (median) time-on-study for the treatment groups was: continuous-fingolimod 0.5&#x02005;mg&#x02014;1083 (1282) days; continuous-fingolimod 1.25&#x02005;mg&#x02014;1015 (1273) days; IFN-switch&#x02014;1012 (1271) days. At the time of study closure, the number (%) of patients completing 24, 36 and at least 48&#x02005;months were 882 (86%), 841 (82%) and 103 (10%), respectively. Such a small number of completers at the M48 time point is attributed to the transfer of patients to the umbrella extension phase or commercial availability of fingolimod past M36 of the study. The most common reasons for study discontinuation (pooled study population) were withdrawal of consent (8.2%) and AEs (6.7%).</p><table-wrap id="JNNP2015310597TB1" orientation="portrait"

The most common SAEs in both groups were basal cell carcinoma and MS relapse. Severe infection AEs were reported in 14 patients (3.9%) in the continuous-fingolimod group and six patients (3.6%) in the IFN-switch group. Herpes viral infections were reported in 36 (10.1%) patients in the continuous-fingolimod group and 25 (15%) patients in the IFN-switch group. In the IFN-switch group, one case of disseminated herpes zoster was reported on extension day 194. The patient recovered completely within 9&#x02005;days following drug discontinuation and treatment with acyclovir. No confirmed cases of macular oedema were reported.

Two patients formally met Hy's law criteria<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> for hepatotoxicity and discontinued the study, one in the continuous-fingolimod 0.5&#x02005;mg group who had a history of Gilbert syndrome and had elevated bilirubin before receiving the study medication, and the other in the IFN-switch fingolimod 1.25&#x02005;mg group who developed jaundice and splenomegaly while in the study and was subsequently diagnosed with hepatitis E infection.</p><p>Basal cell carcinoma and lymphopenia (lymphocyte count below 0.2&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>/L or 200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>; 9 patients each) were the other most common AEs leading to study discontinuation <bold>in the overall population</bold>. One patient in the IFN-switch fingolimod 0.5&#x02005;mg group committed suicide, accounting for the one death reported in the extension phase. Apart from the seven cases of basal cell carcinoma, one case each of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, thyroid cancer, anal neoplasm, ovarian epithelial cancer and non-melanoma skin cancer and two cases of breast cancer were reported in the continuous-fingolimod group. No malignancy was reported in the IFN-switch group other than the one case of basal cell carcinoma.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>These results from the extension phase of the TRANSFORMS study support a sustained effect of fingolimod on disease activity in patients with RRMS who received up to 4.5&#x02005;years of therapy and are consistent with the findings of the core study and the first year of the extension study.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> A comparison between the originally randomised groups shows that over the entire study, a treatment difference in favour of the continuous-fingolimod group for ARR was observed over the IFN-switch group, indicating that the earlier start of fingolimod treatment had an overall stronger impact on the control of clinical disease activity. Both disability progression and MRI outcomes reflecting cumulative changes at the end of the extension phase were not significantly different between the groups, which is not surprising given that both groups received fingolimod for a considerable length of time as compared to the 1&#x02005;year core study. ARR and MRI outcomes were clearly improved in the IFN group after switching to fingolimod, but due to the lack of an external control group we cannot exclude some influence of regression to the mean, as disease activity has a natural tendency to decrease over time, especially in patients with more active disease prior to baseline.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The low rate of BVL during the extension study in the continuous-fingolimod group is in line with observations from the extension of the placebo-controlled FREEDOMS study<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and further supports a continuous effect of fingolimod on this outcome. The pronounced reduction, by approximately 50%, of BVL observed in the IFN-switch patients in the first year after the switch to fingolimod adds to the discussion about IFN&#x003b2;-induced &#x02018;pseudoatrophy&#x02019; but does not allow for definitive conclusions.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Given the long duration of the study, it was important to evaluate if the treatment effect among the dropouts was lower, potentially introducing a responder bias. Indeed, patients who discontinued the study tended to have a higher disease activity while on study and compared with completers. However, within the subgroup of non-completers, patients who were initially randomised to fingolimod had a lower ARR than those who had been randomised to IFN&#x003b2;-1a in the core study, confirming the benefits of earlier fingolimod treatment regarding relapse control.</p><p>Absence of evidence of disease activity defined by MRI and clinical measures (NEDA) is increasingly used to capture treatment benefits.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In the 12-month TRANSFORMS core study, the proportion of patients with NEDA, defined as no evidence of new MRI lesions, relapses and 3-month confirmed disability progression, was significantly higher in the fingolimod 0.5&#x02005;mg group than in the IFN&#x003b2;-1a group (46% vs 34%, p&#x0003c;0.001).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Persisting disease activity as depicted by such clinical and MRI outcomes in the first year of treatment has been shown to be predictive of later disease activity and worsening, especially with IFN&#x003b2; treatment.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;12</xref> Irrespective of the initial treatment allocation, in our study, patients with disease activity during the first year of therapy were more likely to have relapses and disability progression over the extension phase, and this risk increased with the number of measures indicating disease activity during year 1. Overall, our findings support the value of the NEDA criteria in the first year of treatment for the prognosis of longer term outcomes. It remains to be shown in long-term follow-up studies<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> if the achievement of NEDA in the first year after switching treatment from IFN&#x003b2; to fingolimod, as observed in our study, has the same positive prognostic value.</p><p>The safety profile of continuous fingolimod treatment for up to 4.5&#x02005;years was consistent with the previous reports.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;17</xref> Transient effects on heart rate at treatment initiation and effects on liver function were noted, while the absence of confirmed cases of macular oedema may be due to the small number of newly exposed patients in the extension phase (n=167). The incidence of herpes viral infections was similar across the treatment groups. We noted an imbalance in the incidence of cancer between the groups. However, in a pooled analysis comprising 3553 patients treated with fingolimod in the core and extension studies, the incidence of basal cell carcinoma with fingolimod 0.5&#x02005;mg was 1.8%, and the total incidence was 1.5% (Novartis, data on file); our results show comparable frequencies of basal cell carcinoma (2% for the continuous-fingolimod 0.5&#x02005;mg group) and a low incidence of other cancer types (&#x0003c;0.6%). These results also indicate that the safety monitoring described in the fingolimod prescribing information should be adhered to in clinical practice throughout the duration of fingolimod treatment.</p><p>Limitations for this extension study include the absence of a control arm and a potential selection bias typically seen in long-term studies, in which patients who are not doing well are more likely to drop out. Data beyond 36&#x02005;months are sparse and could possibly limit meaningful conclusions to be drawn beyond this time point. The lower number of patients at the 48-month assessment is mainly driven by the transitioning of these patients into the fingolimod long-term safety and efficacy study (LONGTERMS). Despite these inherent limitations, our findings together with those from the TRANSFORMS core study<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and its 1-year extension<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> further support sustained benefits of fingolimod on relapses and MRI inflammatory activity in continuously treated and IFN-switch patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="jnnp-2015-310597-s1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d36e1359" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the patients and investigators who took part in this study.
