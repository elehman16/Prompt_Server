include malfunction of the lumbar muscles, including the internal oblique, transversus
abdominis, and multifidus<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lower limb and
waist pain are increased on walking and standing in patients with low back pain<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Low back pain is caused by lumbar
instability, with weakened muscles, soft tissue damage, and degenerative changes. Lumbar
stability enables conscious or unconscious control of major and minor joint movements<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. To
perform fluid movements, harmonious co-contraction is required between the deep muscles
(which correctly maintain lumbar alignment and provide stability) and the superficial
muscles (which manage external loads or enable psychokinesis)<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stabilizing exercise
induces co-contraction of trunk muscles and improves posture stability by restoring the
ability to control functional posture and movement<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such exercise is essential for lumbar pain patients, because it is
not subject to limitations of place, time, or cost<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although stabilizing exercise has its benefits, a limitation is the
need for the assistance of a therapist to accurately perform movements; similar to isometric
exercise, it is difficult to motivate participation to prevent recurrence of disease, and to
correctly determine the amount and intensity of exercise<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Flexi-Bar is a
152-cm-long flexible bar that transmits 5-Hz vibration stimulation to the entire body and
stimulates muscular activity of the limbs and trunk while the user actively shakes the
flexible bar<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Flexi-Bar is safe at
low-amplitude vibration stimulation, and can easily be used without special techniques<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The speed and amplitude of vibration caused
by the Flexi-Bar can be controlled by active vibration stimulation release by the user<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. A
strong point is that it can be performed in various positions safely and easily<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Monfort-Pa&#x000f1;ego et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the Flexi-Bar can improve lumbar stability if
used in the correct position, posture, and amplitude. This study aimed to determine the
effect of a Flexi-Bar exercise program with vibration stimulation on pain and dysfunction in
patients with low back pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This research was aimed at chronic lumbar pain patients with more than 3 months of
symptoms. Thirty subjects who understood the nature of the research volunteered to
participate in the experiment; 15 subjects (7 men, 8 women) were randomly assigned to the
control group, and 15 (7 men, 8 women) to the experimental group. Inclusion criteria were
lumbar pain lasting more than 3 months, no history of spine surgery, and the ability to
exercise. A history of spine surgery, neurologic symptoms or injury, or inflammatory joint
disease were reasons for exclusion. This study complied with the ethical standards of the
Declaration of Helsinki, and written informed consent was received from each participant.
The ethics committee of Nambu University approved this study. The general characteristics of
the participants are presented in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

The mean age, height, and weight were 60.0 &#x000b1; 11.0 yrs, 168.6 &#x000b1; 8.0&#x02005;cm, and
67.0 &#x000b1; 4.9&#x02005;kg in the experimental group and 63.6 &#x000b1; 7.6 yrs, 165.4 &#x000b1; 7.7&#x02005;cm, and 68.4 &#x000b1;
8.0&#x02005;kg in the control group, respectively. All subjects received lumbar thermotherapy for 30
minutes, electrotherapy for 20 minutes, and ultrasonic therapy for 5 minutes. Both the
experimental and control groups stopped drug therapy throughout the course of this research.
Additionally, Flexi-Bar exercise with vibration stimulation was provided to the experimental
group 5 times a week for 6 weeks. The Flexi-Bar is 153&#x02005;cm long, weighs 710&#x02005;g, and is 9.5&#x02005;mm
thick. Exercise can be controlled by changing its weight or thickness. The Flexi-Bar
vibrates 270 times per minute, and can be used to exercise the shoulder joint and entire
body. Vibration at approximately 5&#x02005;Hz causes simultaneous contraction of the shoulder and
trunk muscles, improves muscular strength and stability in the shoulders and trunk, and
enhances proprioceptive sensation. We made the participant hold a Flexi-Bar horizontally
with them standing up to start vibration exercise laterally for 10 seconds; then, he was
made to held it vertically to do for the same time. Also, we set 10 times as one set and
applied 10 sets. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used to measure pain severity. A linear
scale marked 0&#x02013;10 shows the extent of pain. No pain is defined as 0; maximum pain is 10. VAS
is also a highly reliable evaluation method that had study subjects directly mark the degree
of pain. The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) was used to measure the extent of dysfunction
due to lumbar pain. The extent of pain, personal hygiene, holding objects, walking, sitting,
standing, sleeping, social activity, sexual activity, and travel and movement are included.
ODI is a highly reliable evaluation method that consists of 10 questions, with a total score
of 50 points ranging from 0 to 5 on a 6-point scale. It can be judged that the higher the
total score is, the higher the functional disorder of low back pain patient is. SPSS
statistics 19.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) software was used to analyze collected data. The
paired t-test was used to compare the extent of pain and dysfunction of the experimental and
control groups before and after exercise. The independent t-test was used to compare
differences between groups. Statistical significance level was set to &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The changes in the results of the VAS and ODI are presented in <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the results of the VAS and ODI between the experimental and control

with vibration stimulation on pain and dysfunction in patients with lumbar pain. A clear
difference in pain severity was seen in the VAS of the experimental group. In the comparison
between groups, the VAS of the experimental group showed greater differences than the
control group. Yang and Seo<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
that pain was alleviated after applying vibration stimulation in patients with lumbar pain.
Kim et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that vibration
stimulation using a sling alleviates lumbar pain. Vibration is a convenient, safe, and
inexpensive therapeutic method that has been used to control pain<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Vibration stimulation excites receptors that sense
vibration and transfer the pain that is controlled by A-&#x003b2; and large myelinated nerve
fibers<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Vibration decreases the
levels of substance P-like immunoreactivity in the CSF<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. It also has a neurophysiologic placebo effect that reduces
transfer of pain from the peripheral pain receptors to the brain<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. On the basis
of this result, we can state that the Flexi-bar exercise program with vibration stimulation
helps to alleviate lumbar pain. Pain is not only troublesome; it also causes functional
problems through abnormalities of posture and stability of the trunk<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kim et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that vibration stimulation with a sling decreased the ODI
in patients with lumbar pain and improved their functional ability. Moreside et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that Bodyblade training with
vibration stimulation improves core stability of the trunk by activating the deeper muscles.
In our study, the ODI score improved significantly in the experimental group. Bogaerts et
al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that vibration
stimulation activates the muscle spindles and strengthens the muscles that maintain posture
stability by improving proprioceptive sense. When vibration stimulation is applied,
mobilization of &#x003b1;-motor neurons is increased and the core muscles of the trunk are activated
by strengthening neuromuscular control and increasing proprioceptive sense<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Vibration stimulation acts on the &#x003b1;-motor
neurons, causes contraction of the muscle belly and tendons, and thereby gives rise to
myotonic vibration reflection<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. This increase in the proprioceptive sense
of the muscle is thought to increase muscular activity, as it enables the muscle to carry a
greater external load<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The vibration
stimulation caused by the Flexi-bar exercise program stimulates the mechanical receptors of
the articular capsule of the lumbar joints, enables greater control of posture and motor
sense, and improves stability between spinal segments<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study showed that vibration exercise using shoulder joint
facilitated proprioception and had an influence on trunk stabilization, and had a positive
influence on decreasing the pain and improving the functional disorder of low back pain
patients. The limitations of this study were that the physical characteristics and habits of
the patients could not be modified. Additionally, as the sample size was small, the results
cannot be generalized and applied to all patients with lumbar pain. Further studies with
larger samples are required.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Fran&#x000e7;a</surname><given-names>FR</given-names></name><name><surname>Burke</surname><given-names>TN</given-names></name><name><surname>Hanada</surname><given-names>ES</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Segmental stabilization and muscular strengthening in
