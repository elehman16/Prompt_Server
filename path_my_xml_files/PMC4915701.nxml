In this Phase II trial, the safety and immunogenicity of Modified Vaccinia Ankara MVA-BN<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (MVA) was assessed in a 56&#x02013;80 years old population.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>MVA with a virus titer of 1 x 10<sup>8</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/dose was administered via subcutaneous injection to 56&#x02013;80 year old vaccinia-experienced subjects (N = 120). Subjects received either two injections of MVA (MM group) or one injection of Placebo and one injection of MVA (PM group) four weeks apart. Safety was evaluated by assessment of adverse events (AE), focused physical exams, electrocardiogram recordings and safety laboratories. Solicited AEs consisted of a set of pre-defined expected local reactions (erythema, swelling, pain, pruritus, and induration) and systemic symptoms (body temperature, headache, myalgia, nausea and fatigue) and were recorded on a memory aid for an 8-day period following each injection. The immunogenicity of the vaccine was evaluated in terms of humoral immune responses measured with a vaccinia-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) before and at different time points after vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>Vaccinations were well tolerated by all subjects. No serious adverse event related to MVA and no case of myopericarditis was reported. The overall incidence of unsolicited AEs was similar in both groups. For both groups immunogenicity responses two weeks after the final vaccination (i.e. Visit 4) were as follows: Seroconversion (SC) rates (doubling of titers from baseline) in vaccine specific antibody titers measured by ELISA were 83.3% in Group MM and 82.8% in Group PM (difference 0.6% with 95% exact CI [-13.8%, 15.0%]), and 90.0% for Group MM and 77.6% for Group PM measured by PRNT (difference 12.4% with 95% CI of [-1.1%, 27.0%]). Geometric mean titers (GMT) measured by ELISA two weeks after the final vaccination for Group MM were 804.1 and 605.8 for Group PM (with ratio of GMTs of 1.33 with 95% CI of [0.96, 1.84]). Similarly, GMTs measured by PRNT were 210.3 for Group MM and 126.7 for Group PM (with ratio 1.66 and 95% CI [0.95, 2.90]).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>One or two doses of MVA were safe and immunogenic in a 56&#x02013;80 years old vaccinia-experienced population. No cases of myopericarditis were observed following vaccinations with MVA. The safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity were similar to that seen in younger (18&#x02013;55 year old) healthy populations as investigated in other MVA trials. The results suggest that a single dose of MVA in a 56&#x02013;80 years old population was well tolerated and sufficient to rapidly boost the long-term B cell memory response induced by a prior vaccination with a traditional smallpox vaccine.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=NCT00857493">NCT00857493</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N01-A1-40072</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>The trial was funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases US (NIAID)(N01-AI-40072).

Nevertheless, concern about the re-emergence of VARV persists due to either the accidental or deliberate release of VARV stocks [<xref rid="pone.0157335.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157335.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While traditional smallpox vaccines, based on replicating vaccinia virus (VACV) strains, are highly effective, their use in a pre-emergency situation can be problematic because of rare but severe side effects associated with the replication competence of these vaccines [<xref rid="pone.0157335.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157335.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157335.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>MVA is a live, highly attenuated pox virus currently in advanced clinical development as a non-replicating smallpox vaccine. Due to the proven incapability to replicate in human cells [<xref rid="pone.0157335.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and based on the current database derived from completed and ongoing clinical trials [<xref rid="pone.0157335.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157335.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], MVA is a safer alternative to traditional, replicating smallpox vaccines. MVA has been shown to be efficacious in mice [<xref rid="pone.0157335.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], rabbits [<xref rid="pone.0157335.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and in non-human primates [<xref rid="pone.0157335.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] challenged with species specific orthopox viruses highly related to VARV in humans. MVA has also been shown to be immunogenic with a good safety profile in healthy and at-risk populations who have contraindications for replicating smallpox vaccines, namely subjects infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [<xref rid="pone.0157335.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157335.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], diagnosed with atopic dermatitis (AD) [<xref rid="pone.0157335.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157335.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]) or under immune suppressive treatment [<xref rid="pone.0157335.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, MVA induces peak antibody and VARV-neutralizing responses comparable to a traditional smallpox vaccine (Dryvax<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) [<xref rid="pone.0157335.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>While trials performed to date have shown MVA is able to boost immune responses in vaccinia-experienced healthy and HIV infected subjects [<xref rid="pone.0157335.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157335.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157335.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157335.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], no data exists in older populations (&#x0003e;55 years old) where the majority have been vaccinated against smallpox earlier in their lives. This population is important to investigate, because one of the most striking changes that occur during normal human aging is known as immunosenescence, a progressive and overall diminution of immune functions that affects all cells and organs of the innate and adaptive immune system [<xref rid="pone.0157335.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. As a hallmark of human aging, the progressive involution of the thymus leads to an impaired balance and function of na&#x000ef;ve, memory and effector T cells, thus promoting a latent pro-inflammatory status in the elderly.

Enrollment began July 1, 2009 and the last follow-up (FU) visit was on August 24, 2010. The study was approved by the following Institutional Review Boards: University of Kentucky IRB Office of Research Integrity, 315 Kinkead Hall Lexington, KY; University of Iowa IRB Human Subjects Office, 340 College of Medicine Ad. Bldg., Iowa City, IA; Independent Investigational Review Board, 6738 West Sunrise Blvd Plantation, FL; and the Western Institutional Review Board 3535 Seventh Ave. SW Olympia, WA. Group MM received two subcutaneous (s.c.) injections with 0.5 ml MVA at week 0 and week 4. Group PM received a first injection (s.c.) with placebo (0.5 ml saline), followed by a second injection (s.c.) with 0.5 ml MVA four weeks later. Vaccinia-experienced women and men aged 56 to 80 years were eligible for enrollment. The trial consisted of a screening period of up to four weeks, an active trial period of eight to ten weeks comprised of five visits (initial vaccination, 2 week FU, second vaccination at week 4, another 2 week FU and an additional FU visit 2 weeks later) and a long term FU period of at least 26&#x02013;30 weeks after the second injection ending with a final FU visit. At this final visit long-term safety data and serum for anti-vaccinia antibody analysis was collected and a physical examination was performed. Electrocardiogram and laboratory tests were to be performed only if clinically indicated. The trial was conducted according to the standards of GCP and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by independent review committees for each site and all subjects provided written informed consent prior to participation.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Safety Assessments</title><p>To evaluate safety of MVA, solicited and unsolicited AEs (adverse events) were recorded at screening and at each of the five visits during the active trial phase. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and AEs of special interest (AESI) were monitored throughout the trial up to the six months FU visit. Solicited AEs constituted a set of pre-defined, expected local reactions (erythema, swelling, pain, pruritus, and induration) and systemic symptoms (body temperature, headache, myalgia, nausea and fatigue). All solicited AEs were recorded on a memory aid for an 8-day period following each injection. Unsolicited AEs were all events reported by the subject within a 29-day period after each injection not already solicited in the memory aid. Safety laboratory tests including troponin I and electrocardiograms (ECG) were performed at screening and two weeks after each injection. Any cardiac symptom or ECG change, which was determined to be clinically significant and elevation of Troponin I above twice the normal limit were defined as AESIs. Unsolicited or solicited AEs that prevented daily activities or body temperatures &#x02265; 39&#x000b0;C were defined as grade &#x02265;3.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Immunogenicity Assays</title><p>Samples for immunogenicity testing were drawn at the first visit (baseline, sample drawn prior to first vaccination) and each post-baseline visit.

A sample size of 60 subjects provides a probability of 95% to detect SAEs with an incidence of at least 5%, i.e. 60 subjects provide a 95% certainty of detecting at least one SAE that occurs with an incidence of 1 in 20.</p><p>Subjects eligible for Group MM or PM were randomly allocated per site to one of the two treatment groups in order of their appearance in a 1:1 ratio.

The pharmacist who prepared the syringes for administration was the only individual aware of the group allocation and only had the subject number and no other subject details.</p><p>The trial was not powered to provide formal testing between arms, and the statistical analyses performed were descriptive. Confidence intervals (CI) for rates (%) were calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method, and CIs of the differences (&#x00394; = Group MM&#x02013;Group PM) in rates between groups (adverse event rates and SC rates) used a two one-sided exact confidence interval.

Clinical studies with traditional smallpox vaccines based on replicating VACV strains have reported fewer AEs in vaccinia-experienced subjects compared to vaccinia-na&#x000ef;ve populations, hypothesized to be related to the immunologic memory against VACV [<xref rid="pone.0157335.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Interestingly given that MVA fails to replicate in human cells and as such cannot cause several of the AE associated with the replicating nature of traditional smallpox vaccines (e.g. progressive vaccinia, generalized vaccinia, inadvertent inoculation), the safety profile of MVA has been shown to be the same for vaccinia experienced and vaccinia na&#x000ef;ve populations whether for healthy [<xref rid="pone.0157335.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] or HIV infected [<xref rid="pone.0157335.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157335.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] adults.</p><p>A high number of suspected and probable myopericarditis cases were reported in the pivotal clinical program of ACAM2000, a replicating VACV [<xref rid="pone.0157335.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The Phase III ACAM2000 trials included active post-vaccination cardiac monitoring, leading to the detection of 8 myopericarditis cases in 1,162 primary vaccinees after vaccination with either ACAM2000 or Dryvax (incidence of 1:145). Most cases were symptomatic (i.e. subjects presented with chest pain, reduced tolerance to exercise, dyspnea or palpitations) and diagnosis was confirmed by coexisting ECG changes or echocardiogram, findings indicative of myocardial inflammation. During the campaign to vaccinate first line responders in the USA in 2003, the majority (76%) of the 40,000 people vaccinated were vaccinia-experienced and of the 203 cardiac events reported, 183 were in people previously vaccinated [<xref rid="pone.0157335.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, serious cardiac events may be associated with vaccination in vaccinia-experienced populations receiving traditional smallpox vaccines. Despite the fact that subjects 56 to 80 years of age in general are at higher risk of experiencing cardiac events [<xref rid="pone.0157335.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], no such cases were reported in the current study. Despite close cardiac monitoring, no confirmed cases of myo-pericarditis have been observed in any MVA-BN trials. This supports a favorable cardiac safety profile of MVA for the population of 56 to 80 years of age and confirms results reported in a large clinical trial (N = 745) designed to investigate cardiac safety in 18&#x02013;55 year old healthy vaccinia-na&#x000ef;ve and vaccinia experienced subjects [<xref rid="pone.0157335.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated that humoral immunity against smallpox is long-lived and can persist for more than 30 years [<xref rid="pone.0157335.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157335.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157335.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Consistent with this finding, moderate baseline antibody titers were detected in the 56&#x02013;80 years old subjects enrolled in this study, although primary vaccination of the subjects was likely performed more than 40 years ago. Routine smallpox vaccination in the USA was stopped 1972. The ability of MVA to rapidly boost the antibody responses in all vaccinia-experienced subjects supports the observation that traditional smallpox vaccines induce a long-lived B-cell memory [<xref rid="pone.0157335.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Historically, booster vaccinations with traditional smallpox vaccines provided a robust protection [<xref rid="pone.0157335.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], although the vaccine take, which is an accepted marker of efficacy against smallpox, was often attenuated in vaccinia-experienced subjects. Recently the ability to boost the antibody response in vaccinia-experienced subjects has been suggested to be more indicative of protection than the take rate [<xref rid="pone.0157335.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Therefore, the anamnestic response recorded following a single booster vaccination with MVA suggests that this vaccine will be effective in 56&#x02013;80 year old vaccinia-experienced subjects. Even though antibody titers had declined during the 6 month follow-up period of the clinical trial, ELISA and PRNT titers were still considerably above the baseline titers. Since GMTs are currently not an accepted correlate of protection and no protective titer is defined, it is unknown if this antibody level is high enough to protect against smallpox. Clinical proof of efficacy is not possible due to the fact that smallpox is eradicated. A randomized Phase 3 non-inferiority trial is currently ongoing to directly compare indicators of efficacy of MVA to the replicating smallpox vaccine ACAM2000<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.</p><p>Overall this trial found one or two doses of MVA to be safe and immunogenic in a vaccinia-experienced, population 56 to 80 years of age. These results also suggest that a single MVA vaccination boosts the memory response induced by a prior vaccination with a traditional smallpox vaccine. As such this further suggests that this boosted memory response after MVA vaccination should provide efficacy against VARV in humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0157335.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Vaccinia-specific ELISA GMTs by Week (PPS, N = 102).</title><p>Administrations at Week 0 (Group MM: first MVA vaccination; Group PM: Placebo) and at Week 4 (Group MM: second MVA vaccination; Group PM: first MVA vaccination).
