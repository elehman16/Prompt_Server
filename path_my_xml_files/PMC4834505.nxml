Older people admitted to hospital often have complex treatment, rehabilitation, and nursing needs [<xref rid="C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Poor care coordination at the time of hospital discharge can jeopardize patient safety and result in substandard health care [<xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and patients and their caregivers are often ill prepared for the transition from hospital to home [<xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Collaboration between hospital and primary care providers is imperative to ensure high-quality post-discharge care, indicating a growing need for coordination between primary and secondary health care systems [<xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A high readmission rate is often seen as a proxy of lack of quality in the transition from the secondary to the primary sector. The hospital often loses contact with the patient at discharge, and the municipality is responsible for helping frail older people.</p><p>Several randomized intervention studies have investigated hospital discharge planning [<xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;14</xref>] or interventions by clinical pharmacists [<xref rid="C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] on hospital readmission, primary care, prescription errors, and quality of life among older people and people with chronic diseases. Community-based disease-management programmes significantly reduced readmission among patients with heart failure, coronary heart disease, and asthma, while interventions among unselected older patients with chronic diseases did not affect hospital readmission [<xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Some studies suggest that systematic post-discharge support and effort may result in better coordination and coherence in treatment and may reduce unplanned readmission although the results are not consistent [<xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="C19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;22</xref>].</p><p>We performed a randomized controlled trial among a high-risk population of older people discharged from a hospital department of internal medicine to evaluate whether a systematic municipality-based post-discharge follow-up intervention including the primary general practitioner and municipal nurse in a real-world setting could reduce readmission and the use of primary and secondary health care.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" id="S0003"><title>Material and methods</title><sec disp-level="2" id="S0004"><title>Design</title><p>The study was a single-centre, 1:1 parallel-group individual patient randomized controlled trial stratified by gender and age (65&#x02013;74 years and 75 + years) followed for 180 days.

The Charlson comorbidity score was calculated using information on primary and secondary diagnoses from all in- and outpatient contacts with Danish hospitals from 10 years before index admission and including the index admission [<xref rid="C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Information on municipal services was obtained from municipal registration available on a monthly basis. We calculated the referred services (measured as minutes of referred care), divided into home care (practical help and personal care), nursing home (services at a care home) and nursing (services offered by a municipal nurse). This information was available only among trial participants and not for eligible non-participants.</p><p>Follow-up measures were in-hospital readmissions obtained from the Danish National Patient Register, which contains information on all contacts with Danish hospitals [<xref rid="C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Information on contacts with the general practitioner and visits by the emergency service doctor were obtained from the Danish National Health Service Register [<xref rid="C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

We performed all analysis within 30 and 180 days of follow-up after discharge.</p><p>Further, the mean number of consultations with general practitioners and visits by the emergency service doctor during follow-up were calculated. Finally, municipal services were calculated as the proportion of people who received the services and, among those who received the services, the mean number of monthly minutes of services the month after and one to six months after the index admission. As a descriptive measure, mortality was also evaluated as an outcome.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="S0007"><title>Randomization</title><p>The physicians at the Department of Internal Medicine screened the patients, nurses collected informed consent, and the patients were then randomized. The Data Management Department of the Central Denmark Region centrally administered a computer-generated randomization sequence by using Trial Partner. The medical secretary faxed the screening information to the municipal services independently of randomization group. For the intervention group, the municipality organized the intervention with the general practitioner.</p><p>The doctors screening for eligibility were blinded toward intervention groups. Further, the data analyst obtaining register-based outcome information was blinded towards the randomization groups in the analysis. No methods were changed after the trial began.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="S0008"><title>Interventions</title><p>High-risk people were referred to intervention through systematic electronic referral from the hospital to the municipality. The municipal services contacted the primary general practitioner and then the patient, to arrange the first home visit together with the municipal nurse within seven days of discharge in the patient's home. Only visits where both municipal nurse and general practitioner participated were included in the study. The visit was scheduled for one hour and focused on medication, rehabilitation plan and hospital appointments, functional level, and need for further health care initiatives. The visit concluded with assessment of the need for further visits (up to three visits) and division of responsibilities between the general practitioner and the municipal nurse. The second consultation was planned for the third week and the third consultation in the eighth week after discharge.</p><p>Patients in the control group were assigned to usual care including a discharge letter from the hospital to the general practitioner but not including coordinated home visits from the municipal nurse and the primary general practitioner. In Denmark's health care system, all residents can seek consultation with a general practitioner, and residents with physical disabilities can receive home care without any user charges. This means that participants from both groups could be in regular contact with a general practitioner and/or a municipal nurse during follow-up.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="S0009"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The baseline characteristics of participants versus eligible non-participants were compared.</p><p>We performed all analysis based on the intention-to-treat principle. For the primary outcome analysis, patients were followed for hospital admission 30 days following the discharge from the index admission. As secondary outcomes, we followed the cohort for unplanned admissions, admissions to departments of medicine, and number of consultations with general practitioners for both 30 and 180 days. We also analysed mortality as a descriptive measure and to evaluate the influence of competing risk. We tested all differences using the chi-square test. For the primary outcome, we also estimated the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier survival plots and tested differences using the log-rank test. We also evaluated the mean number of admissions and length of stay and tested differences using the t-test.</p><p>We compared the proportion receiving municipal services using the chi-square test and, among those who received services, we compared the mean minutes of services using the t-test. We performed these calculations only for patients who were alive during the whole follow-up period.</p><p>The epidemiologist responsible for all statistical analysis (LCT) was blinded towards the intervention status. We performed post-hoc unblinded per-protocol analysis, with per protocol defined as visits by the general practitioner at least once during the intervention period and the follow-up started at the time of the first visit or on day 14 after discharge for the control group.</p><p>We used two-sided p-values, and &#x02264; 0.05 was defined as statistically significant.

The intervention and control groups had similar mortality at 30 and 180 days.</p><p>Per-protocol analysis showed the same conclusion as intention-to-treat analyses of no difference in readmission and mortality between groups. However, there was evidence that a lower proportion of patients who received a visit by the general practitioner were readmitted within 30 days compared with the control group (20.1% versus 23.4%) (not shown). These differences were not significant.</p><p>The intervention group had more referred nursing services in the month after discharge and one to six months after discharge (p &#x0003c; 0.0001), but the mean number of referred minutes among those receiving nursing services was significantly lower (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="TB3">Table III</xref>). More patients in the intervention group were referred to home care one to six months after discharge, and there was a trend towards a lower mean number of referred minutes (p = 0.10).</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" id="S0012"><title>Discussion</title><p>This randomized real-world controlled trial comparing municipality-based post-discharge follow-up visits by a general practitioner and a municipal nurse versus usual care among high-risk older people discharged from a department of internal medicine had no benefits in term of the primary outcome of readmission within 30 days. No other secondary outcomes differed significantly except that more patients in the intervention group than the control group received municipal nursing services. This municipality-based follow-up intervention was only implemented in half the planned visits.</p><sec disp-level="2" id="S0013"><title>Comparison with previous literature</title><p>Several intervention studies have reported effects of hospital discharge planning [<xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;14</xref>] on hospital readmissions, primary care, prescription errors, and quality of life among older people and people with chronic disease. Community-based disease management programmes significantly reduced readmission among people with specific chronic diseases, whereas interventions had no effect on readmission among older people [<xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Our results on readmission are consistent with these results, and another meta-analysis reported that regular home visits to frail older people do not influence hospital readmission [<xref rid="C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Another study in Denmark by Rytter and colleagues reported that similar systematic post-discharge support and effort resulted in better coordination and coherence in treatment and reduced readmission [<xref rid="C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The study was smaller and the proportion of home visits carried out was markedly higher (93%) than in our study. Furthermore they included only general practitioners who volunteered to participate in the study and these general practitioners led the intervention [<xref rid="C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In contrast, in our study, we included all general practitioners in the three municipalities and the intervention was led by the municipality.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="S0014"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Our study has several strengths, including: randomizing patients with a similar distribution of baseline covariates; blinding hospital doctors who screened patients for the trial by assessing screening criteria towards randomization status; collecting complete register-based follow-up information for all patients; and blinding researchers&#x02019; analysis and interpretation of data towards randomization status. Few eligible patients refused to participate (18%). A further strength is the pragmatic design conducted in a real-world set-up.</p><p>The study had limitations. First, by its nature the intervention could not be blinded for the patients, the municipal nurses, or the general practitioners. Second, the proportion of patients (55%) who received the home visit in the intervention group limits the ability to study the effect of home visits. This also highlights that the implementation proportion may not be higher in a real-world set-up, e.g. compared with the study by Rytter and colleagues [<xref rid="C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and stresses the importance of implementation research. Third, the screening tool was not validated but based on previous studies of risk factors for readmission. Finally, the primary outcome was readmissions in general, which is an unspecific outcome. The same results were observed for unplanned readmissions and for readmissions at departments of internal medicine.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="S0015"><title>Meaning of the study</title><p>Our study reflects everyday clinical practice by hospital personnel, general practitioners, or municipal nurses. For the intervention group, 55% of the patients received the home visit. The main reason for cancelling the visits was that the general practitioner did not think they were relevant (23% of the patients in the intervention group) because the patient may have seemed too healthy to benefit from the home visit [<xref rid="C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Some general practitioners noted that visiting patients who could come to the medical practice by themselves was demotivating. The control group probably comprises many of the same patients, because the number of consultations was only slightly higher in the intervention group (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="TB3">Table III</xref>). This could reflect unintended crossover of the intervention group to the control group.</p><p>The screening tool for the trial may not be precise enough to make the home visit relevant in the primary care sector. Some patients younger than 65 years may have benefited from home visits because of complicated disease status or treatments. Further, patients may appear in a different state during admission than when they are back in their customary surroundings. The screening tool was not validated but was based on professional assessment (doctors and nurses from both primary and hospital sectors). About 23% of the patients were readmitted within 30 days and 52% within 180 days (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="TB3">Table III</xref>), which, however, supports that the screening did distinguish a patient group at high risk of readmission.</p><p>Several barriers to the implementation of the intervention should be highlighted [<xref rid="C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]: (i) the communication, e.g. transmission of information between and across the three sectors (hospital, municipality, and general practitioner) was suboptimal despite the great potential for such knowledge sharing; (ii) the assessment of the intervention differed between the involved professions, in particular the attitude of general practitioners greatly influenced the intervention; (iii) the practical organization of the visits, e.g. the demand for a joint visit by a municipal nurse and general practitioner; and (iv) the uncertainty as to whether the screening tool was sensitive and specific in identifying those patients at highest risk of readmission. Each of these barriers may have influenced the relatively low proportion of patients receiving the visits.</p><p>The only significant differences between the intervention and control groups were that more intervention patients received municipal nursing services but those receiving services received shorter visits (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="TB3">Table III</xref>). Thus, the intervention group may have received higher-quality municipal care, since more received appropriate services, reflecting a more relevant and tailored service level.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="S0016"><title>Implications for future research</title><p>Hospital readmission is not the most important patient-related outcome of health care [<xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Even if a given intervention fails to reduce readmission rates, continuing implementation may still improve other patient outcomes, such as mortality, satisfaction with care, and cost-effectiveness [<xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Further, the assumption that readmission rates reflect patient well-being may be erroneous.</p><p>Implementation fidelity (the degree to which an intervention or programme is delivered as intended) is an important moderator between the intervention and the intended outcome. In some cases, the lack of implementation fidelity probably resulted from medical assessment and setting priorities [<xref rid="C27" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;29</xref>], but knowledge is lacking on the mechanism that moderates the extent of implementation fidelity in complex cross-sectorial interventions.</p><p>This randomized pragmatic controlled trial comparing municipality-based post-discharge follow- up visits with usual care among high-risk older people reported no effect on the primary outcome of readmission within 30 days.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>The authors would like to thank the following members of the Prevention of Early Readmission Research Group: Peter Schou, general practitioner, Holb&#x000e6;k, Denmark; Natasha Georgieva Roseva-Nielsen, Chief Physician, Department of Internal Medicine, Holb&#x000e6;k University Hospital, Denmark; Gerda Pedersen, Medical Officer, Municipality of Holb&#x000e6;k, Denmark; Lia Clemensen, District Manager, Municipality of Holb&#x000e6;k, Denmark; Jytte Hykkelbjerg Bruhn, Nurse, Department of Internal Medicine, Holb&#x000e6;k University Hospital, Denmark; Inge Jekes, Nurse and Development Consultant, Municipality of Kalundborg, Denmark; Lone Haagensen, Quality Management Nurse, Department of Internal Medicine, Holb&#x000e6;k University Hospital, Denmark; Anette Rise, Team Leader, Municipality of Odsherred, Denmark; Vivi Kenhof, Medical Officer, Municipality of Odsherred, Denmark; Henrik Ancher S&#x000f8;rensen, Department of Internal Medicine, Holb&#x000e6;k University Hospital, Denmark; and Knut Borch-Johnsen, Assistant General Manager, Holb&#x000e6;k University Hospital, Denmark.</p></ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>The Fund for Intersectoral Projects in Region Zealand, Denmark funded the project in 2011 and 2012.
