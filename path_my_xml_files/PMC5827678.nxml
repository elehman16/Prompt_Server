Strength training (ST) has shown an effect in not only normalizing muscle function but also reducing neck muscle pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim</title><p>The aims of this study were to compare muscle function in terms of strength, force steadiness in neck flexion, as well as extension, and rate of RFD of the shoulder in tension-type headache (TTH) patients and healthy controls and to examine the correlation to tenderness. Furthermore, the aim of the study was to examine the effect of ST on neck and shoulder functions in TTH patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants and methods</title><p>In all, 60 TTH patients and 30 sex- and age-matched healthy controls were included for a case&#x02013;control comparison. The 60 patients with TTH were randomized into an ST and an ergonomic and posture correction (EP) control group. The ST group trained for 10 weeks with elastic bands.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>TTH patients had a lower extension force steadiness with a significant 15% higher coefficient of variation (CoV) compared to healthy controls (<italic>p</italic>=0.047). A significantly lower RFD (25%) was noted in the TTH group than in the healthy controls (<italic>p</italic>=0.031). A significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) and moderate correlation to muscle tenderness was found. In the intervention, 23 patients completed ST and 21 patients completed EP. No significant between-group effect was observed, but at 22 weeks follow-up, both groups had a significant within-group effect of improved extension force steadiness (ST: <italic>p</italic>=0.011 and EP: <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>TTH patients showed a deteriorated muscle function, indicated by a lower force steadiness and RFD, compared to the healthy controls. The effect of ST was not larger than EP as both groups of TTH patients showed some improvement in neck and shoulder functions during the 10 weeks intervention and at follow-up. Future interventions are needed to elucidate if normalization of muscle function can lead to a reduction in headache.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>tension-type headache</kwd><kwd>force steadiness</kwd><kwd>rate of force development</kwd><kwd>strength training</kwd><kwd>ergonomic</kwd><kwd>posture correction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tension-type headache (TTH) is very common and has a large impact on the everyday life of the general population, with a substantial influence on work, leisure and social activities.<xref rid="b1-jpr-11-445" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b4-jpr-11-445" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The muscles are considered to be one of the most important factors to influence TTH.<xref rid="b5-jpr-11-445" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-jpr-11-445" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The muscle tenderness is considered to have an important influence on TTH, with an increasing tenderness with increasing headache intensity and frequency.<xref rid="b7-jpr-11-445" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-jpr-11-445" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> A population-based study confirmed that patients with chronic TTH (CTTH) have a significantly higher total tenderness score (TTS) compared to the general population.<xref rid="b31-jpr-11-445" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> A high prevalence of headache has been found in individuals with musculoskeletal symptoms in the neck in a Norwegian study, and this has been confirmed in a Danish study.<xref rid="b9-jpr-11-445" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-jpr-11-445" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>The ability to control and sustain activation of adequate muscle force depends highly on the proprioceptive system that may be impaired in TTH patients.<xref rid="b11-jpr-11-445" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The ability to sustain a muscle contraction with minimum force fluctuations while matching a given force level can be measured as the coefficient of variation (CoV) of the force over time and is referred to as force steadiness.

The patients aimed to maintain the 30% MVC target force over 30 seconds, as stable as possible, guided by a visual feedback. The actual mean force and standard deviation (SD) were registered and used to calculate coefficient of variation as SD/mean over a 25-second period. Three attempts were made.

The training consisted of ST three times per week. Days of training during the week were by own choice and were supervised weekly by a physiotherapist for the first 2 weeks and thereafter every second week. The ST consisted of four shoulder exercises. During the training period, the relative training load was progressively increased from 12 repetitions maximum (RMs; 70% of maximal intensity) at the beginning to eight RMs (80% of the maximal intensity). ST was performed with slow concentric and eccentric muscle contractions with resistance from the elastic bands. The appropriate elastic band was selected and over time shortened or changed to meet the requirements of resistance. The elastic bands were handed in after the 10 weeks of training. The exercises have been described previously in more detail with pictures of the exercises.<xref rid="b22-jpr-11-445" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>The EP control group was instructed in EP. They were instructed to pay attention to their sitting positions and how they used a computer or other working tools. Furthermore, they were asked to do a posture correction exercise three times a day with 10 repetitions. The purpose of the exercise was to increase consciousness of sitting positions. The exercise started with the patient in a posture with a flat lumbar lordosis with protruded shoulders and neck. Thereafter, they overcorrected the lumbar lordosis, shoulders and neck, and after 4 seconds slowly moved back to the starting posture. The control group was seen twice during the 10-week period and was called over the phone every 2 weeks to ask if they paid attention to their ergonomics and posture correction, and filled out the headache diary. After 10 weeks, they were instructed that they should stop the exercise but continue to be conscious of their ergonomics and sitting position.</p><p>The ST intervention compared to EP resulted in no effect on the primary outcome of change in the headache frequency and duration as described previously.<xref rid="b22-jpr-11-445" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>Stata (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA) was used to calculate statistics.</p><sec><title>Case control</title><p>When data were not normally distributed, they were transformed, and a Unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test was used to test for significant difference between healthy controls and TTH patients. <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 was used as the level of significance.

Force steadiness was significantly affected in the extension with a higher CoV in the extension but not in flexion.

The TTH patients had a reduced extension force steadiness with a significant 15% higher CoV than the healthy controls. In contrast, no such difference was found in flexion force steadiness. Furthermore, it was confirmed that there was a significant 25% lower RFD in the TTH group than in the healthy controls. Moderate, although significant, correlations were found between total tenderness and the MVC values in the neck and shoulder muscles, force steadiness and RFD. This suggests that tenderness is associated with the ability to generate force and to control movement in the neck.</p></sec><sec><title>RCT</title><p>The reported outcomes are secondary outcomes from the RCT trial.

There is no clear explanation of this outcome as MVC and RFD in other studies have been found to increase with ST.<xref rid="b16-jpr-11-445" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> We found a nonsignificant tendency to an RFD increase from baseline to testing at 10 weeks but a decrease again during the testing at week 22, indicating some response to the 10 weeks of training and a reduction to an RFD even lower than at baseline in the period after training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-jpr-11-445">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>As both ST and EP groups improved, the ST intervention did not have a significant effect on force steadiness. Within the ST group, extension force steadiness showed a borderline significant improvement in extension at 10 weeks and a significant improvement at 22 weeks when compared to baseline. In the EP group, significant improvement was already found at 10 weeks and again at 22 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-jpr-11-445">Figure 2</xref>). Normalizing the muscle function of the neck with a normalization of the extension/flexion ratio and steadiness could play a key role in reduction of both tenderness and headache. In a previous paper, we described the reduced extension/flexion ratio in the TTH population compared to healthy controls.<xref rid="b13-jpr-11-445" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, no significant improvement was detected in the extension/flexion ratio after the intervention. The expected increase in strength was not detected, and no improvement in the other measurements was found. However, the effect of ST depended on the key component of the training volume, which is the summation of total numbers of repetitions during a training session multiplied by the resistance used.<xref rid="b19-jpr-11-445" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The participants had recorded their training with three training days per week in a diary, and the resistance was adjusted gradually to meet the required resistance. The patients trained at home, and therefore, only attendance and not the actual number of repetitions or actual resistance could be checked. A potential explanation for the lack of increase in strength could be a combination of those factors. Another explanation could be that the amount of training for this group of patients with a high level of muscle tenderness is not sufficient and that a prolonged training period could be needed.</p><p>There have only been a limited umber of high quality RCTs with non-pharmacological intervention in TTH patients.<xref rid="b26-jpr-11-445" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> In an RCT study, Van Ettekoven and Lucas combined motor control training of the neck with physiotherapy and posture correction and their control group conducted posture correction and physiotherapy. The posture correction physiotherapy and motor control training resulted in a reduction of headache frequency with 50 percent or more in 82% after training (6 weeks) and 85 % at follow up (6 months).<xref rid="b27-jpr-11-445" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> No significant differences were found between groups at 6 weeks, but after 6 months, the training group had a significant reduction in frequency, duration and intensity of headaches compared to the control group.</p><p>In the present study, we were unable to normalize the muscle function. This could potentially be achieved through training with a combination of interventions. The training could be a combination of training aiming to normalize neck extensors and force steadiness and minimize load on muscles.</p></sec><sec><title>Muscle function</title><p>The reduced force steadiness in the TTH group may indicate a dysfunction of the neck muscles, leading to a daily &#x0201c;overuse&#x0201d; of muscle activation to control force. Such an increased activity of the neck muscles could over time lead to tenderness of the neck muscles.<xref rid="b18-jpr-11-445" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> This may be made worse by the reduced RFD in the TTH group. Our previous analysis in the same population as the present study has described a lower extension/flexion ratio at baseline, mainly caused by a lower extension force, and additionally, a borderline significant reduction in abduction force. The combination of a low force steadiness and extension/flexion ratio could be an important key in understanding some of the muscle dysfunction in TTH that may contribute to both muscle tenderness and TTH. With an ongoing increased activity of the neck muscles, a gradual increase in tenderness and TTH may follow, as previously hypothesized by Bendtsen.<xref rid="b24-jpr-11-445" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Furthermore, the pain-affected muscles could function in a way that is abnormal to their normal motor function in order to divert from pain. Prolonged muscle pain can influence movement patterns.<xref rid="b28-jpr-11-445" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In the present study, muscle tenderness was associated with the MVC of the neck muscles with a moderate negative correlation that indicates that muscle pain has a negative influence on the force.<xref rid="b29-jpr-11-445" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> A potential explanation of the muscle function in the present study is in accordance with the pain model of Lund., et al who has described how muscle pain can modulate muscle activity and lead to an increased activity of antagonists and decreased activity of agonists.<xref rid="b30-jpr-11-445" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In the present population, the force steadiness and extension/flexion ratio could be explained by an influence of pain on motor control, suggesting that prolonged pain potentially could influence motor pattern.<xref rid="b28-jpr-11-445" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b29-jpr-11-445" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>Bendtsen&#x02019;s model for chronification of TTH from 2000 describes how input from painful muscles may contribute to a chronification of the headache.<xref rid="b5-jpr-11-445" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b24-jpr-11-445" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The muscle dysfunction found in the present study may thus potentially present such a muscular impact.</p><p>In line with other studies, we expected to and did find a higher degree of tenderness in the TTH group. Furthermore, we found a moderate negative correlation between tenderness and muscle force. This indicates that muscle tenderness is associated with muscle function in the neck and shoulder muscles in TTH patients.<xref rid="b7-jpr-11-445" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-jpr-11-445" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Total tenderness has been examined in a 12-year follow-up prospective population-based study, showing that the tenderness was normal at baseline but had increased in the FETTH group.<xref rid="b33-jpr-11-445" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In the present study, we did not measure the muscle function with electromyography (EMG) which could have contributed further to the understanding of cause and effect of the muscle function in TTH.</p><p>In the present study, ST of the shoulders was conducted; this may prove not to be sufficient in reducing highly frequent TTH. It could be necessary to address the neck muscles more directly through training to normalize the neck function.</p><p>The decrease in muscle tenderness following ST could therefore play a key role in reducing TTH.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>A strength of the present study was the precise diagnosis of the headache patients. Furthermore, the systematic registration of the tenderness made it possible to contribute further to the understanding of how muscles work in TTH patients. A limitation of the study was that neck pain was not prospectively registered; hence, it is unknown if the training activity decreased neck pain. An unexpected finding was that the ST group did not have increased muscle strength as expected. Because ST is &#x02013; per definition &#x02013; training that increases muscle strength, the participants of the present study are unlikely to have self-trained sufficiently, e.g., the intensity of training at home may have been too low. As the training frequency and length of the intervention are quite similar to other studies that have shown clear increases in muscle strength, it is likely that too low training intensity and/or the severity of headache with a high level of tenderness were the major causes of lack of progression. Potentially, longer training periods and higher intensity ST could have contributed to a further impact on functions of muscle. Lack of control of training doses in each session, due to home training, could potentially have influenced the results. The power calculation was done regarding the primary outcome; therefore, lack of power could potentially explain some of the results.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A lower force steadiness and RFD were shown in the TTH patients compared to the healthy controls. Furthermore, a moderate correlation to tenderness was found. Unfortunately, ST did not have any substantial impact on strength or RFD and did not normalize steadiness or reduce tenderness. An improved intervention that could reduce tenderness should be examined in a future study. That study could include both posture correction and more intensive and prolonged training to normalize neck extensors and force steadiness in the RCT study design.</p></sec><sec><title>Key points</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>TTH patients compared to the healthy controls showed a deteriorated muscle function, indicated by a lower force steadiness and RFD.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) and moderate correlation to muscle tenderness was found.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The effect of ST was not larger than EP as both groups of TTH patients showed some improvement in neck and shoulder function during the 10 weeks intervention.</p></list-item></list></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by the Tryg Foundation.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-jpr-11-445"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lyngberg</surname><given-names>AC</given-names></name><name><surname>Rasmussen</surname><given-names>BK</given-names></name><name><surname>J&#x000f8;rgensen</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Jensen</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Has the prevalence of migrane and tension type headache changed over a 12 year period</article-title><source>Eur J Epidemiol</source><year>2005</year><volume>20</volume><issue>3</issue><fpage>243</fpage><lpage>249</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15921042</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-jpr-11-445"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rasmussen</surname><given-names>BK</given-names></name><name><surname>Jensen</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Schroll</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Olesen</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Epidimiologi of headache in a general population.
