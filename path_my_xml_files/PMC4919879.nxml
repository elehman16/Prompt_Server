High BP is one of the most common risk factors for cardiovascular disease, affecting approximately 40&#x000a0;% of the adult population worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Currently, it accounts for 45&#x000a0;% and 51&#x000a0;% of deaths resulting from coronary artery disease and stroke, respectively. In addition, its prevalence is projected to reach as high as 1.5 billion by 2025 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Elevated BP results from varying factors such as genetics, diet, lifestyle, and combinations thereof [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Hypertension may also further increase morbidity and mortality due to other diseases in the presence of other risk factors. Strategies for the prevention and management of hypertension and associated adverse consequences are based on lifestyle modification as well as pharmacological interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Notably, clinical trial evidence showed that a large number of hypertensive participants (20&#x02013;30&#x000a0;%) are resistant to the maximum tolerated dose of antihypertensive drugs administered in various combinations, and thus, managing hypertension remains an enormous challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Accordingly, more effective alternative treatment options that can clinically resolve this debilitating condition should be developed to improve patient outcomes and reduce the public health burden.</p><p>Wide-ranging dietary modifications and interventions that include functional foods and nutraceuticals have been shown to have promising antihypertensive effects in the preclinical and clinical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The combination of lifestyle, pharmacological, and other alternative approaches may prove beneficial in individuals affected by hypertension and may also reduce the risk of the previously mentioned diseases.</p><p>In the past decade, considerable interest has developed for using the plant polyphenol resveratrol to combat hypertension and other forms of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Resveratrol has been reported to possess a dose-dependent antihypertensive effect in various animal models of systemic hypertension such as the spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) model, the angiotensin (Ang) II-infused mouse model, the two-kidney one-clip hypertensive rat, and in partially nephrectomized rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Moreover, resveratrol at a low dose (2.5&#x000a0;mg/kg body weight/day) has been shown to enhance the effect of other antihypertensive medication in the SHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Additionally, resveratrol protects against and/or reverses pulmonary hypertension in rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Resveratrol is also effective in preventing high-fat-induced and high-sucrose-induced arterial stiffness in nonhuman primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Resveratrol-mediated reduction in hypertension has been attributed to various mechanisms, including improvement in oxidative stress, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and vasodilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, clinical data from well-designed trials, which can be translated to humans as a treatment option, are scarce. Notably, resveratrol has been reported to lower BP in diabetic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]; however, no study to date has specifically examined its potential in lowering BP in persons diagnosed with hypertension.</p><p>We hypothesize that resveratrol administration (1&#x000a0;g/day for 4&#x000a0;weeks) alone will reduce the BP or will complement the standard antihypertensive medication in hypertensive patients. For example, resveratrol may also have an incremental effect in lowering high BP when taken along with the standard antihypertensive medication. This would help to reduce the dosage of antihypertensive medications that have side effects. To test our hypothesis, a crossover, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 50 participants with prehypertension and 50 participants with stage 1 hypertension was designed. Blood pressure and biochemical parameters will be analyzed to test the antihypertensive efficacy and mechanisms of action of resveratrol in the study subjects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design overview and ethics approval</title><p>This study is a crossover, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, single-center trial with an allocation ratio of 1:1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

A stratified complete block randomization method will be used in this trial. Blocks of four will be used for this purpose. The randomization scheme will be generated using random number formulae in Microsoft Excel. Patients with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension will be separately randomized to receive active drug (resveratrol) in 500&#x000a0;mg capsules, twice daily for 4&#x000a0;weeks (sequence A), or placebo (500&#x000a0;mg neutral microcellulose capsules), twice daily for 4&#x000a0;weeks (sequence B), in a 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 crossover design. The drug or placebo will be taken by patients at 7 to 8&#x000a0;a.m. in the morning on an empty stomach and at 8 to 9&#x000a0;p.m. with 200&#x000a0;cc water. The patients will be asked to record their conditions after taking the capsules in case any unusual effects are experienced. At the end of the 4&#x000a0;weeks, another 4-week washout period will follow, during which the patients in both sequences will receive placebo. All the participants will be followed up for an additional 1-month period for assessing any possible aftereffects (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p>The study will be double-blinded (the patients, those who will be participating in the study and those who analyze the results will be unaware of the state of the patient with regard to receiving the active drugs or placebo). For this purpose, participants will be blinded by using a placebo that is identical to active drug in appearance, but the content is neutral cellulose. To blind those who conduct the study, the person who delivers or checks the study drug will be different from those who examine the patients, and all the drugs packages will be identified by unique numbers. Finally, the randomization table will be concealed from research staff by using closed envelops.</p><p>Compliance will be quantified by counting the number of capsules consumed during the interval between the two visits and presented as percentages (number consumed/number expected to be consumed)&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;100). If compliance is less than 60&#x000a0;%, we will consider this case as noncompliant. Noncompliant patients will be included under the intention-to-treat analysis.

Based on the software output, a two-sided <italic>t</italic> test will achieve approximately 80&#x000a0;% power when the total sample size of a 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 cross-over design is <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;44, the actual mean difference for systolic BP (as primary outcome) is 10, the square root of the within mean square error is 10, and the significance level is 0.05. Enrollment of 44 patients would provide an 80&#x000a0;% power to demonstrate a significant difference&#x000a0;between the study arms. We expect approximately 10&#x000a0;% loss to follow-up. To achieve the calculated statistical power, we decided to recruit 50 patients in each strata (prehypertension and stage 1 hypertension group), equally allocated to sequences A or B. In total, 100 patients will participate in this trial. To minimize loss to follow-up, we give the participants a visit card. The next visit time is recorded on the card based on the study protocol. In addition, we call the participants, the day before, to remind them of their visit time, and again on the day after if they fail to attend their visit on time to re-invite them to reschedule soon.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Adverse effects</title><p>No reports exist of serious adverse effects in any of the previous human studies with the 1-g resveratrol treatment, including a recent study from our group where we used a similar dosage of resveratrol in diabetic participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Nevertheless, any adverse event during the study will be recorded. If the adverse effect is serious enough to require medical attention, it will be reported as soon as possible, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will make a decision on whether or not blinding should be removed and whether the patient should be excluded from the study. In the case of a fatal or severe event requiring hospital admission, reporting should occur on the same day to the principal investigator. For any adverse effect in its early stages (before any link with the intervention is established) necessary treatment will be given. The DSMB will be responsible for studying each case individually to verify a possible link to study products. The principal investigator will be responsible for managing the adverse effects clinically. Necessary services will be provided free of charge. If any unexpected serious or fatal adverse effect occurred that is believed to be due to the consumption of resveratrol, the trial will be terminated. The decision will be made by the DSMB.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Data quality control and management</title><p>All staff members who will collect and handle the data are well trained for managing clinical data. Adequate attention will be given to collect accurate and valid data and set up a regular monitoring scheme by qualified staff. Original hard copies of patient records will be kept at the recruitment center, a copy will be sent to the research deputy of BPUMS, and the data will be available only to designated researchers involved in the trial. All patient documents that are sent or received will be stored after taking into consideration safety and security issues.</p><p>Necessary schemes will be set up to control the quality of drug delivery, storage and handling, clinical examinations, and laboratory tests.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Physical examination</title><p>Anthropometric parameters and clinical characteristics of the participants, including age, sex, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) will be measured. The participants will also be asked to fill out a standard questionnaire form (developed by the United States Department of Agriculture) regarding their typical food intake, including the amount of salt, alcohol, green tea, coffee, grapes, peanuts, wine, berries, and lifestyle (exercise, smoking, sleeping habits, and rest) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In addition, the amount of vitamins and other micronutrients supplemented to the diet will be included. At baseline, the patients will be asked to fast (10-hour to 12-hour overnight fast) for blood collection. The blood samples will be collected before the first stage of the study, after the 1-month intervention, after the 1-month washout, and at the end of the study. Then, the serum will be separated and given a code number and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C until analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis, defined as all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication. Patients with no data recorded for a parameter will be excluded from the analysis of that particular parameter. The statistician will remain blinded to the status of the patients with regard to the intervention. Data will be analyzed stratified by prehypertension or stage 1-hypertension groups.</p><p>Final analyses will be conducted after the trial is finished or a decision has been made to stop the trial by scientific steering committee, which may occur after the interim analysis if the members are satisfied with the strength of the evidence.</p><p>Because of a relatively long washout period, we do not expect a significant carryover effect. However, we will check for a carryover effect by using a two-group independent <italic>t</italic> test to compare the average effects of outcomes for the two sequences. Treatment, sequence, and period effects will be estimated by using an analysis of variance model for all outcome variables. Baseline values of outcome variables as well as potential confounding factors will be controlled by using repeated measure analysis of variance models. Appropriate post-hoc analysis using Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons will be performed.</p><p>Data will be analyzed by using the pk crossover menu of Stat/SE 11.0 statistical software.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Discussion</title><p>The increasing need for alternative strategies for controlling hypertension can be addressed by identifying promising nutraceutical candidates. In this regard, resveratrol has demonstrated great potential in preventing and/or reversing cardiovascular diseases including hypertension in preclinical studies. Recent meta-analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] that reviewed successful clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] concluded that resveratrol may be considered as an adjuvant therapeutic candidate for managing type 2 diabetes. In light of these promising clinical findings and previously reported preclinical evidence, resveratrol appears to be a potential antihypertensive agent. The efficacy of resveratrol has yet to be clinically investigated in patients with hypertension. This trial will be the first study to investigate the potential of therapeutic use of resveratrol for the management of BP in patients diagnosed with prehypertension and type 1 hypertension. The outcomes from this study will help to determine the efficacy of short-term resveratrol treatment in hypertensive patients and bridge the gap with regards to the current preclinical and clinical evidence. This study will also help in collecting further information with regard to identifying a therapeutically effective dose of resveratrol in controlling cardiovascular disease risk factors. Importantly, if a positive outcome is identified, it will provide us with an effective therapeutic strategy to combat hypertension and would pave the way for achieving enormous public health benefit.</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Study limitations</title><p>This trial is designed as a pilot study to investigate the efficacy of resveratrol as a blood-pressure-lowering agent in a specific population. In addition, the trial has a small sample size. Hypertension is a condition that requires long-term medication. Because the trial duration is only 4&#x000a0;weeks, longer-term studies need to be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of resveratrol as a sustained treatment option. In this study, participants will receive daily only a single, high dose of resveratrol, which will be taken twice throughout the study (a high dose that is well tolerated). Further trials may be needed to ascertain whether resveratrol can lower BP at a much lower daily dose. Another limitation is that a pharmacokinetics study will not be done in this trial to understand the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of resveratrol in hypertensive patients; pharmacokinetics may have helped to draw a correlation between the plasma bioavailability and the actual physiological effect. In this trial, stage 1-hypertensive patients will be on standard therapy for hypertension as well; therefore, it may not be possible to understand the standalone efficacy of resveratrol in lowering BP in these patients. Extensive toxicological analysis will also not be conducted as part of this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment is in progress.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ALP, alkaline phosphatase; Ang, angiotensin; BMI, body mass index; BP, blood pressure; BUN, blood urea nitrogen; DSMB, Data and Safety Monitoring Board; GGT, gamma-glutamyl transferase; HCT, hematocrit; HDL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; LDL, low-density lipoprotein; LFT, liver function test; NO, nitric oxide; PLT, platelet; PT, prothrombin time; PTT, partial thromboplastin time; RLT, renal function test; SHR, spontaneously hypertensive rat; TG, triglyceride; TNF-&#x003b1;, tumor necrosis factor- &#x003b1;</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec22"><title>Appendix&#x000a0;1</title><sec id="Sec23"><title>Informed consent</title><p>The informed consent process and form will consist of the following points:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The patients will be informed that they are participating in a clinical trial that assesses the effectiveness of oral resveratrol in prehypertension and stage 1 hypertension.
