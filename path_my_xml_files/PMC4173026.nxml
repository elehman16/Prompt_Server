Iron deficiency adversely affects the physiology of thyroid. The initial steps of thyroid hormone synthesis are catalyzed by thyroperoxidases and are dependent on iron.

The causes of goiter in children and adults are similar, but their relative frequency varies substantially. In the United States, for example, most children with a goiter have chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, whereas among adults, nontoxic nodular goiters predominate (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>Euthyroid goiter is a condition with normal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone in the setting of normal total or free thyroxin (T4) concentration in serum (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>Iron deficiency adversely affects the physiology of thyroid and supplementation of iron may improve the efficacy of oral iodized oil in goitrous children with iron-deficiency anemia (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Iron status also affects thyroid metabolism and iodine deficiency disorders (IDD).The initial steps of thyroid hormone synthesis are catalyzed by thyroperoxidases and are depended on iron. In addition, iron deficiency may alter central nervous system control of thyroid metabolism (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) and modify nuclear triiodo thyronine binding (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). </p><p>Iron-deficiency anemia decreases plasma concentrations of thyroxine and triiodo thyronine, while reducing the peripheral conversion of thyroxine to triiodo thyronine, and increases circulating concentrations of thyrotropin (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p> In goitrous children, the therapeutic response to orally given iodized oil is lower in children with iron deficiency anemia compare to iron-sufficient children (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In addition, in an open, uncontrolled trial, iron treatment of goitrous children with iron deficiency anemia improved their response to orally given iodized oil (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). </p><p>Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether iron treatment would decrease the grade of goiter in children with euthyroid goiter without anemia and iron deficiency or not.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>
<bold>In order to compare the effectiveness of iron </bold>supplementation or placebos for euthyroid goiter, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial on 40 patients with euthyroid goiter without iron-deficiency anemia.</p><p>Random sampling was performed to complete the sample size, Taking sample size at 95% and 80% test power, and considering 60% reduction in goiter size in case group and 20% in the control group.
