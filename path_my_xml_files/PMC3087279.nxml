Informed written consent was taken from parents of each patient. Patients suffering from cardiac abnormalities, neuromuscular disease, pulmonary abnormalities (e.g. asthma), abnormal airway anatomy, any condition with increased risk of regurgitation of gastric contents and prolonged surgeries (&#x0003e;3 hr) were excluded.</p><p>Before surgery all patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups:</p><p><bold>Group A</bold> included three groups of 20 patients each, unpremedicated, who received propofol in doses of 3mg kg <sup>-1</sup> (Gr A1), 4mg kg <sup>-1</sup> (Gr A2) and 5 mg kg <sup>-1</sup> (Gr A3) respectively.</p><p><bold>Group B</bold> included three groups of 20 patients each, premedicated with midazolam (0.05 mg kg) <sup>-1</sup> and received propofol in doses of 3 mg kg <sup>-1</sup> , (Gr B1), 4 mg kg <sup>-1</sup> (Gr B2) and 5 mg kg <sup>-1</sup> (Gr B3) respectively.</p><p>In the operating room, intravenous access was established and, monitors like pulse oximeter, electrocardiogram, EtCO2 and non-invasive blood pressure were applied. In group B, i.v. midazolam (0.05 mg kg <sup>-1</sup>) was given 10 min before propofol induction. Midazolam has an onset of action of less than 15 minutes. It was assumed that the onset of action of midazolam should have initiated at the time of propofol induction. Injection lignocaine 10 mg was added to each 100 mg propofol. Intravenous propofol was administered over a period of 15 sec, following which lungs were ventilated with 100% oxygen for 60 sec before attempting insertion of LMA. Insertion of LMA was performed by the same grade of people in all the six groups under study.</p><p>Observation of mean arterial pressure and heart rate was done before insertion, just after insertion, at 5 and 10 minutes post insertion. All patients were also assessed for following adverse events-:</p><p>

</p><p>For analysis of data, chi-square test and for parametric data including multiple comparisons Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was performed. The present study was conducted as a pilot study, the duration of study was one year only and to get the unbiased results, the demographic matching was necessary. Hence, a sample size of 120 patients to get the preliminary trends was found to be feasible.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Patients undergoing surgery were randomly allocated to different subgroups.

Premedication with midazolam reduces the dose of propofol from 5mg kg <sup>-1</sup> to 4mg kg <sup>-1</sup> with even more successful insertion of LMA in 90% of children. The occurrence of adverse events during LMA placement like inadequate jaw relaxation, limb movements, gagging and coughing were higher in subgroups of A (propofol) as compared to their respective subgroups of B (midazolam + propofol). The incidence of adverse events decreased with increase in propofol dose and this trend was seen in both the groups. Brown et. al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> have suggested propofol as a better induction agent due to decreased incidence of coughing and gagging with propofol than thiopentone as it has a greater depressant effect on airway reflexes than thiopentone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> Effective dose of propofol in midazolam premedicated group was significantly less than propofol alone group. ED50 and ED90 of unpremedicated children were 3.8mg kg <sup>-1</sup> and 5.4mg kg <sup>-1</sup> respectively and those of premedicated children were 2.6mg kg <sup>-1</sup> and 3.6mg kg <sup>-1</sup> respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>. The difference in effective doses between premedicated and unpremedicated children was highly significant (p&#x0003c;0.001). Coughing, gagging and laryngospasm may occur when depth of anesthesia is too light i.e. if lower doses of propofol are used<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>.</p><p>Increased induction requirements for propofol in children may be due to large central volume of distribution of drug<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> and a greater cardiac output per kilogram body weight, which should result in lower peak concentration of propofol in blood, perfusing the brain after bolus injection. Synergistic actions of midazolam and propofol found in the present study are also supported by Short and Chiu<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> where they suggested that the dose of propofol required to produce anaesthesia was reduced by 52% in the presence of midazolam (p&#x0003c;0.01) and the coefficient of synergism being 0.78. ED50 of propofol was reduced from 1.93 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> to 0.93 mg kg <sup>-1</sup> with the addition of midazolam 0.13 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> . They postulated a role of CNS GABAA receptors in medieating sedation caused by propofol and midazolam. Midazolam was used as it does not enhance airway reactivity and has a shorter elimination half life (1-4 min).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></p><table-wrap id="T5" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Comparison of Mean arterial pressure (mm Hg) and heart Rate (HR/ min)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-26-503-g005"/></table-wrap><p>Several investigators have commented on minimal haemodynamic changes. Interestingly, Martlew <italic>et al</italic>. 1996 did not observe any difference in cardiorespiratory side effects between low and high dose of propofol, unlike our present study. Short and Chui, 1991 observed in their study that there was a decrease in systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure when propofol was used alone or along with midazolam group (p&#x0003c;0.01), but there was no correlation between increasing dose and magnitude of change in arterial pressure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>. When they compared the changes in arterial pressure produced by propofol with propofol-midazolam combination for anaesthesia, there was no difference between the two treatments. The current study also shows no significant change in MAP &#x00026; HR after induction between two groups except in group B3 (5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> dose) where there was significant decrease in MAP and HR than in the propofol alone group. Our findings correlates with the observations of Goyagi <italic>et al</italic>. who found a significant decrease before insertion (after propofol induction with 1.95-2.6 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> ) in diastolic blood pressure (DBP), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and HR from preinduction values. After insertion, a significant increase was seen in SBP and HR (p&#x0003c;0.05), but increase in DBP was not statistically significant. At 5 minutes, all the values (SBP and DBP) decreased significantly from preinduction values may be due to deepening of anesthesia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>. The inference that can be drawn from the present data is that addition of midazolam as a premedication provides more haemodynamic stability than propofol alone during LMA placement. Both 5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> and 4 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> propofol are found to be effective in propofol-midazolam group for LMA insertion. Since the fall in MAP is found to be significantly more after induction within the group and between the groups with 5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> of propofol, we can infer that 4 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> is optimum dose of propofol with midazolam premedication for LMA insertion.</p><p>It may be concluded that midazolam premedication by reduces the dose of propofol and provides a better condition for placement of LMA in children without causing significant hemodynamic instability.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brain</surname><given-names>AIJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The laryngeal mask &#x02013; a new concept in airway management</article-title><source>Br.
