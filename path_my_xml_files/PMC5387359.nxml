Currently, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate its efficacy on gait improvement, upper limb and lower limb functional improvement, global motor function and cognitive improvement. A recent Cochrane review confirmed that published studies on virtual reality (VR) training have the limitations of lack of powered sample size, did not evaluate the benefits over a long-term period and lacked trial quality on cognitive function. Another systematic review also concluded that the evidence for the use of VR in gait and balance improvement is limited.

Stroke survivors often have an abnormal hemiparetic gait pattern that is characterised by decreased gait speed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], altered kinematics of hip, knee and ankle joints during a gait cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and functional impairment of lower and upper extremities. Impaired ability to walk is one of the most devastating consequences and gait recovery is often regarded as a primary objective in stroke rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It is becoming widely recognised that multisensory VR training is an important component of stroke rehabilitation and one that has demonstrated potential to promote gait, lower and upper limb functional recovery, and thus increase quality of life.</p><p>Virtual reality (VR) has been subjected to intense research over the past decade as an intervention to promote functional recovery for patients with stroke. The virtual environment offers multisensory interaction and goal-orientated tasks that can stimulate active repetitive movements and offer instant feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. VR is relatively low cost and may be employed within home settings where patients live remotely or have other barriers to participate in intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The concept of using commercial gaming (CG) systems to deliver VR interventions at home as part of the rehabilitation programme was well received among stroke survivors as they believed it to be beneficial for functional recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Previous studies on VR interventions indicated that they may be more effective in improving gait, lower limb functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and upper limb functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] when compared to conventional therapy. Functional imaging studies have indicated that cortical reorganisation is associated with gait improvement post-VR interventions. The latest published meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] suggested that VR interventions are at least as effective as conventional physiotherapy in improving lower limb outcomes within the stroke population.</p><p>Gait performance is a predictor for disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], mortality and morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Early intervention with physical therapy to restore gait function had been shown to improve motor function and decrease the subsequent disability when compared to intervention provided at the subacute or chronic stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Despite the reported positive results for VR interventions, published systematic reviews concluded that the evidence for VR in gait, lower limb functions and balance improvement is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], particularly for stroke patients during the acute stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It was argued that since most of the neuroplasticity activity took place within the first month of stroke occurrence, VR intervention provided during the acute stage of stroke is likely to lead to better clinical outcomes for gait and lower limb functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] also concluded that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the efficacy of VR training on gait speed and global motor function improvement due to a lack of powered sample size and did not evaluate the effectiveness of VR over a long-term period or post hospital discharge. Thus, little is currently known about the impact of VR on gait and lower limb functions during the acute stage and if the impact is sustainable in the long term.</p><p>The recovery of upper limb function to perform delicate motions, such as grasping, finger pinching and individual finger movement continues to be a challenge for stroke survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Existing rehabilitation programmes, such as constrain-induced therapy, imagery training and bilateral training, have focussed on the improvement of upper limb gross motor skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. These training regimes have insufficient emphasis on fine motor skills and coordination of limb movements; thus, leading to reduced ability to carry out activities of daily living. Sophisticated robotic devices have been developed to provide the possibility to train hand and finger motor skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, these types of devices are not easily accessible in most rehabilitation departments. In addition, fine motor movement involves the combination of cognitive and motor functions to plan and execute it. Cognitive function refers to the ability to process received information, and to take appropriate action accordingly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Large numbers of stroke survivors have cognitive impairment which presents an additional challenge in upper limb functional recovery. Previous studies have indicated that cognitive function can be recovered through repetitious training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Two Cochrane reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] suggest that VR interventions appear to be promising with moderate-quality evidence to support the beneficial effects on upper limb functional improvement. However, the number of studies available are too few and too small to draw conclusions on upper limb recovery and cognitive function improvements induced by VR interventions. In addition, most of the studies assessed gross motor function by functional outcome measures such as the Action Research Arm Test and the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery. While they are validated clinical tests, several authors cast doubts on the use of functional outcomes to study motor recovery post stroke. It was argued that functional outcome measures only focussed on task accomplishment regardless of the quality of movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Since motor compensation can affect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] task accomplishment, it is, therefore, essential to understand the impact of VR on motor performance measures and to cross reference with functional outcome measures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Hypotheses</title><p>The primary aim of this study is to test the hypotheses that patients with stroke who receive VR training during the acute stage will have significantly higher improvement in gait speed, lower limb motor functions and upper limb gross and fine motor functions when compared to those who receive conventional therapy. The observed improvements in the VR group will remain significantly higher than the conventional therapy group at 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-up periods. The secondary aim of this study is to assess the changes of the kinematic characteristics of gait and upper limb motions of &#x02018;reach forward&#x02019; and &#x02018;reach forward and grasp&#x02019; after 3&#x000a0;weeks of VR interventions and at 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-up periods.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>This study is a single-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT) to compare the differences between two parallel groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study setting</title><p>This is a single-centre study which will be conducted by the Rehabilitation Department of the Sun Yat-sen University, China.

Therapeutic programmes include lower limb strengthening exercises and traditional gait and balance training, upper limb functional training and activities of daily living practice. The rehabilitation programme will be provided for 5&#x000a0;days a week for 3&#x000a0;weeks, with each therapy session lasting for 1&#x000a0;h (total of 2&#x000a0;h).</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Intervention group</title><p>The intervention group will participate in a multisensory VR training programme for 5&#x000a0;days a week for 3&#x000a0;weeks. VR training is provided in addition to the routine programme. It consists of four components: gait training, limb coordination, gross motor function and fine motor function.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Gait training</title><p>Gait training will be provided through the use of the GaitWatch system (JumHo, China). The system requires the use of seven transmitters strapped to the following points: the lumbar spine at the L4/L5 level, the mid-portion of the femur, the tibial tuberosity and the mid-foot region (on both legs). Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows the GaitWatch system and the locations of the transmitters (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref>). GaitWatch provides a gait training programme with bespoke gaming activities, which include marching on the spot, lifting hips and knees to required position or walking in a virtual environment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c, d</xref>). Real-time feedback on the quality of movement will be provided to the participants. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows the GaitWatch system and the locations of the transmitters. Training sessions will last up to 20&#x000a0;min (excluding a 5-min break at the halfway mark). The system will produce a report on gait speed, maximum joint angle achieved, weight distribution and percentage of deviation from expected motion trajectory.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>GaitWatch system. <bold>a</bold> GaitWatch hardware. <bold>b</bold> Sensor position. <bold>c</bold> Real-time feedback displayed on the screen. <bold>d</bold> Walking tasks participants will be asked to complete</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_1874_Fig5_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Limb coordination and gross upper limb motor function</title><p>Limb coordination and gross motor function will be trained through use of the Microsoft Xbox 360 Kinect via the games Adventures and Fruit Ninja. Participants will be asked to perform tasks that are displayed on the screen at progressive difficulties. The Adventures game will encourage balance, mobility and stepping. Fruit Ninja will encourage shoulder flexion/extension and internal/external rotation and elbow flexion and extension. Body motion is captured by the associated motion-capturing device. A body-weight support harness will be provided to those who are not able to stand for a sufficient length of time (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The score achieved during the virtual game will be recorded to monitor progress. Each training programme will last for 10&#x000a0;min (total of 20&#x000a0;min training time in addition to a 5-min break), 5&#x000a0;days a week for 3&#x000a0;weeks.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>A body-weight support harness will be provided to those who are not able to stand for a sufficient length of time</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_1874_Fig6_HTML" id="MO6"/></fig>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Fine motor function</title><p>The fine motor function of the upper limbs will be trained using the HandTutor&#x02122; glove (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) with MediTutor software (Meditouch Ltd., Rotem Industrial Park, MP Arava, Israel). The device delivers training via bespoke games. The gloves capture the biomechanical motions of the fingers and wrists. Exercises can be tailored to train all fingers or isolated finger movements. Real-time feedback of quality of movement is displayed on the screen. The previously published exercise programme &#x02018;Track&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] will be used as the exercise for this study. &#x02018;Track&#x02019; is a programme where a ball moves along a track horizontally across the screen at varying heights. The movement of the ball is controlled by flexion and extension of the finger/s or wrist. The participant&#x02019;s task is to keep the ball within the track by flexing and extending the finger/s or wrist, which changes the upward and downward gradients of the ball. The therapist can set the participant&#x02019;s range of motion that will be exercised by changing the height of the track. The maximum range of movement represents the full vertical displacement of the ball on the screen. The measurement is a linear measurement and treats the fingers as a single joint. Fine motor training will last for 20&#x000a0;min (with a 5-min break every 6&#x000a0;min), 5&#x000a0;days a week for 3&#x000a0;weeks.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>HandTutor&#x000ae; glove for fine motor training</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_1874_Fig7_HTML" id="MO7"/></fig>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Safety and adverse event reporting</title><p>The participants recruited into this study are patients with acute stroke with a likelihood of morbidity and mortality. Procedures are, therefore, in place to minimise adverse events. The risk relating to the intervention is minimised as patients who are medically unstable will be excluded from the study. Participants will not be asked to exercise beyond their physical ability. The exercise sessions will be delivered by trained physiotherapists/occupational therapists who will work closely with the inpatient clinical team, and they will have regular contact and access to the inpatient clinical team for any queries that may arise. The trial will adhere to the following safety reporting procedures:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>All serious adverse events (SAEs) related to the interventions will be recorded on an SAEs Event Report Form in accordance with local hospital procedure. A SAE is defined as an event that may harm the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening situation, impairment of a body function, permanent damage to a body structure, and prolonged hospitalisation</p></list-item><list-item><p>All SAEs related to the interventions must be reported to the principle investigator within 24&#x000a0;h of learning of the event</p></list-item><list-item><p>SAEs that are related to the interventions will be reported to the special committee of the University Clinical Trial Unit and Research Ethics Committee within 15&#x000a0;days of the principle Investigator becoming aware of the event. Information that will be reported to relevant parties is: (1) appropriate identifying information for the research protocol, (2) a detailed description of the SAE and its outcome, (3) a description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have taken, or are proposed in response to the SAE</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Data management</title><p>A bespoke data management system was developed by Rilintech Co., Ltd. (Beijing,China) for data storage. The assessment session and data entry are always conducted with at least two assessors to minimise data entry error. Monitoring of study conduct and data collection will be performed by a special committee of the University Clinical Trial Unit on a biannual basis. Recorded data are only accessible by authorised personnel.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the demographic data of each sample group. The normality of each parameter will be checked by histogram and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.</p><p>Chi-squared tests will be used to assess sample characteristics of gender and types of cerebral infarction.</p><p>The pre- and post-intervention differences in gait speed within individuals and between groups will be assessed by paired-samples <italic>t</italic> tests (two-tailed) and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), respectively. The comparison of 3-month, 6-month and 1-year follow-ups will be assessed by repeated-measures ANOVA.</p><p>A broadly similar approach will be used to analyse the secondary outcome measures of muscle tone, other kinematic parameters of gait, reach forward motion and reach forward and grasp motion. The kinematic parameters of the paretic side will be compared with the nonparetic side at all recording points using paired-samples <italic>t</italic> tests.</p><p>The Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test will be used to test the between-group differences for the ordinal data obtained from the functional outcome measures and WHODAS 2.0.</p><p>The differences between the two groups during the follow-up phase will be assessed by the Kaplan-Meier test.</p><p>There are no planned interim analyses or stopping rules, as the power calculation has accounted for loss to follow-up. All analyses will initially be performed on an intention-to-treat basis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The VR intervention works on the principle of neuroplasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Studies from the past decade suggest that different types of VR can increase gait speed, lower and upper limb functions and kinematic parameters. There are a number of clinical guidelines which recommend active rehabilitation to be commenced within 24 to 48&#x000a0;h of stroke occurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] as the greatest part of the recovery was reported to take place in the first month following stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. There is some evidence to demonstrate the benefit of an early exercise programme on functional recovery but evidence for early VR intervention is lacking. The majority of the published studies focussed on patients with subacute and chronic stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Thus, this study will provide evidence for the use of VR as part of an early intervention programme.</p><p>The present study also assesses the medium- to long-term impact of VR interventions for patients with stroke during the acute stage. The Cochrane reviews published in 2011 and 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] both concluded that it was unknown whether the effects of VR were sustained in the longer term. The review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] found that only one study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] out of the 37 included studies had measured the effects of VR on upper limb functions at the 6-month follow-up. Motor capacities evolve most strongly over the first month post stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and intervention provided at an early stage has better clinical outcomes when compared to intervention provided at a later stage of stroke. Thus, the follow-up data record at 3, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months post intervention will increase the understanding of whether early VR intervention is superior to conventional therapy in the longer term.</p><p>The kinematic data of gait and upper limb motion will help to establish if functional improvement induced by early VR intervention is associated with changes of kinematic patterns. Buma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] proposed that the desired outcome of stroke rehabilitation was to promote task completion in a manner that is close to normal movement pattern. Detailed kinematic information would enable the identification of potential compensation movement. Nonbiomechanical outcome measures had in the past misled clinicians to believe that a faster observed speed of reach forward movement execution may improve movement quality as appreciated by the smoothness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. However, recent biomechanical study has revealed that the faster execution speed observed in patients with stroke was related to trunk compensation movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. A kinematic study is, therefore, essential to assess whether VR intervention is effective in promoting normal movement patterns as well as functional improvement.</p><p>In conclusion, this current research is set to provide information to demonstrate the clinical effectiveness of VR as part of an early intervention programme for patients with stroke.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruiting since May 2015.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec26"><title>Additional file</title><p>
