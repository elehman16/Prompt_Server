Further, there were no recommended criteria to guide rehabilitation assessment decisions. Subsequently, a decision-making tool called the Assessment for Rehabilitation Tool (ART) was developed. The ART was designed to assist Australian hospital clinicians to identify the rehabilitation needs of patients with stroke using evidence-based criteria. The ART was released and made freely available for use in 2012. This study evaluated the effectiveness of an education-only intervention (1 onsite education session and distribution of the ART) and a multifaceted intervention (2 or more onsite education sessions, distribution of the ART, audit and feedback, barrier identification, site-specific strategy development, promotion of interdisciplinary teamwork, opinion leaders and reminders) for improving assessments of rehabilitation needs after stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Ten hospitals in 2 states of Australia were randomly assigned to an education-only or a multifaceted intervention. Medical records were audited by assessors blinded to group allocation before and after the implementation period. Difference in the proportion of patients assessed for rehabilitation before and after the intervention was analysed using mixed-effects logistic regression analysis, with time period as the dependent variable, an interaction between intervention type and time included to test for differences between the interventions, and hospital included as the random effect to account for patient clustering.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Data from 586 patients (284 pre-intervention; 302 post-intervention; age 76&#x000a0;years, 59&#x000a0;% male) showed that the multifaceted intervention was not more effective than education-only in improving the proportion of patients whose rehabilitation needs were assessed (reference category education-only; odds ratio 1.29, 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval 0.63&#x02013;2.67, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.483). Post-intervention, the odds of a patient&#x02019;s rehabilitation needs being assessed was 3.69 times greater than pre-intervention (95&#x000a0;% confidence interval 2.57&#x02013;5.30, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001).

Rehabilitation after stroke reduces death and disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Rehabilitation needs after stroke will not always be identified without a specific assessment for rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Accordingly, Australian clinical guidelines include a recommendation that every patient with stroke, who is not receiving palliative care, should be assessed for the need for further rehabilitation before leaving hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, in 2011 and 2013, less than half of the patients with stroke in Australian hospitals were assessed for ongoing rehabilitation needs [National Stroke Foundation, unpublished data].</p><p id="Par10">In the immediate post-stroke phase, stroke unit care leads to better patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. One of the defining features of a stroke unit is coordinated care provided by a multidisciplinary team (medical, nursing and allied health professionals) with expertise in stroke. In many developed countries (for example the UK, USA, and Australia) the median length of stay in the acute hospital after stroke is less than 7&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, a referral to a rehabilitation service is required if a person with stroke requires rehabilitation beyond this time. Rehabilitation can be provided in a person&#x02019;s home, in the community or in inpatient settings.</p><p id="Par11">Published information is lacking about the criteria used by hospital clinicians to determine the rehabilitation needs of patients with stroke. Patients with severe stroke in Australia are not always referred for ongoing rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Similarly, patients with mild stroke tend not to be referred to rehabilitation services despite frequently experiencing ongoing difficulties with community mobility, return to leisure and work activities, or having altered cognition or mood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It is important that staff working with patients with stroke accurately and consistently assess patients&#x02019; rehabilitation needs in order to identify patients who require referrals to rehabilitation services.</p><p id="Par12">Data are collected in acute Australian hospitals biennially to audit the delivery of best practice stroke care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Medical records of patients with stroke are audited by hospital clinicians, and site-specific and national reports are prepared by the National Stroke Foundation. One question included in the audit is whether the patient had a formal assessment for inpatient rehabilitation. To address concerns regarding the low proportions of patients assessed for rehabilitation, and variability in rehabilitation assessment and referral processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the Australian Stroke Coalition (an alliance of organisations and groups working in the stroke field) developed the Assessment for Rehabilitation Pathway and Decision-Making Tool (ART) in 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The ART was developed collaboratively by a multidisciplinary working group and consultation with stakeholders following a systematic review of the literature. The ART was designed to help health professionals make objective decisions regarding the ongoing rehabilitation needs of every patient with stroke admitted to hospital. Based on the best available evidence, the default position of the ART was that every patient with stroke would benefit from rehabilitation unless one of four pragmatic exclusion criteria is met: the patient makes a full recovery; refuses rehabilitation; is persistently non-responsive; or is receiving palliative care. Every person with stroke who does not meet the ART exception criteria should be referred to a rehabilitation service to determine whether the patient&#x02019;s rehabilitation needs can be met. In this way, use of the ART could help to quantify unmet rehabilitation needs of patients with stroke.</p><p id="Par13">The ART was piloted in 2011 in six Australian states. The process of developing the ART (literature review, involvement of key stakeholder groups) ensured its content validity. During the pilot testing phase, the ART was found to have good face validity by different professional groups and utility in terms of usability, time to complete and ease of interpretation. Barriers to use of the ART identified during the pilot trial were the time required to complete, changes required to local systems and procedures and the finite availability of rehabilitation services which were not anticipated to meet the rehabilitation needs (as defined by the ART) of patients with stroke in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Users from all pilot sites reported that training in the form of education and educational resources would be required for a national roll-out of the ART (S. Hillier, personal communication, April 2012)</p><p id="Par14">In December 2012, the final version of the ART was passively disseminated via email to stroke clinicians working in Australian hospitals and to Stroke Clinical Networks in all Australian states. Since then, the ART and related educational resources can be downloaded for free from the Australian Stroke Coalition website as part of the dissemination strategy (available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://australianstrokecoalition.com.au/projects/assessment-for-rehabilitation-pathway-and-decision-making-toolnual-and-decision-making-tool/">http://australianstrokecoalition.com.au/projects/assessment-for-rehabilitation-pathway-and-decision-making-toolnual-and-decision-making-tool/</ext-link>).</p><p id="Par15">Passive dissemination of a resource such as the ART does not ensure its use. Clinicians must first know about the resource, access the website, download and print copies of the ART and then determine how to use the ART in clinical practice. When clinicians are provided with printed educational materials, processes of care tend to improve slightly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Two systematic reviews have reported on direct comparisons of passive dissemination of printed educational materials (such as the ART) to strategies that include face-to-face education sessions. Both reviews provided evidence that the education sessions were more effective for changing health professionals&#x02019; behaviour than the passive techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Multifaceted interventions to change practice are interventions comprised of two or more components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A cluster randomised controlled trial conducted after the aforementioned systematic reviews were published, provided evidence that a multifaceted intervention was more effective than passive guideline dissemination alone for improving process of care and patient outcomes in Australian acute stroke units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, very little is known about the relative effectiveness of multifaceted interventions compared to education interventions (with or without printed educational materials), particularly when targeting multidisciplinary teams working in acute hospitals. The most recent Cochrane review regarding the effectiveness of onsite education interventions included 69 studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], but only five studies compared education interventions (with or without printed educational materials) to a multifaceted intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. None of these studies involved multidisciplinary teams within hospitals. No recent literature was identified which compared education to multifaceted interventions for professional behaviour change in any healthcare setting.</p><p id="Par17">This study was designed to investigate and compare two implementation interventions (education-only or a multifaceted intervention) for improving rehabilitation assessment practices for patients with stroke in Australian hospitals by acute hospital clinicians. Data from the national audit provided information on rehabilitation assessment practices in hospitals not participating in the trial. To avoid contamination, a cluster design was used, with the hospital as the unit of randomisation.</p><p id="Par18">The primary research question was</p><p id="Par19">Is a multifaceted intervention more effective than an education-only intervention for increasing the proportion of patients with stroke who are assessed for the need for rehabilitation by hospital clinicians?</p><p id="Par20">The secondary research question was</p><p id="Par21">Does an education-only or a multifaceted intervention ensure that recommended (ART) criteria are used when patients with stroke are assessed by acute hospital clinicians and reported to have no rehabilitation needs?</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par22">A cluster randomised trial design was used, with hospitals randomly allocated to receive either an education-only intervention or a multifaceted intervention. The outcome of interest was documentation of rehabilitation needs in the medical records of patients with stroke by a health professional providing ward-based care in the acute hospital. The trial registration number is ACTRN12616000340437.</p><p id="Par23">All hospitals in South Australia (SA) with organised stroke services were eligible to participate in the trial. Hospitals in other states of Australia with acute stroke units, admitting more than 100 patients with stroke were also eligible. An invitation to participate in a trial of the ART was sent by the Australian Stroke Coalition to hospital clinicians, administrators and stroke networks around Australia. In South Australia, senior hospital-based clinical staff were invited to participate in the trial by the South Australian Stroke Clinical Network.</p><p id="Par24">Recruited hospitals were stratified by state, region (metropolitan, regional) and the proportion of patients that had their rehabilitation needs assessed in the 2011 national audit. After stratification, hospitals were randomly assigned to receive either an education-only intervention or a multifaceted intervention. The randomisation schedule was generated by computer program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sealedenvelope.com/simple-randomiser/v1/lists">https://www.sealedenvelope.com/simple-randomiser/v1/lists</ext-link>) on 19/3/2013 by a third party, blind to the specific hospital list. Allocation was then undertaken by assigning the coded hospitals to the list based on the stratification.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>The implementation interventions</title><p id="Par25">A rolling recruitment and intervention delivery strategy was used, and the interventions were commenced at the different sites over a 14-month period (first site commenced April 2013; tenth site commenced June 2014). All interventions were delivered by author EL. The TIDieR checklist was used to guide reporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). All medical, allied health and senior nursing staff working on the acute stroke unit (metropolitan hospitals) or in the rehabilitation team (regional hospitals) were invited via email to participate in the interventions. Participation in the interventions was not mandated at any site.</p><p id="Par26">The education-only intervention consisted of a single onsite education session and distribution of printed copies of the ART and the ART user manual. Education sessions were conducted in rooms on or near the stroke unit or the rehabilitation departments at the regional hospitals. Participants (and EL who delivered the intervention) were seated, at most sites around a table. Information was provided verbally about why the ART was developed and how it was designed to be used. It was emphasised that while use of the ART might not change access to the currently available rehabilitation services, use of the ART would quantify whether there were sufficient rehabilitation services available to meet the needs of patients with stroke. Copies of the ART and the user manual were distributed, and participants were encouraged to ask questions. Information was provided regarding the online resources. As the trial progressed, participants reported strategies that improved rehabilitation assessment practices to the research team. This information was incorporated into the education sessions for all sites which participated in the interventions at later dates. Education sessions lasted between 30 and 60&#x000a0;min.</p><p id="Par27">The multifaceted intervention was developed using the implementation of change theoretical model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] which has been used extensively in the implementation of new guidelines and best practices and procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

</p><p id="Par28">The multifaceted intervention was spaced over 1 to 2&#x000a0;weeks and included two onsite education sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and distribution of the ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Opinion leaders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and reminders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] have been shown to increase the effectiveness of education interventions, so these strategies were incorporated into the intervention. Audit and feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] was included to provide information to participants about their site&#x02019;s performance. A barrier identification and local strategy development session [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] was facilitated by author EL. Interdisciplinary team work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and development of time-efficient systems and procedures were promoted during the strategy development discussions.</p><p id="Par29">The second education sessions and other strategies involved in the multifaceted intervention occurred approximately 1&#x000a0;week after the first education session. Education sessions were co-presented by a member of the local Stroke Clinical Network. Site-specific feedback from the pre-intervention medical record audit was provided as part of the second education session, which lasted between 30 and 60&#x000a0;min. Feedback was presented verbally and in writing by author EL regarding proportions of patients assessed for rehabilitation, details of people who conducted the assessments and demographic and stroke details of patients who were not assessed.</p><p id="Par30">A 1-h workshop was held in the same week as the second education session to identify barriers and develop local strategies to support use of the ART. Workshop participants were asked to brainstorm factors that might make using the ART with every patient difficult, and these barriers were written onto a whiteboard or butcher&#x02019;s paper. When participants and the facilitator were satisfied that all potential barriers had been listed, each participant wrote on a piece of paper the three most important barriers to address during the strategy development session. Responses were tallied to identify the most commonly nominated barriers. The rest of the session (approximately 30&#x000a0;min) was dedicated to developing strategies to address these barriers. The facilitator encouraged development of strategies wherein responsibility was shared by more than one member of the team (in line with recommendations from the ART pilot trial) and strategies which reduced redundancy of paperwork.</p><p id="Par31">Site champions volunteered or were nominated by other participants to assume primary responsibility for executing the implementation plan, with support from other team members. Reminders in the form of audit feedback, workshop minutes and action plans were sent to all participants.

</p><p id="Par32">At the conclusion of the onsite intervention session(s), participants were asked as a group to use the ART with every patient with stroke; this entailed the team documenting the patient&#x02019;s current level of function on each of the 14 domains and referring all patients to a rehabilitation service unless they met the ART exception criteria. A 4-month implementation period was selected for all sites to execute their chosen strategies for implementing the ART and improving rehabilitation assessment practices.

Both people independently audited the medical records of 32 patients. Inter-rater reliability of the main outcome (assessment for rehabilitation by hospital clinician) was excellent with <italic>k</italic> value of 0.87 (agreement 94&#x000a0;%).

Patients in the post-intervention cohort were discharged from hospital consecutively from a set date 4&#x000a0;months after the last onsite intervention session. Data were collected regarding admitting hospital, patient age, gender, pre-stroke living status (community or residential care, home alone or with others), stroke severity on admission (National Institute of Health Stroke Severity Scale), stroke type (Oxfordshire Stroke Classification) and discharge destination. A minimum of 32 and maximum of 45 medical records were audited at each metropolitan site at the two time points. Fewer medical records were available at the regional hospitals, so all available medical records that were identified within the pre-specified time-frame were included in the audit.</p><p id="Par35">The primary outcome was whether a patient&#x02019;s rehabilitation needs were assessed by a health professional providing ward-based care; this was defined as documentation regarding the patients&#x02019; suitability for rehabilitation, rehabilitation requirements or potential to improve with further therapy or rehabilitation. Assessment details were collected and included the discipline of the person who conducted the assessment and whether rehabilitation was recommended. When rehabilitation was not recommended, the reason given by the assessor(s) was recorded.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par50">The main aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of two implementation interventions for improving rehabilitation assessment practices by health professionals working with patients with stroke. This study is the first to our knowledge that has been used to compare the relative effectiveness of an education-only intervention to a multifaceted intervention for healthcare teams working in hospital settings. The intervention received did not significantly affect the proportion of patients who had their rehabilitation needs assessed. However, both the education intervention and the multifaceted intervention appeared to influence clinical practice; the proportion of patients assessed by hospital clinicians in the overall sample increased by 28&#x000a0;%. In contrast, the proportion of patients assessed for rehabilitation improved in Australian hospitals not involved in the trial by 4&#x000a0;% following the release of the ART (from 45&#x000a0;% in 2011 to 49&#x000a0;% in 2013) [National Stroke Foundation, unpublished data]. Therefore, although a control group was not included in the study, the two implementation interventions appeared to be more effective than passive dissemination of the ART resources alone. Our results compare favourably with median results of 6&#x000a0;% that were reported in a systematic review regarding the effect of onsite education interventions on professional practice and health care outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">In previous research, multifaceted interventions in Australian acute stroke units were significantly more effective than guideline distribution alone for improving processes of care and outcomes for patients with stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. We hypothesised that a multifaceted intervention would be more effective than a single education-only intervention for improving proportions of patients who were assessed for rehabilitation. However, the addition of audit and feedback, tailored interventions, recruitment of site champions, reminders and interdisciplinary teamwork did not augment the effectiveness of the education intervention. While cost of the interventions was not formally evaluated, it is likely that a single education intervention would have important cost savings compared to the equally effective but more time-intensive multifaceted intervention.</p><p id="Par52">Audit and feedback is most effective when baseline performance is poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], whereas three of the sites assigned to the multifaceted intervention were audited at baseline as documenting rehabilitation assessments for a similar or greater proportion of patients than the national average. In line with recommendations, audit and feedback was provided verbally and in writing, and action plans were organised via the strategy development workshop (discussed below). However, due to pragmatics of the trial, some recommended audit and feedback practices could not be performed, such as the audit being conducted by a respected colleague rather than an external researcher, and being provided on more than one occasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par53">The tailored interventions were selected pragmatically by the participants according to their preferences, and mostly consisted of creating action plans to change rehabilitation assessment practices, creating or adapting documents to support these changes, and organising extra education sessions about the ART. Two sites which were assigned to the education-only intervention also reported using some of these same strategies. It could be considered that the format of the education sessions was a source of contamination between the groups, because information arising from early sites regarding use of the ART was incorporated into education sessions for all participating sites. The first site to initiate changes to the case conference document was a site which received the education-only intervention, and this strategy was subsequently discussed at other education sessions in the study and subsequently used at two sites assigned to the multifaceted intervention.</p><p id="Par54">Reminders are most likely to be successful at changing practice when they meet the specific need of the intended users and proactively prompt clinicians to perform certain behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Therefore, in the context of the current research, the reminders initiated by the research team (emails, phone calls or site visits) may not have prompted the participants to use the ART as these reminders were generally received at times when the participants were not providing patient care or attending case conference meetings. In contrast, the strategy developed at three hospitals (one education-only, two multifaceted intervention) of adding a check-box regarding a rehabilitation assessment recommendation to the case conference document was a form of participant-initiated reminders that prompted staff to discuss and document an assessment as part of the case conference discussion.</p><p id="Par55">Opinion leaders are people who through their interpersonal skills, leadership abilities and positioning within the communication structures of the workplace are able to influence change in workplace behaviours through informal methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. There was a participant at every site, whether assigned to receive the education-only or multifaceted intervention, who appeared to be an informal opinion leader (using informal observation methods during the intervention sessions and post-intervention evaluation sessions). In most cases, these clinicians appeared to support the use of the ART without further encouragement or support from the research team. Therefore, the intervention of formally recruiting a clinician as an ART champion or &#x02018;opinion leader&#x02019; may have been no more effective than the education-only intervention because the majority of the participating clinicians (and informal opinion leaders) by choosing to participate in the research trial were already motivated to improve clinical practice and were able to implement change successfully after being educated about the ART.</p><p id="Par56">Despite a significantly larger proportion of patients being assessed for rehabilitation in the post-intervention period, more than one quarter of patients included in the post-intervention medical record audit still did not have a documented rehabilitation assessment. Overall, neither intervention appeared to be effective in addressing <italic>how</italic> clinicians assessed or referred patients for rehabilitation because the majority of sites did not consistently recommend rehabilitation for all patients who did not meet the ART exception criteria. The factors that influenced whether participants changed the way they assessed patients&#x02019; rehabilitation needs and how they referred patients to rehabilitation were identified and described in a separate qualitative study embedded within this cluster randomised trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par57">It has been suggested that there may not be adequate rehabilitation resources in Australia to meet the needs of every patient with stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, unmet rehabilitation needs have not been identified in medical record audits of patients with stroke in Australian hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In earlier work, some participants in our study reported that the availability of rehabilitation services was a factor they considered when deciding whether to recommend ongoing rehabilitation for patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Participants at all sites expressed the opinion that there would not be enough rehabilitation resources to meet the requirements of all people who had rehabilitation needs identified through use of the ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This perceived shortage of rehabilitation service availability influenced participants at some sites not to refer all people with identified rehabilitation requirements to a rehabilitation service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. We argue that in order to better understand current rehabilitation requirements and ensure equity of access to rehabilitation after stroke, it is important that consistent criteria are used when assessing patients&#x02019; rehabilitation needs and when referring patients to rehabilitation services. Further work is required to achieve this standard for every patient with stroke in Australia.</p><p id="Par58">The strengths of this study were that a structured framework was used to guide the implementation intervention, the consort statement for cluster randomised trials was used to plan the design and to guide the reporting of the trial and the TIDIeR checklist was used to guide reporting of the interventions.</p><p id="Par59">A limitation to the study was that the implementation interventions had negligible reach with medical staff. Medical directors at every site provided consent that the trial could proceed, but medical staff providing ward-based care attended intervention sessions at only 3 of the 10 participating sites. Reasons were not sought when clinicians chose not to attend the intervention sessions. Medical staff have previously been reported to have low levels of engagement in quality improvement initiatives in Australian ASUs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. There is evidence that medical professionals respond differently from other health professionals to implementation interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Strategies specifically tailored to medical professionals may have enhanced participation of this group.</p><p id="Par60">Qualitative work conducted alongside this study indicated that participants&#x02019; relationships with patients, medical staff and rehabilitation service providers influenced whether they changed rehabilitation assessment and referral practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Recommendations for future work are that other key stakeholder groups (hospital administrators, rehabilitation service providers, healthcare consumers) are involved in the implementation program, to develop a shared understanding of the importance of using evidence-based criteria to assess patients&#x02019; rehabilitation needs. An integrated intervention, supported by multiple stakeholder groups, could lead to further improvements in rehabilitation assessment practices. This in turn would lead to better understand rehabilitation requirements for patients with stroke and facilitate the development of systems to ensure equitable access to rehabilitation services.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par61">This study has provided evidence that a single education-only intervention and provision of printed materials regarding the ART was as effective as a multifaceted implementation intervention for improving proportions of patients with stroke who had their rehabilitation needs assessed. Comparing these results to data from the national audit over the time frame in which the ART was released, the two implementation interventions appeared to be more effective than passive dissemination of the resources alone. Further work is required to ensure that the rehabilitation needs of all patients with stroke are assessed using evidence-based criteria to ensure accurate data are collected regarding the rehabilitation needs of people with stroke in Australia.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec12"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par69">
