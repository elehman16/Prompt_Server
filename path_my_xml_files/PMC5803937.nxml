Chronic nature, frequent relapses, absence of permanent cure, and the cosmetic disfigurement of psoriasis have a negative impact on quality of life (QoL) by causing psychological stress. Patients with psoriasis often have unambiguous ideas about the causes, controllability, consequences, and expected time-course of their disease.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Aim:</title><p>The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a video-assisted teaching program regarding psoriasis on the level of knowledge and relaxation therapy on QoL among patients with psoriasis.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Experimental design was adapted. One hundred and four participants diagnosed with psoriasis were randomly allocated either to an experimental or to a control group. Fifty-two participants were included in each group by simple random sampling. A video-assisted teaching program on psoriasis and relaxation exercises was taught to the participants over a period of 3 months. The tools used were: Psoriasis Knowledge Assessment Questionnaire, modified psoriasis disability index, and modified psoriasis life stress inventory.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Results:</title><p>In the experimental group, the knowledge score was increased significantly from 9 &#x000b1; 2.2 at baseline to 23.6 &#x000b1; 1.5 after the intervention. The disability score was decreased from 15.6 to 9.9 and the stress score related to the illness was decreased from 22.8 to 16.9 after the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="st5"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Educational intervention about disease process and relaxation exercises was effective in improving the knowledge and QoL of patients with psoriasis.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Knowledge</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>psoriasis</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>quality of life</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory hyperproliferative disease of the skin and currently affects approximately 0.6% to 4.8% of the world's population.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In India, the overall incidence of psoriasis has been reported to be 1.02%.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] In addition to the skin and joint manifestations, psoriasis impairs many aspects of individual well-being, including emotional, physical, sexual, and financial status.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Further, many of the difficulties experienced by patients with psoriasis make demands that outstrip the coping measures of patient and their family or social network. They need sufficient education and support from the health-care providers to manage their condition effectively.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a video-assisted teaching program regarding psoriasis on the level of knowledge and relaxation therapy on quality of life (QoL) among patients with psoriasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Before commencing the study, approval was obtained from Institute Ethics Committee for human studies of the institute, where the study was conducted. Participants signed the written informed consent after being explained about the study. Privacy was provided to the participants and confidentiality was maintained throughout the study. An experimental research design was used to select the sample of 104 participants diagnosed with psoriasis who attended the inpatient and outpatient units of the department of dermatology at a tertiary care hospital. Sample size was estimated using the statistical formula for comparing two related means. The expected change in the mean score of psoriasis life stress inventory (PLSI) as an impact of intervention was 4 with a standard deviation (SD) of 10, and the sample size was estimated at 5% level of significance and 80% power. The samples were selected using simple random sampling. The list of patients registered in the psoriasis clinic was considered. A total of more than 200 patients were undergoing treatment in the psoriasis clinic. The estimated sample size for the study was 51 in each group. The samples were selected using random numbers generated through computer. Patients of both sexes, 18&#x02013;65 years of age, and with the body surface area involvement of &#x0003e;10% were included in the study. Irrespective of patient's disease status and treatment status, patients were recruited. Participants with acute illness and those who had the diagnosis of any psychiatric disorder were excluded from the study. No participant was found to have psychiatric illness as per clinical evaluation.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Psoriasis knowledge assessment questionnaire</title><p>A closed-ended questionnaire was developed to assess the knowledge regarding psoriasis. It consisted of 25 statements pertaining to basic facts on psoriasis (nine items), triggering factors (five items), treatment aspects (four items), and knowledge related to disease process (seven items). The study participants were requested to give &#x0201c;true, false, or do not know&#x0201d; responses. The score ranged from 0 to 25. Reliability coefficient (Cronbach's alpha) was ranged from 0.80 to 0.86. Content validity and face validity were established by the experts from the field of dermatology, psychiatry, and psychology (documented in <xref ref-type="app" rid="App1">Appendix I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Modified psoriasis disability index</title><p>The original psoriasis disability index (PDI)[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] is a 15-item validated self-administered questionnaire designed to quantify the functional disability in the aspects of daily activities, employment, personal relationships, leisure, and treatment effects in participants with psoriasis. The score ranged from 0 to 45. The higher the score, the more the QoL is impaired.</p><p>In the modified PDI, two questions were added since it would be appropriate for the patients with psoriasis in our specific cultural context: (1) &#x0201c;How is your work in kitchen affected by this condition?&#x0201d; and (2) &#x0201c;How much did the patient experience financial burden due to the treatment of psoriasis?&#x0201d; (Under the subdivisions of work or school and treatment-related questions, respectively). The resulting score thus ranged from 0 to 51 instead of 0&#x02013;45. The necessary permission was obtained from the authors to use the questionnaire. The modified version of PDI was adapted for the present study from the published literature.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Modified psoriasis life stress inventory</title><p>The original 15-item version of PLSI[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] was developed to assess the stress associated with potential psoriasis-related psychosocial problems. The score ranged from 0 to 45. The higher the score the more the QoL is impaired.</p><p>In the present study, the stress experienced by the participants was assessed by the modified PLSI which was an 18-item questionnaire. It was found one question &#x02013; &#x0201c;sunbathing in the company of others&#x0201d;&#x02013; inappropriate, when applied to our patients and was deleted. Further, four questions were added &#x02013; feeling less sexually attractive, concerned about children developing psoriasis, fear of relapse, and difficulty in coping if no family support. Thus, the resulting score ranged from 0 to 54 instead of 0&#x02013;45. Modified version of PLSI was adapted from the literature that was already available.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The data were analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistics using SPSS version 19.0 (IBM Corp. Released 2010. Armonk, NY). The data for the categorical variables on the sociodemographic factors were expressed as frequency and percentage. To calculate the responses in the individual items in knowledge, PLSI, and PDI questionnaire, frequency and percentage were used. The overall scores in knowledge, PLSI, and PDI were expressed as mean with SD. The comparisons of the categorical data between the groups were carried out using Chi-square test. The changes in the level of knowledge, PLSI, and PDI scores over time in each group were analyzed using two-way repeated measures of analysis of variance with repeated contrast test. All statistical analyses were carried out at 5% level of significance, and <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-5"><title>Data collection procedure</title><p>A pretest was conducted by the principal investigator for all the participants in the experimental group as well as in the control group to assess their knowledge on psoriasis and their QoL using modified PDI and modified PLSI. All the participants in the control group received routine dermatological treatment for 12 weeks. All the participants in the experimental group received routine dermatological treatment along with video-assisted teaching program on psoriasis and progressive muscle relaxation exercises along with deep breathing exercises and were followed every week for over 12 weeks. Three posttests were conducted for both the groups with the same questionnaires which were used for pretest at different time points (at the end of 4<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>, and 12<sup>th</sup> week).</p></sec><sec id="sec3-6"><title>Video-assisted teaching program on psoriasis</title><p>A video-teaching program was prepared with the details regarding the nature of psoriasis, clinical types, triggering factors, and the diagnostic methods. It also included the description on medications and ointments that are used for the treatment of psoriasis. The side effects of the drugs, precautions to be followed while using ointments, and the signs and symptoms to be reported while taking the drugs were discussed with the participants. The participants were explained about phototherapy and photochemotherapy, and orientation was given to the phototherapy room. Skin care measures and the coping skills were also discussed. Sessions were conducted for four consecutive days and then continued for 12 weeks for reinforcement. An educational pamphlet was provided at the end of the session to reinforce their knowledge.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-7"><title>Jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation technique</title><p>The participants in the experimental group were divided into small groups with five in each group and were trained to learn breathing techniques as well as the relaxation techniques.

For example, a patient with psoriasis who knows about the Koebner phenomenon will be able to avoid injury to the skin. Furthermore, patients with a good understanding of their disease are more self-motivated by increasing their sense of control. Many research findings indicate that it is important to educate patients with psoriasis regarding their condition.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The results of the present study revealed that the knowledge level was significantly increased in the experimental group due to the impact of the educational program.

Other studies which support our study findings are given below:</p><p>Wahl <italic>et al</italic>. investigated patients&#x02019; knowledge regarding psoriasis before and after patient education in the context of climate therapy.

This program was accepted very well and seen as helpful by the concerned.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>It has long been acknowledged that the clients affected with psoriasis may benefit greatly from psychotherapeutic interventions. It is possible that stress management through relaxation may result in improvement in these patients. Stress may worsen psoriasis severity and may even lengthen the time to disease clearance. According to Zachariae <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] 66% of their patients reported that their psoriasis was exacerbated by stress and 35% of them reported that the onset of their psoriasis occurred during a time of worry and stress. Rakhesh <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported that psoriasis sufferers were most likely to feel self-conscious, disturbed/inconvenienced by the shedding of the skin, lived in a constant fear of relapse, and avoided social interactions.</p><p>The findings of the present study showed that the stress score related to the illness was found to be 22.8 before the intervention in the experimental group. It was decreased to 20.4, 18.4, and 16.9, respectively, at the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, and 3<sup>rd</sup> month after the intervention due to the impact of educational and relaxation therapy. Similarly, Kabat-Zinn <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] found that meditation-based stress reduction intervention increased the rate of resolution of psoriatic lesions in patients undergoing phototherapy or photochemotherapy treatment. Price <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] reported that patients with psoriasis who were taught specific relaxation techniques had a significant reduction in their anxiety level and showed physical improvement.

Four studies focused on intervention directed toward the parents and examined the effect of relaxation techniques (hypnotherapy and biofeedback) on severity. Three educational studies identified significant improvements in disease severity between intervention groups. One study found that video-based education was found to be more effective in improving severity than direct education and the control (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). The single psychological study found relaxation techniques resulted in reducing the clinical severity as compared to the control at 20 weeks.</p><p>Price <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] investigated whether psychotherapy helps patients with psoriasis. Participants who were taught specific relaxation techniques for use whenever they felt under stress had significantly reduced anxiety level at the end of the study with the modest trend toward physical improvement. No such changes were seen in a matched control group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The central and peripheral nervous systems, as well as the endocrine system, play an important role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Endogenous factors, such as stress, and exogenous factors, such as trauma, cause an increased release of neuropeptides such as substance P. Thus, as a result of stress playing such a prominent role in psoriasis, it seems evident that stress reduction programs should be considered when trying to treat the condition. The results of the present study also suggest that an educational intervention may be helpful in improving the knowledge and give psychological relief to patients with psoriasis.</p><sec id="sec3-9"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-10" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>We sincerely thank Dr. Andrew Finlay for granting us permission to use Psoriasis disability Index and Dr. Gupta MA and Gupta AK for granting us permission to use psoriasis life stress inventory in our research study.
