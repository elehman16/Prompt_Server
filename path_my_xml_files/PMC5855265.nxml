Ayurvedic literature shows its use in treating oral diseases also. However, their effectiveness, in comparison with the allopathic mode of management, has not been assessed previously. The aim of this randomized controlled clinical trial was to compare the efficacy of ayurvedic drugs over chlorhexidine in treating chronic periodontitis.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Four hundred and eight participants, in the age group 20&#x02013;49 years, suffering from mild-to-moderate chronic periodontitis were included in this study. Community periodontal index for treatment needs (CPITN) score was recorded, and oral prophylaxis was done for each patient. They were then randomly divided into 6 groups: control group (I), chlorhexidine (II), Khadiradi vati (III), Dashansanskar churana (IV), Neem (V), and Apamarga (VI); based on the drugs used by patients for the maintenance of oral hygiene after oral prophylaxis. Patients were recalled at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after oral prophylaxis. CPITN score was re-recorded for each patient at each follow-up.

Increased life expectancy and greater health expectations may lead to changes in demand of individuals of all age groups for periodontal treatment and substantial increase in periodontal therapy. Advanced periodontal disease with deep periodontal pockets affects 10%&#x02013;15% of adults worldwide.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Experimental studies on gingivitis provided the first empiric evidence that accumulation of microbial film on clean tooth surfaces results in the development of an inflammatory process around the gingival tissue.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Local inflammation persists as long as the microbial film is present adjacent to the gingival tissues, and it may resolve subsequent to a meticulous removal of the biofilm. Therefore, current treatment is directed at disruption of biofilm which usually includes professional and home care mechanical methods. Patient cooperation in daily plaque removal is critical to long-term success of all periodontal treatments. Many patients can get effective plaque control using toothbrushes, but antimicrobial mouthwashes such as chlorhexidine, mixtures containing essential oil, and cetylpyridinium can add to the mechanical plaque removal.</p><p>Chlorhexidine has been the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; mouthwash because of its antibacterial action, efficacy, and substantivity. It is a cationic bisguanide with a broad-spectrum antiseptic with pronounced antimicrobial effect on Gram-positive and negative bacteria, yeast, dermatophytes, and some lipophilic viruses and also potent antiplaque agent.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] However, continuous use of chlorhexidine for long periods can cause stains on teeth, tongue, and gingival, also on silicate and resin restorations, alter taste sensation, xerostomia, ulcers, etc. Hence, it cannot be used for daily prophylactic measures.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>According to the WHO, more than 80% of the world's population relies on traditional herbal medicine for their primary health care.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Ayurveda is one of the traditional systems of medicine, practiced in India since ancient times. The concept of oral diseases is vividly found in original scriptures of Ayurveda, that is, Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita, and herbal or herbomineral preparations with their properties, action, and therapeutic uses are well defined in them. Due to the aforementioned side effects of chlorhexidine, herbal alternatives are needed. Out of the rich reservoir of resources available in Ayurveda for treatment of periodontal diseases, two single dosage forms (Apamarga and Neem) and two compound dosage forms (Dashansanskar churana and Khadiradi vati) were selected for this study.</p><p>The aim of this randomized controlled clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy of four ayurvedic drugs, that is, Neem, Apamarga, Dashansanskar churana, and Khadiradi vati, as compared to chlorhexidine in the management of chronic periodontitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This clinical trial was conducted from May 1, 2011 to November 30, 2011.

Community periodontal index for treatment needs (CPITN) was used for screening patients. Patients with CPITN score codes 1, 2, or 3 were considered as cases of mild-to-moderate periodontitis and were included in the study. Immunocompromised patients, those with systemic diseases, and patients with CPITN score code 4 were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Sample size estimation</title><p>The present study had the following assumptions to determine the sample size:</p><p>

It comprised of 266 (65.2%) male and 142 (34.8%) female participants. Out of the total study participants, 236 (57.8%) participants belonged to urban areas and 172 (42.2%) were from rural areas. The participants were in the age range of 20&#x02013;49 years with their mean age being 31.95 (+7.024) years. Out of these, 300 participants completed their 3-month follow-up giving a dropout rate of 26.5%. Three study arms had 51 participants, two had 50, and one had 47 study participants who completed 3-month follow-up.</p><p>CPITN scores were used to evaluate the effect of the different drug formulations. There was no statistically significant difference between the mean baseline scores of the six experimental groups. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean baseline scores of those participants who completed their 3-month follow-up and those who dropped out of the study [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Improvement in scores after 3-month follow-up for the six groups is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>.

The same level of improvement was shown by only 29.4% patients in chlorhexidine group [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. This difference of improvement seen in ayurvedic drugs as compared to chlorhexidine is statistically significant. Seventy-five percent improvement level was found in 70% patients in Dashansanskar churana group followed by chlorhexidine group and Khadiradi vati group that showed such improvement in 66.67% patients each, while this figure was 63.8% in the Neem group [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. If 50% improvement is considered as acceptable, we find that Dashansanskar churana group showed this level of improvement in 100% study participants followed by 98% patients of Khadiradi vati group, 94.1% participants of chlorhexidine group, and 83% participants of Neem group. These differences were statistically significant [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>].

According to MEDLINE search, ayurvedic drugs are more curative, long-term effective, and cheaper than other modern medicines. Ayurvedic drugs are associated with limited or no side effects as these are indigenous preparations from natural resources. Ayurvedic drugs have been used since ancient times to treat oral diseases including periodontal diseases. <italic>Sushruta Samhita</italic> in his 20<sup>th</sup> shloka has stated that <italic>Triphala</italic> can be used as a gargling agent in dental diseases as it has antibacterial, antiseptic, and anti-inflammatory properties.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) provide the major source of collagenases or gelatinase that mediate connective tissue breakdown during inflammatory periodontal disease. Herbal extracts are potent inhibitors of pathologically elevated collagenases and hence may be used as an alternative adjunct in the management of periodontal disease.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] A meta-analysis conducted in 2016 has shown that a wide range of newer herbal mouthwashes are available, but their potential use and recommendations need to be validated. Out of the 11 analyzed studies, only two studies favored the use of herbal products while four studies favored the use of chlorhexidine. Rest of the five studies kept herbal mouthwashes and chlorhexidine at par with each other.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Therefore, more studies are required to prove that herbal products can equate or replace the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; chlorhexidine.</p><p>Chlorhexidine significantly reduces dental plaque and gingivitis in patients and has been established as the most effective chemical plaque control compound.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In our study also, chlorhexidine group showed better reduction in CPITN score than in control group. However, it can cause altered taste sensation, staining of teeth and tongue when used for more than 15 days.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] This disadvantage of chlorhexidine, along with the fact that there are no reported side effects of the four ayurvedic drugs selected for the study when used as tooth powder or in aqueous solution as oral rinse, prompted us to test these ayurvedic drugs and compare their effectiveness with chlorhexidine in chronic generalized periodontitis.</p><p>In this study, improvement in CPITN scores seen with Dashansanskar churana and Khadiradi vati was significantly better than chlorhexidine. Neem was comparable to chlorhexidine in our study results. Dashansanskar churana is a polyherbal formulation, well known as a remedy for all types of dental problems including gingivitis. Almost all drugs of this formulation have anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] It also acts against the foul smell of the mouth. If used regularly for a fortnight, bleeding and pus formation are also checked.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Ayurveda recommends the use of this powder for at least 3 months. In the present study, Dashansanskar churana gave the best results among all the groups and was significantly better than chlorhexidine. Less palatability to patients, especially children is the only disadvantage of this formulation[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] which otherwise has shown promising results.</p><p>The chief ingredient of Khadiradi vati is <italic>Acacia catechu</italic>, an excellent antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory agent. It increases intracellular concentration of Vitamin C, free radical scavenging, and inhibition of collagen destruction.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] A clinical study using a powder of <italic>A. catechu</italic>, menthol, and camphor in the proportion of 91%, 2.7%, and 6.3%, respectively, has reported 87%&#x02013;95% reduction in plaque, 70%&#x02013;72% reduction in gingivitis, and 80%&#x02013;95% reduction in dental calculus, in merely 15 days.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Amruthesh recommended the use of <italic>Dashansanskar churana</italic> for brushing and Khadiradi vati for chewing as treatment for periodontal abscess.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In our study also, Khadiradi vati gave results superior to chlorhexidine and comparable to Dashansanskar churana. With no reported side effects, it can be a good alternative to chlorhexidine in long-term use. No previous study has compared Dashansanskar churana or Khadiradi vati with chlorhexidine; hence, we could not compare our results with any other study.</p><p>Since time immemorial, Indians have used Neem (<italic>Azadirachta indica</italic>) in a variety of ways both for personal and community health by way of environmental amelioration. Neem leaf extract reduces bacteria and plaque levels that cause progression of periodontitis.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In the present study, Neem gave results comparable to chlorhexidine. In a previous study by Balappanavar, the gingival response seen for Neem was better than chlorhexidine.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] A systematic review has also stated that Neem mouthrinse was as effective as chlorhexidine mouthrinse when used as an adjunct to toothbrushing in reducing plaque and gingival inflammation in gingivitis patients. However, the quality of reporting and evidence along with methods of studies included in this review was generally flawed with unclear risk of bias.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Therefore, we state that Neem is comparable to chlorhexidine and can be used for long-term oral hygiene maintenance as there are no reported side effects of Neem mouthrinse.</p><p>Apamarga (<italic>Achyranthes aspera</italic>) root powder is extremely rewarding for cleansing teeth and preventing caries.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] However, it is pungent and bitter in taste, although there is no reported side effect when used as aqueous mouthwash. In the present clinical trial, Apamarga was far less effective than chlorhexidine, so much so that the control group showed better results than apamarga. Inferior results recorded in case of Apamarga root powder may be due to its bitter taste leading to patient noncompliance with oral hygiene instructions. The stem part has better activity than the root. This may be another factor affecting the activity of this powder. Our results are in sharp contrast to those seen by Bansal <italic>et al</italic>., they found that <italic>A. aspera</italic> root powder was at par with chlorhexidine in reducing plaque scores and <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> count in 8&#x02013;12-year-old children.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] An <italic>in vitro</italic> study has also found <italic>A. aspera</italic> extract to be effective against <italic>S. mutans</italic> although at a higher concentration and volume than chlorhexidine gluconate. In contrast to our study, this study used powder of fresh stems and roots.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Between the four ayurvedic drugs, results of Dashansanskar churana group, Khadiradi vati group, and Neem group were comparable in our study and significantly better than Apamarga group. The duration of usage of these drugs also affected the cure rates in patients. Khadiradi vati, Neem, Dashansanskar churana, and Chlorhexidine groups showed significant improvement between 1 month and 3 month recall period. Undoubtedly, increasing the duration of treatment increased the cure rates in all the groups. These ayurvedic formulations can, thus, be used as a regular cleaning aid for maintaining the oral hygiene as their continued use in patients showed no side effects and improved oral hygiene scores.</p><p>However, there are a few limitations in this study. First, in this trial, only the outcome assessor was blinded. Participants and health-care providers were not blinded. This could have been a potential source of bias. Second, the use of drugs in trial was done by patients at home. Thus, their frequency and technique of use could not be confirmed. The difference in compliance could have led to bias in the study. Third, CPITN was used for screening of the patients as well as to assess the outcome. CPITN gives more emphasis on treatment needs rather than the disease condition. Hence, in the future studies, CPITN can be used for screening patients and an index emphasizing on the disease can be used for assessing the outcome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Within the limitations of this study, it is concluded that results of three ayurvedic drugs, Dashansanskar churana, Khadiradi vati, and Neem were superior to chlorhexidine in the treatment of chronic periodontitis in human beings.
