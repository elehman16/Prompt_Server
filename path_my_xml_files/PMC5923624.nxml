The A-CLASS Project aimed to quantify the effectiveness of structured and unstructured physical activity (PA) programmes on children&#x02019;s PA, fitness, body composition, bone health, cardiac and vascular structures, fundamental movement skills, physical self-perception and self-esteem. The study was a four-arm parallel-group school-based cluster randomised controlled trial (clinical trials no. NCT02963805), and compared different exposure groups: a high intensity PA (HIPA) group, a fundamental movement skill (FMS) group, a PA signposting (PASS) group and a control group, in a two-schools-per-condition design. Baseline findings indicate that children&#x02019;s fundamental movement skill competence levels are low-to-moderate, yet these skills are inversely associated with percentage body fat. Outcomes of this project will make an important contribution to the design and implementation of children&#x02019;s PA promotion initiatives.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>intervention</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>fundamental movement skill</kwd><kwd>physical activity</kwd><kwd>fitness</kwd><kwd>cardiovascular</kwd><kwd>physical self-perception</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-ijerph-15-00582"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>The relationships between children&#x02019;s physical activity (PA) and metabolic health are widely reported in the literature [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. PA is independently associated with clustered cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and is therefore a key component in preventing or reducing the onset of CVD in adulthood [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Health benefits are thought to increase with moderate and vigorous intensity aerobic-based activity and weight bearing activity to elicit bone health benefits [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><sec id="sec1dot1-ijerph-15-00582"><title>1.1. Generating an Evidence Base: Sportslinx</title><p>SportsLinx was initiated through a collaborative agreement between Liverpool John Moores University and the local authority Sport and Recreation Department in 1995. The aim of this collaboration was to develop a project that would strengthen the relationship between primary schools, sport and recreation and Liverpool John Moores University. The core programme needed to meet the missions of partner organisations, and have the potential to inform partners about sport participation, fitness, dietary behaviour and lifestyles of children. The programme was based on the Northern Ireland Youth Fitness Project [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and adapted to match the needs of participating stakeholders. The pilot SportsLinx programme included 1500 9&#x02013;14 year old children from an opportunity sample of 10 primary and 10 high schools in Liverpool. The pilot demonstrated that a health-related collaborative project was feasible and schools&#x02019; compliance was good. Further conversations with teachers and children supported wider strategic implementation. The SportsLinx project was implemented in Autumn 1996 and involved around 2500 children per year until 2001 and 4500 children each year thereafter. The programme was implemented in a partnership between Liverpool John Moores University and the local authority Departments of Sport and Recreation and Public Health.</p><p>Details of the SportsLinx project including methods and protocols were first reported by Taylor et al. [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Subsequent publications by Stratton et al., Fairclough et al., and Boddy et al. [<xref rid="B7-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] reported decreasing trends in fitness, and increasing trends in overweight and obesity and sedentary behaviours over a decade. Data also demonstrated that deprivation had little effect on outcomes whereas large sex differences were evident. Stratton et al. [<xref rid="B7-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] further demonstrated that between 1996 and 2004 body mass index (BMI) increased in the least fit, average fit and most fit groups, while fitness had a significant downward trend. Fairclough et al. [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] also reported that children were highly sedentary. Boys spent more time playing sport, watching TV and playing video games than girls, whilst children from higher socioeconomic status (SES) groups spent more time playing sport than those in lower. Overweight girls were more likely to spend time on the internet than their normal weight peers. Further analysis of data found that BMI had plateaued in boys and decreased in girls, whereas cardiorespiratory fitness continued to decline across the whole population [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The Sportslinx data demonstrated the need for population-level interventions to promote PA, healthy eating and healthy lifestyles in 9&#x02013;11 year-old children in Liverpool.</p></sec><sec id="sec1dot2-ijerph-15-00582"><title>1.2. Designing Interventions</title><p>The SportsLinx research group noted the trends in the surveillance data in 1998 and started to plan interventions. As a result, a smaller number of exploratory studies that aimed to increase PA by changing school playgrounds were completed [<xref rid="B11-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These subsequently led to a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that demonstrated that changing the school playground physical environment increased children&#x02019;s PA [<xref rid="B13-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In another intervention in physical education, we demonstrated that physical education teachers could intensify PA during lesson time [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The limitations of these studies were that they did not measure habitual PA; they did not quantify the effect of increasing the quantity of PA on the quality of movement such as motor competence, and they did not include an outcome variable driven by national policy.</p><p>Systematic reviews also support the development of robust interventions using rigorous measures. Mears and Jago [<xref rid="B15-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] recently reviewed the effectiveness of after school PA interventions and found mixed results, with findings limited by the methodological quality of study design, and recommended that research designs were improved. Other reviews found that school-based interventions increased the proportion of children engaging in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) during the school day [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and that programmes that ran for one school year were most effective [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Unlike the studies reviewed by Mears and Jago [<xref rid="B15-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], these were not focused on after school provision. Further, interventions that have been implemented have not included robust measures of exposure (PA, structured exercise) or outcome (direct measures of body composition, motor competence, CVD risk factors, and objective measures of PA). Furthermore, only a small number of studies have been implemented in UK children [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and more research is needed.</p></sec><sec id="sec1dot3-ijerph-15-00582"><title>1.3. The Active City of Liverpool, Active Schools and SportsLinx (A-CLASS) Project</title><p>For over a century, physical education has been consistently used as a vehicle to promote PA, fitness and health [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Between 1997 and 2007, there was a significant investment in physical education curriculum time in schools in England. In 2002, the Physical Education, School Sport and Club Links (PESSCL) strategy was launched by the Labour government [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The objective of PESSCL was to increase the quality and quantity of physical education and sports opportunities for children aged 5&#x02013;16 years old by providing two hours of high quality physical education per week. The two-hour aspiration was superseded in 2004 with the &#x0201c;four-hour offer&#x0201d; of high quality physical education and school sport (PESS) per week, both within and beyond the curriculum [<xref rid="B21-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The &#x0201c;four-hour offer&#x0201d; entitled children to two hours of curriculum physical education and two hours of organized after-school sport.</p><p>The purpose of the A-CLASS Project was to measure the effect of this &#x0201c;four-hour offer&#x0201d; on children&#x02019;s PA, health and motor competence. The A-CLASS design is therefore novel in that it is built on (i) a national policy and (ii) it examines the relative effectiveness of school-based interventions on both children&#x02019;s health (i.e., obesity, cardiometabolic risk) and developmental outcomes (fundamental movement skills). Further, we sought to address some of the limitations in the literature [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] by using robust research tools and methodologies. We created a novel laboratory to community approach that aimed to quantify the effectiveness of structured and unstructured PA programmes on children&#x02019;s PA, fitness, body composition, bone health, cardiac and vascular structures, fundamental movement skills, physical self-perception, and self-esteem [<xref rid="B23-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>The Medical Research Council (MRC) guidance on developing and evaluating complex interventions recommends a five-phase development approach based on theory and evidence of need [<xref rid="B24-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The A-CLASS Project followed this approach. The preclinical and phase I were built on eight years of data from the SportsLinx project (<italic>n</italic> = 20,000). Subsequently phases II (exploratory trial) and III (RCT) were designed around the &#x0201c;four-hour offer&#x0201d; national policy for physical education and school sport (DfE 2004). The phase II exploratory trial proved that the study design and approach was feasible and effective [<xref rid="B25-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], with promising evidence of effects on fundamental movement skills [<xref rid="B25-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], cardiac function [<xref rid="B27-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and body composition [<xref rid="B26-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. As a result of the exploratory work, adjustments to the design were made prior to the study progressing to a full RCT.</p><p>The primary aim of this paper is to detail the decisions related to the design and methods for the A-CLASS Project trial. The intervention aimed to improve both developmental and risk-associated markers, specifically: fundamental movement skill competence, deemed an important marker of physical development [<xref rid="B28-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and a reduction in percentage body fat, as an important marker of disease risk [<xref rid="B29-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A secondary aim of the paper is to present baseline descriptives and cross-sectional associations between the primary outcomes. To date, studies exploring relationships between body composition and skill competence have typically used BMI or waist circumference, with most reporting an inverse association [<xref rid="B28-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B30-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, the sensitivity and accuracy of such proxy measures of fatness is questionable, and therefore more research using reference methods of body composition such as dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is warranted. Slotte et al. [<xref rid="B31-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] recently found better skill proficiency was significantly and negatively associated with lower percentage body fat, as measured by DXA, in a sample of 304 eight-year-old Finnish children. However, no data exists for British children and further evidence is needed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-ijerph-15-00582"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-ijerph-15-00582"><title>2.1. Study Design</title><p>The A-CLASS Project was a four-arm parallel-group school-based cluster randomised controlled trial, conducted within the metropolitan city of Liverpool (UK) between September 2006 and November 2009. The project received institutional research ethics committee approval (05138), and the trial is registered (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02963805).</p><p>Data collection occurred over 36 months with three time points of baseline (month 0/T0, September to mid-October 2006), end of intervention (9 months/T1, June to mid-July 2007) and follow-up (3 years/T2, October 2009). At each time point participants attended University laboratories for individual assessments (anthropometry, bone and body composition, CVD risk factors, cardiorespiratory fitness), had their habitual PA objectively assessed using accelerometers, and were assessed for fundamental movement skills at their respective school. Prior to laboratory visits, participants were instructed to fast for a minimum of 8 h and avoid strenuous exercise for 24 h. The intervention ran over 9 months to replicate an academic school year. No intervention was delivered during school holiday/vacation periods. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-00582-f001">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the intervention design, displaying time points for measurement and the intervention groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-ijerph-15-00582" sec-type="subjects"><title>2.2. Participants and Settings</title><sec id="sec2dot2dot1-ijerph-15-00582"><title>2.2.1. Organisational Level</title><p>Government-funded primary schools were targeted by the research team in May&#x02013;July 2006. The schools were assessed for eligibility based on their size (student enrolment &#x0003e;400 primary school (4&#x02013;11 years old); &#x0003e;250 junior school (8&#x02013;11 years old)), current afterschool club provision (limited), school sport facilities available for use (bi-weekly), and classified low socioeconomic status (SES). School postcode was used to determine low SES, which was defined as an Index of Multiple Deprivation less than 40 [<xref rid="B32-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Sixteen schools met the inclusion criteria and signed consent was obtained from the head teachers for pupil recruitment, study contact, laboratory visits during school time and access to school facilities. Eight from the sixteen schools were randomly selected to take part using random number allocation. All schools had participated in the SportsLinx programme for over 7 years.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2dot2-ijerph-15-00582"><title>2.2.2. Individual Level</title><p>All children in Year 5 (9&#x02013;10 years old) in consenting schools received a verbal and written overview of the study through a researcher-led study information session held at the respective schools. Children provided written assent and a parent/guardian provided written consent to participate in the study. Medical questionnaires were distributed to all children who agreed to take part in the study. Self-reported stature and body mass were used in order to calculate BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>). BMI was used as guide to target the children who were overweight or at risk of being overweight according to UK age- and sex-specific cut-off thresholds [<xref rid="B33-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Generally, 20&#x02013;25 children with the highest BMI within each school, who were free from the presence of chronic disease, metabolic disorders, motor or coordination difficulties and prescribed medications including steroids inhaled by asthma sufferers were then enrolled to participate in the project. There was no racial or gender bias in the selection of participants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-ijerph-15-00582"><title>2.3. Intervention</title><p>In a two-schools-per-condition design, using a computer generated procedure, participating schools were randomly allocated to one of four treatments to reduce risk of contamination effects across the trial. Treatment arms in this four-arm parallel-group cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) included a high intensity PA (HIPA) intervention group, a fundamental movement skill (FMS) intervention group, a PA signposting (PASS) intervention group and a control group (usual practice). In a two-group-per-condition design, the equivalence of groups at baseline is not secure; to attempt to partially address this threat to validity, the schools selected were as similar as possible for the distribution of age, mass and deprivation. Each condition contained the children with highest BMI scores from each school; thus, the number of children varied slightly between intervention groups according to the number of children excluded for medical reasons, and to accommodate children with above average BMI in one school compared to another. The four-arm design was created to compare different exposures. The &#x0201c;Switch-Play&#x0201d; project [<xref rid="B34-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] was used to guide the design of the PA signposting scheme (PASS) [<xref rid="B35-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The high intensity group followed a programme where the instructor focus was on maintaining a high heart rate during multi-games activity, whereas the instructors of the FMS group led similar multi-games activities but focused their instruction on skill development as opposed to high levels of movement.</p><sec id="sec2dot3dot1-ijerph-15-00582"><title>2.3.1. Treatment Groups</title><p>1.&#x02003;High Intensity Physical Activity (HIPA)</p><p>The HIPA programme was based upon the STEX programme trialled in the feasibility study [<xref rid="B26-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Children attended 60 min after-school club sessions twice a week for 26 weeks during school term time. After school sessions took placed in the sports-hall or outdoor space (depending on availability of facilities and weather conditions) at intervention schools. The activity sessions were delivered by trained multi-skills coaches with a variety of coaching qualifications and experience in coaching children. The sessions included a combination of high intensity activities (playground-style games and circuit training activities) which aimed to keep children moving and maintain a mean heart rate of above 70% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate (~145 beats/min) for the duration of the session to confirm the vigorous nature of the sessions. This was verified by intermittent heart rate (HR) monitoring (Polar Electro, Kempele, Finland). A-CLASS coaches delivered and monitored sessions and increased the intensity over time accordingly to allow for the children to progress. The mean HR for HIPA sessions was 150 beats/min, with children spending 52 min at this intensity during the session.</p><p>2.&#x02003;Fundamental Movement Skill (FMS)</p><p>The FMS programme was introduced into the intervention following the feasibility study [<xref rid="B25-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] to assess the effect of skill based structured exercise. Children attended two 60 min after-school club sessions per week for 26 weeks during school term time. After school sessions took placed in the sports-hall or outdoor space (depending on availability of facilities and weather conditions) at intervention schools. The activity sessions were delivered by trained multi-skills coaches with a variety of coaching qualifications and experience in coaching. Each session focused on improving two FMS from the vertical jump, hop, sprint run, dodge, kick, catch, overarm throw, and strike. All skills were taught in equal quantities. The intervention programme was planned using activity resources designed by the Youth Sports [<xref rid="B36-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Each session was designed to maximise participation and enjoyment, and consisted of a variety of games, drills and self-learning activities and offered numerous opportunities for practice. Skill components were taught to the children using simple learning cues, and skill related questions were used to develop purposeful feedback. The mean HR for FMS sessions was recorded at 141 beats/min, with children spending 55 min at this intensity during the session.</p><p>3.&#x02003;Physical Activity Signposting Scheme (PASS)</p><p>The PASS lifestyle intervention focused on increasing habitual PA and reducing time spent in sedentary behaviours. PASS was adapted after the initial pilot, which demonstrated poor compliance to the intervention [<xref rid="B35-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In the current trial, a researcher visited the children once per week in 6 weekly blocks to set them an activity &#x0201c;mission&#x0201d; to take home and complete with family and friends. A total of twenty missions were set over 4 &#x000d7; 6 week blocks, each separated by a 6 week break. The intervention was designed based on the theoretical behaviour change model of the social cognitive theory [<xref rid="B37-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and was developed following action-research involving focus groups with children, parents and teachers. Additionally, parts of the intervention were derived from previous lifestyle interventions such as &#x0201c;Switch-Play&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B38-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and &#x0201c;Switch-Off, Get-Active&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B39-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].

Additionally, the test battery represented skills that were perceived as important to successful participation in mainstream team sports such as football, netball, cricket and basketball.

Tests were conducted either in the school playground (weather permitting) or school gymnasium by one researcher using the same equipment at each site. Children were given a verbal description and single demonstration of the skill. Children were told to run, dodge and hop as fast as they could; to jump as high as they could; to catch as many balls as possible; and to throw, kick, and strike the ball with force rather than accuracy. Children performed each skill five times (except the sprint run and dodge, which was performed three times). The order of skill assessment was standardised throughout. Recordings of all participants were taken from identical angles and distances, with the video camera placed on a tripod during the testing. The data was then converted to DVD format for analysis to enable the assessor more precision when analysing skills performed high speed using slow-motion playback. During analysis, the skill component was recorded as present (scored &#x02018;1&#x02019;) if it was observed in four out of five trials (two out of three for sprint run and dodge). The number of skill components checked as present in each of the 8 skills was summed to create an overall skill score (max score 48) for use in the analysis. A single trained assessor conducted all fundamental movement skill assessments. Before data collection, an observer reliability study was conducted in 20 children (10 boys, 10 girls) randomly selected from the sample. Intra-rater reliability was established using a one-week test&#x02013;retest study with kappa of 0.87 (90% CI: 0.83 to 0.91).

Significant sex differences, favoring boys, were also observed for total skill score, locomotor skills and object-control skills composite scores. However, following adjustments for age, ethnicity, deprivation, maturity offset and percentage body fat, boys only scored significantly higher in total skill score (Adjusted mean difference 7.6 units, 95% CI: 4.5 to 10.7; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) and object-control skills (Adjusted mean difference 7.2 units, 95% CI: 5.1 to 9.2; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01).

Main Analyses</title><p>Results of the standard multiple regression examining skill composite scores as a predictor of percentage body fat are in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-15-00582-t003">Table 3</xref>. Controlling for sex, maturity offset, ethnicity and deprivation, total skill score significantly predicted 5.2% of unique variance in percent body fat. Specifically, a one-unit increase in total skill score is associated with a 0.27% decrease in body fat (95% CI: &#x02212;0.43 to &#x02212;0.12). When the total skill score variable was removed from the regression model and replaced with the composite variables of locomotor skills and object-control skills (Model 2), locomotor skills significantly predicted 15% of unique variance in percent body fat. Specifically, a one-unit increase in locomotor skills score was associated with a 0.88% decrease in total body fat (95% CI: &#x02212;1.14 to &#x02212;0.61). Object-control skills weakly predicted two percent of unique variance in percent body fat but in the opposite direction: a one-unit increase in object-control score was associated with a 0.26% increase in percent body fat.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4-ijerph-15-00582"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>This paper aimed to provide the background, study design and methods of an innovative programme of research that will make an important contribution to the implementation and design of children&#x02019;s PA promotion initiatives and policy&#x02014;The A-CLASS Project. A secondary aim of the paper was to present preliminary findings for participating A-CLASS children with respect to primary outcomes for positive development and risk (i.e., fundamental movement skills and percentage body fat, respectively), and to explore their cross-sectional associations. The fundamental movement skill results indicate that the prevalence of skill proficiency among this population was low-to-moderate, with boys more skillful than girls in object-control skills, but not locomotor skills. Further, skill competence was a significant predictor of percent body fat, suggesting that developing fundamental movement skill competence may be important for addressing childhood obesity.</p><p>In boys, prevalence of skill proficiency was low-to-moderate (ranging from 21% to 61%) and did not exceed 60% in any skill except the overarm throw. In girls prevalence of skill proficiency in girls was low (ranging from 6% to 33%), and only the hop had over 30% rated as proficient, whilst 9 out of 10 girls were rated as non-proficient in the throw, strike and kick. Skill proficiency may be low as children were recruited into the project from areas of high deprivation, with children from higher socioeconomic backgrounds more likely to possess higher levels of skill proficiency [<xref rid="B70-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Children from more affluent areas may have greater access to facilities and be more likely to own sports equipment and therefore have increased opportunities to develop these skills. Nonetheless, the large proportion and pattern of primary school children rated as non-proficient in this sample is similar to results from more heterogeneous samples of similar-aged children in the United Kingdom [<xref rid="B71-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] and Australia [<xref rid="B50-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B72-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="B73-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], which assessed skills using a similar assessment tool. The results suggest that there is significant potential to improve fundamental movement skill competence.</p><p>The low prevalence of skill proficiency is worrying given that children should master most fundamentals by eight years of age [<xref rid="B51-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B74-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], and because evidence suggests that failure to master such skills may provide a barrier to participation in PA [<xref rid="B28-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B30-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B75-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="B76-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,<xref rid="B77-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. The development of fundamental movement skills is not automatic; in order to develop, skills need to be taught and practiced. Instruction time necessary to develop skill proficiency can range from 240&#x02013;600 min, depending on the skill and developmental capability of the child [<xref rid="B47-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Nevertheless, development of competence at these skills is influenced by a wide range of bio-psycho-social and environmental factors [<xref rid="B78-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. It may be that children in this sample were not sufficiently active and so lacked the opportunities to develop these skills, or that the PA experiences that children engaged in may have lacked the quality to facilitate improvements in such skills. For example, children may not have received the quantity or quality of coaching within physical education or sport necessary to reach proficiency in these skills. The training provided to primary school teachers in physical education has significantly declined [<xref rid="B79-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] and many generalist teachers lack the necessary skills and confidence to deliver physical education [<xref rid="B80-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,<xref rid="B81-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. School priorities are literacy and numeracy, with limited attention given to the provision of quality early learning experiences in physical education. While more evidence is needed on how best to train teachers to enhance fundamental movement skill development [<xref rid="B82-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>], the pressure on curricular time supports the need for after-school programmes to provide an additional opportunity for enhancing such skills [<xref rid="B25-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>The skills selected for assessment were considered age-appropriate and free from gender bias. However, overall, boys possessed more skill components and were more proficient than girls. Similar to previous studies which used similar methods [<xref rid="B50-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B71-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,<xref rid="B72-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="B73-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], when adjusted for covariates, gender differences were significant in object control skills (boys better), but not locomotor skills. The observed gender differences in object-control skills may reflect the different sports and activities in which children typically participate in at this age. More boys play football, basketball and cricket than girls and so have further opportunities to develop and practice object control skills such as kicking, catching and throwing. Conversely, girls are more likely to participate in activities such as dance or gymnastics, which do not reinforce object-control skills. Differences are also formulated in unstructured settings such as school playtime. Boys are significantly more likely to participate in ball games and use equipment whereas girls prefer social and sedentary play, skipping or hopscotch [<xref rid="B83-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,<xref rid="B84-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. This explanation indicates that gender differences are environmentally and culturally induced, rather than biological. If similar opportunities for instruction, practice, encouragement, and feedback are provided to both boys and girls then observed sex differences can be reduced.</p><p>Overweight and obese children suffer from bullying, name-calling and teasing, and may seek to avoid overt victimisation by withdrawing from PA [<xref rid="B85-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,<xref rid="B86-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], which, in turn, may limit their opportunities to develop skill competence. The results did reveal weak-to-moderate negative associations between fundamental movement skill competence and percent body fat. Specifically, after adjustments for confounders, total skill score significantly predicted 5.2% of the variance in percent total body fat. However, when skills were partitioned into locomotor skills and object-control skills, only locomotor skills were inversely associated with percent body fat, predicting 15% of variance, signifying a moderate association. This finding of a unique influence for locomotor skills is supported by a recent study in a UK primary school, which found that children with higher levels of locomotor skill proficiency had lower BMI and body fat percentage, as measured by skinfolds [<xref rid="B87-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>], though no such differences were observed for object-control skills. Furthermore, Southall et al. [<xref rid="B68-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] observed that compared to their non-overweight peers, overweight children, as classified by BMI, had lower competence in locomotor skills but no difference was found for object-control skills. Moreover, Okely et al. [<xref rid="B88-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] reported that non-overweight boys and girls were two to three times more likely to possess more advanced locomotor skills than overweight boys and girls, though object-control skills were virtually unrelated to body composition. Slotte et al. [<xref rid="B31-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] did report that better object-control proficiency was associated with lower body fat percentage in Finnish children, as measured by DXA. However, the study did not adjust for confounders relating to both obesity and movement skills, which may have influenced the relationships causal pathway.</p><p>Locomotor skills may be more strongly associated with adiposity than object-control skills for several reasons. Firstly, object-control skills require less movement of body mass from one place to another than locomotor skills, and so may be less difficult to perform for overfat children [<xref rid="B89-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Secondly, obese children can demonstrate abnormal gait patterns [<xref rid="B90-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], which increases the energy cost of locomotion and may cause early fatigue, thus limiting time spent practising locomotor skills. Thirdly, abnormal gait and resultant biomechanical deficiency can cause musculoskeletal pain in knee and hip joints, again limiting participation [<xref rid="B91-ijerph-15-00582" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Taken together, the results suggest that improving locomotor skills may be a plausible intervention strategy to reduce adiposity in children; however, experimental research is needed to determine the causal direction of this relationship.</p><p>The strengths of this study using baseline data from the A-CLASS Project are the use of DXA to assess percentage body fat, and the use of video analysis and a process-oriented, sensitive assessment of fundamental movement skills. However, due to the cross-sectional design, causality cannot be established, whilst the relatively homogenous sample may limit the generalisability of the findings. Nevertheless, outcomes from the cluster randomized controlled trial can be used to inform interpretations of cause and effect.</p><p>In summary, the preliminary baseline findings of the A-CLASS Project corroborate those from other studies examining fundamental movement skills in children. Prevalence of proficiency in skills was low-to-moderate, suggesting that there is great potential to improve such skills. It is especially important that children develop movement skills as competence was inversely related to percentage body fat. These findings support the need for developmentally-appropriate school and community programmes. Outcomes from The A-CLASS project will provide a comprehensive and robust examination of the effectiveness of three feasible school-based PA programmes on the PA, body composition, bone health, cardiac and vascular structures, fundamental movement skills and physical self-esteem of children.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the Neighborhood Renewal Fund and Liverpool City Council.
