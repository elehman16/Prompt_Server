An array of behavioural directives is imposed on these patients such as quitting smoking; increasing exercise; reducing weight; and adhering to self-monitoring, dietary and medication prescriptions. Evidence on the efficacy of the recommended measures is variable. Some may even do more harm than good such as the intensive lowering of blood glucose values by polypharmacy.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Patients frequently feel demotivated and overloaded by the plethora of medical orders. This might contribute to poor long-term adherence even to the most effective preventive interventions such as blood pressure control or use of statins.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;5</xref> Lack of patient involvement in decision-making has been suggested as an important reason for low adherence and limited treatment success.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Since 2012, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) claim a &#x02018;patient-centred approach&#x02019; in the care of people with type 2 diabetes with particular emphasis on <italic>shared decision-making</italic> (SDM).<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> SDM is also strongly recommended in the recent national treatment guideline for type 2 diabetes in Germany.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>SDM is not yet implemented in diabetes care. When we started this project, literature searches on SDM in the context of cardiovascular prevention in type 2 diabetes in 2005<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and updates in 2008<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> retrieved only very few relevant publications. Two of them focused on patient participation in the selection of oral antidiabetic agents or statin treatment.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> A recent pragmatic randomised controlled trial on a patient decision aid included general practices in the Netherlands.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The trial failed to demonstrate an improvement of the primary outcome measure, which was empowerment of people with type 2 diabetes for setting and achieving goals.</p><p>As we designed the present project, we had identified several barriers for the implementation of SDM. They included the lack of ready to use evidence-based patient information (EBPI) material, time constraints on the healthcare teams and physician encounters overloaded with complex information.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>We have developed an informed shared decision-making programme (ISDM-P) to address these barriers.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Main components are a decision aid and a corresponding teaching module provided by diabetes educators who teach and support patients to understand risk information and to define a hierarchy of individual treatment goals. In order to enhance practicability, the teaching module was designed as a supplementary session in the patient education programme that was already integrated into the German national disease management programme for type 2 diabetes.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>The ISDM-P is a complex intervention. It includes a number of interdependent components that may interact with contextual factors. The development process of the ISDM-P followed the UK MRC framework for complex interventions.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Accordingly, development and evaluation of the components encompassed theoretical and empirical groundwork focusing on in-depth understanding of contextual interactions and implementation processes. Details on the underlying theories, design and pilot testing of the decision aid, the teaching curriculum and the trainer modules have been published previously.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>

We investigated if the ISDM-P leads to higher levels of risk comprehension and realistic expectations concerning benefits and harms of preventive options. In addition, we evaluated if the programme helps patients to define, to prioritise and to achieve individual treatment goals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was a parallel group, two-arm, single-blinded, randomised controlled trial with 6&#x02005;months of follow-up.

The study took place at the outpatient department of Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases at the Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany. The outpatient diabetes clinic provides standard care for a large catchment area. Within the DMP, patients are followed usually quarterly but at least once a year.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Intervention</title><p>The ISDM-P is a complex intervention.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>

<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> By definition, complex interventions comprise interdependently acting components essential to their proper functioning. For example, patient teaching and provider training may act interdependently.</p><p>The underlying approach of the ISDM-P follows Ajzen's<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> theory of planned behaviour which suggests that behaviour is influenced by (1) individual attitudes, (2) subjective social norms such as perceived attitudes of family members or the healthcare team, and (3) perceived and actual individual behaviour control. The most predictive variable of SDM behaviour is intention.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Subjective social norms and perceived behaviour control are the most frequently identified determinants of a health professional's intention to perform SDM.</p><p>As one of the relevant issues, social norms of diabetes educators and possible concerns of physicians were addressed in the curriculum. The provision of evidence-based information aimed at strengthening behaviour control by resolving knowledge deficits and by realigning unrealistic expectations.</p><p>Components of the ISDM-P are (1) an evidence-based decision aid for patients on the prevention of heart attack,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> (2) structured patient teaching provided by diabetes educators and (3) a provider training. The decision aid is supposed to be provided 2&#x02005;weeks before the teaching session. It includes EBPI on heart attack risk, risk factors and different preventive options.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Other diabetes-related risks, such as stroke or microvascular complications, are also considered. We used UKPDS data on the combined end point for &#x02018;any diabetes-related end point&#x02019; to communicate benefits and harms of blood pressure and blood glucose control.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The decision aid is available on request from the corresponding author. The patient teaching module is curriculum based and focuses on the EBPI provided within the decision aid. A single session targets a group of 4&#x02013;6 patients and is scheduled to take 90&#x02005;min. Educational elements are illustrating wall charts and worksheets. A magnet board is used for the visualisation of quantity risk with 100 orange and blue game pieces representing people with and without myocardial infarction.</p><p>During the teaching session, the diabetes educator guides through the decision-making process. This encompasses assessing each patient's individual heart attack risk, providing outcome probabilities of the available preventive options, and supporting patients to set and prioritise individual goals regarding smoking cessation, glucose control, blood pressure control and statin treatment. At the end of the teaching session, the diabetes educators use specific question cards to check patients&#x02019; understanding and to repeat information, if necessary. We conducted four test sessions and subsequent focus groups with a total of 24 participants with type 2 diabetes to pilot the teaching module.</p><p>The provider training comprises a training DVD and a training session that includes a demonstration of the patient teaching. The DVD is intended to prepare diabetes educators. It includes objectives and contents of the teaching, basic principles of SDM and an exemplary presentation of specific topics in the patient teaching. The provider training focuses on the EBPI provided within the decision aid and patient teaching. It also addresses the implementation of the patient teaching curriculum and the handling of the media. Piloting showed good overall feasibility.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Comparison</title><p>In order to achieve structural equivalence, a sham control intervention was applied. It comprised usual care supplemented with a 90&#x02005;min teaching module on sports, nutrition and stress issues. Before the teaching session, all participants received a brochure on stress management.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Diabetes educators were prepared for the teaching session with a brief provider training.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Procedure</title><p>In December 2012, two diabetes educators were trained in the ISDM-P by a research fellow of the University of Hamburg (SB). Two additional diabetes educators received the training for the control group (provided by JK). Each of both trainings lasted about 4&#x02005;hours.</p><p>The study was submitted for registration on 22 February 2013. Recruitment of patients started on 12 March 2013. Nevertheless, the registration was classified as retrospective because the date of payment was used as the date of finalised registration. We have notified the registration administrator to correct the classification from retrospective to prospective. We were informed that this was not possible. However, the administrator included an explanation in the registration protocol to testify that following the prospective submission, there were no subsequent changes to the protocol. The recruitment started after initiation of public registration.</p><p>The electronic patient records used for DMP documentation were screened for eligible patients. Eligible patients were marked on the records and asked for participation during the next consultation with their physician. Baseline data were extracted from the electronic patient records. After the patients had given informed consent they were randomised into one of the two study groups. Patients received either the decision aid or the brochure on stress management.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> An appointment within the next 2&#x02013;4&#x02005;weeks for the patient teaching was made. When the appointment failed, a new one was made. In order to ensure that the patients keep the appointment date, they were contacted by phone a few days before. At the end of the teaching session, patients documented their individual preferences on treatment goals regarding smoking cessation, HbA1c level, blood pressure control (systolic blood pressure) and statin treatment on standardised forms. Risk comprehension, including realistic expectations on the prevention of myocardial infarction, was assessed after the teaching session and at 6&#x02005;months follow-up. At follow-up, patients were asked to bring their medication boxes/pill packages to assess current medication. The overall trial end date was supposed to be December 2013. However, patient recruitment took longer than expected. The last patient was enrolled in June 2014; the last teaching session was conducted in October 2014; follow-up data were completed in March 2015.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Primary outcome was patients&#x02019; comprehension of relevant risk information after the teaching session. As outlined in the study protocol, risk comprehension was operationalised by the level of patient knowledge and understanding of the notion of risk, individual heart attack risk, and probabilities of benefits and harms of preventive treatment options, including realistic expectations.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> We used a 12-item standardised questionnaire with a subdomain of six items on realistic expectations. The questionnaire was designed based on the cognitive domain of Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives aimed to evaluate different levels of comprehension.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Each correctly answered item scored one point. We counted missing responses as wrong answers. Item analysis resulted in good test quality (Cronbach's &#x003b1;=0.87 for the total test, and 0.86 for the subdomain of realistic expectations).<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Comprehension, including realistic expectations, was additionally assessed as a secondary outcome measure at 6&#x02005;months follow-up. To avoid learning effects, comprehension and realistic expectations were not assessed at baseline.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Secondary outcome measures also comprised adherence to individual and prioritised treatment goals. Operationalisation of these outcomes is outlined in the study protocol.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> We used the following variables: (1) achievement of individual treatment goals regarding the use of statins, levels of office systolic blood pressure and HbA1c, and smoking; (2) achievement of the prioritised treatment goal; (3) medication uptake as reported by patients. The achievement of treatment goals was assessed by comparing statin uptake, office blood pressure values and HbA1c levels at follow-up with the treatment goals that the patients have set and prioritised at the end of the teaching session. Smoking status at follow-up was assessed by using the standardised interview question &#x02018;On how many of the past 30&#x02005;days did you smoke a cigarette?&#x02019; Patients were classified as smokers if the answer was one or more.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Sample size</title><p>We assumed patients in the ISDM group to answer 70% of the questionnaire correctly (8 out of 12 questions), compared with 50% in the control group (6 out of 12).

By estimating a non-responder/drop-out rate of about 15%, 154 participants needed to be recruited for randomisation.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>Randomisation was performed in permuted blocks of eight patients to ensure close balance of numbers of participants in each group and sufficient numbers of participants (n=4) in each teaching session. Allocation of patients was concealed and independently performed by the Centre for Clinical Studies at the Jena University Hospital. Potential participants were informed about the study aim to compare two approaches of patient information on the prevention of myocardial infarction. Patients were kept blinded to study group allocation, which was validated by asking patients at follow-up &#x02018;What do you think?

Group size varied between one and four patients. Twenty-four ISDM sessions were video-taped. Analyses did not reveal major barriers.

Mean duration was 87&#x02005;min (range 55&#x02013;138&#x02005;min). Using the tool for estimation of the heart attack risk and for calculating the individual benefit from statins were the most time consuming parts of the teaching session. The diabetes educators perceived the ISDM sessions as less interactive as the usual teaching sessions. They modified the page on glucose control of the wall chart to make the discussion more interactive.</p><p>In the control group, a total of 34 teaching sessions were conducted. Group size varied between one and five patients. Initially, diabetes educators felt uncomfortable with providing a sham intervention and appeared reluctant regarding the teaching contents for stress coping and the relaxation exercise. The research team discussed these issues with the diabetes educators and deliberated strategies to deal with them.</p><p>Blinding of patients was assessed among the last 100 patients (the first 43 patients were inadvertently not asked); 21 of 50 patients in the ISDM-P thought that they received the intervention, and 16 of 50 patients of the control group (Cohen's &#x003ba; coefficient k=0.10).</p><p>According to the protocol, patients who opt for a change in therapy should meet a physician after the teaching session.

As a result, most ISDM patients laid emphasis on blood pressure control rather than intensive blood glucose control. HbA1c levels and blood pressure values were already adjusted at low levels with no differences between groups. However, more patients in the ISDM group achieved their HbA1c goals, since they had set slightly higher HbA1c goals after the teaching. While in the ISDM group more patients wished to continue or to start statin treatment, in the control group more patients wished to stop it. Self-reported statin intake did not differ. It remains unclear if the patients really adhered to their statin medication. Nonetheless, the study results indicate that the ISDM-P not only effects comprehension and goal setting, but may also influence behaviour, such as treatment adherence.

Thus, the ISDM-P may not realign power imbalance between patients and their physicians.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Core concept of the ISDM-P was that diabetes educators would act as patient coaches. They were supposed to organise a consultation with the physician in case patients want to adjust treatment goals that require changes of drug therapy. However, self-reported statin intake remained unchanged although a relevant proportion of patients in the control group expressed a wish to not continue statin treatment. We have not analysed patient&#x02013;physician encounters in the present study. We could not validate self-reported adherence to statin treatment.</p><p>Based on these findings, we developed two additional components for the ISDM-P: (1) a single page documentation sheet for treatment goals, and (2) a structured SDM training module for physicians. Both are aimed at optimising the consultation in terms of SDM. First, patients document their treatment goals and thereafter, patients and physicians deliberate on these goals. In case the physician deviates from the patient's defined goals, the reasons are documented on the sheet. The patient keeps the original sheet and a copy is stored in the patient's record. We are evaluating the extended ISDM-P within a cluster randomised, controlled trial in the setting of family practices. We are assessing if patients are more adherent to medication when this is prescribed based on informed SDM.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All authors meet the ICMJE criteria for authorship.
