HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus type 1) and helminth infections can both compromise immune responses in humans. To determine whether the presence of helminth infection or the treatment of helminth infection alters unstimulated vaccine responses among HIV-1 infected individuals, we conducted two nested serologic studies. Blood samples were collected for HIV disease monitoring and vaccine-specific serologic assays, while stool was evaluated by direct microscopy methods. We compared antibody responses to measles and tetanus vaccines in helminth-infected (<italic>Ascaris</italic>, <italic>Trichuris</italic>, hookworm and/or <italic>Schistosoma mansoni)</italic> and uninfected adults 18&#x000a0;years and older (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;100). We also compared measles and tetanus antibody responses in <italic>Ascaris only</italic>-infected adults receiving 400&#x000a0;mg albendazole daily for 3&#x000a0;days (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;16) vs. placebo (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;19) in a separate study. In both cohorts, over 70% of participants had measles and tetanus responses above the protective threshold. Prevalence of measles responses were similar between helminth-infected and uninfected individuals (82%, 95% CI: 71&#x02013;93% vs 72%, 95% CI: 59&#x02013;85%), as well as log<sub>10</sub> tetanus antibody levels (&#x02212;&#x000a0;0.133&#x000a0;IU/mL vs &#x02212;&#x000a0;0.190&#x000a0;IU/mL, p&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;0.05), and did not differ by helminth species. In the <italic>Ascaris</italic>-infected cohort, changes in measles responses and tetanus responses did not differ between those who received anthelminthic vs. placebo (p&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;0.05 for both). In these studies, neither helminth infection, nor deworming, appeared to affect previously administered vaccine responsiveness in HIV-1 infected, ART na&#x000ef;ve, adults in Kenya.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Soil-transmitted helminth</kwd><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>Immunization</kwd><kwd>Vaccine preventable disease</kwd><kwd>Co-infection</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0005">While vaccine delivery programs have averted up to 2 to 3 million deaths each year, the burden of vaccine preventable diseases continues to be substantial and an additional 1.5 million deaths are likely avoidable.(<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2016</xref>) Immunizations are particularly important in HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infected individuals, where HIV progressively impairs immune function by depleting CD4&#x000a0;+ T-cell populations and cellular immunity, increasing susceptibility to many infectious diseases (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Okoye and Picker, 2013</xref>). Vaccine responses, including those against measles, wane faster and may be less effective among HIV infected compared to uninfected individuals (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Geretti et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Geretti and Doyle, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Belaunzaran-Zamudio et al., 2009</xref>). Even among populations with high vaccine uptake, HIV infected adults may demonstrate poor vaccine responsiveness. For example, despite relatively high vaccine coverage in many settings, in Brazil only 36% of HIV-1 infected adults had documented immunity to diphtheria and tetanus, while 7% of HIV-1-infected adults in the UKwere measles seronegative (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Molton et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Ho et al., 2008</xref>). As the number of individuals living with HIV continues to increase, optimizing immune responses to commonly administered vaccines is important among HIV infected populations and alternative intervention strategies to improve coverage or efficacy may be needed.</p><p id="p0010">Considerable geographic overlap exists between areas where HIV-1 and helminth infection are prevalent. Of the 22 million Africans estimated to be infected with HIV-1, many are likely co-infected with at least one species of helminth (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">UNAIDS and WHO, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">de Silva et al., 2003</xref>).

Studies of in vitro responses to vaccinations observed decreased Th1 cytokine responses (IL-2, IL-12, and IFN-&#x003b3;) among helminth infected compared to uninfected individuals, which are some markers of immunosuppression (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Elias et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Sabin et al., 1996</xref>).

If viral load was below the lower limit of detection (400&#x000a0;copies/mL) of the assay, half that value was inputed for analysis purposes. Plasma specimens from the final visit (24&#x000a0;months; concurrent with stool helminth testing) were used for vaccine-specific assays. One stool sample also collected at study completion was assessed with 2 slide preparations using direct helminth microscopy, Kato-Katz and formol-ether concentration, by a trained laboratory technologist. Vaccine-specific antibody responses were measured in duplicate and averaged using commercially available ELISA kits (Diagnostic Automation, Inc., Calabasas, CA, Measles: Cat#1408Z; Tetanus: Cat#8900Z). Measles responses were classified as positive, equivocal, or negative based on the manufacturer's protocol, then further dichotomized, including equivocal as negative, and compared by Chi-squared tests.

One stool sample collected at baseline and at follow-up was assessed with 2 slide preparations using direct helminth microscopy, Kato-Katz and formol-ether concentration, by a trained laboratory technologist. Vaccine-specific antibody responses were measured in duplicate and averaged using commercially available ELISA kits (same as study 1). Positive, equivocal, or negative measles responses were dichotomized, including equivocal as negative. An increase, no change, or decrease in measles seropositivity over 3&#x000a0;months was compared by treatment group using a Chi-squared test.

Most individuals had seropositive measles responses and all had protective levels of tetanus antibody suggesting preservation of vaccine responses despite both helminth and untreated HIV-1 infection. We did not detect a difference in vaccine-specific antibody responses by helminth infection or by species-specific helminth infection. Among <italic>Ascaris</italic>-infected HIV-1 infected individuals, we observed that measles responses did not increase following deworming compared to placebo. In addition, tetanus antibody levels were universally above the threshold of protection and levels of tetanus antibodies did not differ between dewormed vs. placebo recipients. In both analyses, adjusting for the predictors examined does not change the results. To our knowledge, other studies have not evaluated the association between helminths and vaccine responses specifically among HIV-1 infected adults.</p><p id="p0090">Kenya has had outbreaks of measles infection as recently as 2011, (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Mahamud et al., 2013</xref>). This underscores the importance of retaining measles immunity during adulthood in settings such as Kenya with episodic measles outbreaks. In this study, most (&#x0003e;&#x000a0;70%) of the HIV-1 and helminth co-infected individuals appear to have adequate immune protection against measles as confirmed by measles seropositivity. The seroprevalence we observed was lower than that seen in a recent study among a similar population of HIV-1 infected adults in Kenya (96%), as well as a study among HIV-1 infected adults in the UK (93%), and comparable to a study in Mexico (76%) (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Belaunzaran-Zamudio et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Molton et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Merkel et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="p0095">While this study did not reveal an association between vaccine-specific antibody responses and helminth infection with <italic>Ascaris</italic>, <italic>Trichuris</italic>, hookworm and/or <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic>, there are several limitations to the analysis that should be noted. First, the participants in these studies represent a more &#x0201c;immune competent&#x0201d; population of HIV infected adults than might be seen in the general population, since these individuals were ART na&#x000ef;ve and did not qualify for ART based on the guidelines at the time. This is evident by the mean CD4 count of the included participants. The proportion of individuals who initiated ART was higher in the UK and Mexico studies noted above (81% and 95%, respectively), while all participants in our study and the other Kenyan study were ART na&#x000ef;ve. The fact that the participants included in this study may have been more immunocompetent, despite not being on ART may have limited our ability to detect a suppressive effect due to helminth infection.</p><p id="p0100">In addition, it is important to note that these were unstimulated responses. Memory B cells do not actively secrete antibodies until triggered, while plasma cells continually secrete antibody without further stimulation (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Amanna and Slifka, 2010</xref>). Additionally, antibodies specific to many childhood vaccines are detectable in plasma from adults who received vaccinations in early childhood (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Amanna et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Amanna and Slifka, 2010</xref>). Among healthy individuals, the half-life of tetanus specific serum antibody production is approximately 11&#x000a0;years, while for measles it may be maintained for life (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Amanna et al., 2007</xref>). Plasma cell secretion in these individuals may persist despite large systemic immune perturbations due to HIV-1 and helminth infection. However, this study cannot speak to the impact of these helminths on stimulated immune cells such as memory B cells. Additionally, the study cannot speak to the impact of these helminths on Th1 cytokine responses because we were unable to look at antigen-specific T cell responses.</p><p id="p0105">Our results also do not exclude a possible association between these helminths and responses to vaccination. Even without circulating antibodies, vaccine-specific memory B cells can provide protective immunity following infection (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Amanna and Slifka, 2011</xref>). Studies of post-vaccination responses to BCG and an oral cholera vaccine among helminth infected individuals observed improved vaccine responses following albendazole versus placebo prior to vaccination (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Elias et al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al., 2000</xref>). Additionally, post-vaccination antibody responses to tetanus were lower in <italic>Onchocerca</italic>-infected compared to helminth uninfected individuals (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al., 1998</xref>). Finally, the effects of HIV-1 infection may outweigh effects of helminth infection on vaccine responses. In a study among 90 HIV-1 infected children, spontaneous seroconversion of measles and tetanus vaccine responses were detected 6&#x000a0;months after ART initiation without revaccination (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Farquhar et al., 2009</xref>). We did not see a similar effect following deworming with albendazole in our study, though the time intervals differ between studies.</p><p id="p0110">While we did adjust for possible confounders, we may have been unable to detect some potential confounders due to differences in data collection instruments used in both studies that may have resulted in the inability to include all socio-economic data in the analyses. Additionally, these studies had limited power to detect potentially meaningful differences in vaccine responses. We were also unable to evaluate whether these helminths altered recall of vaccine responses since these were previously collected samples from studies that were not designed to study responses to vaccination. This study also only evaluated the impact of a specific group of helminths and other species of helminths might have been present but not identified. Finally, this study relied on direct microscopy methods, which are less sensitive at detecting light intensity infections.</p><p id="p0115">In this analysis, we observed that most HIV-1-infected adults in our cohorts had protective responses to measles and tetanus vaccines, and helminth infection with <italic>Ascaris</italic>, <italic>Trichuris</italic>, hookworm and/or <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> was not associated with differences in pre-existing vaccine-specific antibody responses. Whether helminth infection with <italic>Ascaris</italic>, <italic>Trichuris</italic>, hookworm and/or <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> at the time of vaccination alters responses to vaccination among HIV-1 infected adults is still unclear. Another important question is whether helminth infection with <italic>Ascaris</italic>, <italic>Trichuris</italic>, hookworm and/or <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> alters vaccine responses in HIV-1-infected children, who are more likely to harbor helminth infections compared to adults, often have greater intensities of helminth infection, may receive vaccinations while helminth infected, and have diminished vaccine responses due to HIV-1 infection. Further studies in children are recommended to determine the influence of these helminths and deworming on vaccine efficacy, particularly among HIV-1-infected children who could be easily dewormed through HIV-1 care and treatment services (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Gerns et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Amanna</surname><given-names>I.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Slifka</surname><given-names>M.K.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Mechanisms that determine plasma cell lifespan and the duration of humoral immunity</article-title><source>Immunol.
