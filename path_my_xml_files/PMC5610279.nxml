The present study was designed to investigate the antihypertensive efficacy of monotherapy with amlodipine or HCTZ and their effects on electrolyte profile in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A single-blind randomized clinical study was used; fifty patients newly diagnosed with mild to moderate hypertension (aged 33 to 60 years) were recruited and divided into two groups: amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide each comprising of 25 subjects. The subjects received 5mg of amlodipine or 25mg of hydrochlorothiazide in their respective group once daily for 4 weeks. Blood pressure, serum and urine electrolytes were measured at baseline and weekly throughout the experiment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>At the end of follow up, amlodipine reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure significantly more (p&#x0003c;0.001) than HCTZ. At the end of follow up, blood pressure was reduced to normal in 80% of the subjects in amlodipine group compared to 50% in HCTZ. Amlodipine had no significant effect on electrolyte profile of subjects unlike HCTZ which significantly changed both their serum and urine electrolytes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Monotherapy with amlodipine was more effective than HCTZ in black patients with mild to moderate hypertension and in addition maintained electrolyte balance.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hypertension is a globally common condition that contributes to preventable disease and death.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Essential hypertension is the most common cardiovascular disease among black Africans<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and it is also a significant cause of adult morbidity and mortality.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The recommended initial treatment for hypertension in non-black subjects may involve the administration of either angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), calcium channel blockers or thiazide-type diuretic, while the recommended treatment for black hypertensive subjects was with either the calcium channel blockers (such as amlodipine) or with the thiazide-type diuretics (such as HCTZ).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> An earlier guideline recommended the use of thiazide diuretics in the treatment of uncomplicated hypertension, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other classes of anti-hypertensive drugs.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, a trial that evaluated this guideline found that a combination therapy with amlodipine was more efficacious at reducing blood pressure in high-risk patients than a combination therapy with HCTZ.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Amlodipine and HCTZ are commonly prescribed in Nigeria as monotherapy and in combination with other antihypertensive drugs.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Amlodipine monotherapy was reported to have achieved similar reduction in blood pressure in elderly patients as a combination therapy with HCTZ.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Similarly, a previous study among Nigerians with essential hypertension showed that amlodipine was a more effective than HCTZ in reducing blood pressure.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Hydrochlorothiazide was reported to produce significant adverse effects on the potassium levels of the subjects while amlodipine was neutral.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Hyponatremia and hypokalemia were observed during the initiation of hydrochlorothiazide therapy in type 2 diabetic hypertensive Nigerian subjects, while amlodipine caused no significant clinical biochemical abnormality in their electrolyte profiles.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The effects of amlodipine and HCTZ on electrolyte profile of black patients with mild to moderate hypertension remain poorly understood.

At the end of follow up, blood pressure was reduced to normal in 80% of the subjects in amlodipine group compared to 50% in HCTZ. The efficacy of these drugs in the present study was higher than that earlier reported in a Nigerian population where monotherapy using 5 mg of amlodipine daily achieved 40% reduction to normal BP while 25mg of HCTZ daily produced 35% reduction to normal BP.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The increased efficacy seen in the present study may be due to shorter duration of treatment and adequate monitoring of compliance via phone calls employed. Our study lasted for 4 weeks compared to 6 weeks in the above study and prolonged use of these drugs has been shown to produce lower antihypertensive effect<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>; monitoring of compliance was not indicated in the previous study whereas phone calls were used to monitor and ensure compliance in the present study. There was no significant difference between the antihypertensive efficacy of amlodipine and HCTZ in the previous Nigerian study whereas a significant difference between their efficacies was observed in this study. Apart from other factors mentioned above, the age of the subjects may be a contributing factor; the mean age of our subjects (48 years) was lower than that of the previous study (55 years) and HCTZ has been shown to become more effective with increasing age.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The greater efficacy of amlodipine observed in the present study also agrees with earlier studies by Calvoet et al.,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> which reported that amlodipine was significantly more effective than hydrochlorothiazide in reducing sitting blood pressure in patients with isolated systolic hypertension. The efficacy of amlodipine in the present study also agrees with previous reports that monotherapy with nifedipine (a calcium channel blocker) was efficacious among Nigerians.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The only side effect observed in both groups was polyuria, both drugs were tolerated among the subjects. Polyuria was due to diuretic action of HCTZ and renal vasodilatation caused by amlodipine.</p><p>Amlodipine caused no significant changes in serum electrolytes whereas HCTZ significantly reduced Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> from their baseline levels. These results agree with that from an earlier study.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Our results were also similar to those obtained from an earlier study where amlodipine was also reported to maintain electrolyte balance even among diabetic hypertensive patients.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The results of the present study were also similar to those reported in earlier studies.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Treatment with HCTZ significantly increased urine electrolytes of the subjects in the present study; this similar to earlier reports where HCTZ produced increase in urine electrolytes in patients with essential hypertension.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The corresponding increase in urine electrolytes suggests that they were lost from blood.</p><p>In conclusion, short-term monotherapy with amlodipine was more effective than hydrochlorothiazide in mild to moderate hypertensive Nigerians; it did not cause electrolyte imbalance unlike HCTZ. These results suggest that amlodipine may be safer as a monotherapy in black essential hypertensive subjects.</p><sec><title>Recommendation</title><p>There is need to review the current management strategy in Nigeria where diuretics especially thiazide diuretics are mainly prescribed as the first line drugs in treatment of hypertension. Amlodipine should be the first line drug since it is more effective and did not cause electrolyte imbalance; it is also affordable just like hydrochlorothiazide.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>All authors declare that they have no competing interests related to this work.</p></sec><ref-list><ref
