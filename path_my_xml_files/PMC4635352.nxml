The latter is a serious dose-limiting side effect that can often lead to withdrawal of treatment. We have developed a rat model expressing both phases and used the model to investigate the action of goshajinkigan (GJG), a traditional Japanese herbal medicine, which was reported to ameliorate oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy in a placebo-controlled double-blind randomized phase II study. In this study, neuropathy was induced by injection of oxaliplatin twice weekly for 8 wks. The maximum level of cold hyperesthesia was observed at 4 wks with heat hypoesthesia developing later. Microscopy studies revealed atrophy of axons of myelinated sciatic nerve fibers in oxaliplatin-treated rats at 8 wks. Co-administration of GJG ameliorated both abnormal sensations as well as histological damage to the sciatic nerve. A pharmacokinetic study revealed numerous neuroprotective components of GJG that are rapidly absorbed into the blood. GJG and some of its components attenuated the generation of oxaliplatin-induced reactive oxygen species, which is a possible mechanism of oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity. The present study provides a useful animal model for oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity as well as a promising prophylactic agent.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Peripheral neuropathy is a well known frequent adverse effect of oxaliplatin treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.

Therefore, perception of heat may be a useful method to evaluate abnormal sensations resulting from oxaliplatin-induced chronic neuropathy. A previous report observed that peripheral blood flow was also altered in oxaliplatin-treated animals, which might correlate with neurotoxicity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. In addition, several studies have suggested that increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to treatment with oxaliplatin can lead to the onset of neurotoxicity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.</p><p>Goshajinkigan (GJG), a traditional Japanese herbal medicine, has been widely used to treat disease-associated neuropathy (i.e., diabetic neuropathy)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Recently, the preventive effect of GJG against oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neurotoxicity in a placebo-controlled double-blind randomized phase II study (the GONE Study) was reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Animal investigations also demonstrated that GJG suppresses oxaliplatin-induced cold hyperalgesia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. However, all of these studies were conducted using acute rather than chronic models.</p><p>In the present study, we first examined the effect of oxaliplatin-treatment for a period of 8 wks on the perception of heat and cold stimulation as well as on histopathology and peripheral blood flow using rats. Second, we evaluated the effects of GJG on oxaliplatin-induced chronic neurotoxicity. Third, pharmacokinetic studies of GJG and the effects of GJG and its components on oxaliplatin-induced ROS generation were performed to explore the mechanism of the observed beneficial effect of GJG.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>GJG ameliorated cold hyperesthesia and heat hypoesthesia induced by oxaliplatin</title><p>Treatment with oxaliplatin (4&#x02009;mg/kg, intraperitoneally, twice weekly) significantly increased the duration of withdrawal responses to cold stimulation by acetone at 4, 6, and 8 wks, compared to the na&#x000ef;ve control. GJG (0.3 or 1.0&#x02009;g/kg, p.o.) prevented cold hyperalgesia induced by oxaliplatin at 4 wks but not 6 and 8 wks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). In the hot plate test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>), there was no significant difference in the latency of withdrawal to heat stimulation among all the groups at 4 wks after oxaliplatin treatment. Thereafter, that in the oxaliplatin-treated group compared to the na&#x000ef;ve control gradually increased. A statistically significant difference was obtained at 6 wks and 8 wks, at the level of p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 and &#x0003c;0.01, respectively. These data suggest that cold hyperalgesia is rapidly induced and maintained, while heat hypoesthesia develops more slowly. The groups co-administered with GJG at the dose of 0.3 or 1.0&#x02009;g/kg (p.o.) gave no significant change in the withdrawal responses to heat stimulation compared with the na&#x000ef;ve control groups throughout the experimental periods. In particular, at 8 wks, the withdrawal responses to heat stimulation of 1.0&#x02009;g/kg of GJG-treated group were significantly lower than those of the oxaliplatin-treated group. Next, we examined whether motor impairment is involved in the effects induced by oxaliplatin and/or GJG treatment. The effect of oxaliplatin on motor coordination was examined by a rotarod test. After treatment with oxaliplatin for 8 wks, there were no significant differences in motor coordination among the tested groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). In the wire screen hanging test of muscle strength, no significant differences in the performances of the different groups of rats were observed when the wire screen was inclined to either 90&#x000b0; or 180&#x000b0; for 20&#x02009;seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>GJG prevented oxaliplatin-induced damage of myelinated axons in the sciatic nerve</title><p>In vehicle-treated rats, no histological changes to sciatic nerve were observed by light and electron microscopy at 8 wks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,d</xref>).

Examination by electron microscopy showed that oxaliplatin caused atrophy of axons of myelinated fibers in the sciatic nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). There were no notable morphological changes of non-myelinated nerve fibers in the sciatic nerves between the control and oxaliplatin groups (data not shown).

Next, we attempted to clarify the active components in GJG. Thus, we examined the effect of eight compounds derived from GJG on oxaliplatin-induced ROS generation.

Cold hyperesthesia was established after 4 wks of oxaliplatin treatment and persisted at least until the end of the study period (i.e., 8 wks). By contrast, the onset of heat hypoesthesia occurred more slowly, with a significant alteration in heat sensitivity evident only after 6 wks, and still developing at 8 wks. The damage to myelinated axons in the sciatic nerve was clearly observed at 8 wks. Peripheral blood flow decreased at 4 wks but thereafter returned to normal levels. Although GJG showed ameliorating effects for all these symptoms, we believe these side-effects may occur <italic>via</italic> different mechanisms.</p><p>In clinical practice, acute oxaliplatin-induced hypersensitivity to cold stimuli is generally observed shortly after the commencement of oxaliplatin therapy. Several reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> suggest enhanced response of transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), a polymodal ion channel sensitive to cold temperature and chemical stimuli, is involved in the pathogenesis of oxaliplatin-induced acute cold hyperalgesia and that therapies targeting transient receptor potential (TRP) channels may be beneficial. We<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> and Kato <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> have reported the possibility that GJG ameliorates cold hyperalgesia <italic>via</italic> modulation of function and expression, respectively, of TRP channels.</p><p>Compared to the rapid expression of cold hyperesthesia, there is a delay in the development of peripheral sensory neuropathy such as pain, numbness and tingling (typically in the hands and feet)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. The latter neuropathy, including heat and mechanical hypoesthesia/dysesthesia, is known to be closely related to the cumulative dose of oxaliplatin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. The neuropathy is thought to be related to damage in the peripheral sensory nerves<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> which, in the present study, is clearly evident by histological changes to the sciatic nerve. The suppression, or at least retardation, in the development of sensory nerve damage by GJG may contribute to the amelioration of heat hypoesthesia. Thus, direct protection of neuronal cells by components of GJG, rather than modulation of the TRPA1 channel, could to be involved in the amelioration of the later phase neuropathy. Although chronic peripheral neuropathy is the most serious problem associated with oxaliplatin therapy, there is no available appropriate animal model to examine oxaliplatin-induced hypoesthesia. Therefore, the present model, showing both heat hypoesthesia and cold hyperesthesia with preserved motor function, may be a good model of human symptoms caused by long-term oxaliplatin administration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p><p>Despite the number of studies on oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy, there are relatively few that have focused on the derangement of peripheral blood flow. Although a possible relationship between mechanical allodynia and decreased blood flow has been suggested<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, the significance and pathophysiology of blood flow disorder in oxaliplatin-treated patients remains unclear. GJG and its components have been reported to show vasodilatation in several models partly <italic>via</italic> increasing nitric oxide production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. A similar mechanism may be involved in the vasodilatation by GJG observed in the present experiments. However, a future extensive study to clarify the mechanisms and significance of the effect is needed.</p><p>Light and electron microscopy studies revealed scattered axonal damage in sciatic nerves of the oxaliplatin group. Our observations suggested that oxaliplatin induces axonal degeneration in the sciatic nerve. Indeed, these structural changes are consistent with a previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. The morphological damage to mitochondria induced by oxaliplatin may result in mitochondrial dysfunction, which could increase oxidative stress in peripheral nerve tissue during chemotherapy. Recent studies demonstrated that treatment with oxaliplatin increased ROS production and induced lipid peroxidation and protein and DNA oxidation in neuronal cells and peripheral nerve tissue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.</p><p>Furthermore, the administration of several compounds with antioxidant properties, such as curcumin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> and quercetin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, improved oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy. These reports suggested that oxidative stress is responsible for oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy. Thus, oxidative stress could play an important role in our chronic neuropathy model, and treatment with antioxidants may be useful in preventing oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity.</p><p>In the pharmacokinetic study of GJG, we confirmed that eight components of GJG were rapidly absorbed, some of them at high concentrations, in rat plasma after oral administration of GJG. Some of these components are thought to possess neuroprotective and antiradical activities. MO, LO and PF have been reported to attenuate ROS production, decrease mitochondrial membrane potential and inhibit apoptosis induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or amyloid &#x003b2; 25&#x02013;35 peptide in SHSY-5Y cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. CA and MO have been reported to have neuroprotective activity by suppressing ROS generation in other experimental systems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Furthermore, direct ROS scavenging action was observed for PF using electron spin resonance assay<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Therefore, we investigated whether these eight compounds inhibit intracellular ROS generation induced by oxaliplatin using mouse neuroblastoma neuro2A cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>, dichloro (1,2-diaminocyclohexane) platinum (Pt(dach)Cl<sub>2</sub>, data not shown), an active metabolite of oxaliplatin, increased ROS generation in neuro2A cells, but oxalate, another metabolite of oxaliplatin, did not (data not shown). These results suggest that oxaliplatin increases ROS generation due to Pt(dach)Cl<sub>2</sub> but not oxalate. Among the tested components, LO, MO, PF and 14-AA, as well as GJG, significantly reduced ROS generation. In particular, MO showed the strongest action among these active components. The results suggest that these active components may be involved in the preventive effects of GJG on oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity <italic>via</italic> suppression of ROS generation. However, these four compounds alone may not be sufficient to fully explain the potent anti-ROS activity of GJG because their respective concentrations in 30&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml GJG will be far less than 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M (i.e., around 0.3&#x02009;&#x003bc;M (MO); for more detail, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary method</xref>). It is plausible that GJG contains additional untested and/or unidentified antiradical components. Alternatively, the combination of various components of GJG might exert a synergistic effect beyond the simple sum of the activities of each individual compound.</p><p>MO, LO and CA reached a maximum plasma concentration between 30 and 60&#x02009;minutes after oral administration of GJG and the high concentration was then maintained for 4&#x02009;hours. In a previous report, rats injected with 5&#x02009;mg/kg of oxaliplatin intraperitoneally showed a maximum plasma concentration of platinum approximately 90&#x02009;minutes after administration, which was maintained for 2&#x02009;hours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Oral administration of GJG with simultaneous intraperitoneal injection of oxaliplatin showed a preventive effect for oxaliplatin neuropathy in rats. This preventive effect of GJG could be explained by absorption of the neuroprotective components found in GJG that reached the DRG before oxalate and Pt(dach)Cl<sub>2</sub>&#x02009;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Oxaliplatin-induced chronic neuropathy may be caused by accumulation of platinum and active metabolites in neuronal cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Taken together, these lines of evidence indicate that GJG should be administered orally before oxaliplatin in order to efficiently exert the preventive effect of GJG.</p><p>We have conducted Phase II and III trials to investigate whether GJG ameliorates the adverse effects of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy. The Phase II trial showed GJG exhibited a promising effect on the neuropathy but the Phase III trial did not. It is obviously important to understand why such different outcomes were obtained from the two trials. The present results may help to shed some light on this apparent discrepancy. Specifically, the treatment protocols in the clinical studies did not consider the pharmacokinetic data of the GJG components. Thus, these trials may not have taken into account the most effective timing for GJG administration. In particular, the Phase III trial was a multicenter study in which the timing of GJG administration was not strictly controlled due to the lack of detail in the protocol. However, a human pharmacokinetic study of GJG is scheduled to begin shortly, which will be followed by a new clinical study.</p><p>Oxaliplatin produces antitumor effects by platinum accumulation in tumor cells. Clearly, oxaliplatin-induced chronic neuropathy symptoms must be ameliorated without affecting its antitumor action, even though chronic neuropathy is a serious clinical problem. In reports on clinical or basic research, GJG did not affect the antitumor efficacy of oxaliplatin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Indeed, the present results indicate that GJG does not alter the accumulation of platinum in rat DRG. Thus, our findings suggest neuroprotection by GJG is not due to the inhibition of platinum accumulation.</p><p>In conclusion, we have developed a quantitatively evaluable chronic model of hypoesthesia occurring in rats treated long-term with oxaliplatin. The oral administration of GJG prevented functional and histological disorders of chronic oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity without inhibiting the accumulation of platinum. A pharmacokinetic study showed that several neuroprotective compounds were detected at high levels in rat plasma shortly after the oral administration of GJG. In particular, four compounds of GJG, including MO and LO, inhibited oxaliplatin-induced ROS production in neuro2A cells. The present study provides a useful model for the elucidation of oxaliplatin-induced chronic neuropathy and affords some insights on the mechanism of action of GJG.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Animals</title><p>Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200&#x02013;400&#x02009;g (Japan SLC, Shizuoka, Japan) were kept at a temperature of 23&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, relative humidity of 50&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;20%, and a 12-hour light/dark cycle.

The sciatic nerves were rapidly dissected, and the samples were kept overnight in the same fixative at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. The fixed fibers were post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide solution for 3&#x02009;hours, dehydrated in a graded alcohol series, and embedded in Epon815. For light microscopy, semi-thin sections were cut from each block and stained with toluidine blue. The stained sections were observed using a light microscope (BX60, Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan). For electron microscopy, ultra-thin sections were cut and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The stained sections were observed under an electron microscope (model H-7650; Hitachi High-Technologies Corp., Tokyo, Japan). To calculate the ratio of degenerated myelinated nerve fibers, electron micrographs were taken at low magnification (&#x000d7;200). The numbers of normal- and degenerated-myelinated nerve fibers were counted in the area of 0.05&#x02009;mm<sup>2</sup> (0.01&#x02009;mm<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;5 areas), and the ratio of degenerated nerve fibers was calculated as the percentage of total nerve fibers in each group.
