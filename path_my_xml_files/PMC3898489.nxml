Recommended iron supplementation dose does not preempt anemia in around 20% of the pregnancies, nor the risk of hemoconcentration in 15%. This deficit, or excess, of iron prejudices the mother-child wellbeing. Therefore the aims of the study are to determine the highest level of effectiveness of iron supplementation adapted to hemoglobin (Hb) levels in early pregnancy, which would be optimum for mother-child health.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p><italic>Design</italic>: Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) triple-blinded</p><p><italic>Setting</italic>: 10 Primary Care Centers from Catalunya (Spain)</p><p><italic>Study subjects</italic>: 878 non-anemic pregnant women at early gestation stage, and their subsequent newborns</p><p><italic>Methods</italic>: The study is structured as a RCT with 2 strata, depending on the Hb levels before week 12 of gestation.

Also, there is a frequent risk of hemoconcentrations in about 15% of pregnancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Ferropenic anemia during pregnancy has been related to an increase in risk of low birth weight of the newborn, premature birth, or less cognitive development of the child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, hemoconcentration, defined in a recent Cochrane review as values of hemoglobin &#x0003e;130&#x000a0;g/L at the 2nd trimester of gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], has been associated with prejudicial effects in the mother and fetus. These include preeclampsia and oxidative stress in the mother [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], as well as an increase in premature birth, low birth weight, and small-for-gestational-age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] of the fetus.</p><p>Also, low birth weight and general poor neonatal health have also been associated with environmental factors such as tobacco consumption, toxic environment, low socio-economic status, and prenatal psychological status of the mother e.g. high levels of anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These factors, and others related to the process of iron supplementation and the effects on mother and child, need to be controlled in studies investigating iron levels and pregnancy.</p><p>Prophylactic iron supplements are prescribed to avoid iron deficiency during pregnancy. The health authorities of Spain recommend an iron supplementation of 30&#x000a0;mg/d for non-anemic pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, since this dose is not currently marketed, obstetricians recommend a dose of around 40&#x000a0;mg/d of iron.</p><p>However, there is still no consensus on the best dose, nor schedule of iron supplementation, to prevent its deficiency during pregnancy, without provoking hemoconcentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The lack of evidence on the best pattern of iron supplementation could correspond to other factors, apart from the dietary intake of iron, such as iron status of the woman during the first trimester [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], or the presence of a genetic alteration that modifies the intestinal absorption of iron.</p><p>With respect to iron status during the first trimester, when gestation begins with low levels of iron, the percentage of women with deficit at the end of pregnancy is much greater [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. On the other hand, high levels of hemoglobin at the start of pregnancy in women taking high dose supplements (&#x0003e;60&#x000a0;mg/d) increases the risk of hemoconcentration by the end of gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>With respect to genetic alterations, the presence of the C282Y and H63D polymorphisms in the HFE gene have been associated with higher levels of hemoglobin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]; a situation that can be aggravated if the individual is prescribed daily supplements of iron.</p><p>These factors (initial iron status and genetic alternations together with dietary intake and iron supplements) can explain the presence of different subpopulations of pregnant women, all having different iron needs during pregnancy. As a consequence, a prescribed iron dose modified to the individual&#x02019;s characteristics would be needed to obtain optimum benefit.</p><p>There have been some studies that evaluated the effect of different doses of iron on iron deficiency as a function of the woman&#x02019;s initial hemoglobin concentration but none, to the best of our knowledge, have also take into account possible iron excess and adverse effects on the newborn.</p><p>Hemoglobin is an ideal parameter to classify the women as a function of iron status, due to the high correlation with the levels of serum ferritin and with the presence of genetic alterations in the HFE gene. These measurements are relatively easy and quick, and are already used systematically in standard clinical practice, and in pregnancy follow-up.</p><p>Our hypotheses are that:</p><p>1) In women without anemia at the start of the pregnancy, with normal hemoglobin values of between 110&#x02013;130&#x000a0;g/L, an iron intake of 40 or 80&#x000a0;mg/d, depending on the initial serum ferritin levels and on the presence of genetic alterations in the HFE gene, would be more effective in preventing iron deficiency, without increasing the risk of hemoconcentration by the end of pregnancy. This would help optimize mother-child health status.</p><p>2) In women without anemia and with normal-high values of hemoglobin of &#x0003e;130&#x000a0;g/L, an iron intake of 20 or 40&#x000a0;mg/d, depending on the initial serum ferritin levels and on the presence of genetic alterations in the HFE gene, will be more effective in ameliorating the risk of hemoconcentration by the end of the pregnancy, without leading to iron deficiency.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>The objective of the study is to determine the best grade of effectiveness (on mother-newborn health status), of an iron supplement adapted to the hemoglobin levels at the start of the pregnancy, relative to the usually-prescribed dose.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Trial design</title><p>Multi-centered, parallel groups, controlled, triple blind, randomized clinical trial (RCT) subdivided in 2 strata as a function of the hemoglobin (Hb) levels at the start of the pregnancy:</p><p>&#x02013; Stratum #1: If the levels of Hb are situated between 110 and 130&#x000a0;g/L, the individual will be randomly assigned to an iron dose supplement of 40 or 80&#x000a0;mg/d</p><p>&#x02013; Stratum #2: If the levels of Hb are &#x0003e;130&#x000a0;g/L, the individual will be randomly assigned to an iron dose supplement of 40 or 20&#x000a0;mg/d</p><p>The overall design of the study is summarized in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.

The risk factors of pregnancy to be considered as exclusion criteria are: adverse obstetric history, previous uterine surgery, heart disease grade 2, 3 or 4, endocrinopathy, suspected fetal malformation, morbid obesity, preeclampsia, maternal infection, uterine malformation, perinatal recurrent death, alcoholism, diabetes 1 and 2, uterine cervical incompetence.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>The clinical follow-up of the pregnancy in the PCC will be according to the program set by RHS. This includes a clinical visit at recruitment into the present study, a visit every trimester, and one at 40 days post-partum (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>In the recruitment visit before week 12 of the pregnancy, the inclusion criteria will be assessed (except the Hb levels and the number of fetuses) as well as the exclusion criteria. Informed consent will be solicited. A clinical history will be recorded, as will a questionnaire regarding the ingestion of iron supplements, multi-vitamins, or other treatments (Drugs_Q) and, if a smoker, the Fagerstrom test for tobacco dependency. A blood sample for standard biochemical analyses (including hemoglobin) will be sent for processing in the centralized laboratory.</p><p>At visit 1, around the 12th week of gestation, Hb levels will be evaluated as will be the number of fetuses (using echography) to confirm that the inclusion criteria are fulfilled. If fulfilled, the individuals will be retained in the study and, if not, will be transferred out of the study, and considered a screening failure. The remaining women will be assigned to Stratum #1 or Stratum #2 of the study and will be randomized with respect to iron supplement prescription. Clinical history will be taken, including the use of multi-vitamins and iron supplements (on the questionnaire abbreviated as &#x0201c;Drugs_Q&#x0201d;) and the following questionnaires filled-in: Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ); International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ); State-Trait of Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Fagerstrom questionnaire (Fagerstrom_Q). The ultrasound data on the fetus will be recorded. Venous blood will be taken for analyses, the results of which will be reviewed in the next clinical visit. The iron supplementation that will be needed at the next visit will be prepared for distribution. Adverse events occurring since the previous visit will be recorded.</p><p>At visit 2, around week 24 of gestation, clinical history will be taken, and will include the Drugs_Q, which, from this visit onwards, includes the adherence to the iron supplementation prescribed. The following questionnaires are filled-in: FFQ; IPAQ; STAI, Fagerstrom_Q. The fetal ultrasound data will be registered. The biochemical analyses/results will be reviewed and a further blood sample taken for analysis, the results of which will be reviewed at the next clinical visit. The iron supplementation that will be needed at the next visit will be prepared for distribution. Adverse events occurring since the previous visit will be recorded.</p><p>At visit 3, around week 36 of gestation, the clinical history will be taken, the Drugs_Q as well as the FFQ; IPAQ; STAI, Fagerstrom_Q questionnaires will be filled-in. The fetal ultrasound data will be recorded and the biochemical results will be evaluated. A further blood sample will be taken for analyses, the results of which will be discussed at the next clinical visit.</p><p>The iron supplementation that will be needed at the next visit will be prepared for distribution. Adverse events occurring since the previous visit will be recorded.</p><p>At visit 4 (40&#x000a0;days post-partum), the clinical history will be taken, the Drugs_Q and the FFQ; IPAQ; STAI; Fagerstrom_Q questionnaires will be filled-in. A questionnaire on post-partum depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; EPDS) and the Parenting Stress Index (PSI) will be applied. The standard laboratory analyses results will be discussed. A further blood sample will be taken for analyses. Data on birth and the newborn will be recorded (weight and height). Clinical history of the baby will be recorded, including: anthropometric data (weight, height, head circumference) and cognitive development will be assessed (Bayley III), as well as behavioral and temperament (Early Infancy Temperament Questionnaire; EITQ). Adverse events occurring since the previous visit will be recorded.</p><sec><title>Iron supplementation</title><p>Starting from around the 12th week of gestation and continuing up to partum, adherence to prescription will be recorded. The dose assignments will be random and followed-up blind for each RCT stratum. The principal active ingredient is ferrimanitol ovoalbumin. The doses of 20&#x000a0;mg, 40&#x000a0;mg and 80&#x000a0;mg per day of elemental iron correspond to 150&#x000a0;mg, 300&#x000a0;mg and 600&#x000a0;mg ferrimanitol ovoalbumin. The reference dose is 40&#x000a0;mg/d, similar to that routinely prescribed in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Biological samples of the RCT</title><p>The blood extractions at visits 1, 3 and at birth, will be more than are normally taken for biological analyses in a RCT. This is because slightly larger amounts are required for subsequent analyses such as specialized biochemical measurements (ferritin, cortisol) and genetics (C282Y and H63D of the HFE gene). These samples will be treated and stored for subsequent analyses in the BioBank of the reference hospital of the participating PCCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Participant withdrawal</title><p>Participants will be free to withdraw from the trial at any time, and without the need to provide any reason. The information that may already have been collected on participants will still be used. Withdrawal from the study will not affect the standard of care received from the practice. If participants withdraw before randomization, they will be replaced by an appropriate substitute.</p><p>The pregnancies diagnosed as anemic during the RCT will have the iron supplementation from the RCT changed, and will be treated according to the standard clinical practice protocol. These women will continue forming part of the study and will have the same follow-up, except they will be considered as therapeutic failures in the intent-to-treat statistical analyses, and will not be taken into account in the protocol analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Discontinuation visit</title><p>This visit will take place only in case of the participant&#x02019;s withdrawal from the study at any time outside the scheduled timetable. The exact date and reason for discontinuation will be registered. If possible, the healthcare professional will assess the woman&#x02019;s health status via clinical history notes, and an ultrasound. A blood sample will be solicited for routine tests. The adherence to the iron supplementation up until the discontinuation of the treatment will be recorded, as will any adverse events. All the questionnaires will be filled-in, including: FFQ; IPAQ; STAI, Fagerstrom_Q. In case of having given birth, all the variables related to delivery and the newborn will be collected and a questionnaire on post-partum depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; EPDS) and the Parenting Stress Index (PSI) will be applied.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><sec><title>Primary outcomes</title><p>Principal variables in the pregnancy are iron status of the mother at each clinical visit (anemia, ferropenic anemia, risk of hemoconcentration) and birth weight of the baby.</p><p>Definition of main outcome variables</p><p>&#x02013; Anemia is defined as Hb &#x0003c;110&#x000a0;g/L in the 1st and 3rd trimester, Hb &#x0003c;105 in 2nd trimester, Hb &#x0003c;120&#x000a0;g/L post-partum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>&#x02013; Ferropenic anemia is defined as: Hb &#x0003c; the normal limit, and serum ferritin (SF) &#x0003c;15&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>&#x02013; Hemoconcentration risk is defined as: Hb &#x0003e;130&#x000a0;g/L in the 2nd and 3rd trimester [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Participant timeline</title><p>Clinical follow-up of the pregnancy in the PCC will be according to the program set by ASSIR.

Linear multiple regression models will be applied for dependent quantitative variables. The models will be adjusted for those variables that biologically affect the relationships studied, such as the serum ferritin levels, presence of alterations in the HFE gene, age of the mother, gestational age, parity, anthropometric indices, diet, and lifestyle, and the interactions between these variables. Initially included in the model will be all those variables that form part of the theoretical model and, in a second phase, the variables for entry into the model will be selected step by step (forward and backward) to achieve the most reduced stable models.</p><p>Conditions for the application of models will be verified using standard techniques that are based, essentially, on residuals analysis.

It attempts to establish the optimum iron supplementation to prevent not only iron deficit but also iron excess during gestation. The approach used is to adapt the standard supplementation to the individual characteristics of the pregnant woman, based on the hemoglobin level at the start of gestation.</p><p>Prevention is important, given the elevated percentage of anemia during pregnancy (around 25%) and of the risk of hemoconcentration (around 15%); conditions which have been associated with adverse effects not only in the mother but also in the newborn.</p><p>We will take the following measures to minimize, or avoid, bias in the conduct of the trial:</p><p>&#x02013; Randomization: An externalized randomization program will be used to ensure allocation concealment</p><p>&#x02013; Use of an electronic data collection system that enables homogeneous data collection and reduces transcription errors</p><p>&#x02013; External RCT monitoring, which would increase the reliability of the results</p><p>&#x02013; Blinding and assessment of outcomes: Iron supplements administration would be blinded. Therefore, neither the investigators nor the participants in the study nor the statistician would know the dose of iron in each of the treatment groups.</p><p>&#x02013; Combined batched analyses of samples at the end of the study. The samples will be stored at -80&#x000b0;C in the Hospital&#x02019;s BioBank and analyzed together at the end of the study, thereby limiting the potential bias that could be introduced by several different analytical procedures and laboratory personnel turn-over in the course of the trial. Further, inter- and intra-assay coefficient of analysis will be calculated for all of the measurements performed.</p><p>&#x02013; Standardization of the activities of the health-care professionals involved in the different aspects of the study. Before starting the study, all the health-care professionals participating in the study will standardize their procedures so as to ensure that all the tests and/or questionnaires are conducted in the same manner.</p><p>The particular challenges that we anticipate in this study are as follows:</p><p>&#x02013; Loss to follow-up. We hope to reduce this by taking advantage of the clinical visits that the pregnant women would normally have with her gynecologist/obstetrician. As such, she would not be required to undertake additional activities/visits by participating in the current trial. Further, we have increased the study sample size so as to compensate for possible loss to follow-up.</p><p>&#x02013; The supplementation with iron can produce gastrointestinal side effects that can affect the adherence to treatment. To reduce this effect, the principal component of the supplement will be ferrimanitol ovalbumin which has been shown to have greater bioavailability and better tolerance than ferrous sulfate.</p><p>&#x02013; It is difficult to know the adherence to the prophylactic iron supplement. To improve the registry, we will apply a semi-structured questionnaire on the degree of adherence to the prescription in all the clinical visits during pregnancy. This will indicate the number of units that have been returned to the investigator each week.</p><p>A primary strength of the study is its rigorous methodology that involves a large number of health-care professionals and patients, which will strengthen the validity of the findings. Conclusive outcomes would help the obstetrician in deciding the best iron supplementation pattern required to promote maternal and infant health. Initial hemoglobin levels that are routinely collected on all pregnant women attending the clinic, and there will not be any additional procedures that could dissuade participation by the pregnant woman.</p><p>Our findings would contribute to developing guidelines for good clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>Drugs_Q: Multi-vitamins and iron supplements questionnaire; EITQ: Early infancy temperament questionnaire; EPDS: Edinburg postnatal depression scale; Fagerstrom_Q: Fagerstrom questionnaire; FFQ: Food frequency questionnaire; Hb: Hemoglobin; ICS: Catalan institute of health; IPAQ: International physical activity questionnaire; PCC: Primary care centers; PSI: Parenting stress index; RCT: Randomized clinical trial; RHS: Reproductive health-care services; STAI: State-trait of anxiety inventory.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>VA, FF, GM, SA, JB, JC, BR, EA, NS, CH and NA are all members of the ECLIPSES Study Group.
