Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Patients aged between 20 and 60 years belonging to the American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) Grade 1 and 2 having surgery under general anesthesia were included in the study. Patients allergic to study drug, undergoing laparoscopic surgeries, with the history of psychiatric illness, alcohol abusers, altered mentation, epilepsy, with body mass index (BMI) &#x0003e;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, on beta blockers, sedative or stimulant drugs, with uncontrolled hypertension, and diabetes mellitus were excluded from the study.</p><p>This prospective, randomized, double-blind, comparative two group study was done on one hundred patients. Patients satisfying the inclusion criteria were selected during the study period from the operation register on a daily basis and after obtaining a written informed consent, they were allocated into two groups of fifty each by computer generated randomization technique. All the patients were premedicated with oral pantoprazole 40 mg the previous night and on the morning of surgery; oral ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg was given on the morning of surgery.</p><p>The patient monitoring included electrocardiogram, noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (SPO<sub>2</sub>), and bispectral index (BIS). The baseline HR, NIBP, SpO<sub>2</sub>, and BIS scores were recorded. Infusion pump containing dexmedetomidine 100 &#x000b5;g in saline 25 mL (4 &#x000b5;g/mL) or saline 25 mL was setup.</p><p>A computer-based randomization was done and sealed in an envelope. An anesthesiologist not involved in the management of the case opened a sealed envelope and setup either infusion dose of dexmedetomidine by diluting dexmedetomidine 100 &#x000b5;g/mL using saline in a 25 mL unlabeled syringe to obtain a concentration of 4 &#x000b5;g/mL or saline in 25 mL syringe based on the drug in the envelope.</p><p>

</p><p>An anesthesiologist in the theater blinded to the test drug conducted the intraoperative anesthetic management and monitoring. Vitals were recorded during the infusion at 5<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> min after the infusion of the study drug, and BIS values were also noted. Patients were preoxygenated for 3 min with 100% oxygen at 8 L/min. All patients received propofol 2 mg/kg and fentanyl 1 &#x000b5;g/kg followed by atracurium 0.5 mg/kg to facilitate tracheal intubation. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane 1% until tracheal intubation. After 3 min, intubation was performed using appropriate size endotracheal tube; correct placement was confirmed by end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO<sub>2</sub>) and auscultation. In addition to the preinduction monitors, postinduction ETCO<sub>2</sub> concentration, fraction of inspired and end-tidal isoflurane concentrations, fraction inspired and end-tidal nitrous oxide, fraction of inspired oxygen, and train of four (TOF) monitoring were also done. All patients were mechanically ventilated with fresh gas flow of 2 L/min (N<sub>2</sub>O: O<sub>2</sub> = 1:1), FiO<sub>2</sub>-50% with minute volume adjusted to maintain ETCO<sub>2</sub> between 30 and 35 mmHg using circle system and CO<sub>2</sub> absorber. Parameters were recorded after intubation, then every 5 min interval for half an hour and subsequently every 15 min till the end of surgery and at extubation.</p><p>Isoflurane concentration was increased or decreased step by step by 0.2% to reach the predetermined values of BIS 45&#x02013;60. Atracurium 0.1 mg/kg was given when TOF stimulus showed two twitches. Body temperature was maintained at 35.5&#x02013;36.5&#x000b0;C.</p><p>If there was increase in HR and blood pressure more than 20% baseline, fentanyl 1 &#x000b5;g/kg was given. If fall in blood pressure more than 20% baseline, ephedrine intravenous (i.v.) 3&#x02013;6 mg was given and if HR decreased &#x0003c;40 bpm, atropine 0.6 mg IV injection was given. In both the groups, additional intraoperative analgesic was provided in the form of paracetamol 20 mg/kg IV injection. After skin closure, all anesthetics were discontinued and patients were ventilated with 6 L/min oxygen. Neuromuscular blockade was reversed with neostigmine 50 &#x000b5;g/kg and glycopyrrolate 10 &#x000b5;g/kg. Extubation was done once the patients fulfilled subjective and objective criteria for extubation. The time duration from the discontinuation of isoflurane to extubation was noted.</p><p>Total isoflurane consumption was calculated using Dion's formula[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] = PFTM/2412 &#x000d7; d.</p><p>Where P- Dialed vaporizer concentration; F - Fresh gas flow- 2 L/min; T - Duration of the anesthesia; M - Molecular weight of Isoflurane-184.5 g; d - Density of Isoflurane - 1.496 g/mL.</p><p>Recovery profile was assessed using modified Aldrete score (MAS), postoperative pain by Visual analogue scale (VAS), and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) was monitored in the recovery room.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics of anesthesia consumption, hemodynamics, sedation, and recovery profile were analyzed and presented in terms of mean with standard deviation.

There are studies[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] which have shown the role of dexmedetomidine both loading and maintenance dose, reducing the dose of inhalational anesthetics. Our study used only loading dose of dexmedetomidine and dialed concentration of isoflurane was adjusted to achieve BIS of 45&#x02013;60.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is a more selective alpha-2-agonist, has a shorter duration of action than clonidine,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and produces hypnosis similar to normal sleep, without respiratory depression, making it a near ideal sedative.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] It suppresses nociceptive neurotransmission, terminating propagation of pain signals leading to analgesia. Its sympatholytic effect causes hypotension and bradycardia; effect judiciously used to attenuate the stress response of surgery. Other useful effects include decreased salivation, increased glomerular filtration rate, reduced intraocular pressure, and reduced shivering threshold.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Attenuation of sympathoadrenal effects due to tracheal intubation has been reported in earlier studies.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Our study showed that dexmedetomidine group had partial blunting of response to intubation with statistically significant lower MA<italic>P</italic> values but not significant lower mean HR values.</p><p>Patel <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] reported statistically significant lower values of HR, systolic, and diastolic pressure throughout the intraoperative period. During the maintenance of anesthesia, we observed significant lower MA<italic>P</italic> values requiring treatment in ten patients, and lower HR values which were statistically insignificant. This is probably due to the combined effect of vasodilatation and myocardial depression with volatile agents.</p><p>Shin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] have seen that patients undergoing gynecological surgeries have the end-tidal concentration and total sevoflurane consumption which were significantly lower in dexmedetomidine group than in control group. Ozcengiz <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] noted in children undergoing minor surgeries that end-tidal sevoflurane concentration was significantly higher in control group at before incision, after incision, and at the end of the surgery than in dexmedetomidine group. Ohtani <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] studied patients undergoing lower abdominal surgeries and noted that dexmedetomidine reduced the anesthetic requirements to maintain BIS of 45 by 20&#x02013;30%, reducing sevoflurane from 1.1 &#x000b1; 0.2% to 0.8 &#x000b1; 0.2% and propofol from 4.4 &#x000b1; 0.8 mg/kg/h to 3.1 &#x000b1; 1 mg/kg/h. Our study showed that the use of dexmedetomidine and intraoperative BIS-guided isoflurane alteration led to decrease in the fraction of inspired concentration and end-tidal concentration. Thus, dexmedetomidine causes a decrease in maintenance inhalational consumption, especially when BIS monitoring is also being used.</p><p>Keniya <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] demonstrated that the intraoperative requirement of fentanyl in dexmedetomidine decreased from 100 &#x000b1; 10 to 60 &#x000b1; 10 &#x000b5;g. Our study revealed that dexmedetomidine has an analgesia sparing action. The likely explanation is that the continued analgesic and sedative effects of dexmedetomidine during the perioperative period making it possible for patients in dexmedetomidine group to reach target BIS value at a lower end-tidal isoflurane concentration.</p><p>Studies have observed better postoperative analgesia in the recovery room.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Patel <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] in their study observed that postoperatively dexmedetomidine group showed a significant sedation at 2 h compared to control group. Our study showed that there were no differences noted in postoperative recovery profile and pain scores. Patients from both the groups had MAS scores of &#x0003e;9 and ready for discharge by half an hour following surgery. Similar findings were also noted in the study conducted by Shin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The possible explanation can be due to 2 h elimination half-life of dexmedetomidine.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>One limitation of our study was the inclusion of varied surgical procedures. Hence, the requirement of inhalational agents and analgesics would differ depending on the invasiveness of the procedure.</p><p>Our study has demonstrated that a single preanesthetic i.v. dose of dexmedetomidine 1 &#x000b5;g/kg reduced the total isoflurane consumption from 6.61 &#x000b1; 1.2 to 4.84 &#x000b1; 1.08 mL with <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 which was statistically significant proving dexmedetomidine to be a useful adjuvant. More number of patients in Group 1 required supplemental analgesia suggesting analgesia sparing action of dexmedetomidine. However, there was a higher incidence of hypotension noted in dexmedetomidine group which could be easily treated. Dexmedetomidine group showed earlier emergence; however, recovery profile and pain scores postoperatively were similar between the two groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>We conclude that single preanesthetic 1 &#x000b5;g/kg dexmedetomidine loading dose with the BIS monitoring is a good anesthetic adjuvant for general anesthesia
