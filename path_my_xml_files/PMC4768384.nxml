We also found that atrial APD and ERP shortened with increasing frequency of stimulation, which has been related mainly to decrease in L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> current,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> and that adaptation to high rates was attenuated in preparations from patients in cAF.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The maximum rate of depolarization dV/dt<sub>max</sub> declined significantly at high rates<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> because of the incomplete restoration of RMP with an increasing number of preparations failing to capture stimulation, thereby limiting frequency testing to 5 Hz.</p><p>Channels conducting the human cardiac I<sub>Kur</sub> are encoded by the K<sub>v</sub>1.5 gene <italic>KCNA5</italic>, which is strongly expressed in atria, and although small amounts of messenger RNA have been reported in human ventricular tissue, no functional current has been reported.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Consequently, I<sub>Kur</sub> block exhibits an atrial-selective effect on cardiac repolarization and could be considered a drug intervention suited for the treatment of atrial rhythm disturbances without unwanted effects on ventricular function. This is suggested by the lack of impact of XEN-D0103 on ventricular AP. The absence of XEN-D0103&#x02013;induced QTc prolongation as well as PR and QRS changes and the absence of arrhythmias, including AF, in healthy volunteers observed in the clinical study confirms the finding previously reported for XEN-D0101<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> and MK-0448<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> and also provides further support for I<sub>Kur</sub> only being present and functional in the human atria and not the ventricle.</p><p>The characteristic changes in electrophysiological parameters observed with XEN-D0103 in human right atrial trabeculae (1 Hz) are consistent with block of K<sub>v</sub>1.5 channels as previously reported for this<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> and other less selective drugs (eg, 4-AP,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> DPO-1,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> AVE0118,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> XEN-D0101,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> and MK-0448<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref>). These drugs elevated the plateau potential in SR preparations and significantly shortened APD<sub>90</sub> at 1 Hz but prolonged APD<sub>90</sub> in cAF trabeculae. The shortening of APD<sub>90</sub> and ERP by K<sub>v</sub>1.5 inhibitors in SR is proposed to be caused by the marked elevation of the plateau potential into a voltage range where more hERG channels are activated, and although they inactivate rapidly, they can recover from inactivation at more negative potentials and thus hasten final repolarization.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Since the most prominent effects of XEN-D0103 were elevation of PLT<sub>20</sub>, shortening of APD<sub>90</sub> in SR at 1 Hz, and prolongation of APD<sub>20</sub>, APD<sub>50</sub>, APD <sub>90</sub> in cAF, we conclude that XEN-D0103 does block I<sub>Kur</sub> in human atrial trabeculae. Furthermore, these characteristic electrophysiological changes appear to be a dominant class effect of I<sub>Kur</sub> block, since they are observed with XEN-D0103 as well as with other less selective K<sub>v</sub>1.5 inhibitors.</p><p>Interestingly, in SR preparations, the APD shortening effect of XEN-D0103 at the basal frequency of 1 Hz turns into an APD-prolonging effect accompanied by an increase in ERP at the higher stimulation rates of 3 and 4 Hz (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). In addition, fewer preparations could be stimulated at 4 Hz and excitation failed in all SR preparations at 5 Hz in the presence of XEN-D0103. In pAF, similar effects were observed, the PLT<sub>20</sub> increased at all frequencies, and ERP was prolonged at 3&#x02013;4 Hz (although this effect was significant only at 3 Hz) with all but one preparation failing to capture excitation at 5 Hz. These qualitatively similar responses suggest that tissue from patients in SR may be a useful surrogate for investigating the effects of drugs in pAF, especially given the scarcity of tissue from patients in pAF. The data in SR and pAF tissue provide novel evidence in support of I<sub>Kur</sub>/K<sub>v</sub>1.5 as a target for the management of pAF.</p><p>In cAF, qualitatively different effects were observed compared with those seen in SR and pAF. All but one preparation followed stimulation at 5 Hz both in the absence and in the presence of XEN-D0103. The ability to pace the cAF tissue at high frequencies suggests a remodeled phenotype that forms the substrate for the initiation and perpetuation of the arrhythmia in these patients. The shorter APD<sub>90</sub> and ERP and the more negative RMP of cAF tissue have previously been reported by us and others<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> at 1 Hz. This is likely to contribute to the ability of cAF tissue to capture higher stimulation frequencies, in the absence and presence of the drug, than to the ability of SR or pAF tissue because of the higher availability of Na<sup>+</sup> channels at more negative membrane potential. In cAF tissue, XEN-D0103 prolonged the APD at all frequencies but effects on the ERP were significant only at 2 Hz. However, the TMC data suggest this was underestimated at all frequencies tested. Despite these effects on AP parameters in cAF preparations, we do not expect block of Kv1.5 channels by XEN-D0103 to <italic>convert</italic> cAF back to SR because of electrical and structural remodeling.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Nevertheless, this effect may protect the atrial myocardium during the phase of reverse remodeling after cardioversion.</p><p>At present, it is not known whether and how block of I<sub>Kur</sub> is related to ERP. We speculate that the primary reduction in I<sub>Kur</sub> can cause a secondary effect on Na<sup>+</sup> conductance, leading to increased postrepolarization refractoriness rather than having a direct effect on the cardiac Na<sup>+</sup> channel. This is supported by the lack of effect on the recombinant peak Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 current at concentrations up to 10 &#x003bc;M.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Given the lack of a direct effect on Na<sup>+</sup> channels, the increase in postrepolarization refractoriness <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> may be due to an indirect effect on Na<sup>+</sup> channel availability owing to the marked change in the profile of the AP in the presence of the drug (ie, elevated plateau and triangulation of the AP shapes). However, this is speculative and further experiments are needed to clarify the mechanism of ERP modulation by XEN-D0103, but these are outside the scope of the present study. In any case, it is seems highly desirable to increase ERP in both SR and pAF to disrupt reentry and prevent AF recurrence. This, in turn, may be expected to facilitate the reverse remodeling process after cardioversion. Pharmacological interventions for interrupting microreentry have to prolong the ERP, while suppression of ectopic foci requires reduction of excitability. Given the pharmacological profile of XEN-D0103, it is more likely to increase atrial refractoriness than to reduce excitability.</p><p>It should be noted that although the reported effect of XEN-D0103 in cAF appears small, prolongation of ERP may be underestimated because of the concomitant reduction of ERP observed in TMC. A broader comparison to other AF antiarrhythmic drugs was not possible, as they would require evaluation using the methodology that evaluated APD parameters and ERP in SR and AF tissue at multiple pacing frequencies as well as assessment of the effect on ventricular tissue to confirm atrial selectivity. More importantly, the present data suggest some benefits of XEN-D0103 in pAF. A lack of effect of other I<sub>Kur</sub> inhibitors in healthy volunteers<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> could be due to the rather long cycle lengths (ie, &#x0003e;400 ms) used. According to our data, we would not have expected a prolonging effect of MK-0448 on atrial ERP at cycle lengths below 333 ms (3 Hz). Last but not least, although I<sub>Kur</sub> had been originally discovered in dog atria, I<sub>Kur</sub> could no longer be demonstrated during the past years<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref>; hence, the absence of any effect of I<sub>Kur</sub> inhibitors in dog models of AF is not surprising. In conclusion, we found the use of I<sub>Kur</sub> inhibitors in treating AF that includes both pAF and recent-onset persistent AF, that is, AF of &#x0003c;6 months of duration.</p><p>Our data highlight the importance of pathophysiologically relevant pacing frequencies (SR and pAF) and an arrhythmogenic substrate (ionic and structural remodeling in cAF). Only at higher pacing frequencies in SR and pAF and at 2 and 3 Hz in cAF tissue did we observe significant increases in APD/ERP. On the basis of our results, we expect XEN-D0103 to be preferentially effective in non-remodeled atrial tissue (SR and pAF). The positive frequency dependence of ERP prolongation and loss of excitability at high frequencies (5 Hz) in SR preparations and an essentially similar pattern of effects in pAF suggest that I<sub>Kur</sub> inhibitors could be effective for the termination of recent-onset AF (ie, suppression of high-frequency firing) and reduction of AF burden in pAF before electrical and structural remodeling has taken place.</p><p>To date, no clinical trials have been published on a selective human I<sub>Kur</sub> inhibitor in a patient population with AF; however, based on these novel mechanistic findings for XEN-D0103, it is currently being evaluated in 2 phase 2 clinical studies to evaluate the therapeutic potential of a selective I<sub>Kur</sub> inhibitor to prevent recurrences in patients in pAF. They both started in 2014.</p><p>The first trial (EudraCT no. 2013-004456-38) was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study assessing a single-dose level (150 mg twice daily) of XEN-D0103 in patients in pAF and patients with implanted pacemakers. The primary objective was to assess the reduction in AF burden over 28 days compared to placebo. The second phase 2 study in patients in pAF called DIAGRAF-IKUR (EudraCT no. 2013-004456-38) aimed to evaluate the efficacy of 3 doses of XEN-D0103 (S66913), vs placebo on AF and/or atrial tachycardia burden (AF/AT burden) in patients who have an indication for AF ablation and are implanted with insertable cardiac monitoring device.</p><sec id="s0080"><title>Study limitations</title><p>In most of the preparations, basic parameters slightly declined with time. The classification of patients into SR and AF groups is not always reliable; that is, the SR group may include atrial tissue from patients that have had unrecognized episodes of pAF or recent-onset AF. Furthermore, cAF tissue will include patients in permanent AF who are known to be refractory to SR-maintenance therapy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0085"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The selective I<sub>Kur</sub> inhibitor XEN-D0103 consistently elevated the AP plateau in human atrial trabeculae irrespective of the initial shapes of the control APs and whether the preparations originated from patients in SR, pAF, or cAF. In SR and pAF preparations, the APD shortening effect observed at 1 Hz resulted in prolongation of APD<sub>90</sub> and ERP at high stimulation rates with loss of excitability at 5 Hz, whereas in cAF preparations, ERP prolongation was modest. For the prevention of AF recurrence, frequency-dependent prolongation of ERP by XEN-D0103 in both SR and pAF preparations is a highly desirable mode of action that may protect the atrial myocardium during the phase of reverse remodeling after cardioversion. These data warrant the evaluation of XEN-D0103 in a clinical trial in patients in pAF.</p><p><boxed-text id="b0005"><caption><title>Clinical Perspectives</title></caption><p>Pharmacological treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) remains a clinical challenge owing to the lack of effective and safe drugs. The selective blockers of K<sub>v</sub>1.5 channels were designed to fill this gap, yet their antiarrhythmic effects are yet to be reported in a clinical setting. To date, most K<sub>v</sub>1.5 blockers have been shown to prolong only action potential duration (APD) and effective refractory period (ERP) at physiological beating rates in atrial tissue remodeled by persistent AF, whereas they actually <italic>shorten</italic> APD and ERP in sinus rhythm (SR) tissue. However, little is known about their efficacy at the high rates of excitation encountered during AF. Here we report that the highly selective K<sub>v</sub>1.5 channel blocker XEN-D0103 prolongs APD and ERP measured with sharp microelectrodes in human right atrial trabeculae from patients in chronic AF in the frequency range 1&#x02013;5 Hz. In trabeculae from patients in SR and paroxysmal AF, the ADP-shortening effect of XEN-D0103 at low stimulation rate (1 Hz) turns into APD prolongation at high rates, leading to failure of excitation response. We conclude that the XEN-D0103 exhibits positive frequency&#x02013;dependent electrophysiological effects that could be clinically useful, because prolongation of APD and suppression of action potentials by XEN-D0103 at high stimulation rates in SR and paroxysmal AF tissue is expected to reduce AF burden. This concept needs to be confirmed in clinical trials. Our data cannot provide evidence for preventing recurrence or termination of permanent AF by XEN-D0103. This must be tested in appropriate models.</p></boxed-text></p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"
