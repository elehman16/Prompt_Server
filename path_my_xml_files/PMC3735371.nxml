But, anesthetics are among the substances that alter the temperature regulation system and give patients a tendency to hypothermia. Certain methods have been developed to prevent hypothermia in intraoperative and postoperative periods. In addition to heating and humidifying the air being inhaled and heating intravenous fluid and transfused blood, methods of energy and heat generation formed by increasing the metabolism of the patient have been used in studies conducted in the last decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-medscimonit-19-625">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-medscimonit-19-625">5</xref>].</p><p>In the volunteers with intact thermoregulatory system, it has been demonstrated that enteral protein or amino acid infusions provoke thermogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-medscimonit-19-625">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-medscimonit-19-625">7</xref>] and hyperthermia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-medscimonit-19-625">8</xref>].

It is not known if oral carbohydrates administered in the preoperative period have positive effects on thermoregulation, as do amino acid and fructose solutions. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of preoperative administration of oral carbohydrate solution on heat regulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>This prospective, randomized, single-blind study (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry number: ACTRN12612000792820) was commenced following the approval of our Institutional Review Board and obtaining written consent of the patients. The study included 40 female patients who were to undergo myomectomy-hysterectomy under general anesthesia. The patients&#x02019; ages ranged from 18 to 50 years, and they had I&#x02013;II American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification. Patients were chosen from among the cases scheduled to undergo surgery between 08:00 am and 13:00 pm. We excluded patients that had an inflammatory disease, diabetes mellitus, muscle diseases, hypo-hyperthyroidism, Parkinson disease, Raynaud phenomenon, menopause, with body mass index below 20 and above 30, used drugs affecting body temperature (&#x003b2;-blocker, calcium channel blocker, clonidine, steroid, antiepileptic, NSAI, or benzodiazepine), and delayed gastric emptying (pregnancy, gastroesophageal reflux, opioid use), as were patients scheduled to undergo an operation that takes less than 60 min or more than 180 min. Patients that had alterations in their hemodynamic parameters of more than 30%, patients that required the use of vasopressor or vasodilator, and patients who needed blood transfusion were also excluded from the study.</p><p>Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups by using the opaque enveloped method. Group CONT (control group, n=20) included patients with oral intake stopped 8 h before the operation. Group CHO (preoperative carbohydrate group, n=20) included patients that were administered oral carbohydrate fluid (Nutricia preop, Nutricia, Numil Gida Urunleri San. Tic. A.S. Istanbul, Turkey) prepared for the preoperative period as 800 ml to be administered 8 h before the operation and as 400 ml 2 h before the operation. Administration of anesthesia for patients that were not given premedication was conducted by the practitioner, who was not informed about which group the patient belonged to. In addition to electrocardiography (ECG), noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) monitoring by Draeger monitor (Draeger Cato Edition, Germany), patients&#x02019; temperatures were monitored with temperature probes to measure tympanic membrane and peripheral temperature (chest, arm, <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inner mid-face of the forearm, ventral face of middle finger distal phalanx, thigh, and calf). Tympanic temperature was measured by a Genius 2 Tm Accusystem device (Genius 2 Tm Accusystem, Kendall, Mansfield, Massachusetts, USA), and peripheral temperature was measured by using a Draeger monitor (Draeger Cato Edition, Germany). Peripheral temperature measurements were conducted on the arm from which the fluid was not being given and a blood pressure cuff was not present. After preoxygenation, anesthesia was inducted by 5 mg/kg sodium thiopental, 0.1 mg/kg vecuronium, and 2 &#x003bc;g/kg fentanyl, and endotracheal intubation was carried out. Maintenance of anesthesia was obtained with desflurane in 5&#x02013;6% concentration with 50% O<sub>2</sub> &#x02013; 50% N<sub>2</sub>O with fresh gas flow of 4 liter/min. Respiration was mechanically maintained with ETCO<sub>2</sub> adjusted as 30&#x02013;40 mmHg. Throughout the surgery, fentanyl for analgesics and vecuronium for muscle relaxation were administered as additional doses when needed. Patients were covered with standard surgical drape during the operation and any heating method such as heated IV fluids, blankets, and hot air blow was not utilized. For humidification of inhaled air, an artificial humidifier was added between endotracheal tube and the y-connector of the respiration system. Operating room temperature was maintained at 20&#x02013;23&#x000b0;C. In recovery from anesthesia, when needed, 0.04 mg/kg neostigmine and 0.01 mg/kg atropine were administered intravenously to eliminate the residual muscle relaxation effect. Patients were extubated when laryngeal reflexes returned to normal and in the presence of sufficient spontaneous respiration. Patients that were covered with a single layer standard cloth in the PACU were monitored with ECG, NIBP, SpO2, tympanic membrane, and peripheral temperature measurements for an hour and 2 l/min O<sub>2</sub> was administered by face masks.</p><p>Heart rate (HR, beat/min), mean arterial pressure (MAP, mmHg), central and peripheral temperatures, room temperature, and shivering score (0: no shivering, 1: presence of 1 or more of such findings as piloerection, peripheral vasoconstriction, and peripheral cyanosis without muscle movement, 2: presence of muscle activity observable in single muscle group, 3: presence of muscle activity in more than 1 muscle group, 4: presence of significant muscle activity observed in the whole body) were recorded immediately before anesthesia, in 5-min intervals after the induction of anesthesia, and in 10-min intervals in PACU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-medscimonit-19-625">12</xref>]. Patients with 3 or more tremor score were administered 25 mg meperidine intravenously. In addition, mean skin temperature, mean body temperature, vasoconstriction time, and vasoconstriction threshold that triggers the central temperature were estimated with the help of recorded temperatures. Tsk was estimated with [0.3 (Tchest + Tarm) + 0.2 (Tthigh + Tcalf)] formula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-medscimonit-19-625">12</xref>].

Vasoconstriction was estimated with the [Tforearm- Tfingertip] formula of fingertip blood flow and the obtained value &#x02018;0&#x02019; demonstrates the vasoconstriction initiated and the value 4 shows severe vasoconstriction. Central temperature at the time of vasoconstriction formation shows the vasoconstriction threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-medscimonit-19-625">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-medscimonit-19-625">16</xref>].</p><p>PACU complications (e.g., nausea, vomiting, and oxygen desaturation) were treated and recorded when they occurred.

Tympanic temperature significantly decreased in both groups in subsequent time periods of time compared to the pre-induction period.

Tsk increased subsequent time periods in Group CONT compared to pre-induction values (p&#x0003c;0.05).

However, in recent years it was demonstrated that the administration of fluids containing water or carbohydrate 2 hours before the operation instead of preoperative 8-hour fasting had positive effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-medscimonit-19-625">17</xref>]. In this study, we investigated the effects of preoperative carbohydrate solutions, which are more preferred in routine practice, on disordered temperature regulation, which is a significant issue in anesthesia applications.</p><p>In our study, the expected increase in tympanic temperature in patients that were administered carbohydrate solution in the preoperative period did not occur, and a significant decrease was observed in the carbohydrate group compared to the control group. In patients given carbohydrate solution, mean skin temperature increased in a delayed manner and more significantly, and a significant change was not observed in mean body temperature. In the control group, vasoconstriction was more significant, occurred earlier, and the threshold was higher.</p><p>In our study, we believe there are 6 reasons why our results do not match those of previous studies, especially in terms of tympanic temperature and vasoconstriction threshold. Firstly, hypothermia caused by anesthesia was one of application area of diet induced thermogenesis. Here, the most frequently used nutrients are amino acids. It was noted that amino acid solution administered 1&#x02013;2 h before general anesthesia induction and at the first hour of the maintenance of anesthesia as 240 kj/h has been suggested to increase heat accumulation and prevent hypothermia by delaying heat generation stimulation and to increase vasoconstriction threshold, and that postoperative shivering were not observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-medscimonit-19-625">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-medscimonit-19-625">21</xref>]. In addition, when amino acid solution was administered to patients under spinal anesthesia, central temperature increased before performing spinal anesthesia and the decrease in central temperature reduced after performing it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-medscimonit-19-625">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-medscimonit-19-625">23</xref>]. In a study in which lower doses of amino acid solution was administered, the effects of amino acid solution given as 100 kj/hour in the intraoperative period on central temperature in patients that were administered isoflurane anesthesia were not observed; however, positive effects were established on the central temperature in patients that were administered propofol anesthesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-medscimonit-19-625">4</xref>]. Furthermore, fructose is superior to glucose (although both are hexose monosaccharide) because: a) fructose is mainly metabolized in the liver, b) fructokinase is more active than glucokinase and hexokinase, and c) fructose is a better substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis because it causes a smaller increase in insulin concentration. The solution used in our study did not contain a nutrient that included high energy like amino acid or fructose.</p><p>Secondly, thermogenesis induced by diet is either obligatory or facultative. Obligatory thermogenesis is the energy needed for digestion and absorption of food and its metabolisms. Facultative thermogenesis is the energy spent in excess of obligatory thermogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-medscimonit-19-625">24</xref>]. Type and route of administration of food and sympathoadrenal system activation are among the factors that determine thermogenesis induced by diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-medscimonit-19-625">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-medscimonit-19-625">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-medscimonit-19-625">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-medscimonit-19-625">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-medscimonit-19-625">26</xref>]. Proteins are the main nutrients that product energy carbohydrates, followed by fats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-medscimonit-19-625">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-medscimonit-19-625">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-medscimonit-19-625">19</xref>]. Carbohydrates that occupy the second place in terms of energy were also used for this purpose. Mizobe et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-medscimonit-19-625">10</xref>] administered a fructose infusion (0.5 g/kg/h) 3 h before anesthesia induction and maintained it until 1 h after the anesthesia induction. In patients that were administered fructose, central temperature was observed to significantly increase beginning from the 20<sup>th</sup> minute of anesthesia induction until the 180<sup>th</sup> minute. The vasoconstriction threshold was also found to be significantly higher in patients that were given fructose compared to patients that did not receive fructose. Regarding the effects of glucose (i.e., carbohydrates) on thermogenesis, central temperature decreased even though a 20% increase was found in temperature generation after 500 ml intravenous infusion of 20% glucose, and skin temperature increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-medscimonit-19-625">27</xref>]. Therefore, we believe that the solution administered at the established time and dose could cause obligatory thermogenesis but it was not able to generate energy sufficient for facultative thermogenesis. This is why we did not establish an increase in tympanic temperature and vasoconstriction threshold.</p><p>Thirdly, carbohydrate was given orally in our study. When nutrients are administered intravenously, its effects on thermogenesis are more significant compared to oral intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-medscimonit-19-625">25</xref>].</p><p>Fourthly, thermogenesis occurs after the nutrient is received and then it is terminated. As in the case of amino acid and fructose studies, in studies in which facultative thermogenesis occurred, solutions were began preoperatively and continued to be given during anesthesia for a few hours. In our study, the solution was administered 2 and 8 hours before the operation, in accordance with suggestions, due to aspiration risk.</p><p>Fifthly, it is also known that the sympathoadrenal system modulates the thermal effects of nutrients. It was shown that nutrients with carbohydrate contents lower than 20% do not change noradrenaline concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-medscimonit-19-625">28</xref>]. The carbohydrate content of the solution used in our study was 12.6%. Because the solution we used did not contain carbohydrates sufficient for sympathetic system activation, it was believed that it was unable to generate thermoregulatory response.</p><p>Sixthly, unlike other studies, a placebo group with fluids containing no calories was not created in our study. If there was a placebo group, perhaps more temperature decrease would have been observed in the said group since it was shown in the literature that central temperature measured 150 minutes after a drink that does not contain energy, such as lemon squeeze, decreased significantly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-medscimonit-19-625">29</xref>].</p><p>In line with studies that demonstrated a decrease in shivering, or even elimination of it, in patients who were administered amino acid solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-medscimonit-19-625">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-medscimonit-19-625">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-medscimonit-19-625">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-medscimonit-19-625">23</xref>], we found that shivering decreased in patients who were given carbohydrates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>As a result of our study, it was established that oral carbohydrate solution administered preoperatively did not provide the expected increase in tympanic temperature, vasoconstriction, and vasoconstriction threshold; on the contrary, it had decreasing effects, but it significantly decreased postoperative shivering. Therefore, we believe that the combined use of an additional temperature-preserving method would be beneficial in patients given preoperative carbohydrate.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
