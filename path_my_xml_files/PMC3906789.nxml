In genetically predisposed patients, several factors including physical agents, drugs, neoplasm, hormones, and viruses notably herpes simplex virus (HSV), have been hypothesized to trigger or exacerbate the disorder.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] HSV, a double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) virus, is a common human pathogen classically causing orofacial (mostly HSV-1) or genital (mostly HSV-2) infections.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Immunodeficient patients such as pemphigus patients are at risk of developing extended or atypical HSV infections which can be easily misdiagnosed. Atypical infections have been reported more frequently in immunocompromised patients than in immunocompentent hosts.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Secondary cutaneous HSV infections should be considered in patients with chronic pemphigus vulgaris (PV) with atypical sudden relapses or resistance to sufficient immunosuppressive treatment who do not show an increase of desmoglein-specific immunoglobulin G autoantibodies. Acantholytic disorders, including pemphigus vulgaris (PV), chronic benign familial pemphigus (Hailey-Hailey disease), Darier disease, and Grover's acantholytic dermatosis as well as other vesiculobollous disorders, including bullous pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa, and atopic dermatitis are prone to florid infections by HSV-I and II and more rarely by varicella-zoster virus (VZV).[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] On the basis of polymerase chain reaction, some studies suggest an association between HHV-8 and pemphigus.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>In this study, we evaluated the impact of a course of acyclovir in improvement of the pemphigus patients and reduction of the hospitalization duration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted as a single-blinded randomized clinical trial in Al Zahra hospital (Isfahan/Iran) from March 2005-March 2006. Sampling was performed using simple method.</p><p>Inclusion criteria: Patients with confirmed diagnosis of PV who had at least five cutaneous blisters or involvement of at least one mucosal surface hospitalized in the dermatology ward of Al Zahra hospital were included in this study.</p><p>Exclusion criteria: Pregnant women, any known hypersensitivity to acyclovir and patients on monthly steroid pulse therapies, were excluded from the study.</p><p>A total of 30 consecutive patients with histology and DIF confirmed diagnosis of PV were randomized using simple randomization technique and enrolled into two groups each including 15 cases. Informed consent was obtained from all of the cases and controls. Ethical committee clearance was achieved before the start of the study.</p><p>Control group were treated using routine treatment regimen (prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day + azathioprine 2.5 mg/kg/day). Patients in the cases group, in addition to aforementioned routine treatment, were treated with oral acyclovir (1200 mg/day for 2 weeks).</p><p>The patients were examined every day by a single observer for evaluation of the response to treatment and appearance of side effect for 1 month.</p><p>The severity of PV was graded using pemphigus severity score (PSS) using the following protocol: that measured at the start and fixed intervals, and it was varied from 0 to 6, the ingredients of the score mentioned above are as follows:</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Epithelialization degree</title><p>0: Complete reepithelialization</p><p>1: Partial reepithelialization occurred</p><p>2: Absence of reepithelialization, (eroded surfaces.)</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Surface area of involvement</title><p>0: Absence of skin or mucosal involvement</p><p>1: Less than or equal to 10% of body surface area affected</p><p>2.

Several cases of PV-induced or worsted by viral infections have been reported. In addition, a few cases of PV were reported upon vaccination with viral proteins.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Viral infection was considered to be a possible trigger factor for PV. Several reports have described pemphigus cases in association with HSV, VZVs, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus and HHV-8 infection,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] particularly the latter correlation has been obtained presumably due to local factors.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In 1999, Tufano <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] evaluated the prevalence of herpes virus DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCS) and skin lesions of PV patients by polymerase chain reaction. HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNA were detected in 50% of PBMCS and 71% of skin biopsies of the patients.</p><p>Onset or exacerbation of PV has been found to be associated with HSV infection in several clinical studies as reviewed by Ahmad <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Brenner <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and Ruocco <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Different hypotheses have been suggested regarding the potential role of HSV in the pathogenesis of PV. Viral infection may induce upregulation of hormonal and cellular proinflammatory factors that facilitating the outbreak of PV. Kalra <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] recently suggested a role for HSV in perpetuating/slowing down in the healing of PV lesions; however, our study seem to suggest HSV infection as a concomitant event due to lack of normal epithelial defense in PV lesion, but without any pathogenic implication causing disease exacerbation.</p><p>The HSV lesions mostly consisted of multiple grouped small (1-3 mm) round blisters arising from inflamed skin or mucosa. Although they clinically appeared to be somewhat different from the PV lesions, they are difficult to identify, whereas they appear together with a flare up of lesions.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, we did not observe any significant differences between responses to treatment in the group that was treated with acyclovir as compared with control group. In addition, no reduction in hospitalization period was seen in the acyclovir treated group. However, the partial and complete remissions were somewhat higher in patients on acyclovir therapy compared to controls.</p><p>Use of acyclovir therapy, in those pemphigus patients who have high PSS and do not have any contraindication for acyclovir, may be a logical approach.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Marzano</surname><given-names>AV</given-names></name><name><surname>Tourlaki</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Merlo</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Spinelli</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Venegoni</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Crosti</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Herpes simplex virus infection and pemphigus</article-title><source>Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol</source><year>2009</year><volume>22</volume><fpage>781</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19822095</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Madkan</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Sra</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Brantley</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Carrasco</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Bolognia</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name><name><surname>Jorizzo</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name><name><surname>Rapini</surname><given-names>RP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Human herpes viruses</article-title><source>Dermatology</source><year>2008</year><edition>2nd ed</edition><publisher-loc>Philadeliphia</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Elsevir</publisher-name><fpage>1199</fpage><lpage>204</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lecluse</surname><given-names>AL</given-names></name><name><surname>Bruijnzeel-Koomen</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Herpes simplex virus infection mimicking bullous disease in an immunocompromised patient</article-title><source>Case Rep Dermatol</source><year>2010</year><volume>2</volume><fpage>99</fpage><lpage>102</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21103195</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nikkels</surname><given-names>AF</given-names></name><name><surname>Delvenne</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Herfs</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Pierard</surname><given-names>GE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Occult herpes simplex virus colonization of bullous dermatitides</article-title><source>Am J Clin Dermatol</source><year>2008</year><volume>9</volume><fpage>163</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18429645</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Meibodi</surname><given-names>NT</given-names></name><name><surname>Nahidi</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Mahmoudi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Javidi</surname><given-names>Z</given-names></name><name><surname>Rastin</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Sheikh</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Evaluation of coexistence of the Human Herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8) infection and pemphigus</article-title><source>Int J Dermatol</source><year>2010</year><volume>49</volume><fpage>780</fpage><lpage>3</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20618497</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Krain</surname><given-names>LS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Pemphigus.
