UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) are involved in aspirin metabolism and clearance, and variant alleles in UGT1A6 have been shown to alter salicylic acid metabolism and risk of colon neoplasia. In a randomized, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial of 44 healthy men and women, homozygous for UGT1A6*1 or UGT1A6*2, we explored differences between global epithelial and stromal expression, using Affymetrix U133&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;2.0 microarrays and tested effects of 60-day aspirin supplementation (325&#x000a0;mg/d) on epithelial and stromal gene expression and colon prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels. We conducted a comprehensive study of differential gene expression between normal human colonic epithelium and stroma from healthy individuals. Although no statistically significant differences in gene expression were observed in response to aspirin or UGT1A6 genotype, we have identified the genes uniquely and reproducibly expressed in each tissue type and have analyzed the biologic processes they represent. Here we describe in detail how the data, deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) &#x02013; accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ncbi-geo:GSE71571" id="ir0005">GSE71571</ext-link> &#x02013; was generated including the basic analysis as contained in the manuscript published in BMC Medical Genetics with the PMID <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pmid:25927723" id="ir0010">25927723</ext-link> (Thomas et al., 2015 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>).</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p><table-wrap id="t0010" position="float"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="left">Specifications</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Organism/cell line/tissue</td><td align="left"><italic>Homo sapiens</italic>/colon/epithelial and stromal tissue</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Sex</td><td align="left">Males and females</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Sequencer or array type</td><td align="left">Affymetrix GeneChip HGU133&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;2.0 microarrays</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Data format</td><td align="left">Raw and normalized</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Experimental factors</td><td align="left">We tested effects of 60-day aspirin supplementation (325&#x000a0;mg/d) on epithelial and stromal gene expression in 44 healthy men and women who were randomly assigned, blocked on sex and genotype, to the order in which they received treatment A or treatment B.

Participants were recruited from among those who completed a cross-sectional study of diet and aspirin metabolism (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Potential eligibility was assessed by questionnaire. Exclusion criteria included tobacco use, consumption of &#x0003e;&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;alcoholic beverages/day (equivalent to 720&#x000a0;ml beer, 240&#x000a0;ml wine, 90&#x000a0;ml hard liquor), regular use of prescription or over-the-counter medications, known intolerance of aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), weight loss or gain of &#x0003e;&#x000a0;4.5&#x000a0;kg in the past year, current or planned pregnancy, breastfeeding, bleeding disorder, anemia, renal insufficiency, hepatic dysfunction (e.g., cirrhosis, hepatitis, abnormal liver function tests), chronic lung disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure, angina, recent myocardial infarction, history of endocarditis, aortic or iliac aneurysm, history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, diabetes, recent pelvic surgery, history of gastrointestinal disorder (e.g., gastric or duodenal ulcer, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, celiac sprue, HNPCC, familial adenomatous polyposis, pancreatic disease, previous gastrointestinal resection, radiation or chemotherapy) and cancer (other than non-melanoma skin cancer).</p><p>As part of the cross-sectional study, participants completed a self-administered food frequency questionnaire and a health and demographic survey, and provided a fasting morning blood that was used for UGT1A6 genotyping <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. We determined the UGT1A6*2 genotype of 434 participants by Sanger sequencing of a 268&#x000a0;bp fragment of exon 1, amplified by PCR as described previously <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Study design</title><p>The study was a randomized, double-blind crossover clinical trial designed to examine the effects of aspirin on gene expression in colonic mucosa. Our goal was to have at least 40 participants complete both arms of the trial. Participants were selected on the basis of their genotype of rs2070959 (T181A) and rs1105879 (R184S) &#x02014; 20 with the UGT1A6 *1/*1 genotype (homozygous for the major allele at both SNPs) and 20 with the UGT1A6 *2/*2 genotype (homozygous for the minor allele at both SNPs). All participants with a *2/*2 genotype and sex-matched participants with a *1/*1 genotype were invited to consider participation in the trial. Fifty-five individuals (23 men), mean (SD) age 30.1 (6.5) years, were randomized. Ten participants discontinued the study: 3 did not tolerate the Fleets Phospho-soda preparation prior to the first sigmoidoscopy, 2 started on prescription medications, 2 refused sigmoidoscopy, 3 left for reasons unrelated to the study and sufficient total RNA could not be extracted from one participant. Forty-two participants were included in the analysis of intervention and UGT1A6 genotype effects and an additional 3 participants with the UGT1A6 *2/*4 genotype were randomized and included in the expression array analysis of stromal and epithelial tissue. (Initially, we randomized *2/*4 individuals into the study because the phenotype was thought to be similar to that of *2/*2; however, with the emergence of new data <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, we decided that the 2 genotypes may be sufficiently different and therefore excluded *2/*4 individuals from the intervention analysis.)</p><p>To ensure that participants could take aspirin safely for 60&#x000a0;days and tolerate sigmoidoscopy, each participant underwent a clinical assessment before entering the study that included a detailed medical history, measurement of blood pressure and complete blood count, liver panel, chemistry panel, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, urinalysis, and in women only, a pregnancy test. In addition, a physician interviewed and examined participants before each of their sigmoidoscopies. The laboratory assays to assess the health of participants were completed by a commercial lab (CLIA licensed Quest Diagnostics, Seattle, WA).</p><p>Because this was a randomized crossover trial, each person served as his/her own control, receiving both intervention (aspirin) and control (placebo) at 2 different periods, with a washout period between periods. Participants were randomly assigned, blocked on sex and genotype, to the order in which they received aspirin or placebo. Eligible participants took 325&#x000a0;mg aspirin or a visually identical placebo by mouth daily, for 60&#x000a0;days. The washout period between intervention periods was 3&#x000a0;months. A sigmoidoscopy was performed at least 60&#x000a0;days after day 1 of each intervention period. Participants took the study medication up until 24&#x000a0;h before their sigmoidoscopies. During each treatment period, we monitored adherence to the study medication by pill count.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><label>2.3</label><title>Sigmoidoscopy, biopsy collection, and tissue separation</title><p>Participants prepared for sigmoidoscopy by following standard instructions for use of Fleet Phospho-soda Oral Saline Laxative (Lynchburg, VA), which included adherence to a clear-liquid diet for 24&#x000a0;h before the procedure. At each sigmoidoscopy, we used large-cup flexible biopsy forceps (Precisor Disposable, Bard, Billerica, MA) to obtain biopsies of normal-appearing mucosa from the sigmoid colon. Forty-five participants completed both sigmoidoscopies. Within 1&#x000a0;min of removal from the colon, three biopsies were transferred to Hank's buffer containing 20&#x000a0;mM EDTA and 40&#x000a0;mM dithiothreitol at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and were held on ice for 10&#x02013;15&#x000a0;min. The epithelial cells were separated from the stromal layer by vortexing <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The stromal layer was removed with an autoclaved toothpick and epithelial fraction was then collected by centrifugation. Both fractions were frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until RNA extraction.</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><label>2.4</label><title>RNA extraction and microarray procedures</title><p>Participants were labeled consecutively. There are 4 samples from each person designated A1&#x02013;A4 (participant 1); A5&#x02013;A6 (participant 2); B1&#x02013;B4 (participant 3) etc. to W1&#x02013;W4 (participant 44). Within the data for each person, odd numbers (1 and 3) are epithelial tissue and even numbers (2 and 4) are stromal tissue. The epithelial and stroma from each intervention period are paired together (e.g., A1 and A2 are from the first treatment Participant 1 received; A3 and A4 are from the second treatment participant 1 received). Each participant's epithelial and stromal samples were processed at the same time. Total RNA was extracted with RNeasy extraction kits (Qiagen, Valencia, California) and treated with DNAse I according to the manufacturer's protocol. The integrity of total RNA samples was verified by visual analysis of 18S and 28S bands on an ethidium bromide-stained 1.5% agarose gel. RNA was quantified using the Quant-iT RiboGreen RNA assay Kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon). We obtained sufficient RNA from 44 of the 45 participants. This resulted in obtaining total RNA from 88 epithelial samples and 88 matched stromal samples. cRNA was synthesized from 100&#x000a0;ng of total RNA, biotin-labeled by the GeneChip Two-cycle cDNA synthesis labeling protocol (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, California), and then hybridized to HGU133 plus 2.0 expression arrays. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450. GeneChips were scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G. Each microarray contained 54,675 probes representing 38,500 genes. The quality control (QC) criteria used to assess sample and chip performance were fold-amplification after two cycles of in vitro transcription (to be at least 40-fold), and increasing signal strengths and &#x02018;present&#x02019; calls for poly-A RNA spike-in controls (lys, phe, thr, dap) and hybridization controls (bioB, bioC, bioD and cre).

To ensure an RT performance of equal quality, all samples were reverse transcribed simultaneously by a two-step reverse transcription with SuperScript RT II (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California). Relative gene expression was examined by TaqMan PCR using 2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California) and TaqMan Gene Expression Assays for two epithelial genes (ABCC3, MLPH; assay identifiers Hs00358677_m1 and Hs00983106_m1) and two stromal genes (ITG&#x003b1;8 and ANXA1; assay identifiers Hs00943530_m1 and Hs00945401_m1). Human &#x003b2;-glucuronidase (GUSB) was used as the normalization control based on its consistent expression across all samples in the microarray analysis. Relative quantification was performed with the ABI Prism 7900 HT sequence detection system and calculated by the comparative CT method.</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><label>2.6</label><title>PGE2 analysis</title><p>PGE2 in whole biopsies collected at the end of each treatment period was measured with enzyme immunoassay kits from Assay Design (Farmingdale, NY).

Each sample was homogenized by an Ultrasonic Processor (Misonix, Farmingdale, NJ) at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 3.5&#x000a0;min&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;2 with a 1-min rest in between and then centrifuged at 16,000&#x000a0;rpm for 5&#x000a0;min at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. An aliquot (100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l) was mixed with 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of assay buffer and acidified with 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l 1&#x000a0;N citric acid. The acidified solution was then applied to a Sep.-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) that had been preconditioned with methanol and water. Prostaglandins were eluted with 2&#x000a0;ml of hexane:ethyl acetate (1:1). The eluate was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, and the residue was dissolved in 25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l ethanol and 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l assay buffer. PGE2 was then measured with ELISA kits according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein levels were determined by a Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Levels of PGE2 were normalized to protein concentrations and expressed as ng/mg protein.</p></sec><sec id="s0045"><label>2.7</label><title>Data analysis&#x02013;microarray analysis</title><p>Data were normalized by the Robust Multi-array Analysis with correction for GC content of the oligo (GC-RMA) <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Subsequently, the probe-set expression levels were log2-transformed using GC-RMA (version 2.40.0) and R version 3.2.1 (2015&#x02013;06&#x02013;18) with default function settings. Nonspecific filtering was done where estimated intensities were required to be above 100 fluorescence units in at least 25% of the samples and the interquartile range (IQR) across all of the samples on the log base 2 scale was expected to be at least 0.6. A total of 6227 genes passed nonspecific filtering. Differential expression between tissue types in biopsies collected at the end of each treatment period was determined by using a paired t-test. The false discovery rate (FDR) was calculated using the procedure proposed by Benjamini and Hochberg <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Visualization of the statistically significant genes was performed in GeneSpring 7.0 with per chip and per gene normalizations (Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, Delaware).

The wide differences in expression between stroma and epithelium suggest that future study of gene expression in colonic epithelium may benefit from separation of the tissue so as to focus the analysis on a specific tissue type.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Navarro</surname><given-names>S.L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Saracino</surname><given-names>M.R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Makar</surname><given-names>K.W.</given-names></name><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>S.S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Levy</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Schwarz</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bigler</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Potter</surname><given-names>J.D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lampe</surname><given-names>J.W.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Determinants of aspirin metabolism in healthy men and women: effects of dietary inducers of UGT</article-title><source>J Nutrigenet Nutrigenomics</source><volume>4</volume><year>2011</year><fpage>110</fpage><lpage>118</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21625173</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0010"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lampe</surname><given-names>J.W.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bigler</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Horner</surname><given-names>N.K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Potter</surname><given-names>J.D.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A6*2) polymorphisms in Caucasians and Asians: relationships to serum bilirubin concentrations</article-title><source>Pharmacogenetics</source><volume>9</volume><year>1999</year><fpage>341</fpage><lpage>349</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10471066</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0015"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0015"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Schwartz</surname><given-names>B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Avivi</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lamprecht</surname><given-names>S.A.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Isolation and characterization of normal and neoplastic colonic epithelial cell populations</article-title><source>Gastroenterology</source><volume>100</volume><year>1991</year><fpage>692</fpage><lpage>702</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1993490</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0020"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0020"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shureiqi</surname><given-names>I.</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Day</surname><given-names>R.S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Zuo</surname><given-names>X.</given-names></name><name><surname>Hochman</surname><given-names>F.L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ross</surname><given-names>W.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Cole</surname><given-names>R.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Moy</surname><given-names>O.</given-names></name><name><surname>Morris</surname><given-names>J.S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Newman</surname><given-names>R.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lippman</surname><given-names>S.M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Profiling lipoxygenase metabolism in specific steps of colorectal tumorigenesis</article-title><source>Cancer Prev Res (Phila)</source><volume>3</volume><year>2010</year><fpage>829</fpage><lpage>838</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20570882</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0025"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0025"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Z.</given-names></name><name><surname>Irizarry</surname><given-names>R.A.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Preprocessing of oligonucleotide array data</article-title><source>Nat.
