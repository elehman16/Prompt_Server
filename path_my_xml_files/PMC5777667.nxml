Herein, we monitored changes in T cell and B cell flow cytometry crossmatch (FCXM) to assess the effects of short-term super high-dose IVIG (4 g/kg) administration with plasmapheresis before living-donor renal transplantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Seventeen patients, each showing positive T cell FCXM (median ratio, &#x02265; 1.4) after 2 rounds of double-filtration plasmapheresis, received 4-day regimens of IVIG (1 g/kg per day) over 1-week periods. T cell and B cell FCXM determinations were obtained after every IVIG dose and again up to 4 weeks after initiating IVIG to ascertain negative conversion of T cell FCXM (median ratio &#x0003c; 1.4). The primary study endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving T cell FCXM-negative status after the 4-dose IVIG regimen.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Upon completion (4 g/kg total) or discontinuation of IVIG administration, 8 (47.1%) of 17 patients displayed negative T cell FCXM. Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, the cumulative T cell FCXM-negative conversion rate 4 weeks after IVIG administration initiation was 60.3%. The T cell FCXM-negative conversion rates after cumulative doses of 1, 2, 3, and 4 g/kg IVIG were 29.4%, 35.3%, 56.3%, and 46.7%, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Desensitization of donor-specific antibody-positive renal transplant recipients seems achievable in only a subset of recipients through IVIG dosing (1 g/kg &#x000d7; 4) within 1 week after double-filtration plasmapheresis.

In this study, we monitored changes in T cell flow cytometry crossmatch (FCXM) as part of a desensitization protocol in which recipients demonstrating positive T cell FCXM received IVIG (1 g/kg) for 4 days within a 1-week period (total of 4 g/kg) after double-filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) in preparation for living-donor transplantation. T cell FCXM was measured after each IVIG dose and up to 4 weeks after initiating IVIG administration, allowing us to better establish the timing of conversion and the effectiveness of cumulative IVIG dosing.

T cell and B cell FCXM were measured the day after each of the 4 IVIG doses. For patients showing positive T cell FCXM after the fourth administration, FCXM was measured weekly until negative conversion was confirmed, for up to 4 weeks after initiating IVIG. The primary study endpoint was percentage of patients converting to T cell FCXM-negative status after the fourth IVIG dosage. Patients who prematurely discontinued IVIG dosing were evaluated according to last observation carried forward. Secondary study endpoints were percentage of patients showing conversion to T cell and B cell FCXM-negative status (last observation carried forward) 4 weeks after initiating IVIG administration and percentage of patients converting to T cell and B cell FCXM-negative status after each dose of IVIG (1 g/kg). This study plan aimed to confirm the potential of IVIG as a desensitization therapy and did not require renal transplantation, but planned for transplantation to be performed in cases in which FCXM-T became negative.</p></sec><sec><title>Donor-specific Crossmatching Analysis</title><p>FCXM determinations were conducted at a single clinical laboratory (ReproCELL Inc., Yokohama, Japan) equipped with a cell analyzer (FACSCalibur; Becton, Dickinson and Co., Franklin Lakes, NJ). Class I- and II-positive control sera (One Lambda, Inc., Canoga Park, CA) were purchased, whereas prospective donor plasma served as a negative control. Median ratio was calculated by dividing median fluorescence intensity of patient specimens by median fluorescence intensity of the negative control.

Although IVIG plays a key role in desensitization protocols, it is unknown whether high-dose IVIG alone or low-dose IVIG combined with PE is superior. Furthermore, there is no protocol to date where the number of IVIG administrations and intervals have proven optimal. In this study, we measured changes in T cell and B cell FCXM after each dose of IVIG (1 g/kg &#x000d7; 4) administered to sensitized renal transplant recipients within 1 week before transplantation to determine the effects of such treatment.</p><p>Administration of IVIG as a monthly dose of 2 g/kg is commonly considered high-dose therapy. Glotz et al<sup><xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> have reported that renal transplantation was possible in 13 of 15 recipients who were desensitized using 3 courses of IVIG (2 g/kg each) given at 4-week intervals. In 11 of these patients, all recipients of deceased-donor renal transplants, the PRA rate had declined from 64% (50-77%) to 14% (0-24%), representing a mean decrease of 80% through desensitization. The remaining 2 patients were crossmatch-negative and underwent living-donor renal transplantation. Jordan et al<sup><xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> likewise reported a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind controlled trial in patients showing high sensitization (PRA of at least 50% for 3 months). After receiving of 2 g/kg IVIG per month for 4 months, the level of PRA was significantly lower in patients given IVIG (vs placebo), and the rate of transplantation was significantly higher (IVIG, 16/46, 35%; placebo, 8/46, 17%). In our study, the rate of conversion to T cell FCXM-negative status after cumulative administration of 1, 2, 3, and 4 g/kg IVIG generally increased in a dose-related manner, culminating in a 60.3% cumulative conversion rate 4 weeks after initiating IVIG. In contrast, the rate of conversion to T cell and B cell FCXM-negative states after standard IVIG dosing of 2 g/kg has not been high, and repeated IVIG administration seemed to be required at or after renal transplantation. Using our IVIG regimen, the FCXM-negative conversion rate increased by 20% or greater through cumulative IVIG administration of 3 g/kg or more (ie, cumulative dose &#x0003e;2 g/kg). Thus, effective, short-term desensitization is likely responsible for the extent of patient conversion achieved.</p><p>FCXM can be expressed as a median channel shift (MCS) derived through linear scale calculation or as a ratio calculated via log scale. According to the Laboratory Manual of the American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics,<sup><xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> each institution is obliged to define a standard FCXM cutoff value. In the Laboratory Manual of the American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics, cutoff values in studies of T cells are at 10 to 15 for MCS 256 scale and ratio of 1.0. For B cells, cutoff values are at 25 to 30 for MCS 256 scale and ratio of 1.2. An abundance of previous research has focused on MCS values of FCXM (FXMCS), graft survival rates, and the incidence of AMR in anti-HLA antigen-positive renal transplantation. In these investigations, clinical cutoff values have varied, as have the mean fluorescence intensities of DSA, and no consensus has yet been reached in establishing associations with clinical events such as AMR.</p><p>However, Gloor et al<sup><xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> have reported good results (37% incidence of AMR and &#x02265;90% graft survival for ~5 years) by desensitizing patients with negative T cell antihuman globulin-enhanced complement-dependent cytotoxicity and FXMCS values &#x02265;300, lowering FXMCS below 300 (cutoff value of FXMCS-T, 52; FXMCS-B, 104). Jordan et al<sup><xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> have also claimed a lowering of AMR to less than 16% within 1 year after renal transplantation, using a DSA-relative intensity scale score of 17 or less (scored according to mean fluorescence intensity), and a FXMCS less than 225 (cutoff value of FXMCS-T: 130, FXMCS-B: 70) to gauge desensitization. Hence, renal transplantation may not be prohibitive, even if negative FCXM is not achieved. The cutoff values used herein less than 1.4 for T cells and less than 1.7 for B cells. When this value of 1.4 or less was defined as negative, the subsequent T cell FCXM conversion rate after cumulative administration of 4 g/kg of IVIG was 73.3%. Neither PRA nor Luminex assays were explored for this study, and we acknowledge that an additional study will be needed.</p><p>Rebound of DSA and accompanying AMR have proven to be problematic for desensitization protocols involving PE and IVIG administration, the rate of AMR being as high as 30% to 50%.<sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Recent studies have shown better long-term graft survival rates in recipients desensitized through high-dose IVIG plus rituximab, compared with those subjected to high-dose IVIG alone.<sup><xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Transplantation was planned for patients of ours who were FCXM-negative after cumulative administration of 4 g/kg IVIG. Four of such patients received living-donor renal transplants after treatment with steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil, plasmapheresis, and rituximab. All of them did well posttransplantation, with no signs of AMR.</p><p>Planned desensitization and immunosuppressive therapy in the short term are important for living-donor renal transplantation in DSA-positive recipients. Evaluating a desensitization protocol based on FCXM and PRA determinants is therefore critical. In this study, we have shown that cumulative doses of IVIG &#x02265;3 g/kg may boost the FCXM-negative conversion rate beyond that attained through conventional IVIG administration (2 g/kg). Although negative conversions of T cell FCXM peaked at IVIG doses of 3 g/kg, there are some cases in which it becomes negative after the fourth administration or 1 week after the fourth administration. Therefore, in this study, we conclude that IVIG &#x02265;3 g/kg (3-time administration) is effective.</p><p>The primary goal of this study was to monitor changes in T cell and B cell FCXM during an IVIG-based desensitization protocol that differed from the high-dose IVIG alone or low-dose IVIG plus PE protocols typically used. Of the 17 patients studied, only 4 received living-donor renal transplants; and this patient sampling is smaller than that of other published studies.<sup><xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Nonetheless, the results of this limited trial were encouraging. A broader evaluation of our desensitization regimen in greater numbers of transplant recipients is needed to properly assess patient and graft survival at 1 year and longer. This short-term high-dose IVIG desensitization protocol may be an alternative to conventional protocols for recipients with DSA.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank all participating patients and their family members as well as the investigators and study coordinators at the 13 centers involved in the trial.
