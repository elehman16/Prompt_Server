intervention for early prevention and management of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) in China. This 18-year cluster-randomized controlled trial
encompassing 15 villages included 1008 patients (454 men and 40 women in the
intervention group [mean age, 54 &#x000b1; 10 years]; 482 men and 32 women in the control
group [mean age, 53 &#x000b1; 10 years]) with confirmed COPD or at risk for COPD. Villages
were randomly assigned to the intervention or the control group, and study
participants residing within the villages received treatment accordingly.
Intervention group patients took part in a program that included systematic health
education, smoking cessation counseling, and education on management of COPD. Control
group patients received usual care. The groups were compared after 18 years regarding
the incidence of COPD, decline in lung function, and mortality of COPD. COPD
incidence was lower in the intervention group than in the control group (10%
<italic>vs</italic> 16%, &#x0003c;0.05). A decline in lung function was also
significantly delayed in the intervention group compared to the control group of COPD
and high-risk patients. The intervention group showed significant improvement in
smoking cessation compared with the control group, and smokers in the intervention
group had lower smoking indices than in the control group (350 <italic>vs</italic>
450, &#x0003c;0.05). The intervention group also had a significantly lower cumulative
COPD-related death rate than the control group (37% <italic>vs</italic> 47%,
&#x0003c;0.05). A rural community-based integrated intervention is effective in reducing
the incidence of COPD among those at risk, delaying a decline in lung function in
COPD patients and those at risk, and reducing mortality of COPD.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Integrated intervention</kwd><kwd>Rural area</kwd><kwd>Lung function</kwd><kwd>Smoking cessation</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="5"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="30"/><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by a limitation in airflow
that is not fully reversible. Currently, COPD is widespread throughout the world (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The overall prevalence of COPD in China is 8.2%
and this prevalence is significantly higher in rural areas compared with urban areas
(<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). COPD has become a major worldwide public
health problem because of its already high and steadily increasing prevalence.</p><p>Fortunately, COPD is a preventable and treatable disease. Quitting smoking, nutritional
support, and pulmonary rehabilitation are effective measures for prevention and
treatment of COPD (<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). COPD is a long-term, chronic disease. Currently, patients with
COPD receive treatment as outpatients and, therefore, spend much of their time in their
communities rather than in hospitals. Recent studies that examined two useful
community-based comprehensive interventions for COPD have produced encouraging results
(<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Currently, interventions for COPD are mainly implemented in cities or economically
developed areas, while little attention has been paid to economically underdeveloped or
rural areas, especially in China. Because aspects of local social environments, economic
conditions, and cultures all affect development of COPD and its outcomes, findings from
studies that are conducted in urban or affluent areas may not be applicable in other
areas.</p><p>The primary aim of this study was to investigate the effects of an integrated
intervention for prevention of COPD. The secondary aim was to investigate the
differences in decline in lung function between the intervention and control groups.
Therefore, an 18-year rural community-based comprehensive intervention study was carried
out to evaluate the efficacy of an integrated intervention for early prevention and
management of COPD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Selection of areas and populations</title><p>This rural community-based cluster-randomized controlled trial was conducted from May
1992 to September 2010 in some villages in Haokou Township, Qianjiang, China. This
area was chosen because it is typical of China's rural areas, containing no modern
industry in the immediate or surrounding areas. People in these areas mainly rely on
agriculture and handicrafts to make a living, and spend most of their time inside
their homes. Another important reason for choosing this area was that there are
complete village clinics in every village or pair of neighboring villages, with
permanently stationed health care personnel and a fixed treatment room in each
clinic. These local health personnel (called &#x0201c;village doctors&#x0201d; in China) are always
the original owners of the clinics, and are well-educated. They have received
specialist medical training and have passed a medical licensing examination. They
always have close connections with the local residents, and this helps to improve
their patients' adherence to treatment protocols.</p><p>Computer-generated random selection was used to select 15 villages from the 48
villages in Haokou Town. Villages were used as the study units. Each village was
assigned to the intervention or control group by simple randomization (a coin toss).
Among 16,511 individuals over 18 years of age living in these villages, 1,062 over 40
years of age met the diagnostic criteria for COPD or were found to have a high risk
of COPD by physical examination and spirometry testing. Fifty-four individuals were
excluded from the analyses for various reasons, including incomplete information such
as census data or moving to another area after the study began. Finally, a total of
1,008 individuals over 40 years of age living in the 15 selected villages were found
to fulfill criteria for inclusion in the integrated intervention study. Follow-up
interviews were conducted with these subjects every year over the next 18 years,
until 2010 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="f01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Flow chart of participants in the study.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="1414-431X-bjmbr-48-11-01023-gf001"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Spirometry tests</title><p>All of the participants underwent standard spirometry tests. The tests were conducted
by technicians from the authors' hospital who had received rigorous training and
passed the necessary examination. In summary, the patients first inhaled 400 &#x000b5;g of
albuterol sulfate aerosol over a period of 10-20 min and were then examined. The
diagnostic criterion for COPD was a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1
s (FEV<sub>1</sub>)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio under 0.7. The levels of
severity of the subjects' COPD were classified as follows: mild (FEV<sub>1</sub>&#x02265;80%
of the predicted value); moderate (FEV<sub>1</sub> &#x0003c;80% and &#x02265;50% of the predicted
value); and severe (FEV<sub>1</sub>&#x0003c;50% and &#x02265;30% of the predicted value). Very
severe patients (FEV<sub>1</sub> &#x0003c;30% of the predicted value or
FEV<sub>1</sub>&#x0003c;50% and &#x02265;30% of the predicted value and the presence of chronic
respiratory failure) were not included in the study. Patients who did not meet the
diagnostic criteria (i.e., had an FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC &#x02265;0.7) but had a smoking history
and were currently smoking, or were suffering from second-hand smoke, chronic cough,
with increased sputum in the morning and other symptoms, were considered to be at
high risk of developing COPD.</p><p>All of the COPD participants were in a stable phase of the disease and did not
receive any drugs, such as bronchodilators when they entered the study. Patients were
excluded if they had diseases such as asthma, bronchiectasis, interstitial lung
disease, active tuberculosis, chronic heart failure, cancer, or other diseases that
could potentially affect the spirometry test. Patients were also excluded if they
could not communicate well with the respiratory specialist or who were unwilling to
participate in the study. Each participant either signed an informed consent form or
had one signed by a member of his/her immediate family. This study was carried out in
accordance with the requirements of the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethics approval was
obtained from the local Health Department and the research ethics board of Tongji
Medical College.</p></sec><sec><title>Comprehensive intervention</title><p>The patients' villages were randomly divided into control and experimental
intervention groups, with each group of villages containing patients who were
diagnosed with varying levels of severity of COPD, as well as the population judged
to be at high risk for COPD. Participants in the experimental intervention group
received a comprehensive intervention. The intervention consisted of an intensive
intervention phase and an active maintenance phase. In the intensive intervention
phase, a respiratory specialist from the authors' hospital performed specific
interventions for 1 month or more, at 6-month intervals. In the active maintenance
phase, the interventions were mainly performed by local health personnel who received
regular supervision from a respiratory specialist and several public health experts
from the authors' hospital.</p><p>In the first step of the comprehensive intervention, participants were provided with
basic knowledge through classroom teaching, because the local residents generally
followed an &#x0201c;out at sunrise, in at sunset&#x0201d; lifestyle, had received only a limited
education, and had difficulties with understanding and grasping new ideas. Every
effort was made to offer them clear and simple information on general health issues,
smoking cessation, COPD management, and pulmonary rehabilitation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>

</p><p>The COPD patients in the control villages were treated with conventional therapy in
accordance with guidelines. Neither they nor those considered to be at high risk for
COPD received additional medical aid in the control villages.</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up and measurement of health outcomes</title><p>Because of the large number of participants and funding issues, pulmonary function
testing was not performed every year for all of the patients. However, if
participants who were considered to be at high risk of COPD had respiratory symptoms,
such as coughing or wheezing that suggested that they might have progressed to COPD,
spirometry tests were performed to confirm their condition. For patients who were
already suffering from COPD, spirometry tests were also carried out to facilitate
better treatment when their symptoms became aggravated. All of the participants had
spirometry tests at the end of the trial.</p><p>The cumulative case fatality rates for COPD in the two groups of villages were
calculated, and the rate of smoking cessation among the participants was
examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Quality control</title><p>To maximize the research quality, the local health personnel received professional
training in the authors' hospital and took related examinations before they performed
intervention tasks. Their rights and obligations were also explained to them in
detail, and detailed assessment criteria were developed for evaluating their work.
They received assessments every 6 months throughout the course of the study. If they
failed an examination, they were retrained, and they were refused participation in
the study if they could not do their jobs well. To encourage the local health
personnel's enthusiasm, the authors provided free skills training in the affiliated
hospital, along with some other types of reward.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The SPSS 19.0 software package was adopted for statistical analysis. A normality test
for distribution of the data was carried out using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, which
showed that the data were normally distributed at P&#x0003e;0.05. Normally distributed
measurement data are reported as means&#x000b1;SD, and the intervention and control groups
were compared by the independent-sample <italic>t</italic>-test. Abnormally
distributed measurement data are described as the median (P<sub>50</sub>) and
percentiles (P<sub>25</sub>, P<sub>75</sub>). Accordingly, the Mann-Whitney test was
applied to the two sets of data. Enumeration data are reported as frequency
(constituent ratio). Comparison between the groups was performed by the Pearson
<italic>&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup></italic> test. The differences were statistically significant if &#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Baseline and follow-up data</title><p>Of the 1008 participants who fulfilled the study criteria, 494 (454 men and 40 women

have generally been conducted in urban or economically developed areas. Patients in
economically underdeveloped or rural areas have received less attention, especially in
Chinese rural areas. To date, inadequate attention has been paid to conditions of COPD
in Chinese rural areas. Morbidity of COPD in rural areas in China is higher than that in
the city. Additionally, numerous rural COPD patients have failed to receive effective
diagnosis and treatment before the disease worsens. In this case, Chinese rural
residents are in great need of comprehensive intervention measures, including prevention
of COPD, as well as daily disease control and treatment. To the best of our knowledge,
the current study is the first randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness
of a community-based comprehensive intervention for COPD in a rural area of China. We
found that such an intervention effectively reduced the incidence of COPD among a
high-risk population, delayed a decline in lung function, and improved the prognosis of
COPD patients and those at risk. The current findings may inspire creation of new
prevention and treatment programs for COPD for populations of poor and underdeveloped
areas.</p><p>Currently, COPD is the fourth leading cause of death globally (<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and it is projected to have the fifth leading burden of disease
worldwide by 2020 (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Despite these facts, COPD
fails to receive sufficient attention either from the general population or from the
health care community. In the East and the West, a considerable proportion of patients
do not receive the correct diagnosis of COPD, even when they already have major symptoms
(<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The reasons for this phenomenon are multifaceted. Because of a lack of
diagnostic equipment or of clinical experience, some primary care physicians and general
physicians are unable to accurately identify COPD (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Many patients also lack
knowledge of COPD and do not request medical help, even when they have respiratory
symptoms (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). This phenomenon is particularly
acute in China's rural areas. China's rural areas tend to be remote, and their residents
tend to lead a self-sufficient lifestyle with relatively little connection with the
outside world. Most rural residents only have a primary level of education, and some of
them are illiterate. Some rural residents live in poverty, and levels of education and
income can affect people's health in a variety of ways. Compared with patients who have
a higher education or income levels, those with low education and income levels tend to
have poorer health outcomes (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), especially when they suffer from chronic
diseases, such as chronic immunodeficiency diseases, chronic heart failure, diabetes, or
COPD (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In the present study, integrated intervention helped patients from poor
rural areas who were either illiterate or had only a primary school education to improve
their situation and the prognosis of COPD.</p><p>COPD may be promoted by a variety of external factors, such as air pollution,
malnutrition, and smoking, of which smoking is the major cause. The relationship between
tobacco use and COPD has already been recognized. Smoking can significantly increase an
individual's likelihood of contracting COPD (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>)
and smoking rates tend to be high among patients with COPD (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In the present study, almost all of those who qualified for the
study were current smokers. The reason for this finding might be due to the social
context of China's rural areas. These areas tend to be remote and underdeveloped, and
lack entertainment and leisure facilities. Smoking is one of the main leisure activities
of Chinese agricultural workers. Throughout China, friends and relatives often present
cigarettes to each other as gifts.</p><p>Quitting smoking is one of the most important measures to prevent COPD and smoking
cessation is also considered the most effective intervention for slowing down the
disease progression of COPD. Persuasion to quit smoking is one of the most important and
comprehensive treatment measures for COPD (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).
Smokers with COPD tend to have higher tobacco consumption, higher dependence on
nicotine, higher concentrations of CO in exhaled air, and greater difficulty quitting
smoking compared with healthy smokers (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).
Smoking cessation strategies include pharmacological therapy and behavioral counseling.
In previous studies, pharmacological therapy together with behavioral counseling were
found to be the most effective smoking cessation strategy for COPD patients, while
neither counseling alone nor particular anti-smoking drugs alone effectively improve
smoking cessation rates (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). However, in the
current study, behavioral counseling was an effective smoking cessation measure. The
local health personnel in our study might deserve most of the credit for this success,
because the close connections between them and the patients might have improved
patients' therapeutic adherence. In the present study, a lower incidence of COPD and a
delay in decline in lung function in the intervention group compared with the control
group may partly be attributed to smoking cessation, as well as simple pulmonary
rehabilitation.</p><sec><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>This study has some limitations. First, most of the subjects in the study were male
(454 men and 40 women in the intervention group; 482 men and 32 women in the control
group). Although COPD has a higher incidence in men than in women in China (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), there is still a large number of female
patients with COPD in China. They receive even less attention than male patients.
Representative numbers of female and male patients with COPD should be included in
similar studies in the future. Second, because COPD has a long-term course and
entails a slow decline in lung function, regularly monitoring lung function is useful
for assessing the condition of patients. However, in the present study, because of
funding and other restrictions, pulmonary function testing was not conducted for all
of the participants every year. Most of the patients were tested only at the
beginning and end of the study, so we were unable to collect detailed information on
the dynamic changes in patients' lung function. Therefore, such detailed information
could not be used to guide the present research. Finally, there are some
questionnaires, such as the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire, that are widely
used in the study of COPD. In the present study, a questionnaire was initially used
as a research tool. However, in practice, the patients appeared to have difficulty in
responding to some of the questions. They often did not correctly understand the
choices and made incorrect judgments. This might be related to their relatively low
level of education. To ensure rigor of the study, a similar tool should be developed
for use in poorly educated populations.</p><p>In summary, a rural community-based integrated intervention significantly helped
decrease the COPD-associated rate of morbidity among the high-risk population by
delaying a decline in lung function and improving prognoses through simple,
economical, multidisciplinary co-operation between the researchers and the local
medical staff. Although the results were obtained in a rural area of China, and thus
might not apply to other areas, medical staff and health policy makers worldwide will
hopefully find the present results useful.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors appreciate the contributions of the village doctors who participated in the
