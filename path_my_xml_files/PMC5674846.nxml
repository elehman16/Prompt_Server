Currently, there is no effective non-surgical treatment for articular cartilage injury. Arthroscopic debridement and microfracture surgery are performed for fibrocartilage repair. But fibrocartilage is different from normal articular cartilage, and functional recovery is not satisfactory. Therefore, it is necessary to develop more effective techniques for articular cartilage repair. Progress in material science, cell biology, biomechanics, and bioreactor technology has allowed the development of biomimetic, tissue-engineered osteochondral composites that have shown potential for the repair of damaged cartilage. We prepared biomimetic, tissue-engineered cartilage scaffolds optimized for biochemical composition and structural characteristics. Based on the experience of our pre-clinical studies on animals, a human articular cartilage acellular matrix scaffold was prepared and is in clinical use. The combination of autologous chondrocytes and scaffolds has shown satisfactory results in repairing cartilage defects in preliminary experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This is a prospective randomized controlled trial. One hundred patients with full-thickness cartilage injury of the knee will be randomly divided into two groups to receive treatment with either tissue-engineered cartilage constructed using biomimetic cartilage extracellular-matrix-oriented scaffolds combined with autologous chondrocytes, or arthroscopic debridement and microfracture surgery. There will be five visiting time points: at baseline, then at 3, 6, 12, and 18&#x000a0;months postoperatively. The primary outcome will be therapeutic efficacy as assessed by the Lysholm score at 12&#x000a0;months postoperatively. The secondary outcomes will be the International Knee Documentation Committee score, Visual Analog Scale score, and cartilage injury and repair as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging as well as the incidence of postoperative adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This trial will attempt to verify the use of tissue-engineered cartilage constructed using autologous chondrocytes combined with allogeneic, acellular cartilage matrix for the repair of cartilage defects, thereby providing favorable evidence for its use in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02770209?cond=autologous+cell-derived&#x00026;draw=1&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02770209</ext-link>.

Without timely, early, and effective treatment, damage to the articular cartilage progressively worsens, resulting in joint swelling, pain, and dysfunction. The patient ultimately develops osteoarthritis and may require artificial joint replacement. Clinical therapy for cartilage damage includes microfracture surgery and autologous osteochondral transplantation. However, the microfracture technique is limited to small-scale damage, and autologous osteochondral transplantation is hindered by limited supply. With advances in material science, cell biology, biomechanics, and bioreactor technology, the new generation of biomimetic, tissue-engineered osteochondral composites display great potential for the repair of cartilage damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Currently, in cartilage tissue engineering, seed cells are derived from autologous or allogeneic chondrocytes, mesenchymal stem cells, embryonic stem cells, or pluripotent stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Increasing evidence indicates that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells can be induced to differentiate into chondrocytes, and these cells have been successfully used in the treatment of large-size bone defects, cartilage lesions, and spinal cord injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The quality and quantity of bone mesenchymal stem cells gradually decreases with age, especially in patients with degenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Adipose stem cells and umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells are abundant and have similar characteristics to bone mesenchymal stem cells, and both of these cell types can be induced to differentiate into chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Adipose stem cells and umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells have been used to repair cartilage defects, but the findings are still preliminary, and these cells cannot be harvested or cultured in large quantities. Furthermore, the use of embryonic stem cells is complicated by ethical considerations. As a consequence, autologous chondrocytes are optimal seed cells for cartilage tissue engineering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">The transplantation of autologous chondrocytes in combination with tissue-engineered cartilage scaffolds to repair cartilage damage requires researchers to focus on two major issues, namely (1) the in vitro amplification of chondrocytes and (2) the preparation of biocompatible chondrocyte scaffolds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The preparation of chondrocyte scaffolds requires advanced technique, and currently, only the Institute of Orthopedics at the Chinese PLA General Hospital has the capacity to produce acellular cartilage; there is no other source of tissue-engineered cartilage scaffolds in China.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Preliminary experiments</title><p id="Par14">A proprietary allogeneic, acellular, cartilage-oriented scaffold was successfully created by the Cartilage Tissue Engineering Research Group, Institute of Orthopedics, Chinese PLA General Hospital (with intellectual property rights). The innovative scaffold simulates the composition and spatial structural characteristics of normal cartilage. The preparation methods are as follows: articular cartilage is pulverized to obtain natural cartilage extracellular matrix, which is identical in biochemical composition to extracellular matrix of natural articular cartilage. Then, a porous sponge-like scaffold is prepared using a freeze-drying technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In vitro experiments and large-animal, articular cartilage injury repair experiments have produced good results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Using this material, our research group prepared biomimetic cartilage tissue-engineered scaffolds, which mimic the structural characteristics of natural articular cartilage extracellular matrix. This allogeneic, acellular cartilage scaffold has the following characteristics: (1) it is derived from allogeneic cartilage, and the extracellular matrix remains intact after allografting, helping to maintain the numerous components of normal cartilage, particularly type II collagen and proteoglycans, resulting in enhanced repair. Cartilage scaffolds used outside of China are mainly composed of types I and III collagen or hyaluronic acid, and vary greatly from natural cartilage components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The original cartilage structure is difficult to reproduce with these types of scaffolds, and fibrous cartilage may affect treatment outcome; (2) the biomimetic scaffold has a similar three-dimensional structure to that of normal articular cartilage, which is the oriented scaffold structure. The scaffold imitates the orientation of normal cartilage cells, which are arranged perpendicular to the surface, and provides a paratactic columnar structure that contributes to the columnar arrangement of cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This structure in combination with type II collagen and proteoglycans derived from normal articular cartilage results in a scaffold structure that is extremely close to that of normal joint cartilage. Consequently, the repaired cartilage will have normal structure and function; (3) the oriented scaffold has a good biomechanical property. Its compressive stress is better than the non-oriented scaffold in wet and dry conditions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>); and (4) the oriented scaffold has good biocompatibility. Preliminary experiments have investigated the immune responses of the oriented scaffold of heterogeneous (porcine) and conspecific (rabbit) acellular cartilage. After the oriented scaffold had been implanted into the rabbit, its immune responses were observed from the aspects of cellular immunity and humoral immunity. Results suggested that its immunogenicity was low. Thus, it is verified that the oriented scaffold of acellular cartilage has good biocompatibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Allogeneic, acellular cartilage scaffolds. Scaffold pores exhibit a parallel arrangement, which is conducive to the growth of cells along the pores. Cells are arranged in a column during proliferation.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Theoretical evidence</title><p id="Par15">Cartilage has limited regenerative capacity and can only be repaired using autologous, allogeneic cartilage or artificial substitute materials after injury. However, these repair methods have limited effectiveness. Autologous chondrocyte transplantation may have significant side effects, while allogeneic cartilage or artificial substitute materials have poor biocompatibility. Tissue-engineered cartilage may provide an alternative means of repairing damaged cartilage. After autologous chondrocytes cultured in vitro are combined with a biomimetic cartilage scaffold, the tissue-engineered cartilage is constructed in vitro and transplanted into the site of injury to repair the cartilage. This strategy may restore articular cartilage function, providing a novel method for the treatment of cartilage defects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Reason for establishing a control group</title><p id="Par16">Microfracture is an arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation technique first applied in clinical practice by Steadman and Rodrigo in 1985. During microfracture surgery, damaged articular cartilage is cleaned until the edge of the normal articular cartilage and subchondral bone marrow cells, chondrocytes, and bone cells penetrate into the damaged area through a hole made using an awl on the surface of the exposed subchondral bone. Blood clots seeping out of the hole adhere to surrounding normal cartilage tissues forming a fibrous cartilage repair defect area responsible for joint function recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Arthroscopic microfracture is the most widely used method for the surgical repair of articular cartilage injuries because it is a simple operation with satisfactory clinical efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Here, microfracture surgery will be used as a control for the repair of articular cartilage injury.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study objectives</title><p id="Par17">We hypothesized that autologous-cell-derived, tissue-engineered cartilage is superior to microfractures in the treatment of knee cartilage injury.</p><p id="Par18">The main objective of the study is to evaluate the functional and symptomatic recovery in patients with knee joint cartilage injury undergoing autologous-cell-derived cartilage treatment and to compare it with microfracture surgery, based on Lysholm scores at 12&#x000a0;months postoperatively as the primary outcome measure.</p><p id="Par19">The secondary objective of the study is to (1) compare the effectiveness of the two repair methods on knee function recovery based on International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores, (2) compare the effectiveness of the two repair methods on pain relief, (3) assess cartilage regeneration by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and (4) compare the safety of the two repair methods for knee cartilage repair.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par20">This prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted at the Institute of Orthopaedics, Chinese PLA General Hospital, China.

After muscle-strength training, patients will feel mild muscle soreness. The presence of mild muscle soreness and ligament strain or muscle soreness at the second day after exercise is normal and will lead to strengthened muscles and stabilized joints. However, a rest plus ice compress is necessary if the pain lasts for several days, which indicates excessive exercise.
