Threatened miscarriage is manifested by vaginal bleeding, with or without abdominal pain, while the cervix is closed and the fetus remains viable inside the uterine cavity.</p><p>The reasons of miscarriages are many. During the first trimester, the most common cause of miscarriage is embryonic chromosomal abnormality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], although in some cases the cause cannot be identified. Progesterone plays a crucial role in the maintenance of pregnancy. It is secreted by the corpus luteum that provides early pregnancy support until placental production takes over at 10 to 12&#x000a0;weeks of gestation. Low levels of circulating progesterone have been linked to impending miscarriage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It has been postulated, therefore, that a lack of progesterone is a cause of miscarriage rather than a secondary signal of failing pregnancy.</p><p>Treatment options for threatened miscarriage include bed rest, the use of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), uterine muscle relaxants and progestogens. Bed rest is conventionally the most commonly used management technique for threatened miscarriage. However, there is little evidence of its value. A recent Cochrane review also came to the conclusion that there is insufficient evidence to support a policy of bed rest to prevent miscarriage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Indeed, a lack of physical activity can lead to other complications such as thromboembolic events, back pain and muscle atrophy, and women may experience emotional, family related and economic stress during bed rest, as well as self-blame if they fail to comply and subsequently suffer a miscarriage.</p><p>A small randomized study conducted by Harrison [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] showed hCG to be significantly more effective than bed rest. Based on this finding, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted in 183 women with first-trimester vaginal bleeding and a viable fetus as confirmed by ultrasound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of complete miscarriage between the hCG and placebo groups (12&#x000a0;% versus 11&#x000a0;%). The sample size of the study was smaller than planned due to loss of patients in follow-up and it was possible that the sample size was too small to reveal any differences in effect between hCG and placebo. Uterine muscle relaxing drugs, which include beta-agonists and atropine-like antispasmodic agents, are rarely used today. A recent search of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials register and Central Register of Controlled Trials confirmed that there is insufficient evidence to support their use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Progestogens have been used to treat threatened miscarriage for many years. In 1989, Goldstein et al. published a meta-analysis of 15 randomized controlled trials and concluded that progesterone and its analogs are ineffective in the maintenance of pregnancy in women with threatened miscarriage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Some recent studies suggest that the use of progestogen is associated with reduction in risk of miscarriage in women with threatened miscarriage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It has been suggested that progesterone potentially sustains the survival of the embryo by shifting the immune system towards production of non-inflammatory T-helper 2 cytokines and by increasing nitric oxide production, thus improving blood flow and oxygen supply [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Progesterone also plays an important role in keeping the myometrium quiescent, as demonstrated by enhanced uterine contractility and sensitivity to prostaglandins, after treatment with mifepristone, an anti-progestogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>A recent Cochrane review assessing the efficacy and safety of progestogens in threatened miscarriage identified four trials to be included in a meta-analysis, involving 421 participants, which compared progesterone with either placebo or no medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It concluded that progestogen treatment for threatened miscarriage reduced the risk of miscarriage by 47&#x000a0;% with a confidence interval consistent with a risk reduction of 21 to 65&#x000a0;%. Only in a subgroup of women who were treated with vaginal progesterone was the treatment not statistically effective in reducing miscarriage. It also showed no statistically significant difference in the number of congenital abnormalities, pregnancy-induced hypertension nor antepartum hemorrhage between the women who received progestogens and those who did not. However, it was commented that the results of this systematic review should be approached with caution due to the poor methodological quality of some of the included trials, which were not double-blind, and the small number of participants.</p><p>Dydrogesterone, a retro progesterone with very good oral bioavailability, is structurally and pharmacologically very similar to natural progesterone. It is considered suitable for women with threatened miscarriage as, in contrast to other available synthetic progestogens, it does not have androgenic side effects in the mother (e.g., hirsutism, acne) or estrogenic effects on the fetus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It also does not alter the normal secretory transformation of the endometrium, nor inhibit the formation of progesterone in the placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Moreover, studies have shown that it increases the proportion of progesterone-induced blocking factor-positive cells, while stimulating the production of T-helper 2 cytokines and inhibiting T-helper 1 cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], thereby ensuring protective immunomodulation. Regarding its safety in pregnancy, despite some early suggestions that progestogens may increase the risk of congenital developmental disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], evidence from subsequent large prospective studies and meta-analyses indicates that any such teratogenic effects are unlikely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A recent review of maternal use of dydrogesterone during pregnancy also found no evidence for an increased risk of congenital malformations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>Hence, there is still no good scientific evidence to support the routine use of progestogens for the treatment of threatened miscarriage because the existing studies were not large enough and some of them were not randomized or double-blind. Therefore, a large randomized double-blind trial is needed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objective and hypothesis</title><p>The aim of this study is to determine whether dydrogesterone therapy reduces miscarriage in women with first-trimester threatened miscarriage.

The randomization process will be done using the computer in a 1:1 ratio in a block of 10. Each randomization result will be put into a sealed opaque envelop. One envelop will be opened if a woman agrees to join the study. Both the clinicians and patients will be blinded from the treatment given. An unblinding procedure will be considered if there are adverse drug reactions after treatment as deemed necessary by the clinician in charge.</p><p>Patients allocated to the dydrogesterone group will receive dydrogesterone 40&#x000a0;mg per os, followed by 10&#x000a0;mg per os three times a day, and an identical-looking placebo will be used in the control group accordingly. Concomitant use of any other hormonal medications or tocolytic agents will not be allowed. Patients will be followed up with weekly pelvic ultrasound until twelve completed weeks of gestation or 1&#x000a0;week after the bleeding has stopped, whichever is longer. Blood will be taken weekly for serum hCG and progesterone levels. The treatment will be continued until twelve completed weeks of gestation or 1&#x000a0;week after the bleeding has stopped, whichever is longer. Any adverse effects from drugs and the patient&#x02019;s compliance will be noted during follow-up. For serious and unexpected adverse drug reactions, a report on the adverse drug reaction will be submitted to the Drug Office, Department of Health as soon as possible but no later than seven calendar days after first becoming known to the investigators. Non-serious adverse reactions and expected serious adverse reactions will be reported in a brief summary at the conclusion of the trial. Patients will receive a standard antenatal checkup and follow-up routinely in the antenatal clinic until delivery. Written consent regarding retrieval of pregnancy and delivery data will be sought from the patient at the time of study entry. The obstetric outcomes will be traced from the electronic patient record system if the patients deliver in public hospitals. A pre-formatted letter with replying address available will be given to the patient at the end of the study period and is to be filled by the private obstetrician and returned to us after delivery. If no reply letter is received 2&#x02013;3 months after the expected date of confinement of the patient, a letter including the patient&#x02019;s authorization will be sent to the corresponding private obstetrician to retrieve the information of the pregnancy outcomes.</p><p>Treatment will be stopped if the vaginal bleeding becomes severe and requires surgical intervention, or a diagnosis of silent miscarriage is confirmed upon a follow-up scan (i.e., the gestational sac or fetal pole fails to grow after 1&#x000a0;week, or there is no cardiac activity in a fetal pole with crown-rump length of &#x02265;7&#x000a0;mm). If the patient has a spontaneous miscarriage, the tissue mass passed or obtained after medical or surgical evacuation will be sent for histology and karyotyping by quantitative fluorescence-polymerase chain reaction (QF&#x02010;PCR) or the array comparative genomic hybridization method. QF-PCR, which is a simple and cheap method, will first be used to exclude common aneuploidy of chromosomes 13, 18, 21 and XY. The array comparative genomic hybridization method will be employed in those with negative QF-PCR results to confirm or exclude aneuploidy.</p><p>The primary outcome is the percentage of miscarriages before 20&#x000a0;weeks of gestation. The secondary outcomes are the live birth rate; the proportion of heavy vaginal bleeding or severe abdominal pain requiring surgical intervention (after 20&#x000a0;weeks); and obstetric complications including antepartum hemorrhage, placenta previa, pregnancy-induced hypertension, intrauterine death, congenital abnormality, preterm labor, and low birth weight at term. The birth weight, gestational age at delivery and apgar score are also included.

The primary outcome, the percentage of miscarriage before 20&#x000a0;weeks of gestation, will be analyzed with the chi-square test. Subgroup analysis for the primary outcome will be done with regard to gravida, gestation at presentation, presence of subchorionic hematoma and after exclusion of those with an abnormal karotype in the abortus. The secondary outcomes will be compared between the treatment group and the control group by the chi-square test.

Women with missing primary outcome data will not be included in the primary analysis. This presents a risk of bias, and secondary sensitivity analyses will be undertaken to assess the possible impact of the risk, including the assumption that all women lost to follow-up have miscarriages before 20&#x000a0;weeks.
