With increasing centralisation of resources in healthcare, the trend is exactly the reverse of the trend to &#x02018;shop locally&#x02019;.

In six UK hospitals (University College London, Royal Free, Whittington, Guy's and St Thomas' (all in London), Ninewells (in Dundee, Scotland) and Royal Hampshire County (in Winchester)), the patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery either received traditional EBRT or were selected to receive TARGIT IORT as a single dose using the Intrabeam device (Carl Zeiss). Patients who received TARGIT were recommended additional breast EBRT (without a tumour bed boost) if their final tumour histology had prespecified adverse prognostic factors. Fifteen per cent to 20% of patients randomly allocated to receive TARGIT were expected to receive additional EBRT. Supported by the results of the TARGIT-A trial,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> the preferred method of using TARGIT is during initial lumpectomy, and therefore, for this paper, we restricted the analysis to the prepathology stratum of the TARGIT-A trial.</p><p>For each patient, we first calculated the shortest driving distance from home to the radiotherapy centre and travel time (excluding traffic delays) using Google Maps. We then calculated the total distance travelled and total journey time to receive all of the recorded fractions of radiotherapy for each patient. We assumed that patients who received EBRT required two additional journeys, for consent and for radiotherapy planning. Typically, a patient receiving 15 fractions of EBRT (3&#x02005;weeks of radiotherapy) would attend the radiotherapy centre on at least 17 occasions. Amongst patients selected to have EBRT, those who lived a considerable distance from a TARGIT trial centre (more than 60&#x02005;miles, 100&#x02005;km) were excluded from the analysis (n=7) as they may have chosen to travel to a local radiotherapy centre closer to their home.

The estimates using Google maps were found to be an accurate reflection of such journeys (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary table</xref> S1). Therefore, for each patient with breast cancer treated with lumpectomy and TARGIT, we could estimate these values for travelling between their home and the radiotherapy centre using Google maps.

The current provision of radiotherapy is concentrated in the larger hospitals in urban centres, so patients could face either a daily prolonged &#x02018;cross-city commute&#x02019; or a longer journey from surrounding towns or villages. The geographical location of many moderate-sized UK breast centres is such that patients need to travel considerable distances to receive radiotherapy, and we need to remember that the potential environmental and economic savings of introducing TARGIT may be greater when applied to a breast cancer population outside of large UK urban centres.</p><p>These figures are likely to be an underestimate of the CO<sub>2</sub> reductions as applied in the UK, as we have not taken into account traffic conditions. Similarly, the savings in travel times, mileage and CO<sub>2</sub> for patients is likely to be even greater as many UK breast units do not have an on-site radiotherapy centre, as is the case with two of the six TARGIT-A trial centres (Whittington and Winchester) that required their patients to travel to a different hospital for EBRT. Typically, most UK patients, just as the patients treated in Swindon or Harlow, would thus travel more than twice the distance of their TARGIT study counterparts (753 vs 305 miles; 1212 vs 491&#x02005;km).</p><p>Carbon sequestration by woodland is often promoted to offset carbon production. Depending on tree species, the annual rate of carbon absorption for UK forests is 2&#x02013;5 tonnes/hectare.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> One tonne of carbon is contained within 3.67 tonnes of CO<sub>2.</sub> Using a figure of 3 tonnes/hectare per year, we estimate that failing to introduce TARGIT in the UK would require continuous maintenance of an area of mature forest over an area of 47&#x02013;395 hectares to offset the CO<sub>2</sub> produced by travel of these selected patients to receive radiotherapy. This forest would need to cover St Jame's Park (23ha), Green Park (19ha), Buckingham Palace Gardens (17ha), Kensington Gardens (111Ha) and Hyde Park (142ha) combined.</p><p>The use of public transportation or bicycles and walking, particularly in London, may change these calculations of the carbon footprint. However, the vast majority of patients in the rest of the country would have used a car for which these calculations are valid.</p><p>As clinicians, we need to remember the impact of our prescribed therapies on patients and their relatives. In rural areas, chemotherapy services may be provided closer to the patient's home to reduce the need to travel, and indeed, breast screening is usually available using mobile units. However, the need to travel to receive radiotherapy has an environmental impact that, until now, has been ignored. We have demonstrated that providing single-dose TARGIT treatment to selected UK patients with breast cancer will benefit patient travel times and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Given that patients with breast cancer constitute about a third of patients in a radiotherapy department, this should also reduce the traffic congestion around the hospital.</p><p>This is the first study to quantify the environmental benefit of introducing TARGIT IORT and demonstrates the magnitude of the impact on our environment of asking our patients to travel to receive centralised radiotherapy services. The analysis and concepts described are applicable in every aspect of healthcare where a patient is required to travel to receive a series of treatments. While the term &#x02018;food-miles&#x02019; has become commonplace in the mindset of the general public, perhaps the concept of &#x02018;therapy-miles&#x02019; ought to be considered when planning and prescribing patient treatment.</p><p>Our finding of a saving of about 87 to 215&#x02005;kg CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for each patient receiving TARGIT (and thus from making TARGIT available to every patient with breast cancer having a lumpectomy in the NHS) is considerably greater than the estimated savings of the study investigating the benefits of introducing a different mode of improving access to services, namely, mobile breast screening units, which is about 1.25&#x02005;kg CO<sub>2</sub> per woman screened.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>We conclude that introducing TARGIT as an option for appropriate patients in the UK will contribute significantly to saving patients time, cost, fuel and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to Mr Andrew Binmore, BSc (Hons), Forestry Dip.Th, for his advice and analysis of the tree physiology and carbon sequestration data in UK forestry and to Mr Stephen Foulds for his programming skills.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Twitter:</bold> Follow Jayant Vaidya at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/jsvaidya">@jsvaidya</ext-link></p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> NJC, JMC, UJV, JS, MaB, DB, RR, TD, DJAA, IP, NW, JST, MiB and JSV were involved in the conception, design, data collection and analysis, manuscript writing and final approval.
