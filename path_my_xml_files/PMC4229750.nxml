Long-term stabilization of periodontal health in such patients usually requires comprehensive mechanical/surgical and antimicrobial therapy. However, conservative periodontal therapy may result in reparative wound healing with limited regeneration of the lost tissues, which has always been a challenge in clinical periodontics.</p><p>Regeneration is defined as reproduction or reconstitution of a lost or injured part.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] It is, therefore, a biologic process by which the architecture and function of the lost tissues are completely restored. The main approaches for periodontal regeneration requires introduction of a &#x0201c;filler&#x0201d; material into the periodontal defect in the hope of inducing bone regeneration.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] For decades, various types of synthetic artificial bone substitutes have been utilized for regenerative periodontal treatment in intra-bony defects.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Porous hydroxyapatite (HA) bone grafting material has been used to fill periodontal intra-bony defects, which has resulted in clinically acceptable responses.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] However, true periodontal regeneration is not achieved because the healing, which occurs is a connective tissue encapsulation of the graft with a long junctional epithelium.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Alternatively, techniques are being developed to guide and instruct the specialized cellular components of the periodontium to participate in the regenerative process.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] This latter approach to reconstruction makes use of understanding of the development of the periodontium and the cellular processes that are involved. Polypeptide growth factors are biological mediators that have the ability to regulate cell proliferation, chemotaxis, differentiation, and extracellular matrix synthesis.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Unfortunately, these important wound healing proteins have not been available to clinicians for frequent use. However, the use of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) to make platelet gel allows clinician to concentrate naturally occurring growth factors for immediate clinical use.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The processing of PRP involves the sequestration and concentration of platelets through centrifugation and subsequent polymerization.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Platelets play a crucial role wound healing because they promote the initial coagulation at wound site and also release many wound healing growth factors.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Thrombin and calcium are usually added to platelet concentrate (PC) to induce platelet aggregation and degranulation, release of growth factors, and better handling of the graft material. The basic strategy is to amplify and accelerate the effects of growth factors contained in the platelets (platelet derived growth factor [PDGF], transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;, insulin-like growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, epithelial growth factor), which are universal initiators of almost all wound healing.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The use of PRP as an adjunct to bone grafting procedures has become an attractive option since its introduction by Whitman <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and Marx <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Platelet-rich plasma also contains three proteins (fibrinogen, fibronectin, vitronectin) in blood known to act as cell adhesion molecules for osteoconduction and as a matrix for bone and connective tissue.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Due to its high fibrin content, PRP presents with a &#x0201c;sticky&#x0201d; characteristic which works as a hemostatic and stabilizing agent and may aid the blood clot and bone graft immobilization in the defect area.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Fibrin component of PRP also adheres to the root surface and so may impede the apical migration of epithelial cells and connective tissue cells from the flap.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare efficacy of PRP combined with HA graft, and HA graft alone in the treatment of intra-bony defects in L-AgP patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>This study was a randomized controlled clinical trial, carried out after obtaining the ethical clearance from Institutional Review Board.

Occlusal stents for positioning the UNC-15 probe were fabricated with self-cured acrylic resin on a cast obtained from an alginate impression.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The occlusal stent was made to cover the occlusal surfaces and were also extended apically on the buccal and lingual surfaces to cover the coronal third of the teeth involved. A wire was placed on the bucco-occlusal line angle of teeth during fabrication. This wire was then exposed by making grooves in the inter-dental regions, such that the probe when inserted in the inter-proximal area was in contact with the wire; hence, the probe position and angulation remained the same for all pre- and post-operative measurements. Using the groove and wire as a guide, the periodontal probe was inserted into the gingival sulcus and pocket depth (using the gingival margin as reference), and RAL (using the stent wire as a reference) were recorded.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Radiographic measurements</title><p>Radiographs were taken using the RINN XCP system<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Dentsply, USA) by the standardized paralleling technique with the digital radiovisuography (RVG) (Suni Ray<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Suni Imaging Microsystem Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). The size of the defect was calculated using the RVG software X-ray Vision<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Apetryx. In order to calibrate measurements digitally, the distance from the cusp tip to the cementoenamel junction was measured clinically after flap reflection and recorded, the same was measured radiographically and all further radiographic measurements were calibrated according to this scale.

Biologic molecules, such as growth factors, could enhance regeneration. PRP, which is an autologous volume of plasma with a high PC, has been shown to contain several growth factors that may enhance wound healing and shorten the healing period.</p><p>Very few studies have analyzed periodontal regenerative treatment in patients affected by L-AgP. The clinical results of this study demonstrated that the use of PRP and HA in intra-bony defects may lead to statistically significant periodontal probing depth reduction and clinical attachment loss (CAL) gain for patients with L-AgP. In this study, the comparison was done between the maxillary and mandibular sites as there are anatomical differences between the bone and the teeth of the two arches.</p><p>In this study, reduction in plaque scores and BOP was observed, from their preprophylactic levels to preoperative levels and then up to 12 months postoperatively. The improvement in scores support the observed treatment effects obtained under a strict oral hygiene regimen. These results are in accordance with the results of Hanna <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] who reported that all patients enrolled for the study maintained very low mean plaque index scores of 0.98 at baseline and 0.43 at 6 months and also very low mean gingival index scores of 0.40 at baseline and 0.22 at 6 months. Okuda <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] reported no significant difference in plaque index scores, gingival index and BOP scores at baseline and 12 months between the PRP + HA and HA + saline groups. Results of this study are also in conformity with the studies with triple combination therapy including PRP, bovine porous bone mineral (BPBM), and guided tissue regeneration (GTR) carried out by Camargo <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Lekovic <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Lekovic <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Camargo <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] in which they reported slight decrease in plaque index and scores sulcus bleeding index from baseline to 6 months postoperatively, the difference was not statistically significant between the test and the control groups.</p><p>Results of this study show that the decrease in PD and gain in RAL was more where defects were filled with PRP + HA graft. These results are in conformity with the results of Hanna <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] who compared bovine-derived xenograft (BDX) with and without PRP in the treatment of human intra-bony defects. The mean PD of the deepest sites in the group treated with BDX showed a reduction from 7.0 to 4.46, while in the PRP/BDX treated group, the mean PD reduction was from 7.3 to 3.76. This change amounts to 2.54 and 3.54 mm in BDX and PRP/BDX treated groups respectively, and were comparable to our study. Okuda <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] compared a combination of PRP and HA with a mixture of HA and saline in a 1-year study. The mean PD difference from baseline to 12 months was 4.7 in the PRP + HA sites and 3.7 in the HA sites. They also reported 3.14 mm of CAL gain in the intra-bony defects treated with PRP + HA graft in comparison to 2.0 mm in the HA graft sites. They concluded that the test group exhibited statistically significant changes compared to the control sites in PD reduction and CAL gain. Ouyang and Qiao[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] evaluated the effectiveness of PRP as an adjunct to BPBM graft in the treatment of human intra-bony defects and reported that the test group exhibited statistically significant changes compared to the control sites in PD reduction. They also reported that the group receiving PRP + BPBM exhibited 4.52 mm of mean CAL gain as compared with 2.85 mm in the group receiving BPBM alone. The triple combination therapy including PRP, BPBM, and GTR was found clinically more effective in reducing the pocket depth and CAL than open flap debridement[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and GTR,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] but no significant differences with a combination of PRP + BPBM.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Lekovic <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] have reported that GTR adds no clinical benefit to PRP + BPBM, which means the combination of PRP + BPBM might prove the same clinical benefit as the triple combination. In a similar study conducted on 60 patients of chronic periodontitis, the efficacy of PRP/HA bone graft combination with a mixture of HA/saline was evaluated. Results showed a significant PD reduction (5.4 &#x000b1; 0.49 mm vs. 4.0 &#x000b1; 0.45 mm) and clinical attachment gain (5.4 &#x000b1; 1.2 mm vs. 3.1 &#x000b1; 1.1 mm).[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Whereas, in both the studies of D&#x000f6;ri <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] no significant difference in pocket reduction and CAL gain between the two groups were reported. The difference could be attributed to the reason that no blood parameters were evaluated, which may entail the risk of production of PRP volumes with low PCs leading to disappointing results.</p><p>Results of this study indicated a greater amount of bone gain with PRP + HA graft. The bone gain by PRP + HA observed in this study is in accordance with the study by Marx <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] who reported that the addition of PRP to grafts evidenced a radiographic maturation rate 1.62&#x02013;2.16 times that of grafts without PRP. The histomorphometric assessment provided evidence of greater trabecular bone density in grafts in which PRP was added than in grafts in which PRP was not added. Nevins <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] observed that bone height increased from a mean of 7.38 to 9.52 mm in defects treated by rhPDGF + allogeneic bone. This change amounts to 2.14 mm. McGuire <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] observed a substantial increase in linear bone gain and percent bone fill in sites treated with rhPDGF-BB + &#x003b2;-tricalcium phosphate (&#x003b2;-TCP) as compared with sites treated with &#x003b2;-TCP + buffer. Menezes and Rao[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] also reported a significantly increased defect fill in PRP/HA treated defects as compared with HA/saline cases (3.2 &#x000b1; 0.8 mm vs. 2.1 &#x000b1; 0.6 mm). However, Tamura <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] have reported that the addition of PRP to porous &#x003b2;-TCP for onlay bone grafting produced no significant difference in the relative amounts of mineralized bone generated in the blocks. This difference may be attributed to the density of platelets in PRP that increased only 3.5-fold relative to peripheral blood, whereas in this study, there was a 5-10 fold increase in PC relative to peripheral blood. This can be explained by differences in the procedure for blood centrifugation.</p><p>Finally, it can be suggested that the successful treatment of intra-bony defects may not be related only to the addition of PRP to HA graft. Other factors may play a more significant role in affecting the regenerative responses to the graft materials. Any or all of the following factors may influence periodontal regeneration: Depth and width of the defect and attachment level prior to treatment, thickness of the gingival flap, plaque accumulation, quality of the recall maintenance program, periodontal history of the affected tooth, healing response of the subject and clinicians&#x02019; surgical skill. The decision to treat a defect with a regenerative technique must be based on consideration of these factors, which in turn will determine the predictability of a successful result. Additionally, it is important to point to the practical aspects related to PRP preparation, which involves an additional step to the surgical procedure. The many steps involved in PRP procurement makes the procedure technique sensitive, which may lead to different growth factor concentration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study showed that both treatments (PRP/HA and HA) provided significant improvements in clinical and radiographic parameters for intra-bony periodontal defects in patients with L-AgP in a 12-month postoperative period. PRP/HA group presented superior results regarding PD reduction, clinical attachment gain and radiographic bone fill than HA group.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><collab>American Academy of Periodontology</collab><article-title>Glossary of Periodontal Terms</article-title><year>2001</year><edition>4th ed</edition><publisher-loc>Chicago</publisher-loc><publisher-name>American Academy of Periodontology</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bartold</surname><given-names>PM</given-names></name><name><surname>McCulloch</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name><name><surname>Narayanan</surname><given-names>AS</given-names></name><name><surname>Pitaru</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Tissue engineering: A new paradigm for periodontal regeneration based on molecular and cell biology</article-title><source>Periodontol 2000</source><year>2000</year><volume>24</volume><fpage>253</fpage><lpage>69</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11276871</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Yukna</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Synthetic bone grafts in periodontics</article-title><source>Periodontol 2000</source><year>1993</year><volume>1</volume><fpage>92</fpage><lpage>9</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kenney</surname><given-names>EB</given-names></name><name><surname>Lekovic</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Carranza</surname><given-names>FA</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name><name><surname>Dimitrijevic</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The use of a porous hydroxylapatite implant in periodontal defects.
