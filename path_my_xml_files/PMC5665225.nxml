We have developed a structured individual-based lifestyle education (SILE) programme for T2D. With attention now being paid to techniques to change behaviour, we recently developed a behavioural type-specific SILE (BETSILE) programme. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the BETSILE programme compared with the SILE programme for reducing glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in patients with T2D and special behavioural types by a cluster randomised controlled trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This is a 6-month cluster randomised controlled trial with two intervention arms (BETSILE vs SILE) provided in a medical care setting by randomising registered dietitians for patients with T2D aged 20&#x02013;79 years. Patients&#x02019; behavioural types were classified into four types (BT1 to BT4) using an assessment sheet. We will perform independent trials for BT1 and BT2. The primary endpoint is a change from the baseline HbA1c value at 6 months. Differences between the SILE and BETSILE groups will be primarily analysed following the intention-to-treat principle. Crude and multivariate adjusted effects will be examined after adjusting for covariates, using a general linear mixed-effects model for continuous variables and a logistic regression mixed-effects model for dichotomous variables. Sample sizes needed were calculated assuming effect sizes of 0.42 and 0.33 for BT1 and BT2, respectively, an intraclass correlation of 0.02, a significance level of 5% (two-sided), a power of 80%, and equal allocation of clusters to the two arms, with each cluster having three BT1 patients for the SILE and BETSILE arms and six BT2 patients for the SILE and BETSILE arms. We will need 16 dietitians for each arm, and a total 288 patients will be required.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This study has been approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Teikyo University (No.15&#x02013;222).

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is now considered to be a global health issue, and preventing the onset and progression of diabetes is regarded as an important health measure in Japan.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> The ability to continuously self-manage lifestyle habits such as dietary habits and physical activities has a significant impact on the prevention of progression of T2D. The effectiveness of diabetes education, such as on diet and exercise, has been observed internationally,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref> and standardised diabetes education programmes have been published.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> In recent years, it has been expected that health guidance will be applied to prevent the progression of diseases, including T2D, in Japan. There has been a gradual increase in the demand to motivate and promote effective behavioural changes in individuals by providing support for improvements in lifestyle issues, but little has been done to develop a standardised diabetes education programme.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</p><p>Despite a proliferation of programmes and interventions to encourage and support dietary changes, bringing about lifestyle changes remains elusive. There are many barriers to lifestyle change.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy and psychodynamic therapy, has been evaluated for its effectiveness in glycaemic control<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>; however, the effectiveness of behaviour type-specific interventions in achieving glycaemic control has not been examined and we expect that it may be effective in achieving such control.</p><p>The dual process theory (DPT)<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> is widely known in the fields of cognitive and social psychology. Specifically, in the DPT the processes of &#x02018;System 1&#x02019; are unconscious, rapid, automatic, and high capacity, while those of &#x02018;System 2&#x02019; are conscious and slow. Human decision-making and behaviour are considered to be carried out by either System 1 or System 2. Daniel Kahneman explained that System 2 prevents the impulses of System 1 (self-control) and prevents various cognitive and judgement errors (cognitive bias) by easily entering into System 1; thus the two systems are mutually related. We can recognise differences among individuals in relation to these two systems&#x02014;some people are more like System 2, while others are closer to System 1.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</p><p>Education directed toward improvement in lifestyles, such as dietary habits and physical activity, is known to be effective in preventing the onset and progression of diabetes. On the other hand, education incorporating the behavioural science approach has been identified as important to encouraging a behavioural change in patients,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> but the effect of practical education on lifestyles has been rarely examined. Both within and outside of Japan, few studies have examined improvements in lifestyle taking into account the study participants&#x02019; characteristics.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
</p><p>From our experience, lifestyle behaviour is associated with the systems described above and lifestyles can be changed depending on the types of behaviour according to those systems, especially for behaviour type 1 (BT1) and BT2. To use the mechanisms of DPT and to combine a behavioural type-specific approach, our experiences as registered dietitians may help to shift patients to more effective health choices. Therefore, we considered that a scientifically-based programme to evaluate effectiveness was essential. We previously developed a structured individual-based lifestyle education (SILE) programme for glycaemic control.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> SILE utilises the food frequency questionnaire (FFQW82) to estimate nutritional intake for patients with non-communicable diseases.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> We examined the validity of SILE by a randomisation trial and confirmed its effectiveness.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;18</xref>
</p><p>In order to improve the effectiveness of our educational programme, we propose a new behavioural type-specific SILE programme (BETSILE) corresponding to patients&#x02019; behavioural types.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Behaviour is classified into four types (BT1 to BT4) based on an assessment sheet of the &#x02018;Behavioural type specific chart&#x02019;.</p><p>In our experiences as registered dietitians, in patients with BT1 and BT2 better behaviour could be achieved by the type-specific approach. As for patients with BT3 and BT4, when considering feasibility and benefit to patients, we decided to conduct trials using BT3 and BT4 in the future after determining the value of the BETSILE programme.</p><p>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the BETSILE with that of the SILE programme for T2D patients with BT1 and BT2 in reducing the level of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) by a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT). If successful, the BETSILE programme can contribute to further improvement in preventing the onset and progression of T2D.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>The study is an open-label, multicentre, parallel-group comparison trial based on cluster randomisation (trial registration code: UMIN 000023087). An open-label design was necessary as the healthcare workers who performed the intervention at hospitals and clinics (hereafter referred to as &#x02018;medical settings&#x02019;) could not be blinded.</p><p>Patients enrolled in the trials for BT1 and BT2 will be classified using the &#x02018;Behavioural type-specific chart&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>), and the two trials will be performed simultaneously in parallel as separate trials. Classification using this chart was done by four questions. Those four questions were selected from 14 assessment questions based on the result of pattern analysis using correspondence analysis (or Hayashi&#x02019;s Quantification Method 3) on awareness, motivation and behaviour of individuals who received outpatient dietary consultations.

The registered dietitians who are employed in the medical setting will be allocated to each group of patients using a cluster randomised allocation. In each cluster, the registered dietitian works for both trials (for BT1 and BT2) and enrols three patients for BT1 and six patients for BT2 within the recruitment period. Each unit of the cluster (one registered dietitian/unit) comprises nine patients (n=3 for BT1 patients, n=6 for BT2 patients). Cluster allocation will be used to avoid the possibility of contamination of information exchange within the same medical settings when different intervention methods are used.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>

Namely, lifestyle improvements do not rely solely on intra-individual factors such as one&#x02019;s own effort but rather extra-individual factors, such as environmental barriers.</p><p>In the DPT, System 1 is automatic, emotional, and sensory, and reactions cannot be controlled autonomously; erroneous recognition is also likely to occur. Conversely System 2 is related to logic, control, paying attention, thinking deeply, and endeavouring to achieve, but it is difficult to make this system work when the person participating feels busy or discouraged. In the DPT, decision-making and behaviour is dependent on these two systems. Some people&#x02019;s mode of action is similar to System 2, while that of others is close to System 1.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</p><p>As for the approach to improvements in lifestyle by the two behavioural types (BT1, BT2) in BETSILE, BT1 tends to be strongly influenced by factors that often hinder the appearance of System 2, while BT2 tends to be biased towards System 1. Considering these features, we adopted the following educational approach.</p><p>For those with BT1 it is easy to erroneously assume that &#x02018;complications do not occur to oneself&#x02019;. Therefore, at the first interview, we begin by giving the patient correct information based on clinical data (plasma glucose levels and HbA1c) and evidence of the patient&#x02019;s actual condition and health risk, and correcting wrong assumptions. Also a BT1 individual tends to feel a considerable burden regarding bringing about lifestyle improvements because of feelings of being overwhelmed by a busy daily life, work, etc. In response to these feelings, at the first session using the BETSILE approach, the dietitian states: &#x0201c;If you achieve even one effective behaviour, your weight and clinical data (plasma glucose levels and HbA1c) may improve&#x0201d;. Furthermore, in setting an action target, enough time must be given to consider the barriers to its execution and finding what can be done despite having a busy schedule or other barriers to success. These small steps reduce the sense of burden imposed by attempting lifestyle improvements and encourage the adoption of System 2 which may lead to subjective control.</p><p>BT2 is not good at subjective decision-making or aggressive behaviour, for instance, &#x0201c;I want to carry this out if possible&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;I can do it if I try, maybe&#x0201d;. BT2 individuals are easily attracted to solutions such as health foods, health equipment, opinions of family members, etc. Even though there is a willingness to improve, execution tends not to last long. Therefore, for BT2, it is effective to encourage lifestyle improvements that will not be affected by outside influences by encouraging the use of System 2 by repeatedly paying attention to &#x02018;your health&#x02019; at each session. Furthermore, the dietitian will recommend repeatedly that meals should be taken in accordance with the &#x02018;model menu&#x02019;, which shows suitable amounts for that individual, and to pay attention at meal time as to the appropriateness of the amount. Furthermore, dietitians will induce the participant to record dietary intakes. These practices may be related to System 2 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Specific characteristics and approach to study participants according to type</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Behavioural type 1 (BT1)</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Behavioural type 2 (BT2)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Characteristic of type</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

The SILE programme was performed according to the nutrition care management (NCM) approaches with the additional educational approach for self-management and empowerment. NCM is a nutrition management system consisting of nutrition screening, nutrition assessment, and a nutrition care plan that involves implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. For the period from the first counselling session (start of intervention) up to 6 months (&#x000b1;1&#x02009;month), the registered dietitian holds three or more counselling sessions. The second and third counselling sessions are held 1&#x02009;month and 3 months (&#x000b1;1&#x02009;month), respectively, after the first.</p><p>In the first session, assessment by the FFQW82 (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP3">supplementary table 2</xref>) is done to review daily dietary intakes. Based on the nutrition assessment the registered dietitian supports the participant to independently set goals for improvement of diet, physical activity, and glycaemic control. Physical activity will be measured by a questionnaire.

Family medical history, current exercise, and smoking and drinking habits will be assessed using a self-rated questionnaire. Furthermore, changes in energy and nutrient intakes and the fat/protein/carbohydrate energy ratio are assessed using the FFQW82. Moreover, the difference in the HbA1c levels between the two groups at the 12th month (&#x000b1;1&#x02009;month) (at the completion of observation) from the first intervention compared with those at the time of study registration is examined as an exploratory analysis.

These estimated HbA1c improvements were based on our dietitians&#x02019; experience and a preliminary study (not published). Each registered dietitian has to assist three participants with BT1; therefore, in total 32 registered dietitians are required for the SILE (16) and BETSILE (16) groups. Similarly, each registered dietitian has to assist six participants with BT2; therefore 32 dietitians are required for SILE (16) and BETSILE (16). By amalgamating these, we need 32 registered dietitians for trials of BT1 and BT2 participants (288 patients in total). This study will be conducted in the usual clinical settings and the period is 6 months, which is not long. Therefore, the dropout rate will be expected to be low.

Continuous and self-managed lifestyle change programmes in which effectiveness is evaluated exist in many other countries. However, there are few programmes other than SILE that have been evaluated for effectiveness by an RCT in Japan and that involves self-managed lifestyle change. Furthermore, the behavioural type classification method is the first of its kind to be used for operational classification based on analysed data on patients&#x02019; intention to improve their health, patients&#x02019; initiative in achieving goals, and application of patients&#x02019; dietary knowledge. To our knowledge, there is little research in and outside of Japan on a lifestyle improvement programme that specifically considered participants&#x02019; characteristics. Scientifically verified knowledge will encourage patients to change behaviours and in achieving such changes to reach even greater goals, and makes this research distinctive.</p><p>The advantage of this study is the addition of the new behavioural-type clustered approach to the SILE programme to prevent the serious effects of diabetes (BETSILE programme). The BETSILE programme can incorporate the behavioural science approach with information on characteristics of study participants and encourage behaviour modification, and is expected to facilitate more easily efforts toward glycaemic control by patients with diabetes in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e216" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-017838.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e217" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-017838.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> MA, KY, MW and TT were responsible for designing the research questions and drafting the study protocol.
