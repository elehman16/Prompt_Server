Depending on definitions, 25-50 % of patients aged 75&#x000a0;years or older are exposed to at least five drugs. Evidence is increasing that polypharmacy, even when guidelines advise the prescribing of each drug individually, can potentially cause more harm than benefit to older patients, due to factors such as drug-drug and drug-disease interactions. Several approaches reducing polypharmacy and inappropriate prescribing have been proposed, but evidence showing a benefit of these measures regarding clinically relevant endpoints is scarce. There is an urgent need to implement more effective strategies. We therefore set out to develop an evidence-based electronic decision support (eDS) tool to aid physicians in reducing inappropriate prescribing and test its effectiveness in a large-scale cluster-randomized controlled trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The &#x0201c;<bold>P</bold>olypharmacy in chronic diseases&#x02013;<bold>R</bold>eduction of <bold>I</bold>nappropriate <bold>M</bold>edication and <bold>A</bold>dverse drug events in older populations&#x0201d; (PRIMA)-eDS tool is a tool comprising an indication check and recommendations for the reduction of polypharmacy and inappropriate prescribing based on systematic reviews and guidelines, the European list of inappropriate medications for older people, the SFINX-database of interactions, the PHARAO-database on adverse effects, and the RENBASE-database on renal dosing. The tool will be evaluated in a cluster-randomized controlled trial involving 325 general practitioners (GPs) and around 3500 patients across five study centres in the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria and Italy. GP practices will be asked to recruit 11 patients aged 75&#x000a0;years or older who are taking at least eight medications and will be cluster-randomized after completion of patient recruitment. Intervention GPs will have access to the PRIMA-eDS tool, while control GPs will treat their patients according to current guidelines (usual care) without access to the PRIMA-eDS tool. After an observation time of 2&#x000a0;years, intervention and control groups will be compared regarding the primary composite endpoint of first non-elective hospitalization or death.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The principal hypothesis is that reduction of polypharmacy and inappropriate prescribing can improve the clinical composite outcome of hospitalization or death. A positive result of the trial will contribute substantially to the improvement of care in multimorbidity. The trial is necessary to investigate not only whether the reduction of polypharmacy improves outcome, but also whether GPs and patients are willing to follow the recommendations of the PRIMA-eDS tool.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">This trial has been registered with Current Controlled Trials Ltd. on 31 July 2014 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN10137559">ISRCTN10137559</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-016-1177-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Polypharmacy</kwd><kwd>Electronic decision support</kwd><kwd>Primary care</kwd><kwd>Multimorbidity</kwd><kwd>Inappropriate prescribing</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme (BE)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Health-2012-Innovation-1-2.2.2.-2 grant 305388-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>S&#x000f6;nnichsen</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p id="Par18">The prevalence of multimorbidity is substantial and affects more than half of the population aged 75&#x000a0;years or older in developed countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Cardiovascular disease (including coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and peripheral vascular disease), heart failure, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, musculoskeletal pain, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and mental diseases like depression and dementia most often co-occur, with heart failure showing the highest rate of comorbidity, being accompanied by an average of 2.9 additional chronic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It is generally recommended to treat each chronic condition in accordance with disease-specific guidelines. However, most clinical practice guidelines do not modify or discuss the applicability of their recommendations for older patients with multiple diseases and following all guidelines for each and every drug a patient is taking will inevitably lead to polypharmacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Even though the term &#x0201c;polypharmacy&#x0201d; is frequently used to describe the use of multiple medications, a clear definition is still lacking. The variety of definitions reflects the difficulty in setting an accurate cut-off point. According to the medical literature review of Bushardt et al., the most common cut-off point is the use of more than five medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Depending on definitions and setting, between 25 and 50&#x000a0;% of all patients age 75&#x000a0;years or older are exposed to five or more drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The clinical trial evidence of benefit for most drugs is based on studies of mostly younger, fitter subjects with a life expectancy of many years, even though these drugs are most often prescribed for older patients with multimorbidity, and the findings of these studies may not be so applicable due to drug-drug and drug-disease interactions as well as aging processes and a reduced life expectancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Polypharmacy is associated with an increased risk for medication errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and adverse drug events (ADE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] which in turn are frequent causes of hospitalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Various international studies report a hospitalization rate due to ADE of between 2.4 and 16.6&#x000a0;%, depending largely on the age group evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Polypharmacy and inappropriate medication have been shown to contribute substantially to the burden of morbidity, hospitalization and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Up to 50&#x000a0;% of ADE and ADE-related hospitalizations are judged to be preventable by avoiding inappropriate prescribing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Although exact figures are not available for all countries, it may be assumed that between 60 and 80&#x000a0;% of all patient prescriptions are initiated by general practitioners (GPs). In Germany, 67.6&#x000a0;% of all prescriptions covered by statutory public health insurance are attributable to GPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Any intervention aimed at the reduction of polypharmacy will, therefore, be most effective if targeted at GPs.</p><p id="Par21">A number of diverse approaches to reduce polypharmacy and inappropriate prescribing have been proposed, but no convincing evidence from sufficiently powered randomized controlled trials exists regarding their practicality for use in primary care or their impact on clinically relevant endpoints. There is limited evidence that the Beers Criteria list of potentially inappropriate medications (PIM) for older patients has some associations with adverse outcomes, but this evidence is mostly based on retrospective cohort studies, and there is no study showing that avoiding drugs on a PIM list for older patients like the Beers list will improve outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. There is also preliminary evidence that the prudent reduction of polypharmacy using the Garfinkel algorithm may be beneficial to patients, but Garfinkel used a non-randomized design in his studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Similarly, it has been shown that the application of STOPP-criteria is associated with ADE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and a reduction of PIMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], but a randomized controlled trial proving that this also improves clinical outcome does not exist.</p><p id="Par22">Use of a simple interdisciplinary medication review has been shown to lead to the reduction of inappropriate prescribing and costs, but there was no effect on clinically relevant patient outcomes, possibly due to a lack of power and insufficient observation time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Some authors suggest a &#x0201c;process of deprescribing,&#x0201d; prioritizing drugs in a patient with polypharmacy according to each drug&#x02019;s risk/benefit ratio, but likewise we do not have evidence from randomized trials supporting this strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">A recently updated Cochrane review concluded that both the application of the &#x0201c;medication appropriateness index&#x0201d; (MAI) and the Beers list appeared to improve medication appropriateness, but effects on outcome were inconsistent, and the quality of evidence has been graded as low or very low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Moreover, most of the studies included in the review were carried out in a hospital or nursing home setting.</p><p id="Par25">There is a strong need for improved interventions to reduce inappropriate prescribing and polypharmacy, especially in the primary care setting. We therefore set out to develop an electronic decision support (eDS) tool based on current best evidence and targeted at the primary care setting to help GPs identify and reduce inappropriate prescribing and polypharmacy in older patients. The principal intervention will be the recommendation for drug discontinuation or modification by the &#x0201c;Polypharmacy in chronic diseases&#x02013;Reduction of Inappropriate Medication and Adverse drug events in older populations&#x0201d; (PRIMA)-eDS tool (see Methods section for further description of the tool).</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives of the study</title><p id="Par26">Our principal hypothesis is that the reduction of polypharmacy and inappropriate prescribing will improve clinical outcomes for older patients.

The intended GP practice cluster size is around 11 patients (see sample size calculation). To assure concealment of allocation, each GP practice reports to the Department of Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, Ruhr University, Bochum, Germany as soon as patient recruitment has been completed, and is then cluster-randomized by computerized sequence generation. Thus, neither patients nor GPs will know whether they will take part as an intervention or control cluster at the time of recruitment.

</p><p id="Par46">The PRIMA-eDS tool supports GPs to reconsider, modify or stop the use of certain drugs in older patients with polypharmacy. Recommendations provided by the tool do not replace careful clinical consideration by physicians, nor clinical guidelines, but aim at supporting clinical decisions.</p><p id="Par47">After entering diagnoses, current medication including drugs that have not been prescribed by the GP, and other patient data (current symptoms, biometric measurements and laboratory values), the GP will receive an on-screen &#x0201c;Comprehensive Medication Review&#x0201d; report, generated by the PRIMA-eDS tool and detailing all the relevant prescribing recommendations. The patient&#x02019;s list of medications can then be reviewed and revised accordingly by the GP in a shared decision-making process with the patient. A record will be made of which recommendations were adopted. GPs will be explicitly instructed that any decision to continue or discontinue a drug according to or against the advice of the PRIMA-eDS tool remains at the discretion of the GP and the patient. All intervention GPs will be trained to use the PRIMA-eDS tool. Training options will include personal training, group training, webinars and a handbook.</p><p id="Par48">Before the start of the trial, the tool has been evaluated in a feasibility study which has been presented at the 16<sup>th</sup> annual meeting of the German Network for Evidence-based Medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The tool as a whole has not yet been tested for validity or reliability, but substantial work has demonstrated the feasibility and applicability of the various components of the tool. The use of clinical decision support (CDS) for promoting appropriate, safe, and cost-effective drug use has become common as an inbuilt feature of advanced electronic health record (EHR) systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. CDS can also be implemented as an externally offered service that is integrated with an EHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The EBMeDS CDS system (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebmeds.org">www.ebmeds.org</ext-link>) is a service developed by Duodecim Medical Publications Ltd. since 2003. An early version of EBMeDS containing a variety of decision support rules was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Databases on drug-drug interactions and renal dosing developed by Medbase Ltd. have been included in EBMeDS. The design and usability of these databases have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and their impact evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Because of its modular design, comprehensiveness and easy integration with EHRs and case-report forms, EBMeDS was selected as the platform for developing the PRIMA-eDS tool. All components of the tool are regularly updated during the trial by the corresponding provider and by the PRIMA-eDS&#x000a0;consortium.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Control</title><p id="Par49">GPs in the control group will be asked to record the medication and other data of the participating patients at the same time points as the intervention group. Control group GPs will provide their patients with the care they would normally receive (usual care), including adhering to any relevant current guidelines, some of which may be country-specific, but without the help or recommendations from the PRIMA-eDS tool which will not be available to them.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Documentation and monitoring</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Baseline-examination</title><p id="Par50">Shortly after consent is obtained, the GPs will assess the following parameters and record all data in each patient&#x02019;s electronic case report form (eCRF):<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par51">Age, sex, height, weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par52">All drugs with a systemic effect</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par53">All diagnoses</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par54">Current symptoms (within last month)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par55">Falls within the last 3&#x000a0;months&#x000a0;requiring medical attention</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par56">Creatinine, blood glucose, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), platelet count, international normalized ratio (INR), cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, triglycerides, potassium, sodium. With the exception of creatinine level, GPs should not initiate additional laboratory examinations solely for the study due to ethical reasons and to avoid contamination in this pragmatic trial. They should rather enter the latest values available in the health record and include the date of the measurement. If the tool requires a laboratory value for a recommendation, it provides this information to the GP.

One exception is the quality of life questionnaire (SF-12v2), which will be collected at 8 and 24&#x000a0;months only. GPs in the intervention group will conduct further medication reviews using the PRIMA-eDS tool for their participating patients, and make the medication changes they think are appropriate, at each follow-up and final visit. Control group GPs will continue to provide usual care to their patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Monitoring</title><p id="Par62">Monitoring is performed according to a prespecified monitoring charter. Independent monitors selected by the corresponding study centers will conduct all monitoring. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be checked electronically. The monitors will control whether the informed consent forms of all participants are correctly filled out and signed. All other data will be monitored at each follow-up visit in a random sample of 10&#x000a0;% of the GPs. On-site visits are performed at T0 and T3. Monitors will compare the entries of all study patient records to the entries in the eCRF regarding age, sex and medication. In a random sample of three patients, monitors will check the eCRF entries of the medication plus doses, diagnoses, falls, and laboratory results as well as height and weight, and compare these data to the patient record. Additionally at T3, monitors will check all reported and not reported non-elective hospital admissions as well as adherence to protocol visits with the practice record. At T1 and T2 monitors will check this via phone verification. Furthermore, at T1 to&#x000a0;T3, monitors will monitor 100&#x000a0;% of the reported dropouts via phone verification, and in a random sample of 10&#x000a0;% of the practices they will check the reported hospital admissions and deaths of all patients of the practice.</p><p id="Par63">For safety purposes, the PRIMA-eDS consortium will appoint a Safety and Data Monitoring Committee (SDMC) consisting of three experienced researchers, including one clinical trial statistician. The committee is independent from the investigators and will review the accumulated trial data. They will perform interim analyses regarding the primary endpoints 4&#x000a0;months after the follow-up visits exclusively for safety reasons and without disclosure of the randomization. Additionally, ADEs will be monitored regularly. The results will be available only to the SDMC. The SDMC will report any recommendation on necessary trial modifications or a trial abort to the principal investigator and the coordinating monitors. The SDMC will recommend termination of the trial if clinically relevant safety concerns arise in either the control or the intervention group. No explicit stopping rules have been developed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Primary outcome</title><p id="Par64">The primary outcome is a composite endpoint of first non-elective hospital admission or death during the observation period measured as a binary outcome. This avoids issues of a potential trade-off between these two forms of event and also allows all patients to be included in the primary analysis. Primary outcome measures are recorded by the GPs when they occur or at follow-up visits every 8&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Secondary outcome</title><p id="Par65">Secondary endpoints are all cause mortality, non-elective hospital admission (number of episodes and duration), falls (number and severity), fractures, quality of life (SF-12v2), the number and types of drugs (total number, number discontinued, number not discontinued despite the recommendation to discontinue, number re-administered for symptom control), adverse event rate, and medication costs over the observation period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Potential harms and patient safety</title><p id="Par66">We do not expect any specific complications or harms for patients because only non-evidence-based medications will be discontinued. However, there is a slight possibility that the discontinuation of a drug might lead to reappearance or development of new symptoms. In this case, the medication can be restarted at any time at the discretion of the GP. The PRIMA-eDS tool only provides recommendations based on current best evidence. The decision about the medication always remains with the GP in agreement with the patient. Nevertheless, we monitor potential harms. GPs are required to report serious adverse events in the eCRF as soon as they get notice of the event, and all adverse events at the scheduled study visits. They are asked to judge whether the adverse event is associated with the intervention. All serious adverse events will be reported to the SDMC for final analysis and judgment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Data management and sample size calculation</title><p id="Par67">Sample size calculation is based on binary analysis of the primary endpoint (non-elective hospital admission or death within 2&#x000a0;years). The study sets out to prove superiority regarding the primary endpoint. Garfinkel observed an 18&#x000a0;% absolute risk reduction achieved by prudent reduction of polypharmacy in a non-randomized controlled trial (from 30&#x000a0;% in the control group to 12&#x000a0;% in the intervention group regarding the annual referral rate to acute care facilities) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This corresponds to a relative risk reduction of 60&#x000a0;% regarding this endpoint.</p><p id="Par68">However, considerably smaller reductions than this still represent substantial clinical and economic benefits; therefore, this study is powered to detect a relative risk reduction of 20&#x000a0;%. We expect to recruit healthier patients than Garfinkel and will use non-elective hospital admission (yes/no) instead of referral rate, because it seems less susceptible to bias. In addition, our primary outcome will combine mortality with hospital admission, since there may be trade-off between these. We have been unable to find empirical data on which to estimate the rate of admission and mortality for our population, but in England in 2010 there was an average of approximately one completed consultant episode for every person in the population aged 75&#x000a0;years or older [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The primary outcome of dropouts is coded as an &#x02018;event&#x02019; in both groups. Therefore, we consider a low estimate to be half the rate observed by Garfinkel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]: an annual admission and mortality rate of 15&#x000a0;% of control patients; or 30&#x000a0;% in 2&#x000a0;years. Calculations show that in the event of the actual rate being higher than this, the sample size given below is conservative (ie., larger, rather than smaller, than requirement).</p><p id="Par69">A relative risk reduction of 20&#x000a0;% in the intervention group implies a 2-year event rate of 24&#x000a0;% for that group.</p><p id="Par70">The sample size is calculated according to Hayes et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] for a power of 80&#x000a0;% (1-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.8), <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> =5&#x000a0;%, and an assumed intra-cluster correlation coefficient (for similarity in outcomes between patients within GP practices) of no more than 0.01 (derived from an earlier cluster-randomized trial involving GP practices as clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]). Dropouts in both groups will be considered as treatment failures. Further assuming attrition rates of 10&#x000a0;% of patients and 10&#x000a0;% of GP practices over the period of the study, sample sizes required at recruitment are 3542 patients (1771 per arm) across 322 GP practices at a mean of 11 patients per GP practice (Poisson random variation in patient numbers per GP practice is assumed). To operate a practicable number of GP practices and patients per country we are aiming at 325 GP practices (65 per study center) recruiting 3575 patients (11 patients per GP practice).

We are confronted with increasing evidence that current prescribing practices, which are highly conducive of polypharmacy in the treatment of multiple chronic diseases, do not achieve the same benefits as are observed in younger people with single diseases and may in fact be quite detrimental to the health of older people with multimorbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Very few existing studies have explicitly investigated drug treatments in older patients, and where they have done, have tended to focus on otherwise rather healthy patients. In contrast, the PRIMA-eDS trial will purposely sample and research an older-age population with multiple chronic conditions and many prescribed medicines, and will evaluate whether the polypharmacy and inappropriate prescribing burden can be safety reduced &#x02013; and health outcomes consequently improved &#x02013; within a routine primary care context.</p><p id="Par77">Our systematic reviews of the literature on drug benefits and risks (conducted in the context of the development of the PRIMA-eDS tool) will gather the available evidence and evaluate it critically regarding its applicability to an older population with multimorbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. We envisage that this will kick-start a process of continuous development of new guidelines specifically addressing drug treatments in the context of multimorbidity.</p><sec id="Sec25"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p id="Par78">We have explicitly decided to not include any recommendations in the PRIMA-eDS tool for starting patients on additional drugs, and this may be considered a weakness of our study. Our main objective is to demonstrate that the discontinuation of inappropriate drugs can improve patient outcomes. A combined intervention to stop inappropriate and start other (more appropriate) medications would impede us from differentiating out the effect of drug discontinuation.</p><p id="Par79">Furthermore, access to medical records differs by country. Italy and the UK are characterized by a primary care&#x000a0;centred health care system, with all medication data and diagnoses available to the GP. In these two countries we expect data from the electronic health records of the GPs to be largely complete. This is not the case in Germany or Austria where patients have direct access to specialists, and not all medication prescribed by a specialist will be known to the GP. We are asking GPs to address medication prescribed by specialists at the study visits to assure completeness of data. Nonetheless, patients&#x002bc; data in these countries carry a risk of being incomplete which might be considered a limitation of our study. However, the problem of incomplete medication data equally affects the intervention and the control group. We therefore believe that due to randomization being stratified by study centre, incomplete medication data will not bias our study results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par80">Recruitment started in January 2015 and is expected to be completed by 30 September, 2015.
