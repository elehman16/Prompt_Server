In Ecuador, a health promotion program improved the muscular strength and speed-agility, and reduced the decline of the moderate-to-vigorous physical activity of adolescents after 28&#x000a0;months. We performed a sub-group analysis to assess the differential effect of this intervention in overweight and low-fit adolescents.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We performed a cluster-randomized pair matched trial in schools located in Cuenca&#x02013;Ecuador. In total 20 schools (clusters) were pair matched, and 1440 adolescents of grade 8 and 9 (mean age of 12.3 and 13.3&#x000a0;years respectively) participated in the trial. For the purposes of the subgroup analysis, the adolescents were classified into groups according to their weight status (body mass index) and aerobic capacity (scores in the 20&#x000a0;m shuttle run and FITNESSGRAM standards) at baseline. Primary outcomes included physical fitness (vertical jump, speed shuttle run) and physical activity (proportion of students achieving over 60&#x000a0;min of moderate&#x02013;to-vigorous physical activity/day). For these primary outcomes, we stratified analysis by weight (underweight, normal BMI and overweight/obese) and fitness (fit and low fitness) groups. Mixed linear regression models were used to assess the intervention effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The prevalence of overweight/obesity, underweight and poor physical fitness was 20.3&#x000a0;%, 5.8&#x000a0;% and 84.8&#x000a0;% respectively. A higher intervention effect was observed for speed shuttle run in overweight (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;1.85&#x000a0;s, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04) adolescents compared to underweight (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;1.66&#x000a0;s, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.5) or normal weight (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.35&#x000a0;s, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.6) peers.

Overweight adolescents are on average 1.5 times more likely to develop type II diabetes, hypertension and an abnormal lipid profile during adulthood. Only recently, adolescents with low fitness levels are considered as a public health issue as their low fitness levels are significantly related with unhealthy cardiovascular performance, muscle mass losses, adipose tissue increase, decreased insulin response and sensitivity, and low bone mineral density in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>NCD prevention strategies such as school-based interventions, are particularly important since these are feasible and relatively inexpensive approaches that reach out to large populations with a wide range of BMIs or fitness abilities. School-based interventions involving both the individual and environmental components have shown small to moderate effects for the prevention of overweight and low-fitness in adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, little is known about the effect of these school-based interventions in groups of adolescents with a high health risk, like overweight/obese and low-fit adolescents. Current research on the topic is focused on the 6 to 12&#x000a0;year age group from high-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), the evidence on the effectiveness of school based interventions for the prevention of overweight and low-fitness is limited and specifically scarce regarding to its effect modification on high-risk groups such as overweight/obese and low-fit adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>In Cuenca-Ecuador a school-based intervention program &#x0201c;ACTIVITAL&#x0201d;, with a sample of adolescents (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1440), was carried out. The intervention was developed by using the Intervention mapping protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] together with a participatory approach (Comprehensive Participatory Planning and Evaluation approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In summary, the needs assessments include a qualitative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and quantitative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] research which identified the influencing factor (individual and environmental) for diet and physical activity behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In the sample targeted by quantitative research, 3 out of 5 adolescents had low fitness scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and the prevalence of overweight and obesity was 18&#x000a0;% and 2.1&#x000a0;%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This information was used to define the intervention objectives. The objectives were translated into intervention strategies using theories reported to be effective in other studies. The developed strategies were then adapted to the local context by using the local evidence and the participatory approach (participatory workshops with school staff and adolescents). This overall process resulted in a multicomponent (individual/environmental) intervention program aimed to (i) decrease sugar intake, (ii) increase daily fruit and vegetable intake, (iii) decrease unhealthy snack intake, (iv) increase healthy breakfast intake, (v) decrease daily screen time, and (vi) increase physical activity of adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In line with these objectives, diet, physical fitness, physical activity and screen-time were defined as primary outcomes, while anthropometric measurements (body mass indices, waist circumference) and blood pressure were secondary ones. After 28&#x000a0;months, the intervention showed an effect on three primary outcomes, diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], physical fitness and physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and on two secondary outcomes: blood pressure and waist circumference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>The present manuscript assessed if the adolescents in high-risk groups, specifically those overweight/obese and low-fit, responded differently to the intervention compared to their peers in lower risk groups in terms of physical fitness (speed shuttle run and vertical jump) and physical activity (the proportion of adolescents who met the recommended 60&#x000a0;min of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day).

Stata (version 12, Stata Corporation, Texas, USA) was used to select the pairs at random and randomly allocate the intervention or control within each pair. Two 8th grades and two 9th grades were randomly selected in each school. All adolescents in the classes were invited to participate but were excluded when they were pregnant, had a muscle or bone injury or had a concomitant disease. Supervisors and interviewers were trained to carry out the measurements. Interviewers were blinded to the allocation group of the intervention and adolescents were not informed about the existence of counterfactual schools.</p><p>Coordinators of ACTIVITAL recruited adolescents, parents and schools&#x02019; principals through separate meetings.

The other 11 chapters of the educational package focused on the promotion of a healthy diet.</p><p>The environmental strategy included three main activities: (i) Workshops for parents that were parallel to the classes with adolescents and covered similar topics (e.g. be active for at least 60&#x000a0;min per day, spend maximum 2&#x000a0;h per day on sedentary behavior and ways to overcome the barriers for physical activity). The parental workshop lasted one hour and consisted of a slide show presentation followed by a session of questions of parents. (ii) Organization of social events such an interactive pep talks with famous young sportsmen. During a one-hour session, an athlete shared her/his personal sport experiences and gave advice on healthy diet, active lifestyle and physical activity. One session per school was organized. (iii) Environmental modification that consistent of providing a walking trail in each school. Walking trails were drawn on the playground and three posters were suspended on the walls along the walking trails to encourage the adolescents to walk more during recess. Additionally, full color posters of young sportsmen, the ACTVITAL logo and key message regarding physical activity were suspended on the classroom walls and in the front of the food shops.

As a proxy of sedentary behavior, screen time was used. The latter was estimated using a validated questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] that assessed the time spend on television, video games and computer during a weekday (after school hours) and weekend day. Physical activity was measured using accelerometers (type GT-256 and GT1M, Actigraph Manufacturing Technology Incorporated, Fort Walton Beach FL, USA). A randomly selected subsample (acceptance rate 100&#x000a0;%) of adolescents (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;251 at baseline, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;134 after the intervention i.e. 47&#x000a0;% of missing data) wore an accelerometer during five weekdays. To reduce the data from accelerometer to minutes of physical activity the cut-points used were &#x02264;100 counts/min, 100&#x02013;759 counts/min and &#x02265;760 counts/min for sedentary, light and moderate to vigorous physical activity respectively. The proportion of adolescents who met the recommended 60&#x000a0;min of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] was calculated. The anthropometric measurements (secondary outcomes) included BMI and waist circumference, and were used to estimate changes in the anthropometric status.</p><p>As mentioned before, the present sub-group analysis considered two primary outcomes that showed a significant improvement among adolescents: physical fitness in terms of speed shuttle run and vertical jump, and physical activity in terms of the proportion of adolescents who met the recommended 60&#x000a0;min of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day.

FITNESSGRAM contains the minimum levels of aerobic capacity (in ml/kg/min units of VO2max) that provides a protection against health risks associated with inadequate fitness.

Adolescents with poor physical fitness showed a higher improvement of muscular strength (vertical jump) compared to fit adolescents, after the intervention program. Whilst, overweight adolescents had a significantly lower increase in the time needed for speed shuttle run test compared to normal-weight and underweight adolescents i.e. although there was an overall decline in speed fitness with the time, this decline was smaller in the overweight adolescents compared to the normal-weight and underweight adolescents. These potential health benefits among adolescents at health risk (low-fit, overweight) are independent of the differences between weight and fitness groups in terms of age, socio-economic status, BMI and proportion of females. The latter is supported by the fact that our analyses were adjusted for all interaction terms between covariates and intervention allocation.</p><p>The findings of our analysis show that the intervention could provide positive effects on health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] among low-fit adolescents as they showed larger improvements on muscular strength compared to fit ones. Muscular strength and cardiorespiratory fitness are independently associated with NCD risks factors and are important determinants of general health during adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>It has been reported that overweight adolescents have a lower performance on speed shuttle run than their normal peers, diminishing their self-efficacy, enjoyment for sport participation and physical exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Speed/agility is an independent predictor of bone mineral density in a young population and therefore, a persistent pattern of being slower and less agile through adolescence could compromise bone health at a later stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. We consider that the intervention effect reported in the present manuscript is encouraging for overweight/obese adolescents in terms of speed shuttle run with a possible positive effect on bone health. However, we acknowledge that the absence of an effect in the underweight group could be a result of its smaller sample size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] compared to the size of overweight and normal weight groups.</p><p>To our knowledge, only one Swiss study has examined simultaneously the intervention effect by weight category and fitness levels group among preschoolers. This study showed that low-fit and overweight preschoolers had a higher decrease in waist circumference and index of skin fold compared to fit and normal weight peers. In addition, the motor fitness improved more in overweight preschoolers compared to normal-weight ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Some studies have examined the variation of intervention effect only for fitness status or only for BMI status. As far as we know, only one study has analyzed the modification of intervention effect by fitness levels. This study reported the intervention effect on BMI, body fat and waist circumference by fitness levels in a population aged from 6 to 12&#x000a0;years. The latter study did not find that the intervention was more effective among low-fit subjects compared to fit ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. On other hand, the modification of intervention effect only by weight category has been evaluated in some studies, but only in a younger population than that of the present study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In most of those studies, the intervention effect on fitness (cardiorespiratory and muscle strength) was higher in the overweight group compared to normal weight group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Our intervention was developed using a participatory approach, i.e. participants were involved in the health research process in order to improve the quality of the research design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. We speculate that this approach has created an environment in which the participants feel more comfortable and willing to be part of the intervention activities. In addition, our intervention used simple and positive messages that responded to a latent need for fun activities that address healthy lifestyles, in particular in the group of overweight and low-fit adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This might have induced a higher response from these groups of adolescents that commonly face discriminatory attitudes and behavior at school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Interventions that use high intensity physical activity or fitness sessions might have led to poor adherence in overweight/obese or low-fit adolescents due to their limited ability to carry out many of these activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Another plausible explanation, for the observed intervention effect among adolescents at health risk, is the presence of a &#x0201c;flooring effect&#x0201d;. Given their poor performance on the fitness components, the group of overweight or low-fit adolescents might have had more room and could require less effort to improve the motor fitness or speed/agility fitness components compared to normal weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] or fit adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p>The results of the present manuscript suggest that future similar programs should consider the BMI or fitness status of adolescents if they expect to improve the speed&#x02014;agility or muscular strength component among adolescents. Whilst, similar approaches could have an effect of physical activity independently of the BMI or fitness status of the adolescents. Besides, while the ACTIVITAL program is potential benefit for adolescents at high risk in terms of physical fitness only, more research are needed in order to identify approaches able to improve also the physical activity and screen-time behavior among overweight or low-fit adolescents. Additionally, future studies should invest time on sub-groups analysis in order to identify possible benefits among groups at health. This will provide sufficient evidence to confirm our findings.</p><p>Our results are limited to the populations with similar characteristics to Ecuadorian adolescents i.e. mixed <italic>mestizo</italic> ethnicity, living in urban areas at high altitude, with an obesity/overweigh prevalence around 22&#x000a0;%, a high proportion (&#x0003e;90&#x000a0;%) of adolescents that met the physical activity recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and a high proportion (&#x0003e;60&#x000a0;%) of adolescents with low-fitness. However, the systematic process to develop the program could be generalized to adolescent populations with different prevalence of obesity/overweight/low-fit or with low proportion of adolescents that met the physical activity recommendations, since the approach used takes into account the needs and opinions of the participants to design the intervention. And therefore, the resulted intervention program might have an increased acceptability among the target groups.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Our study holds important strengths. First, our program uses a strong experimental design, with a sample size that is much larger than the average sample size (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;300 participants) of similar school based studies in LMICs. A second strength is the duration of our program, which is longer than most trials focusing on a similar topic. Third, we used objective and clinically relevant cut-points (FITNESSGRAM standards) to classify adolescents into the fit and low fitness groups. Some limitations must be addressed. First, we used the 20&#x000a0;m shuttle run as an indirect measurement of VO<sub>2</sub> max. We acknowledge that the estimation of VO<sub>2</sub> max from results of 20&#x000a0;m shuttle run can vary according to the equation used. Nevertheless, in this study we used an equation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] that has showed the highest agreement between the actual VO<sub>2</sub> max and the estimate VO<sub>2</sub> max from the 20&#x000a0;m shuttle run scores considering the age, gender and BMI of the subjects. Second, the dose received could not be assessed by the weight status or the fitness status of the adolescents, as the tools used to estimate the uptake only collected general information for the entire sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Third, physical activity was assessed only in a sub-sample. Finally, although our results are encouraging for school interventions in LMICs, our findings are modest and should be combined with other strategies to improve its effectiveness.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results suggest that comprehensive school-based interventions to improve diet and physical activity could be beneficial in low-fit and overweight/obese adolescents who are already at health risk. The overweight/obese and low-fit adolescents responded differently to the intervention program compared to their normal/underweight and fit peers for the speed component (speed-shuttle run) and muscle strength component (vertical jump test) of the EUROFIT test. Future school interventions should consider the effect of their interventions strategies on the high-risk groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Findings</title><p>This work was supported by grant from VLIR-UOS and Nutrition Third World and conducted within the cooperation between the University of Cuenca (Ecuador) and Ghent University (Belgium).</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec20"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12887_2016_588_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Table S1.</label><caption><p>Mean and range of fitness scores at baseline, by BMI<sup>a</sup> and fitness<sup>b</sup> status.
