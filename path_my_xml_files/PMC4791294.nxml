electromyographic (EMG) activities of the shoulder muscles and perceived exertion for the
shoulder area during floor mopping using a figure eight method. An experimental study with
13 cleaners was conducted using surface EMG and category ratio (CR-10) scale. EMG activity
was recorded unilaterally from the upper trapezius, infraspinatus, anterior and middle
deltoid muscles. Each subject performed four trials of mopping and each trial consisted of
using a different mop handle height (mop adjustment at the level of shoulder, chin, nose
and eye) in randomized order. EMG data were normalized to a percentage of maximal
voluntary contraction (%MVC). The muscle activities were assessed by estimating the 10th,
50th and 90th percentiles of the amplitude probability distribution function (APDF) of the
EMG signals and analysed by linear mixed model analysis. Results showed that shoulder
muscle activity was significantly lower when the mop handle height was adjusted to
shoulder level or chin level as compared to eye level. These &#x0fb01;ndings were supported by
subjective ratings of exertion. It seems that mop handle height adjustment between
shoulder and chin level may be recommended as a basis for figure eight mopping.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Muscle activity</kwd><kwd>Electromyography</kwd><kwd>Perceived exertion</kwd><kwd>Floor mopping</kwd><kwd>Cleaner</kwd><kwd>Shoulder</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Professional cleaning is important work that is carried out worldwide. In recent decades,
the technology of cleaning tools, equipment and machines has developed<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nevertheless, the majority of cleaning work is still conducted
manually<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cleaning is physically
demanding work with a high frequency of awkward working postures<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, repetitive movements<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, static muscular load<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> and lack of muscle rest<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, cleaners have a high risk of developing
musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs)<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, such as neck and shoulder symptoms<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, preventive actions are needed to reduce overloading of shoulder muscles and to
prevent work-related upper extremity disorders (WRUEDs).</p><p>Floor mopping takes up 35&#x02013;40% of the working time in most cleaning jobs<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> and it has received much attention in the
literature as a physically demanding cleaning task<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Mopping is characterised by
high static shoulder muscle load<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, repetitive movements of the upper
extremities<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> and awkward postures of neck, shoulder and back<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Surface electromyography (EMG) has been widely used to
assess the muscle activity associated with different floor cleaning methods and
techniques<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been shown that wet mopping causes higher muscular and
cardiorespiratory loading than dry mopping<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Earlier studies using EMG<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> have found that during mopping the static
load on the upper trapezius muscle exceeds the level of 2&#x02212;5% maximal voluntary contraction
(MVC) suggested as a threshold limit value for long-term work<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, the trapezius muscle on the upper position arm (i.e.,
the hand placed higher on the mop handle) has a higher activity level than the lower
position arm<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, regardless of the dampness
of the mop and mopping direction (i.e., backward or forward)<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Previous research has indicated that the figure eight mopping method (i.e., moving the mop
in an arc) is more strenuous than the &#x02018;push&#x02019; method<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The median muscular load on the trapezius and perceived exertion
were higher with the figure eight method compared to the &#x02018;push&#x02019; method. Moreover, the figure
eight method involves highly repetitive movements of the arms, with a cycle time of
approximately 2&#x02005;s, and large shoulder abduction movements particularly in the upper position
arm<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. It seems that regardless of the
method or technique used during mopping, the shoulder muscle load is high for the hand
placed higher on the mop handle<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. High force requirements, repetitive
movements and working with the hand above shoulder level are widely recognized as
work-related physical risk factors for MSDs of the shoulder<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Physical risk factors of floor mopping systems have been identified. Inadequacies in the
design of mops have been highlighted and design modifications have also been suggested<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. One essential issue of concern for users
has been found to be an unsuitable mop height<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Finnish survey (n=48) has found that 35%
of cleaners hold the mop at shoulder level, 33% at chin level and 21% at nose level<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has also been reported that for female
cleaners the top of the mop was situated between standing eye and shoulder height<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. A long-handled mop has been considered too
long for shorter cleaners<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. On the other
hand, a longer mop handle allows cleaners to maintain a more upright posture when
mopping<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In practise, telescopic mop
handles are commonly used, but it seems that advice on the optimal mop handle height differs
among cleaning managers, supervisors and occupational health services. The benefits of
modern mop handles could be lost, if cleaners do not know how to use a mop safely. Only a
limited number of studies have evaluated the effect of adjustment of mop handle on shoulder
muscle load. A study of &#x000d6;hrling <italic>et al.</italic><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> found that in staircase mopping the shoulder muscular activity and
perceived exertion were lower when an easily adjustable mop handle was used, compared to a
non-adjustable mop. However, it is uncertain whether the high shoulder muscle load during
mopping with a figure eight method is partly due to the use of a too-long mop handle. Thus,
information about the muscular activity related to mop handle height is needed.</p><p>The aim of this study was to examine the effects of mop handle height on shoulder muscle
activity of the upper position arm and perceived exertion during floor mopping with a figure
eight method. EMG activities were measured from four shoulder muscles during mopping with
four different heights of the mop handle. It was hypothesized that shoulder muscle
activities and perceptions of exertion would differ among different heights of the mop
handle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects|methods" id="s2"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>A total of 13 volunteer professional cleaners (12 females and 1 male) participated in
this study. The inclusion criteria were a minimum six months&#x02019; working experience as a
cleaner and floor mopping as a part of cleaner&#x02019;s daily routine. Exclusion criteria
included a disorder in shoulder region at the time of the experiment. The study procedures
were approved by the Committee on Research Ethics of the North Savo Hospital District. The
study was conducted in conformity with the Declaration of Helsinki. Each subject signed an
informed consent form.</p></sec><sec><title>Instrumentation</title><p>An aluminium telescopic mop handle and a 60&#x02005;cm wide mop frame with unlocked swivel
mechanism were used in this experiment. The handle could be extended to a length anywhere
between 100 and 170&#x02005;cm. The shaft of the mop handle was 2.6&#x02005;cm in diameter. The handle
grip was composed of ribbed plastic, 13.5&#x02005;cm in length and 3.2&#x02005;cm in diameter. The mop
weighed 850&#x02005;g and the dry microfiber mop (cloth) weighed approximately 120&#x02005;g. The friction
between the floor and the tool depends on the dampness of the mop and impacts on physical
load<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. For this reason, standardized
dampness was controlled by dampening the microfiber mop with 60 ml of water.</p></sec><sec><title>Electromyographic measurements</title><p>Surface electromyographic activity was recorded unilaterally from the upper trapezius
(UT), infraspinatus (IP), middle (MD) and anterior of the deltoid (AD) muscles, from the
side that the subject preferred to use higher on the mop handle. These muscles were chosen
for their relevance to shoulder function during floor-mopping<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Further, the selection of the UT muscle was also based on earlier
studies, which reported that the trapezius load might be a predictor of disorders in the
neck and shoulder region<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Surface electrodes were applied over the muscle bellies so that they ran parallel to the
muscle fibers, and reference electrodes were placed on an electrically inactive area, in
accordance with SENIAM guidelines<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Prior to electrode placement, the skin was shaved (if required) and rubbed with alcohol
over the appropriate areas in order to reduce impedance levels. A skin impedance of less
than 10 K&#x003a9; measured using an ohm meter (Fluke 183, True RMS multimeter), was considered
acceptable. EMG signals were obtained bipolarly using disposable Ag/AgCl-surface
electrodes (Ambu Neuroline 720, Denmark), a gel area diameter of 10&#x02005;mm and an
inter-electrode distance of 20&#x02005;mm. The electrode placement guidelines of McLean <italic>et

standardized verbal encouragement was given to the subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental protocol</title><p>The experiment included three phases. At the beginning, the subjects filled in a
questionnaire; including questions about individual characteristics (e.g. age, dominant
hand), experience in cleaning work, and subjectively perceived symptoms and pain in their
shoulder region. The intensity of perceived pain was assessed by means of a Numeral Rating
Scale (NRS-11)<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. Anthropometric
measurements consisted of body weight, height and Body Mass Index (kg/m<sup>2</sup>).
Anthropometric dimensions of the upper limbs were also assessed<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. Subjects were guided in the use of Borg&#x02019;s category
ratio scale (CR-10 scale)<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>, which is
an acceptable approach to quantifying muscle force and fatigue<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the second phase of the experiment, subjects
practiced each MVC test and after the actual MVC test recordings there was a rest period
of 5&#x02005;min before beginning the mopping trials.</p><p>In the third phase of the experiment, the subjects mopped the floor surface of a 20&#x02005;m
long and 1.79&#x02005;m wide corridor back and forth once. Subjects walked forward while they
moved the mop from side to side in a figure eight pattern. The subjects were encouraged to
use their habitual style and normal working rhythm, and they were allowed to practice
before the first trial. Each subject performed four trials of mopping and each trial
consisted of using a different mop handle height (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.

practical adjustments. Breaks of 5&#x02005;min were given between the trials to prevent the
cumulative effect of local muscle fatigue. At the end of each trial, the subjects were
asked to verbally rate their level of perceived exertion for shoulder area using CR-10

open-ended questions, including the subjective preference for the four heights of the
mop.</p></sec><sec><title>EMG data processing and analysis</title><p>At first, the EMG signals were band-pass filtered (5th order Butterworth, 20&#x02013;400&#x02005;Hz
pass-band), and the few high-amplitude artefacts were removed using spline interpolation.
Root mean square (RMS) amplitudes were calculated using a window length of 250&#x02005;ms.</p><p>The RMS amplitudes of the mopping trials were normalized according to isometric MVC tests
such that 100%MVC value corresponds to the highest value obtained during the three MVC
tests, individually for each muscle and each subject.</p><p>Next, the amplitude probability distribution function (APDF) for RMS amplitudes was
assessed for each time period when the actual mopping of 20&#x02005;m long corridor took place.
The 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles of the APDF, expressed as %MVC, for the four muscles
(UT, MD, AD, IP) were calculated for each subject and for each mopping trial. These
percentiles are denoted by APDF10, APDF50 and APDF90 and represent static, median and peak
activity levels<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, respectively. All
signal processing and analysis was performed using the MATLAB R2014a (The MathWorks Inc.,
Natick, MA, USA) environment.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago IL, USA).
Descriptive statistics (median, mean, standard deviation, range, quartiles) were
calculated. The APDF parameters were logarithmically transformed due to the skewness of
the distribution. After logarithmic transformation, the normality was tested using the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov -test. The linear mixed model was used for statistical analysis to
examine the differences in the shoulder muscle activities among different mop handle
heights. The Sidak method was performed for multiple comparison. Each logarithmically
transformed EMG parameter (APDF10, APDF50 and APDF90) was used as a dependent variable and
analysed separately. The mop handle heights (i.e., shoulder, chin, nose and eye level) and
muscles (i.e., UT, IP, MD, AD) were used as fixed factors in all analyses. The
distribution of residuals was controlled in the analyses. Furthermore, the non-parametric
Friedman&#x02019;s test was used to examine the differences in perceived exertion among different

difference between the IP and UT muscles. The MD muscle had the lowest activity level in
each EMG parameter.</p></sec><sec><title>Subjective assessment</title><p>The perceived exertion (CR-10) ratings of the floor mopping ranged from 0.5 (&#x02018;extremely
weak&#x02019;) to 5 (&#x02018;heavy&#x02019;). Subjects rated mopping exertion as &#x02018;very weak&#x02019; (median 1) for the
shoulder area when the mop handle height was adjusted to chin level. Mopping was
considered &#x02018;weak&#x02019; (median 2) at shoulder level and &#x02018;moderate&#x02019; (median 3) both at nose
level and eye level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Minimum, maximum, median and quartiles of perceived exertion during mopping with

chin level compared to nose level (<italic>p</italic>=0.011). Similarly, less strain was
found when the mop was adjusted to chin level compared to eye level
(<italic>p</italic>=0.005). With regard to subjective preference for mop height, the chin
level was most preferred by 10 out of 13 subjects. Common reasons given were comfort and
less strain on upper arm.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study of 13 cleaners investigated the effects of four different mop handle heights on
shoulder muscle (i.e., UT, IP, MD, AD) activity and perceived exertion of shoulder area
during a standardized floor mopping task. Results of this study supported the hypothesis
that there were differences in shoulder muscle activities and perception of exertion among
different mop handle heights.</p><p>Our study showed that shoulder muscle activation levels were similar when the mop handle is
adjusted to the shoulder and chin level. As the height of the mop handle increased, a trend
of increasing EMG activities was observed, and muscle activation levels were highest when
the mop handle was adjusted to eye level. These results might be due to some extent to
increased shoulder flexion movement, because it has been demonstrated that the activity of
DA, IP and UT muscles steadily rises as the degree of forward flexion increases, whereas the
MD muscle is not very active in this movement<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. Similarly, shoulder and scapular muscle activities have been shown
to increase during tasks that require large shoulder and scapular movements<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup>
or shoulder stability<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup>. Mopping also
requires large shoulder movements<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> and a large amount of stabilization in the
shoulder<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, the deltoid and
scapular muscles may be more active in order to maintain the position of the arm and scapula
with rising abduction levels during continuous movements<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. One can postulate that this may also explain our results showing
increased muscle activities at greater mop handle heights. However, MD muscle activity
levels were low regardless of the height of the mop. This finding was surprising since the
arms are constantly abducted during mopping<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.
One potential explanation for the low activity level of the MD muscle in this study may be
the lower abduction angles of the shoulder, because the MD muscle is not an effective
abductor until at higher angles<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. It
seemed that less favourable wrist postures did compensate for wide abduction movements of
the shoulders. However, postural analysis was not used in the present study. Therefore,
future studies should analyse synchronously obtained EMG and motion data of the upper limbs
with different mop handle heights.</p><p>Our study examined short-term effects of mopping. Consequently, we cannot explain factors
associated with long-term changes in shoulder muscles. However, it seems that median and
peak activity levels in this study were lower in comparison with Jonsson&#x02019;s limit values<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been suggested that the static
load level for continuous work for one hour or more should not exceed 2% MVC and must not
exceed 5% MVC<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, the
static level for the shoulder muscles would be considered high if mopping was performed for
prolonged periods of time. The mean muscle activity of the UT, IP and AD exceeded the lower
limit (2%) for static load, in particular when the mop was adjusted to eye level. Muscle
activities were significantly lower for mop adjustments at shoulder and chin level. On that
account, it is recommended to use a lower adjustment of the mop. Moreover, the reduction in
the mean muscle activity was greatest for the UT muscle when mop handle height was changed
from eye level to shoulder level. The results of previous studies supported a causal
relationship between prolonged static loads and high level of static contractions and
neck-shoulder pain<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, high
static load of the trapezius muscle is associated with neck-shoulder disorders and it has
been shown that even a static level below 1% MVC may be harmful<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, reducing the activity of the UT muscle may be
one means of preventing MSDs in the neck-shoulder area.</p><p>In this study, the 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles of UT muscle activities seemed to be
markedly lower than previously reported<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, direct comparisons with other
research results must be conducted with caution due to methodological differences. EMG
results may differ due to electrode placement and MVC procedures. One potential explanation
for the lower muscle activity levels in the present study may be lighter mop materials and
the amount of water used in the mop<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Majority of cleaners (85%) in this study had received ergonomic training, which may somewhat
explain the lower muscle activities. In addition, these differences may be explained by the
various mopping environments and tasks. Moreover, the inter-individual variations in EMG
activity levels seemed to be high even if the mopping task was similar. Individual
differences in mopping style were observed, which accounts for part of the total variation.
Methodological factors may explain some of the variation<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, in this study each cleaner served as their own control so
the effect of individual differences on results is probably minor.</p><p>A strength of this study is the utilization of both subjective and objective measurements.
The use of self-reported measures of exertion of the shoulder area increases the
understanding of the effect of physical workload on the musculoskeletal system. Prior
research has demonstrated a positive correlation (r=0.99) between ratings with CR-10 scale
and objective measure of exerted force (RMS values)<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. As our results indicate, lower mop handle heights led to decreased
shoulder muscle activation. Cleaners also rated lower mop handle heights, the chin level
adjustment in particular, as less strenuous for their shoulder area. These lower ratings of
exertion can probably be explained by the fact that the postures were more convenient,
because cleaners were able to work with their arms at a lower level without elevating their
shoulders. Similarly, with regard to staircase cleaning the favourable impact of adjustment
of the mop on perceived effort and muscular load has previously been reported<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study has some limitations. First, the sample size was small to be able to generalize
the results to the entire population of cleaners, but it was similar to that of previous
studies<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><sup>)</sup>. Second, the same mop cloth was used
in all four trials, because the weight of available dry mop cloths was not precisely
identical. Therefore the dampness of the mop cloth may have been somewhat different in each
trial, because the moistening (60 ml of water) was performed before the first trial. The
weight of the mop cloth had decreased an average of 9.5&#x02005;g over the course of the experiment.
Thus, the impact on muscle demand of the loss of mop cloth weight due to moisture reduction
was probably minor. Moreover, the order of the mop heights was randomized to eliminate
systematic bias. Third, this study did not evaluate muscle activities in diverse mopping
environments. It is known that buildings and work areas are not designed and furnished to be
easy to clean<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, the mop handle height should be tailored not only to the
individual, but also to the task in question. Despite these limitations, this study revealed
that muscle activity levels were affected by the change in height of the mop handle.
Information obtained in this study can be used as a basis for the selection of appropriate
mop handle height. Hence, further study is suggested in order to record the EMG and postures
bilaterally (i.e., both arms) for longer durations in more challenging environments.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that height of the mop handle had an impact
on the activation level of the shoulder muscles and perceived exertion of the shoulder area.
Increased mop handle height was associated with higher muscle activity levels. These
findings were supported by subjective perceptions of exertion. Therefore, in order to reduce
muscle demand, a mop height adjustment between chin and shoulder level may be recommended as
a basis for floor mopping with a figure eight method. The results of this study may be
useful for cleaners in assisting them to optimize the use of the mop and reduce risks of
WRUEDs resulting from overuse of the shoulder muscles. Further, these results could be used
in occupational health care, as well as by cleaning supervisors and managers responsible for
ergonomic guidance (e.g. work orientation sessions for new employees). In addition, the
results might benefit cleaners who should avoid unnecessary load on account of shoulder
impairments.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>S.M.R. and P.A.K. were supported by the Academy of Finland (project no. 252748). T.B. and
