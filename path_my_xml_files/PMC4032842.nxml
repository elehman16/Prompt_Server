The motor disorders of CP are often accompanied by disturbances of sensation, cognition, communication, perception, and/or behavior, and/or by a seizure disorder.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Incidence of CP ranges from 1.5 to 3 cases per 1000 live births.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The incidence is higher in males than in females; the Surveillance of Cerebral Palsy in Europe (SCPE) reports male to female ratio of 1.33:1.00.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The United Cerebral Palsy Foundation states that there are 800,000 children and adults in the United States with CP. The Centers for Disease Control estimates that about 10,000 babies are born each year with CP.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Despite the non-progressive character of CP, some children deteriorate in mobility-related activities during childhood.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Spasticity is a disabling clinical symptom that is prevalent in those with CP.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The primary problems associated with spasticity are loss of balance, strength, and selective motor control of the muscles, and increased muscle tone which leads to problems such as fixed contractures and bony deformities that cause severe motor dysfunctionin patients.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Perinatal asphyxia accounts for between 6% and 8% of CP. Prenatal causes are responsible for approximately 75% of all CP cases, although it is impossible to determine the nature and the exact timing of the damage. Postnatal acquired CP ranges in incidence from 10% to 18%.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Management of CP focuses on helping the individual to maximize his or her potential by providing physical therapy to facilitate motor development and to enhance independence in motor skills, self-care, play, and leisure activities.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Current interventions for CP include: Physical therapy to prevent the weakening or deterioration of muscles and for motor development; braces or orthotic devices to stretch spastic muscles, which can disrupt balance and normal motor development; occupational therapy to help develop daily living skills, such as feeding, dressing, or using the bathroom; speech therapy to help develop communication and language skills; behavioral therapy to promote socially appropriate behaviors; and surgery to treat severe cases of contractures of muscles that cause movement problems or placing a feeding tube in severe cases of swallowing problems and malnutrition.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>CP cannot be correlated with any single disease or condition mentioned in Ayurveda, as it is a multifactorial disease. However, considering the classification and the respective features of the types, CP may be stated as <italic>Janma Bala Pravritta Vyadhi</italic> (congenital disorder). In some cases, it may also be due to the derangement of <italic>Doshas</italic> (bodily humors). Consequently, CP may also be considered as <italic>Shiro Marmabhighata Vata Vyadhi</italic> (diseases caused due to injury to head), as <italic>Marmaghata</italic> (injury to vital organs) is one of the causes of <italic>Vata Vikara</italic> (disease of <italic>Vata</italic>, i.e. body humor). Ayurvedic classics have mentioned that derangement of bodily humors and/or injury to vital organs during formative stage, fetal life, delivery, and neonatal period produces symptoms like loss of activities, stammering, dumbness, and weakness, including mental derangement due to impairment of motor and sensory activities. The therapeutic management is done according to <italic>Vata Vikara</italic> (disease of <italic>Vata</italic>, i.e. body humor) where the main line of treatment is considered to be application of medicated enema and internal administration of drugs.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Incidence of CP has not declined despite the medical advances made in neonatal management and obstetric care. On the contrary, with a decline in infant mortality rate, there has actually been an increase in the incidence and severity of CP.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Defining the goals of CP treatment is one of the main issues in its management. These goals, which should be individualized for each patient, are to reduce the muscle tone, increase the range of motion of the joints, improve the function of upper and lower extremities, delay the need for surgery, and predict surgical results.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The few available treatments to reduce generalized spasticity are associated with a high incidence of adverse effects and complications. There is an urgent need for studies to establish the efficacy of the current therapies and to find additional safe and effective treatments to help children affected by generalized spasticity due to CP. None of the oral medications used to treat spasticity in children has been adequately tested for safety and efficacy. There are minimal or no data regarding the pharmacokinetics or appropriate dosing parameters to treat children.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] These critical questions deserve serious research efforts. Currently there is no curefor CP.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Few answers can be found in various indigenous systems of medicines being used globally. Indian Systems of Medicine, including Ayurveda, Unani, and Siddha, have been in use since time immemorial and are time tested. The present study was conducted with a goal to improve physical activity, capacity of mobility, social participation, and health-related quality of life in children with CP by means of Ayurvedic intervention using a combination of massage therapy, fomentation, and Ayurvedic drug administration through enema and oral route, i.e. <italic>Rajayapana Basti</italic> and <italic>Baladi Yoga</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Design</title><p>This study had a double-arm pre-test and post-test design.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Participants</title><p>Patients presenting with CP were enrolledfrom Kaumarabhritya (Ayurvedic Pediatrics) out-patient department and in-patient department of SDM College of Ayurveda and Hospital, Hassan, irrespective of their sex, caste, religion, etc., Institutional ethical committee approved the protocol and written informed consent was obtained from the parents before any study-related procedures were performed.

Out of 123 participants, 100 completed the study and 23 participants discontinued and could not be followed up. Thus, 60 participants in the study group and 40 participants in the control group were followed up in this study.

It was noted that 31% of subjects belonged to joint family. In this series, an interesting fact came up, which was that 36% parents of the patients gave the history of consanguinity and 24% mothers have had early marriage and conception before the age of 18 years.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Age wise distribution of study subjects (<italic>N</italic>=100)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JTCM-4-49-g003"/></table-wrap><p>The pre-conception status of the mothers showed on enquiry that 8% mothers of the patients had the history of spontaneous abortion, 2% mothers had undergone D and C operations, 2% used intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCD), and 33% mothers had the history of using oral contraceptives. Accordingly, it was found that 45% mothers suffered from one or the other disease; of these, 18% mothers had anemia, 12% had pre-eclampsia, and 9% had pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH). However, 55% mothers remained healthy. Antenatal check-up (ANC) reports showed that mothers of 52% children did not follow the ANC advices properly, while 36% properly followed them. On the other hand, the mothers of remaining 12% children did not attend ANC. Thirteen percent mothers delivered by Lower Uterine Cesarean Section and 6% delivered by instrumental application.

While in the placebo control group, Basti was administered maintaining all the procedures, except that in the place of <italic>Mustadi Rajayapana Basti</italic>, only saline water was applied. In place of <italic>Baladi Yoga</italic>, <italic>Godhuma Vati</italic> (wheat powder) was administered as placebo. These findings reveal that the beneficial effects observed were due to the medication also and not only due to the Basti (enema) procedure. The attendance of reasonable number of CP patients may be because 36% parents gave a history of consanguinity while 45% of the mothers were having some kind of complications before child birth. Early child birth was noticeable in 24% mothers. Studies worldwide have revealed that risk factors like pre-existing diseases in mothers during delivery, birth asphyxia, gestational age, and low birth weight are associated with CP in children.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] CP is a <italic>Vata Vyadhi</italic>; therefore, the therapies having <italic>Brimhana</italic> (stoutening therapy) and <italic>Balya</italic> (strengthening) properties were selected for this thereby resulting in more circulation. Also, the venous and lymphatic return is assisted, increasing the strength (or immunity) of the body. It relieves pain in the joints, reduces emaciation of the study. <italic>Abhyanga</italic> and <italic>Shastikashali Pinda Sveda</italic> soothe the sensory nerve endings, thereby causing relaxation. They produce a hyperemic effect causing the arterioles to dilate, limbs, and make the body strong with well-developed musculature. <italic>Abhyanga</italic> causes movements of the muscles, thereby accelerating the blood supply, which in turn helps in relieving the muscular fatigue and reduces stiffness. <italic>Mustadi Rajayapana Basti</italic> and <italic>Baladi Yoga</italic> have <italic>Rasayana</italic> (rejuvenator) effect in the body, as <italic>Charaka</italic> had stated: <italic>Rasayana</italic> (rejuvenation therapy) <italic>Indriya Balam Param</italic> (increases the strength of sensory and motor organs), <italic>Visham Avisham Bhavati Gatre</italic> (removes toxins from the body parts), <italic>Medha Smriti Karam</italic> (promotes intellect and memory).[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In this study, the role of Ayurvedic management has shown some hope for improving the quality of life among CP patients.</p><p>A study from USA showed that the massage therapy reduced spasticity and arm hypertonic muscle tone and improved fine and gross motor functioning in children with CP. Improved immune function has been reported in one massage study,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] showing increased number and activity of natural killer cells, which have the potential to destroy viral cells.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Massage therapy has been shown to decrease stress hormone (cortisol) levels.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Several studies have reported that massage leads to enhanced alertness, as shownby increased cognitive scores in preschool children.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] A study from Norway showed improvement in basic motor abilities and self-care and mobility in young children with CP after they were given goal-directed activity focused physiotherapy involving their local environment.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Treatment with botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) has been a well-established option in the interdisciplinary management of spasticity since the late 1980s, providing focal reductions in muscle tone in CP patients. A study from Turkey highlighted that single multilevel BTX-A injection reduces spasticity and improves motor function in children with CP.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Studies showed that for generalized spasticity, diazepam is probably effective in reducing spasticity, but there are insufficient data on its effect on motor function and its side-effect profile. Tizanidine is possibly effective, but there are insufficient data on its effect on motor function and its side-effect profile. There are insufficient data on the use of dantrolene, oral baclofen, and intrathecal baclofen, and toxicity has been frequently reported.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] A survey in the USA showed 56% of the families of children with CP using Complementary and Alternative Medicine which included massage therapy and aqua therapy as the most common.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Recent years have also seen the development of multiple intensive therapy or educationally based programs which provide some benefits due to their strong focus on activity and independence, but also raise some concerns. These include the fact that they have failed to demonstrate superior effectiveness over other approaches. Despite their significantly greater time intensity, they fail to identify the &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; ingredients, making it unclear to determine which aspects of the programs are effective and which are not.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>Cure for CP is not yet available.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Throughout the lifespan of patients, the motor disability persists and interacts with normal developmental processes, altering its presentations and complications. The present mode of care in CP includes regular physical therapy, followed by medical and surgical interventions if needed, mostly in early childhood through pre-adolescence. A long list of treatments has shown to improve motor outcomes, but very few definite practical guidelines exist for the management of CP due to limited scientific evidence to support holistic intervention approaches. Consequently, approach toward CP patients varies among clinicians, health care settings, and geographic areas with regard to the different types and modes of treatments prescribed, the timing and the range of treatment intensity, or frequency of interventions. Since CP is a not a single disease entity with a known causal pathway, but in fact a heterogeneous group of disorders with etiological differences, brain injury patterns, and associated health complications, the choice and response to intervention is further complicated. Documentations reveal that the developmental patterns of children with CP are very slow, especially in physical and cognitive disability. So, it is better to expect immediate short-term effects of intervention rather than long-term effects in reality. Instrument sensitivity to detect small changes in motor ability is another setback while studying the effects of treatment of motor problems resulting from CP. Even minor improvements have the potential of becoming major practical and psychological significance for children with CP and their families.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] When Ayurvedic therapeutic principles were applied to CP patients, the patients showed signs of improvement, but in a very slow manner. Traditional Ayurvedic procedures have been used effectively since ages and were implemented for treating diseases related to congenital anomalies. However, knowledge-based evidences need to be validated in a scientific way.</p><p>The increasing trend of Complementary and Alternative Medicine is reflective of the high interest in new and different therapies that has always been present among families of children with CP. The observations of this study are encouraging with rays of hope bestowed upon by the age-old system of medicine of Ayurveda for the crippled children to have meaningful and improved quality of life. It is hoped that it will stimulate the research workers in the field to take up more such studies, so that new horizon may open up for children suffering from CP who are otherwise leading a long miserable life for no fault of their own. Further clinical trials must be carried out to evaluate and validate the maximum effect of <italic>Rajayapana Basti</italic> and <italic>Baladi Yoga</italic> combination, used in the present study, on a large sample with repetition of the courses for longer duration. Also, there is a need to find if by starting treatment in the early stage, i.e. immediately after cerebral injury and diagnosis, one can expect better improvement. Ayurveda with its immense treasure can deliver different modalities of treatment regarding CP. So, we have to explore these areas keeping in mind that a multi-dimensional approach with evidence-based personalized medicine will lead the road toward
