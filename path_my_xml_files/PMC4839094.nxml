Measures of HRQL are patient-reported and can be generic or disease-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Disease-specific measures may be more sensitive to some of the symptoms experienced by patients but generic measures permit uniform comparisons across medical conditions and as such are necessary to aid decision making in evaluating the value of new treatments. As the landscape of therapies for cystic fibrosis (CF) expands, it is important to characterize the relationship between clinical and physiologic measures of disease and generic measures of HRQL.</p><p>Cystic fibrosis is an inherited, rare autosomal recessive disease that results in chronically debilitating morbidities and high premature mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. CF disease affects multiple organs in the body including the lung, pancreas, intestinal and biliary tracts, sweat glands and the reproductive system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Patients with CF typically experience progressive loss of lung function ultimately resulting in respiratory failure and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A key characteristic affecting CF disease trajectory is the occurrence of pulmonary exacerbations (PEs), which require acute medical care and often hospitalization. Avoiding PEs is a foremost goal of CF treatment since exacerbation frequency is associated with lung function decline, greater likelihood of subsequent exacerbations and increased mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Pulmonary exacerbations, particularly those that are severe, have been reported to impact HRQL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Lung function as measured by forced expiratory volume (FEV<sub>1</sub>) is an outcome measure in clinical studies of CF therapies and has been shown to be related to patient&#x02019;s survival and HRQL in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Research to date has reported mixed degrees of associations between several CF physiologic and clinical measures such as FEV<sub>1</sub> and PEs, and generic and disease-specific HRQL measures (e.g. Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised [CFQ-R] scores) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] of CF symptoms and HRQL. Previous studies of patients with CF have reported utilities derived using time tradeoff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and standard gamble [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] direct elicitation methods, and generic indirect measures including the health utilities index (HUI2 and HUI3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and the EuroQol EQ-5D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] with varying results. Within CF there has been evidence of potential ceiling effects of generic measures such as the EQ-5D and insensitivity particularly to FEV<sub>1</sub>. While some of these studies have independently assessed the impact of lung function and PEs on generic measures of HRQL in CF, no studies to date have analyzed both of these key disease elements within the same model. In order to better assess this, the aim of this analysis is to examine the impact of PEs and lung function on generic HRQL as assessed by the EQ-5D-3&#x000a0;L questionnaire in patients aged 12&#x000a0;years and older with CF and a <italic>G551D</italic> mutation on at least 1 <italic>CFTR</italic> allele using data from the STRIVE clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Data source</title><p>This analysis used data from a 48-week, Phase 3, international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (STRIVE) which was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ivacaftor in patients aged 12&#x000a0;years and older with CF who had a <italic>G551D</italic> mutation on at least 1 <italic>CFTR</italic> allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Patients were included if they had an FEV<sub>1</sub> of 40 to 90&#x000a0;% (inclusive) of the predicted normal value for age-, gender-, and height-matched persons at screening (ppFEV<sub>1</sub>). As reported in Ramsey et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], &#x0201c;subjects were excluded if they had other illnesses that confounded the study results; ongoing illness; a pulmonary exacerbation or changes in therapy (including antibiotics) for pulmonary disease within 4&#x000a0;weeks before first dose of study drug; abnormal liver function tests, defined as 3 or more LFT parameters &#x0003e;3 times the upper limit of normal; or abnormal renal function tests. Subjects were also excluded if they had a history of prolonged QT/QTc interval; history of solid organ or hematological transplantation; colonization with organisms associated with a more rapid decline in pulmonary status (e.g., <italic>B. cenocepacia, B. dolosa</italic>, and <italic>M. abcessus</italic>); concomitant use of any inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4; or use of inhaled hypertonic saline treatment. Subjects were required to stop inhaled hypertonic saline treatment for at least 4&#x000a0;weeks prior to Day 1 (first dose of study drug)&#x0201d;.

The descriptive profile includes five single-item dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), each with 3 levels of response (no problems, some problems, and extreme problems) that can be combined into a single score (index) which summarizes health status (i.e., utility) and is anchored at 0 (=death) and 1 (=perfect health). The index is calculated by an algorithm using patients&#x02019; responses to the EQ-5D descriptive profile and preference weights for different health states ascertained from the general population of a country (herein, using values for the United Kingdom [UK]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>The EQ-5D VAS records the respondent&#x02019;s self-rated health on a 20&#x000a0;cm vertical VAS with endpoints labeled &#x0201c;the best health you can imagine&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;the worst health you can imagine.&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

In post-hoc analyses of data from a clinical study of patients with CF (&#x02265;12&#x000a0;years of age and a <italic>G551D-</italic>CFTR mutation), PEs, primarily those requiring hospitalization, were associated with lower HRQL as measured by the EQ-5D index. Mean EQ-5D index was lowest (worst) within one week (before or after PE start) for PEs requiring hospitalization. Similar findings were observed for ratings of health status as measured by VAS scores for all PEs regardless of whether they required hospitalization. Lung function as measured by ppFEV<sub>1</sub> was also on average lowest (worst) within the one-week period before or after the study defined PE start date regardless of whether PEs required hospitalization or not. In multivariate analyses, experience of any PEs, PEs requiring hospitalization and low ppFEV<sub>1</sub> were identified as independent negative predictors of EQ-5D index and VAS scores.</p><p>Our study findings are consistent with those reported by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A prior meta-analysis has identified PEs and ppFEV<sub>1</sub> as predictors of disease-specific HRQL and symptoms as measured by Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In cross-sectional analyses of data from pediatric and adult patients with CF treated in a US Midwestern CF center, PEs were reported to have a profound negative impact on physical and psychosocial HRQL using the generic Short-Form (SF)-36 and the Child Health Questionnaire; the impact of ppFEV<sub>1</sub> was reported to be relatively small compared to the impact of PEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In another study conducted in five UK CF centers, adolescent patients with CF and chronic <italic>Pseudomona aeruginosa</italic> infection who experienced PEs that required hospitalization reported poorer HRQL using the EQ-5D index as well as worse VAS scores compared to those with chronic infection and milder PEs (i.e., not requiring hospitalization) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>In our analyses, ceiling effects were high, particularly for the EQ-5D index and in patients with no lung dysfunction or mild lung dysfunction as well as among those with less severe disease (i.e., patients who did not experience PEs). Mixed results have been reported by others regarding the association between physiologic measures of pulmonary disease and CF, particularly ppFEV<sub>1</sub>, nutritional indices and HRQL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Patients with the most severe disease as measured by pulmonary function measures and weight for height have been reported to rate their CF as &#x0201c;above/well above average&#x0201d; compared to other patients with CF whereas physician&#x02019;s ratings of disease severity were positively correlated with clinical findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Yi et al.&#x02019;s study of adolescents with CF that employed preference elicitation methods (e.g., time tradeoff, standard gamble) found that HRQL was poorly associated with lung function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In our subgroup analysis, HRQL impacts of PEs requiring hospitalization were still apparent after exclusion of patients who did not experience a decline in absolute ppFEV<sub>1</sub> of 10 percentage points or higher prior to the PE start date.</p><p>In summary, our results are supportive of prior suggestions that &#x0201c;the powerful association of HRQL with exacerbations, and the weaker association with FEV<sub>1</sub> percent predicted may imply that for patients with CF and their families, HRQL may have less to do with how severe one&#x02019;s underlying disease is, and more to do with the disruptive effect of exacerbations.&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. While this may be more strongly observed for disease specific measures, there is an important role for including and assessing the impact of disease on generic measures, which are frequently used for cross-condition comparisons. The STRIVE trial appropriately included the EQ-5D as a generic measure of HRQL and the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire- Revised which has been reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>It should be noted that the EQ-5D index at the time of study initiation was high (mean&#x02009;&#x02248;&#x02009;0.93) leaving little room for improvement with study treatments. There are multiple possible explanations for these high values. Among others, STRIVE study criteria excluded patients with a history of any illness or condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, could confound the results of the study or pose an additional risk in administering study drug to the patients, acute respiratory illness or PE within four weeks of baseline, those with colonization with selected microorganisms, and patients with any &#x0201c;non-CF-related&#x0201d; illness within 2 prior weeks. High scores have been also reported at the time of study initiation in the TIGER clinical trial (Health State Utilities Index [HUI]&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.90, and 0.83 using a feeling thermometer similar to the VAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. High values may also be explained by patients&#x02019; adaptation and coping mechanisms leading to acceptance of their chronic condition. From the physician&#x02019;s point of view, patients with CF and their close companions may underestimate the severity of their disease and overestimate self-care, and such perceptions often remain constant over time even if the patient&#x02019;s health is clinically deteriorating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Denial of physical symptoms as a protective means for psychosocial adaptation and emotional resiliency are suggested strategies for living in the present used by patients with chronic disease which may limit consideration of the full impact of their condition when evaluating health on a given day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>While both EQ-5D and VAS are generic measures, they provide complementary information; the use of the EQ-5D index alone (a generic HQRL measure) may limit characterization of disease burden and health gains in patients with CF. The EQ-5D index is however, a necessary generic HRQL (&#x0201c;health-state utility&#x0201d;) metric that is typically required in cost-effectiveness evaluations of new therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In our analysis, the EQ-5D VAS measure showed greater ability to discriminate disease severity (as measured by ppFEV<sub>1</sub> and PEs respectively) than the EQ-5D index. This broader range of response on the VAS measure, as compared to the EQ-5D index, which has also been reported by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], may point to health constructs or dimensions that may not be fully captured by the EQ-5D questionnaire. Some dimensions of the EQ-5D, particularly self-care, are less likely to be impacted by CF; pain, discomfort, anxiety and depression have been reported to be most affected in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] but others may not be well represented by this generic HRQL measure. Use of disease-specific measures (e.g., CFQ-R) alongside generic instruments, per guidance, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] should provide complementary assessment of patient-reported symptoms and HRQL.</p><p>The current analysis does have a number of limitations. EQ-5D measures were not assessed at the time of PE start as this was not part of the original study design. Sample size was small for ppFEV<sub>1</sub> category &#x0003c;40&#x000a0;% and for some of the PE-related analytical windows employed in our analyses. Patients in clinical practice may differ from those participating in the STRIVE clinical trial and caution should be used in generalization of study findings. Also, the STRIVE clinical study included only patients with CF and the <italic>G551D-</italic>CFTR mutation. Finally, the EQ-5D was designed for use in populations 18&#x000a0;years of age or older, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] whereas this study included adolescent patients as young as 12&#x000a0;years of age. However, it should be noted that some previous research has indicated that as long as the language and concepts used within the instrument are understood, the EQ-5D may be used in adolescents (12&#x02013;18 years) with adequate functioning ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] as cited in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, in a clinical study of patients with CF (&#x02265;12&#x000a0;years of age and a <italic>G551D</italic>-CFTR mutation), PEs, primarily those requiring hospitalization, were associated with low EQ-5D index and VAS scores. The impact of ppFEV<sub>1</sub> was relatively smaller.
