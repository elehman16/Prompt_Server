Outcomes included the change in the Cobb angles of the Largest Curve and Sum of Curves from baseline to six months. The intervention consisted of a 30&#x02013;45 minute daily home program and weekly supervised sessions.

It is generally agreed that curves less than 30&#x000b0; are unlikely to progress after skeletal maturity.[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Therefore, early treatment is recommended throughout pubertal growth to prevent progression.</p><p>In North America, the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) developed standard of care guidelines for growing patients with AIS, which includes observation (curves 10&#x000b0; to 25&#x000b0;), bracing (curves 25&#x000b0; to 45&#x000b0;), and elective surgery (curves &#x0003e;45&#x000b0;).[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Some scoliosis centers are more proactive, starting bracing with curves under 25&#x000b0; that have demonstrated progression.[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The efficacy of exercise treatment is controversial. Although evidence suggests that PSSE, which include auto-correction in 3D, integration in daily life, stabilizing the corrected posture, and patient education,[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] could improve some outcomes,[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] PSSE have not yet been widely accepted in North America. However, the international Society on Scoliosis Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Treatment (SOSORT) that has interest in non-operative management of patients with scoliosis, developed guidelines[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] that recommend PSSE used alone and as an add-on to bracing for patients with curves &#x0003c;45&#x000b0; to 1) prevent further curve progression at puberty, 2) to prevent or treat respiratory dysfunction, 3) to prevent or treat spinal pain syndromes, 4) to improve aesthetics via postural correction, and 5) reduce the need for surgery. [<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Differences between the North American and European guidelines may be due to cost, culture, social standards or, possibly differing appraisals of the quality of research involving exercises.</p><p>Bracing can induce stress, fear of injury, discomfort, limitation in activities, negative self-esteem[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and impair lung function,[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. While surgery reduces deformity, it does not necessarily improve other outcomes.[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Moreover, patients fear surgery due to its invasiveness, risk of complications, post-surgical pain, and long recovery. Conversely, exercises are well received,[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and frequently requested by patients and their parents.[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Several systematic reviews on exercises for scoliosis [<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] report promising results on curve severity, such as improving neuromotor control, respiratory function, back muscle strength, and cosmetic appearance. However, most reviews [<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] carry a risk of reviewer bias because they were published by authors of studies included in the reviews. In a recent independent review,[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] nine prospective cohort studies were included, of which only three were controlled and only one used observer blinding. Other limitations of exercise studies included unclear reporting of patient selection criteria, recommendations for, and contraindications to exercise, not reporting on compliance, intention-to-treat analyses, or recruitment strategies. Change in Cobb angles was usually statistically significant, but often within the measurement error. Most recently an overview of systematic reviews on non-surgical interventions for AIS analyzed 21 reviews and concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of non-surgical treatments, including exercises, for AIS.[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>Among the promising PSSE approaches reviewed, Schroth exercises were the most studied. The Schroth method consists of sensorimotor, postural and breathing exercises aimed at recalibration of normal postural alignment, static/dynamic postural control, and spinal stability.[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Several studies of limited quality demonstrated positive outcomes of Schroth exercises on back muscle strength,[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] breathing function,[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] slowing curve progression,[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] improving Cobb angles,[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and decreasing the prevalence of surgery.[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Recently, a 6-month long randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared the efficacy of a supervised to non-supervised Schroth intervention in patients with AIS, while a control group received no treatment.[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Of 45 participants with AIS, 15 were randomized into each of the groups. After six months, the supervised Schroth exercises were superior in improving Cobb angles, scoliometer measures, waist asymmetry and rib hump compared to the non-supervised and no-treatment groups.

A primary care practitioner can refer patients to the Scoliosis Clinic if scoliosis is suspected. The patients&#x02019; evaluations within the trial occurred between April 2011 and May 2014. The local Health Research Ethics Board Biomedical (HREB) approved the study prior to beginning patient recruitment, on September 16, 2010 (Pro00011552). However, our trial was registered later (April 2012) in the registry of clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, Trial registration: NCT01610908), because when the recruitment started in 2011, we were not aware that the trial needed to be registered beyond being approved by the Health Research Ethics Board.

Risser grades refer to a child's' skeletal maturity, where children with Risser 0 and 1 are growing rapidly and are considered skeletally immature, and patients who are Risser 4 and 5 have stopped growing and are considered skeletally mature.[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] <bold>Exclusion criteria</bold> were: patients with diagnosis other than AIS, having completed brace treatment, scheduled for surgery, a follow-up scheduled later than 6&#x000b1;2 months, and previous spine surgery.

After being seen by a surgeon or a nurse, patients who previously expressed interest in participation in any type of research conducted at the clinic were approached. The research coordinator explained the study and invited consecutive eligible patients to participate. The research coordinator, the surgeons and the nurse were not involved in the randomization, treatment or outcome assessments. Within two weeks from this visit, a researcher obtained consent and booked an evaluation to confirm eligibility. During the initial visit to our lab (University of Alberta, Rehabilitation Sciences), an independent blinded evaluator completed the baseline exam, and a Schroth therapist who provided treatments determined a scoliosis curve type using our Schroth classification algorithm designed for this study. The participants were then randomized using a computer-generated sequence contained in pre-sealed sequentially numbered opaque envelopes into the Schroth exercises or the control group. Random size (4&#x02013;8) blocked randomization stratified for the four Schroth curve types was used to ensure a balanced allocation of curve types in both groups (25/group).</p><p>Therapists and participants could not be blinded to the treatment. Participants were asked not to reveal their group allocation to ensure evaluator blinding. The statistician was also blinded to coding of group allocation.

Differences between the supervised group and the other two groups were statistically significant. The supervised Schroth intervention was also superior in improving all other measured outcomes. The supervised Schroth intervention consisted of three supervised 1.5 hour-long sessions per week with a Schroth therapist for six weeks (18 sessions in total), after which patients were asked to continue with the treatment at home until six months. The unsupervised exercise group learned the exercises over 1&#x02013;3 sessions, and then continued on their own at home. Controls received no treatment. This protocol is slightly different from ours despite equal supervised time provided (27 hours). Over six months, we provided five one-hour long treatments during the first two weeks followed by weekly one-hour long sessions (about 27 supervised sessions, 27 hours), compared to 18 1.5-hour long sessions during the first six weeks in Kuru et al&#x02019;s study (18 supervised sessions, 27 hours).[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] In their RCT, patients were supervised only for six weeks, while in the present RCT weekly supervision continued until the end of six months.

Nevertheless, both studies concluded that the supervised Schroth PSSE intervention is similarly effective in decreasing the Cobb angles in patients with AIS while other groups experienced some progression.</p><p>Several controlled studies on PSSE for scoliosis have also reported significant effects on curve severity. Wan et al&#x02019;s short-term RCT reported larger Cobb angle improvements (from 26&#x000b0;&#x000b1;12&#x000b0; to 10&#x000b0;&#x000b1;7&#x000b0;) in the group treated daily with PSSE added to standard of care (surface electrical stimulation, traction and postural training) than with standard of care alone over six months (from 25&#x000b0;&#x000b1;13 to 18&#x000b0;&#x000b1;9&#x000b0;).[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] Comparison with our results is difficult because the standard of care is different and the type of scoliosis investigated in this RCT is unclear.</p><p>Monticone et al&#x02019;s long-term RCT found that PSSE consisting of active self-correction and task-oriented exercises, consistent with Scientific Exercise Approach to Scoliosis (SEAS)[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] improved Cobb angles by 5.3&#x000b0; at skeletal maturity in patients with AIS, while traditional exercises were associated with stable curves.[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] None of the patients in their study wore a brace, which explains the smaller curves at baseline in their sample than in ours (19.3&#x000b0;&#x000b1;3.9&#x000b0; vs. 28.5&#x000b0;&#x000b1;8.8&#x000b0;, respectively).

However, their sample had lower (10%) estimated risk of progression[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] compared to ours (65%).</p><p>Otman et al&#x02019;s prospective one-year short-term uncontrolled cohort study that focused on PSSE consistent with Schroth exercises[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] showed improved Cobb angles in 49/50 adolescents and one stable curve after one year. Treatment was intensive consisting of four-hour sessions, five days/week for six weeks, followed by the same program at home with biweekly follow-ups until six months, and then bimonthly until one year. None of the patients wore brace. Mean Largest Curve decreased from 26.1&#x000b0; to 19.2&#x000b0; over six months. The higher intensity might explain the lower compliance (74%) and high dropout rate (25%), but also a larger Cobb angle change among completers as compared to our study.</p><p>Among studies that examined the effect of PSSE, ours was the only one that included patients wearing braces. All, except one prior PSSE study, were with short-term follow-ups ranging from four months to one year. As described by Stokes, lateral curvature of the spine can produce asymmetrical spinal loading resulting in differences in bone growth rates within an individual vertebra. [<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] This leads to a self-perpetuating progressive deformity during skeletal growth, known as &#x0201c;vicious cycle&#x0201d;. [<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] The goal of PSSE schools is to teach patients auto-corrected posture, to stabilize it and integrate in daily life. Auto-correction, defined as the ability to reduce the spinal deformity through the active postural realignment of the spine in three dimensions,[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] balances loads on the convex and concave side of the growing spine and may reverse the &#x0201c;vicious cycle&#x0201d;.[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] There are several PSSE approaches described in the literature with documented evidence of effects on curves including Dobomed, Functional Individual Therapy of Scoliosis (FITS), Lyon method, Schroth, SEAS and Side-Shift. All follow the same principles, although their specific techniques differ. The results of our study strengthen the emerging positive evidence of the effect of PSSE on the Cobb angle change in patients with AIS.</p><sec id="sec027"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Several features of this RCT helped reduce the risk of bias. Randomization balanced number of patients wearing a brace in both groups, and curve types distribution. The evaluators and statistician were blinded. We standardized curve classification[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and exercise prescriptions[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] using algorithms. Patients reported not using co-interventions at follow-ups. Exercise dosage led to high adherence monitored via patients/parent/therapist logbook to minimize the overestimation. Compliance and attendance rates were reported using intention-to-treat. We reported intention-to-treat analysis and acknowledged reasons for missing data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168746.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The main reason for non-compliance and dropout was &#x0201c;time constraint due to homework&#x0201d;.</p><p>Ours was the first study to stratify randomization by curve types. Patients with major thoracic curves and deviated pelvis to the thoracic concavity (3cp) had the largest curve magnitudes, possibly because of their worst prognosis for progression.[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] In contrast, patients with double major curves (corresponding to 4c) had the smallest curve magnitude all including left lumbar and right thoracic, which have a better prognosis.[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] Differences between patterns emphasize the importance of accounting for curve type in randomization.</p><p>A limitation of this study includes possibly limited statistical power due to early termination, and the 12% attrition rate. Regardless, we detected large effects amongst patients (Cohen&#x02019;s d of 0.92 and 0.77 for change in Largest Curve and Sum of Curves, respectively).</p><p>Subject heterogeneity could be another limitation. The selection criteria in our study were wide (heterogeneous) and included all patients with AIS, with all curve types who were undergoing a non-surgical (observation or bracing) standard treatment for scoliosis, because we aimed to generalize the results to the entire population, rather than focus on a very narrow sample. For example, if we were limiting our criteria to only patients who were being monitored and deemed at a high risk of progression, we would not be able to determine the effect of combined bracing with exercises, which was thought to have best outcomes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of enhanced non-surgical (monitoring or bracing) treatment for AIS. Despite the wide selection criteria, we had a balanced representation of the baseline characteristics in the Schroth and control groups in terms of age (13.5 vs. 13.3), height (1.6 vs. 16), weight (45.9 vs. 50.5), curve magnitudes (29.1&#x000b0; vs. 27.9&#x000b0;), number of braced patients (17 vs. 17), Risser sign (1.76 vs. 1.44) and Lonstein-Carlson risk of progression (65% vs. 65%). However, the overall sample of eligible patients had slightly different characteristics: age of 14.2&#x000b1;1.8, height of 1.62 &#x000b1;9.9m, weight of 53.0&#x000b1;13.3kg, largest curve of 26.0&#x000b1;9.6, Risser of 3.02&#x000b1;1.8, and the risk of progression of about 30%, suggesting that patients who are at higher risk of progression and in the ranges of curves for non-surgical treatment are more interested in applying exercises as an ad on to standard of care. This might be due to the fact that the patients were approached to be part of the study shortly after being seen by a practicing scoliosis surgeon, and the patients&#x02019; decision might have been influenced by their surgeon&#x02019;s opinion about their condition. Nevertheless, exercises should be considered as an ad on to standard of care for scoliosis, because: 1) the patients and their parents are interested in more comprehensive and proactive management, and because 2) the patients are shown to be compliant with the exercises and have better short term outcomes compared to the ones who only receive standard of care.</p><p>We included patients of all maturity levels. More mature patients (Risser 3&#x02013;5) have lower risk of progression, and potentially better treatment success. Nevertheless, our sample&#x02019;s estimated risk of progression was higher than in most exercise trials. While conducting subgroup analysis on patients with high (Risser 0 to 2) versus low risk of progression (Risser 3 to 5) is warranted, our sample size does not yet allow for this comparison. Most of our patients, however, were deemed at high risk of progression with the distribution of Risser signs presenting as follows: one patient with Risser 5, 11 with Risser 4, five with Risser 3 compared to six patients with Risser 2, four with Risser 1 and 23 with Risser 0. We have made our data available with this publication; future individual patient data meta-analyses will allow for answering such important clinical questions.</p><p>The relatively short 6-month follow-up is another potential limitation of the study. Consensus between SRS and SOSORT non-operative management committee published after we underwent the present study recommends a minimum one-year follow-up.[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] However, we believe that if we did not first show at least a small effect at six months, then a study with a later endpoint would not be necessary. The exercise treatment requires daily purposeful commitment and dedication of the patients and their parents, as well as adjustment of their daily routine. Shorter follow-up can assure tangible and meaningful feedback to the patients and promote motivation for continuation of this demanding treatment. In addition, this shorter trial allowed for a stricter control of the intervention, including absence of co-interventions and high compliance, which would be more likely to occur over a longer follow-up. Although, the evidence suggests that long-term PSSE intervention until maturity leads to improvement of the curves[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], it is possible for the curves to deteriorate after a shorter follow-up despite the initial improvement. While the shorter 6-month follow-up allowed for more control over the trial&#x02019;s possible confounders (i.e., compliance, co-intervention, standardized treatment), it also limited extrapolation of the results to the longer follow-up, at the end of skeletal maturity.</p><p>Lastly, this study could not determine the effect of only Schroth exercises, because exercises were combined with standard of care. In order to determine this, our study would have to randomize patients meeting the brace prescription criteria into an exercise only and a brace only group. Ethically, we could not withhold the bracing from the patients meeting the SRS criteria. We aimed to determine the effect of the Schroth PSSE as an add-on to the standard of care, and not as a stand-alone therapy. Since in North America standard of care includes observation and braces for patients with curves &#x02264;45&#x000b0;, our sample consisted of an experimental group of patients who received Schroth + observation or Schroth + brace, and controls, who received only observation or only brace. The proportions of patients receiving observation and bracing within each group was balanced between groups. Wearing a brace was further controlled for in the analyses. The covariate representing the bracing effect was not retained in the statistical models showing that an adjustment for differential effects of bracing in the groups was not required. While it would be interesting to examine the differences between the mentioned subgroups using a factorial design, our sample size did not permit it. The continuing multicenter SETS trial should allow comparisons of the following subgroups: observation versus Schroth PSSE, observation versus Schroth PSSE + brace, brace versus Schroth, as well as brace versus Schroth PSS + brace.</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>Future research</title><p>Future research investigating the effect of Schroth intervention should include a larger population of patients with AIS, which justifies our multicentre RCT. It is also necessary to establish guidelines for the assessment of the exercise effectiveness, as has been proposed for braces.[<xref rid="pone.0168746.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] That way the comparisons between similar exercises trials would be easier and more valid. Future work should highlight the cost-benefit of this promising conservative treatment for scoliosis before a widespread change in practice is implemented. Finally, to avoid the overtreatment, a clinical prediction rule to identify patients who would benefit from the Schroth treatment is also an important step.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec029"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, based on both the intention-to-treat and the per protocol analysis, six-months of Schroth PSSE added to standard of care improved curve severity in adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis compared to standard of care. The completers experienced larger benefits from the intervention compared to the entire sample, which emphasizes the importance of compliance with the exercise program. Low dropout and adequate compliance rates indicate the feasibility of adding Schroth intervention to the standard of care in North America. This trial increases the level of evidence on the short-term benefits of Schroth PSSE for AIS by its methodological rigor and justifies continued investigation in the ongoing Multicenter Trial, in which we will also identify which children are most likely to benefit from Schroth exercises.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec030"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0168746.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 Compliance Checklist.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0168746.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0168746.s002"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Full study protocol approved by our local Human Research Ethics Board Biomedical.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0168746.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0168746.s003"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Excel file containing study data.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0168746.s003.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Kathleen Shearer for coordinating the study recruitment, Alan Richter for helping with the data entry and acting as an assessor, and the participants with their parents.
