<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> Recent recommendations suggest that early treatment should be targeted towards the goal of clinical remission or low disease activity (LDA) and that this can lead to better structural and functional outcomes for patients. Furthermore, remission or LDA should be maintained throughout the course of the disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> In addition to clinical targets, maintaining inhibition of joint damage is important for the patient, given the association between structural damage and long-term loss of function.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></p><p>B cell depletion with rituximab 2&#x000d7;1000 mg is an established and effective treatment for RA. In combination with methotrexate (MTX), rituximab has been shown to significantly reduce clinical signs and symptoms of RA in patients with an inadequate response (IR) to either conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> and to inhibit radiographic progression in TNF-IR patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> In the IMAGE study&#x02014;a randomised placebo-controlled trial of rituximab plus MTX in MTX-na&#x000ef;ve patients with early active RA&#x02014;rituximab 2&#x000d7;1000 mg+MTX significantly inhibited progression of joint damage and improved clinical outcomes and physical function compared with MTX alone after 1 year.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> Here, we present clinical and radiographic outcomes from the 2-year analysis of this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>Full eligibility criteria have been previously reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> In brief, patients were required to have a disease duration of &#x02265;8 weeks but &#x02264;4 years, no prior MTX treatment and active disease (swollen joint count (66 joints) and tender joint count (68 joints) both &#x02265;8 at screening and baseline, and Creactive protein level &#x02265;1.0 mg/dl). Patients seronegative for rheumatoid factor (RF) were only eligible if they had radiographic evidence of erosive damage attributable to RA. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the institutional review board or the ethics committee at each study site. All patients gave written informed consent.</p><p>In October 2009, following a spontaneous report outside of clinical trials of a case of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML) in a rituximab-treated patient not previously treated with biologics, rituximab treatment was discontinued in the IMAGE trial and patients were subjected instead to safety follow-up. By this time, all patients had completed their 104-week follow-up and, consequently, the discontinuation does not impact the data presented here.</p><p>Patients were randomised (1:1:1) to receive rituximab 2&#x000d7;500 mg+MTX, 2&#x000d7;1000 mg+MTX or placebo+MTX. Rituximab or placebo was administered by intravenous infusion on days 1 and 15. Patients received intravenous methylprednisolone 100 mg premedication before all infusions. Oral MTX was commenced in all patients at 7.5 mg/week and escalated to 20 mg/week by week 8, as tolerated. Repeat courses of rituximab or placebo were permitted from week 24. To be eligible for re-treatment, patients had to have a Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) &#x02265;2.6, with further re-treatment permitted 24 weeks after each course based on the same criteria. The placebo-controlled period continued to week 104. At week 52, the sponsor was unblinded to all treatment assignments for the purposes of data analysis, but investigators, sites, patients and radiographic readers remained blinded. Radiographs (hands, wrists and feet) were performed at screening and weeks 24, 52 and 104 and were read by two independent expert radiologists using the Genant-modified Sharp scoring system.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></p><p>The primary end point was the change in total Genant-modified Sharp score (mTSS) at week 52 from baseline.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> At week 104, radiographic end points included the change in mTSS, total erosion score and joint space narrowing from baseline to week 104. Proportions of patients with no progression in mTSS and erosion scores were also assessed. Clinical end points included the proportion of patients achieving American College of Rheumatology (ACR)20/50/70/90 criteria responses, European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) responses and change in DAS28-ESR. ACR index of improvement in RA (ACRn) was calculated as described previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> Physical function was assessed using the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI). Radiographic outcomes and ACR50 responses were also analysed by serological status (RF and/or anticitrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA) presence). Adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout the study and graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3).</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Radiographic end points were analysed using a modified intention-to-treat population (all randomised and treated patients with a screening and at least one postbaseline radiographic evaluation). The intention-to-treat population (all patients randomised and treated) was used for all other efficacy and all safety end points.</p><p>Efficacy end points were grouped and ranked according to three objectives (prevention of joint damage, improvement in clinical signs and symptoms and improvement in physical function). All clinical signs and symptoms end points at week 104 were defined as exploratory in the protocol. Within the other two categories, all end points were secondary or exploratory at week 104, using a hierarchical approach to significance testing to control for multiplicity. When an end point did not reach significance at week 52, that end point and all end points lower in the hierarchy were treated as exploratory at week 104. When a secondary end point did not reach significance at week 104, all end points lower in the hierarchy were treated as exploratory. The primary end point (change in mTSS vs placebo at week 52) was achieved for rituximab 2&#x000d7;1000 mg+MTX; however, the change in mTSS with rituximab 2&#x000d7;500 mg+MTX was not statistically significant. Therefore, all p-values associated with radiographic outcomes at week 104 for this lower dose are exploratory and should be interpreted with caution. Exploratory p-values are denoted by &#x02018;ex-p&#x02019;.</p><p>Changes in radiographic scores were assessed with pairwise comparisons using a non-parametric test (Van Elteren) adjusted for baseline stratification factors (RF and region). Missing values were imputed by linear extrapolation. Percentage of inhibition of radiographic progression was calculated as (mean mTSS change in placebo group&#x02212;mean mTSS change in a rituximab group)&#x000d7;100/(mean mTSS change in placebo group). Differences in the proportions of patients without radiographic progression were assessed using the Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test, adjusting for baseline stratification factors. Patients were deemed to have progressed if their progression status could not be determined. Clinical signs and symptoms and physical efficacy differences were assessed using the Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test and analysis of variance for categorical and continuous end points, respectively, adjusting for baseline stratification factors. Endpoint baseline values were included in analysis-of-variance models, if applicable. Non-responder imputations were used for categorical end points, and last observation carried forward was used for continuous end points.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 755 patients were randomised, with 748 included in the intention-to-treat and safety population and 716 in the modified intention-to-treat population analysed for radiographic outcomes. Overall, 606 patients (80%) completed week 104; lack of efficacy and refusal of treatment were the most common reasons for withdrawal, with 4%, 3% and 5% of patients in the rituximab 2&#x000d7;500 mg+MTX, 2&#x000d7;1000 mg+MTX and placebo+MTX groups, respectively, withdrawing due to safety reasons. The proportion of randomised patients completing week 104 was higher in the rituximab 2&#x000d7;500 mg+MTX and 2&#x000d7;1000 mg+MTX groups compared with the placebo+MTX group (85% and 85% vs 71%, respectively). At 2 years, 67&#x02013;68% of patients had received a third course of treatment, with some patients receiving up to five courses. The number of courses received was balanced between the placebo and rituximab treatment groups; overall, 249, 250 and 249 patients in the rituximab 2&#x000d7;500 mg+MTX, 2&#x000d7;1000 mg+MTX and placebo+MTX groups, respectively, received &#x02265;1 course; 215, 219 and 212 received &#x02265;2 courses; 169, 172 and 169 received &#x02265;3 courses; 106, 107 and 122 received &#x02265;4 courses; and 24, 26 and 31 received &#x02265;5 courses. Baseline characteristics were similar across all treatment groups and have been reported previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> As at 1 year, MTX doses were similar across groups at 2 years.</p><sec id="s5"><title>Radiographic end points</title><p>At week 104, rituximab 2&#x000d7;1000 mg+MTX continued to inhibit progressive joint damage (PJD) in patients. The change in mTSS from baseline was 0.41 for patients treated with rituximab 2&#x000d7;1000 mg+MTX compared with 1.95 in the placebo+MTX group (p&#x0003c;0.0001), equating to 79% inhibition in mTSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). Change from baseline in total erosion score also continued to be significantly lower with rituximab 2&#x000d7;1000 mg+MTX versus placebo+MTX at this time point (mean change 0.23 vs 1.32; p&#x0003c;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, a positive effect on joint space narrowing scores was observed with rituximab 2&#x000d7;1000 mg+MTX versus placebo+MTX (0.18 vs 0.63; ex-p=0.0183), an effect that was not seen at week 52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). Also, contrary to the results observed at week 52, exploratory analysis showed that PJD was reduced in patients receiving rituximab 2&#x000d7;500 mg+MTX over the 2-year time period: change in mTSS was reduced by approximately 61% compared with placebo+MTX (ex-p=0.0041), and erosive progression was slowed (mean change 0.50; ex-p=0.0019) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Change in radiographic end points at 2 years in the modified intention-to-treat population.

Exploratory analysis also suggested that rituximab 2&#x000d7;500 mg+MTX slowed joint damage over 2 years.</p><p>The proportion of patients showing no progression of joint damage after 2 years was significantly higher in the rituximab dose groups compared with the placebo+MTX group. The figure of 57% observed for the 2&#x000d7;1000 mg dose was almost identical (56.8%) to that seen at 2 years in a similar population treated with abatacept+MTX.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> The majority of joint damage progression in the current study was observed within the first 6 months, with further damage almost entirely prevented thereafter; the reasons for this are unknown.</p><p>Over 2 years, both doses of rituximab continued to demonstrate significant improvements over placebo in relieving the signs and symptoms of RA, as exemplified by significantly higher proportions of patients achieving &#x02018;high-hurdle&#x02019; end points, such as ACR70 and ACR90, major clinical response, EULAR good response and DAS28 remission. In addition, improvements in physical function were maintained, with significantly greater mean changes in HAQ-DI observed in both rituximab groups than in the placebo group throughout the observation period.</p><p>This study was not powered to compare rituximab doses, but exploratory results generally show that numerically greater responses for radiographic outcomes were achieved with the higher dose, while clinical outcome responses were generally numerically similar for both doses. In addition, the disconnect between radiographic and clinical responses with rituximab 2&#x000d7;500 mg+MTX previously observed at 1 year was reduced at 2 years&#x02014;an effect attributed to a slower onset of radiographic inhibition during the initial 6 months of treatment with the 500-mg dose. A recent consensus statement<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> discussed the optimal dose of rituximab in patients with RA. The authors proposed that the 500-mg dose may provide equivalent clinical and radiographic benefits to 1000 mg; however, the 500-mg dose is not approved and has not been studied in the licensed TNF-IR patient population. Consequently, further analysis would be required to confirm any equivalence of doses. In the present study, while both rituximab doses provided benefit in improving clinical signs and symptoms, data suggest that the higher dose slows PJD sooner, an observation that is relevant to an early population with RA (data presented in online supplementary table S1).</p><p>As at 1 year, and consistent with observations made in other patient populations,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> patients in the small subgroup who were seronegative for both RF and ACPA showed limited evidence of radiographic or clinical improvement with rituximab+MTX or placebo+MTX treatment. Conversely, radiographic and clinical responses among patients seropositive for RF and/or ACPA were significantly improved for rituximab compared with MTX alone.</p><p>The 2-year safety profile is consistent with that observed at 1 year<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> and with previously reported data in TNF-IR patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> and pooled data from long-term rituximab studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> The incidence of serious infections remained low and consistent with previously reported rates,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> and no further opportunistic infections were reported beyond those observed up to week 52. Infusion-related reactions remained the most common safety event overall; however, their incidence generally declined following the first infusion of the first course.</p><p>No cases of PML were reported in this trial, and the overall reporting incidence of PML in patients with RA receiving rituximab is very rare (5 cases in 129,000 patients with RA).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> The IMAGE trial was conducted in MTX-na&#x000ef;ve patients with early disease, and many alternative treatment options are available for these patients; therefore, following a spontaneous report of a case of PML in a rituximab-treated patient not previously exposed to biological treatment,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> the sponsors took the decision to discontinue dosing with rituximab in the IMAGE trial.</p><p>Rituximab 2&#x000d7;1000 mg is currently licensed in combination with MTX for patients with RA who have had an IR or intolerance to other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, including one or more TNF inhibitor treatments. Rituximab is not approved for use in the MTX-na&#x000ef;ve population described here, but these data demonstrate the value of rituximab+MTX in preventing progression of structural joint damage, a key goal of treatment. Furthermore, under recent recommendations and guidelines, patients often now receive their second and subsequent biological treatment much sooner after RA diagnosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> Consequently, the positive results presented here for the IMAGE trial, in which patients were treated on average 1 year after RA disease onset, may be relevant to a TNF-IR patient who initiates treatment with rituximab.</p><p>In conclusion, this 2-year analysis of the IMAGE study demonstrates that rituximab 2&#x000d7;1000 mg+MTX led to sustained and significant inhibition of joint damage progression and significant improvements in clinical signs and symptoms of RA and functional ability compared with MTX alone in an early population of patients with RA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplemental Table</title></caption><media xlink:href="ard-71-3-0351-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d34e939" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Laura Burke and Nicola Tyson (Roche Products) who contributed to the analysis and interpretation of the data.
