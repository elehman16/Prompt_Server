This avoids the untoward effects of general anesthetic drugs and upper airway instrumentation. It achieves complete muscle relaxation, intraoperative hemodynamic stability, and postoperative analgesia.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>There are many approaches to the brachial plexus block have been described, but the supraclavicular approach is the easiest and appropriate method for anesthesia and management of perioperative pain in surgery below the shoulder joint.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Bupivacaine used frequently for supraclavicular nerve block as it has long duration of action from 3 to 6 h. Adjuncts to local anesthetics for brachial plexus block may enhance the quality and duration of analgesia.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Brachial plexus blockade reduces pain, but still with short duration and the challenge remains to increase the duration of analgesia with decreasing side-effects.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Different additives have been used to prolong regional blockade and shorten the onset times of blocks. Vasoconstrictor was used to constrict vessels, thereby reducing vascular absorption of the local anesthetic. Additives such as opioids, clonidine, verapamil, etc., were added to local anesthetics, but the results are either inconclusive or associated with side-effects.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Steroids have powerful antiinflammatory as well as analgesic property and were used intrathecally with no evidence suggesting neuritis when given in low concentration.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Also midazolam, a water-soluble benzodiazepine, is known to produce antinociception and enhance the effect of local anesthetics when given epidurally or intrathecally.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of adding either dexamethasone or midazolam in comparison with epinephrine addition to 0.5% bupivacaine in supraclavicular brachial plexus block.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This is a prospective randomized controlled observer-blinded study conducted at Tanta University Hospital and carried out on 60 adult patients of both sexes during the period from April 2010 to February 2012 after approval by the Hospital Ethical Committee.</p><p>Inclusion criteria are American Society of Anesthesiologists physical Status I-II and age between 18 and 45 years.</p><p>Exclusion criteria are known allergy to local anesthetic agents or narcotics, coagulation disorders, ASA physical status of more than II, history of a major psychiatric disorder, chronic pain syndrome, diabetic patient, pregnancy, history of substance abuse, and current opioid use. Patients were provided with complete information about the techniques of anesthesia and analgesia. All included participants were asked to take part in the study by the study personnel soon after admission to the ward and a written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Patients were randomly allocated to three groups of 20 patients each.</p><p>Patients were connected to the monitor include pulse oximeter, electrocardiogram and noninvasive blood pressure (BP). Patients were connected to nasal prong at 3 L/min. Intravenous access was secured, lactated ringer started at rate 10 mL/kg intravenous (IV).</p><p>Patient in semi-sitting position (the head of the bed raised about 45&#x000b0;) with head tilted to the opposite side of injection site. The skin was cleaned with chlorhexidine solution. The ultrasound transducer (high frequency linear 13-6 MHz, 38 mm broadband linear array [SonoScape SSI 6000 China]) was inserted into a sterile sheath. A thin layer of sterile gel was placed between the draped ultrasound transducer and the skin. Probe is applied parallel to the clavicle in the supraclavicular fossa. At this location, the subclavian artery is seen beating above the first rib; it cannot be compressed as opposed to the vein. The rib is bright and pleura are seen on each side of the rib. The brachial plexus is lateral to the subclavian artery with honeycomb appearance. A volume of 2 mL lignocaine 2% was infiltrated subcutaneous before the block (24-G needle Masco Mid Co., Cairo, Egypt). An 18-G tuohy needle (Perifix, B Braun, Melsungen AG, Germany) is advanced in plane under direct visualization toward the plexus sheath till its puncture and start injection. The injected volume gently expands the connective tissue surrounding the nerves, which is called hydro dissection. This allows a clear path for the needle, decreasing the chance of nerve damage by the needle. Another injection site is at the angle between the first rib and the subclavian artery. Aspiration done every 3-5 mL during injection to prevent vascular injection the end of the injection was considered time 0.</p><p>Patients were randomly divided into three groups (each group 20 patients) using closed sealed envelope, according to drugs injected into:</p><p>

Perineural injection was found to be safe, devoid of potential adverse effects and may affect postoperative analgesia. Dexamethasone is a synthetic glucocorticoid, preferred because it is highly potent antiinflammatory, about 30 times as potent as hydrocortisone and without any mineralocorticoid activity.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Dexamethasone is also known to reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting through its antiinflammatory effect.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Dexamethasone prolonged duration of block through local action mediated through glucocorticoid receptors. When steroid alone is used in regional blocks, the blockade is not produced. Steroids might exert this effect by altering the function of potassium channels in the excitable cells; bind to intracellular receptors and modulate nuclear transcription.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Movafegh <italic>et al</italic>. in their study they found that addition of dexamethasone to lignocaine prolongs duration of analgesia significantly without any change in onset time.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>While in study of Shrestha <italic>et al</italic>. found that addition of dexamethasone as adjuvant to mixture of local anesthetics in supraclavicular block had significant early onset and longer duration of analgesia.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Dexamethasone had safety profile in spite of sample sizes in most studies are insufficient to detect rare outcomes and most studies did not follow patients for weeks after surgery.
