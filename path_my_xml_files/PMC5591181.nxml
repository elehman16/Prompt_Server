However, clinical outcome data from prospective studies in RS&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;11 patients are lacking, as are relevant real-life clinical practice data. In this retrospective analysis of a prospectively designed registry, we evaluated treatments/clinical outcomes in patients undergoing RS-testing through Clalit Health Services. The analysis included N0 ER&#x02009;+&#x02009;HER2-negative breast cancer patients who were RS-tested from 1/2006 through 12/2010. Medical records were reviewed to verify treatments/recurrences/survival. The cohort included 1801 patients (median follow-up, 6.2 years). Median age was 60 years, 50.4% were grade 2 and 81.1% had invasive ductal carcinoma; 48.9% had RS&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;18, 40.7% RS 18&#x02013;30, and 10.4% RS&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;31, with chemotherapy use of 1.4, 23.7, and 87.2%, respectively. The 5-year Kaplan&#x02013;Meier estimates for distant recurrence were 0.8, 3.0, and 8.6%, for patients with RS&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;18, RS 18&#x02013;30 and RS&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;31, respectively; the corresponding 5-year Kaplan&#x02013;Meier estimates for breast cancer death were 0.0, 0.9, and 6.2%.

Our results extend those of the prospective TAILORx trial: the 5-year Kaplan&#x02013;Meier estimates for distant recurrence and breast cancer death rate for the RS&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;18 patients were very low supporting the use of endocrine therapy alone. Furthermore, in chemotherapy-untreated patients with RS 11&#x02013;25 (where TAILORx patients were randomized to chemoendocrine or endocrine therapy alone), 5-year distant recurrence rates were also very low, suggesting that chemotherapy would not have conferred clinically meaningful benefit.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Genetic testing: Diagnostic shows which node-negative patients need chemo</title><p id="Par2">Patients with early breast cancer that hasn&#x02019;t spread to lymph nodes can likely forgo chemotherapy if they score under 25 on Oncotype DX. That&#x02019;s the finding of a retrospective analysis led by Salomon Stemmer from Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikvah, Israel, that looked at 1801 women with node-negative, ER-positive, HER2-negative disease who received the diagnostic test, which measures the expression levels of 21 genes within tumor cells. Rates of disease recurrence and death were low for patients who received only anti-hormone treatment and had low-to-intermediate Oncotype DX results, suggesting no need for additional chemotherapy (which carries an appreciable risk of toxicity). Previously, a prospective US study called TAILORx established that women with scores under 11 could be spared chemotherapy. The Israeli trial validates and extends the results to include women with scores up to 25.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">The 21-gene Recurrence Score&#x000ae; (RS) assay (Oncotype DX&#x000ae;, Genomic Health Inc., Redwood City, CA) is used to guide treatment decisions in estrogen receptor (ER)&#x02009;+&#x02009;early-stage breast cancer (BC) for more than a decade.

</p><p id="Par4">Prospective outcome data from patients treated based on their RS results are currently limited to findings from 2 phase 3 trials; TAILORx and West German Study Group (WSG) PlanB. TAILORx is a non-inferiority trial comparing endocrine treatment alone to chemoendocrine treatment in patients with node-negative, hormone receptor (HR)+, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)&#x02212;negative BC and RS 11&#x02013;25. Patients with RS&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;25 received chemoendocrine therapy, and patients with RS&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;11 received endocrine therapy alone. Recently published TAILORx findings reported only on the RS&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;11 patients (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1626), and demonstrated very low recurrence rates (rate of freedom from distant recurrence at 5 years: 99.3%; overall survival at 5 years, 98.0%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> Prospective outcome data have also been presented from the WSG PlanB trial, where patients with HR&#x02009;+&#x02009;HER2-negative disease with node-positive or high risk node-negative early BC and RS&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;11 were recommended to omit adjuvant chemotherapy. The 3-year disease-free survival for the 348 RS&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;11 chemotherapy-untreated patients was 98%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>
</p><p id="Par5">The TAILORx data from patients with RS 11&#x02013;25 randomized to chemoendocrine or endocrine therapy alone has yet to be presented. While awaiting these results to clarify whether chemotherapy benefits intermediate risk patients, prospective data on recurrence rates in patients with RS&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;11 treated with endocrine therapy alone are lacking, as are data from real-life clinical practice where treatment decisions incorporated the RS.</p><p id="Par6">The RS assay became commercially available in 2004. Clalit Health Services (CHS), the largest health maintenance organization (HMO) in Israel, approved assay reimbursement for node-negative ER&#x02009;+&#x02009;patients in 1/2006 and extended its policy in 1/2008 to include node-positive (up to 3 positive axillary lymph nodes including micrometastases) patients. Since its introduction in Israel, approximately 11,600 patients have been RS-tested including approximately 7300 CHS members. Here, we report the first outcome results of a real-life contemporary practice CHS registry analysis where all patients were RS-tested&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;5 years ago. The relationship between the RS, adjuvant treatments received, and clinical outcomes across the entire range of RS results is reported. Notably, this analysis complements another analysis focusing on node-positive patients who were RS-tested through CHS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>

Since the distant recurrence rate without adjuvant chemotherapy is so low in this population, the absolute benefit of chemotherapy is expected to be very small, and to be outweighed by treatment-related toxicity and mortality. In addition, our analysis of chemotherapy-treated vs. untreated patients showing no significant difference in recurrence risk between these groups supports treating these patients with endocrine therapy alone. In the group of patients with RS 26&#x02013;30, no evidence of chemotherapy benefit was observed although the number of patients and events in this group was small; in a post hoc analysis of statistical power for detecting a difference in outcome by treatment, we calculated less than 30% power in both the RS 18&#x02013;25 and RS 26&#x02013;30 cohorts. Notably, our registry analysis is impacted by selection bias as patients were not randomized to chemoendocrine vs. endocrine therapy alone. For patients with RS 18&#x02013;30, measured/unmeasured prognostic parameters associated with higher risk maybe more common in those who were recommended chemotherapy. The results from the randomized arms in TAILORx will provide final evidence on whether endocrine therapy alone is non-inferior to chemoendocrine therapy in this patient population.</p><p id="Par19">Although some subgroups are relatively small, our findings suggest that RS&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;18, patients with larger tumors have worse outcomes; however, we cannot predict whether these patients will benefit from adjuvant treatment with the currently used chemotherapeutic agents.</p><p id="Par20">Our data, showing that oncologists in Israel treat BC based on the RS results, are consistent with decision impact studies conducted worldwide (including in Israel).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> Within the RS 18&#x02013;30 group, we found increased chemotherapy use with higher RS results, suggesting that clinicians do not view this group as a uniform entity.</p><p id="Par21">Notably, other genomic assays are also commercially available and serve as prognostic tools in early BC. These include MammaPrint&#x000ae; (Agendia BV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), Prosigna&#x000ae; (PAM50; NanoString Technologies Inc, Seattle WA), and EndoPredict&#x000ae; (Myriad Genetics Inc, Salt Lake City, UT). These assays differ from each other and from the RS assay in the technological platforms used, the specific genes included in the assay, and the patient populations used for their development/validation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>
</p><p id="Par22">There are health economic (HE) implications associated with the cost of the tests, from sparing chemotherapy among patients who would not benefit from it, thereby decreasing acute/chronic treatment-related morbidity, as well as from using chemotherapy in patients who would benefit from it (i.e., preventing recurrences). The first 313 RS assays reimbursed by CHS were included in HE analysis, which reported cost effectiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> A formal cost-effectiveness evaluation of using the RS assay in Israel is warranted and planned. Notably, our distribution analyses demonstrated that overall, estimating the RS from clinicopathological characteristics is not feasible as the RS distribution was wide in all evaluated subgroups, except for patients with grade 1 disease and tumors &#x02264;1&#x02009;cm where the proportion of patients with RS&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;25 was low and the baseline risk to which the RS adds prognostic information is also low.</p><p id="Par23">This is the first real-life large registry analysis that represents clinical practice on a national level; no exclusion criteria with respect to gender, age, location, socioeconomic status, or comorbidities were applied and patients were treated in CHS-affiliated centers and government hospitals throughout Israel. Nonetheless, the analysis does have some limitations. It was not randomized and patients were not treated uniformly (with respect to chemotherapy/endocrine therapy regimens), and there may have been selection bias in who was tested and in those not receiving chemotherapy. We believe that the former was minimal as &#x0003e;80% of eligible CHS patients are tested. Also, although the sample size was approximately 1800 patients, the event rate was very low, and therefore drawing more definitive conclusions for smaller subgroups is not possible. The SEER analysis may provide robust data in subgroups with less common clinicopathological characteristics. Also, median follow-up of 6 years is relatively short for N0 ER&#x02009;+&#x02009;patients; thus, our findings are limited to &#x02018;early&#x02019; distant recurrences, but this is also the timeframe when chemotherapy benefit would be expected. Longer-term analysis (median of 10 years) is warranted and planned. The TAILORx randomized arms are yet to be reported as the number of events has been low (consistent with our findings).</p><p id="Par24">In conclusion, this is the first analysis of a prospectively designed registry evaluating clinical outcomes in N0 ER&#x02009;+&#x02009;HER2-negative early BC patients for whom the RS was used in real-life clinical practice. It extends the remarkable results from the TAILORx-defined cohort (RS&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;11) to include patients with RS&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;18, as in both studies, the 5-year risk of distant recurrence was very low (&#x02264;1%). For selected patients with RS&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;25, the data suggest that endocrine therapy alone may suffice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Patient population</title><p id="Par25">Collecting clinical outcome data from all CHS RS-tested patients was planned by CHS, in concert with assay reimbursement approval. This retrospective analysis of the prospectively designed CHS registry investigated the relationship between the RS, adjuvant treatments received, and distant recurrence/survival in patients with ER&#x02009;+&#x02009;HER2-negative N0 BC in real-life clinical practice. The analysis included all N0 CHS members who were RS-tested between 1/2006 through 12/2010 to allow for &#x02265;5 years of follow-up. Patients who were ER-negative by immunohistochemistry (IHC; cutoff: 0.5) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which was performed as part of the 21-gene assay (cutoff: 6.5 units) were excluded.

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize clinicopathological characteristics. The primary endpoint was 5-year KM distant recurrence estimates and 95% CI by RS risk categories<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> (&#x0003c;18, 18&#x02013;30, &#x02265;31). Patients without recurrence were censored at the time of last follow-up (later of last follow-up or date that medical records were reviewed) or at time of death (due to any cause). A secondary endpoint was 5-year KM BC death estimates and 95% CI. Patients with metastatic disease at the time of death were considered events; patients were censored at the time of last follow-up or death from other causes, and recurrences were ignored for purposes of this endpoint. Analysis was also performed on intermediate risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> subgroups (18&#x02013;25, 25&#x02013;30) and using TAILORx<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> RS categorization (&#x0003c;11 and 11&#x02013;25). The log-rank test was used to compare distant recurrence rates across RS groups. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate the association of RS group, age, size, and grade with distant recurrence. Univariate analysis identified a set of prognostic baseline factors, and a full multivariable model was fit. Non-significant covariates were removed from the final model. For sensitivity analysis, two sets of prognostic models were fit: one assessing fit with the three-category RS group, the other with continuous RS result. Proportional hazards assumptions were assessed and met in the final model. As sensitivity analysis, PS adjustments were performed to account for lack of randomization. SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used for the analysis. <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Data availability</title><p id="Par29">All relevant data are available upon request from the corresponding author.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec15"><p>
