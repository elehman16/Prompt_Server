aerobic exercise on senile osteoporosis. [Subjects and Methods] A total of 70 elderly
patients with osteoporosis, who treated at our hospital between April 2013 and August
2014, were divided into equal-sized observation and control groups. The control group was
administered raloxifene, whereas the observation group received raloxifene treatment plus
aerobic exercise. [Results] Outpatient outcomes were considered dependent variables. After
treatment, the two groups differed significantly in terms of lumbar spine (L2&#x02013;L4) and
proximal femoral bone mineral density. The urine pyridine/creatinine ratio decreased
significantly and serum calcitonin level increased significantly in the observation group.
These differences were statistically significant. [Conclusion] Raloxifene combined with
aerobic exercise therapy significantly improves bone density and promotes bone formation
in patients with senile osteoporosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Raloxifene</kwd><kwd>Aerobic exercise</kwd><kwd>Elderly</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Osteoporosis is a common metabolic disease in the elderly and is closely associated with
patient age. Its main signs are overall bone tissue density loss and structural fiber
changes. Recent studies have shown that an age-related decrease in intestinal calcium
absorption is closely related to senile osteoporosis and bone loss<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. A lack of exercise among the elderly is also an important
factor in promoting osteoporosis<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Here we
report on the beneficial effects of a combination of aerobic exercise and raloxifene therapy
for patients with senile osteoporosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study included 70 elderly patients with osteoporosis treated at our hospital between
April 2013 and August 2014. Patients with renal disease, liver disease, and secondary
osteoporosis; those who had not visited a doctor in 3 months; and those taking drugs known
to affect bone metabolism were excluded. Patients were divided into observation and control
groups according to the treatment received (n=35 for each group). The control group included
24 female and 11 male patients, with a mean age of 64.7 &#x000b1; 3.2&#x02005;years (range, 51&#x02013;76&#x02005;years).
The control group included 12 female and 23 male patients, with a mean age of 65.3 &#x000b1;
4.1&#x02005;years (range, 50&#x02013;78&#x02005;years). The two groups did not differ significantly with regard to
sex or age.</p><p>Both patient groups would normally be prescribed a chewable D2 calcium hydrogen phosphate
tablet (Guangxi Wuzhou Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd.; approval H45021454, 2010-09-20) once
per day. The control group patients were also prescribed 60&#x02005;mg raloxifene hydrochloride
(Spanish Eli Lilly Nederland B.V.; registration card number H20120499, 2012-11-29) once per
day. Patients in the observation group received the drug plus aerobic exercise. Patients
were offered choices among tai chi, walking, jogging, running, and sports. The exercise
intensity was advised to be based on patient tolerance. With increasing patient fitness, the
workout was gradually increased to a duration of approximately 30 minutes, distance of
approximately 3&#x02005;km, or tai chi duration of approximately 30 minutes<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>All patients were involved in the study for 6 months. Data were collected before and after
treatment. Data included: 1) bone mineral density measurements, including the lumbar spine
(L2&#x02013;L4 intervertebral) and proximal femur; 2) serum calcitonin levels measured using
commercial bone gla protein (BGP) kits (Metra, USA) based on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) method; and 3) urine pyridine/creatinine ratios (U-Pyd/Cr), with urine
pyridine and Cr measured using ELISA Pyd and a biochemical method, respectively (Metra,
USA).</p><p>In this study, the data were collected and processed by personnel of a specialized data
processing center to ensure authenticity and appropriate scientific technique<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Preliminary data were entered into Excel
(2003 version; Microsoft Inc., Seattle, WA, USA) for logic check and analysis. IBM SPSS
Statistics for Windows, version 22.0 (Armonk, NY, USA) was used to analyze bone mineral
density, resorption, and formation data using Student&#x02019;s t-test; values of p&#x0003c;0.05 were

mineral density and quality as well as microstructural damage. Increased osteopsathyrosis
results in easy bone fracture<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Osteoporosis can be
primary or secondary. Primary osteoporosis can be classified as postmenopausal (PMOP; type
I), senile (type II), or idiopathic (also seen in teenagers). PMOP typically occurs
5&#x02013;10&#x02005;years after menopause; senile osteoporosis generally refers to osteoporosis in older
men aged &#x0003e;70&#x02005;years; and idiopathic osteoporosis, while known to occur mainly in
adolescents, has unknown etiology. PMOP occurs mainly due to decreasing estrogen levels,
which increases bone conversion and absorption, causes trabecular bone perforation and
rupture, and increases osteopsathyrosis, with a loss of mainly cancellous bone<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Senile osteoporosis is associated with
oxidative stress; it is characterized by increased rheological bone loss and reduced bone
cell and osteoblast function. Bone loss and osteoblast function declines result in decreased
bone formation. Because osteoclast function is normal or reduced, bone resorption may not be
active; therefore, cortical bone loss is slightly greater than cancellous bone loss.</p><p>Senile osteoporosis has direct reference to the age of patients with primary osteoporosis,
who may have various types of osteoporosis concurrently<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. For example, a female osteoporosis patient who is 65&#x02005;years of age
may have idiopathic osteoporosis or PMOP based on age, previous treatment for postmenopausal
osteoporosis, and bone transformation condition. If osteoporosis had previously been under
control, senile osteoporosis would be the most likely diagnosis or at least given priority.
Similarly, a single male patient &#x0003e;65&#x02005;years with senile osteoporosis may have a history of
cured idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis.</p><p>Osteoporosis is a common chronic disease, ranking sixth among causes of morbidity and
mortality in the elderly<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Osteoporosis-related fracture outranked the incidence of stroke, heart attack, and all
breast cancers from 2004 to 2006. A woman&#x02019;s lifetime risk of osteoporotic fracture is higher
than that of breast cancer, endometrial cancer, and ovarian cancer combined. In men, the
risk of osteoporotic fracture is greater than the risk of prostate cancer. As this is a
common and dangerous disease in the elderly, clinicians should attach great importance to
the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis. Additionally, poor treatment adherence over
time is a universal problem. Therefore, clinicians should strive for early screening,
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.</p><p>The ultimate goals of osteoporosis prevention and treatment are to reduce the occurrence of
osteoporosis fracture and improve quality of life in the elderly. However, doctor and
patient awareness of osteoporosis degree are insufficient, as bone hydrophobic pine disease
is underdiagnosed, treatment rates are low, and adequate treatment is often not completed.
Additionally, osteoporosis fracture is correlated with no prior treatment for
osteoporosis<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. This is a common
problem worldwide. A retrospective study in the United States reported 300 fractures in
&#x0003e;50 women, more than half of whom did not receive anti-osteoporosis treatment. A women&#x02019;s
community survey of another 60 patients with &#x0003e;165 recent hip fractures found that only
13% of patients received sufficient osteoporosis treatment in accordance with the guidelines
of the International Osteoporosis Foundation: 47% of women were insufficiently treated and
40% received no treatment. Assessment of male osteoporosis patients after fracture revealed
a lower probability of prior osteoporosis treatment.</p><p>Current clinical research on osteoporosis treatments tends to compare the curative effects
of single drugs and observe the effects of drug treatments combined with aerobic exercise.
The Diagnosis and Treatment of Primary Osteoporosis Guide (2011), from a branch of the
Chinese Medical Association of Osteoporosis and Bone Mineral Salt Disease, advises against
treating osteoporosis simultaneously with bone formation promoters and bone resorption
inhibitors that use the same mechanism of action<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, existing studies have shown that compared with the use of
a single drug, a combination of two kinds of bone resorption inhibitors can significantly
improve bone absorption, which in turn significantly increases bone mineral density<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. A complementary decrease in fracture
risk, however, is yet to be confirmed.</p><p>Raloxifene belongs to a category of selective estrogen regulators that interfere with some
aspects of estrogen activity and thereby simulate other functions. Raloxifene is rapidly
absorbed after oral ingestion. The minimum concentration is 60%; it has a bioavailability of
2% and a plasma half-life of approximately 27.7 hours<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. A number of clinical studies have shown that raloxifene has an
obvious preventive effect on postmenopausal osteoporosis since it can supplement estrogen
levels in patients to improve bone density<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The current study shows that raloxifene treatment well before the
bone mineral density in the treatment of patients with L2&#x02013;L4 (0.78&#x02013;0.08) for
g/m<sup>2</sup>, after treatment for (0.83 + 0.10&#x02005;g/m<sup>2</sup>, change obviously before
and after treatment. Previous research has demonstrated the curative effects of raloxifene
for the treatment of senile osteoporosis, which resulted in improved patient bone density.
Always study, human bones but as sport and adaptability to changes<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Aerobic exercise, also referred to as green therapy, can
achieve results beyond what drug treatment alone can achieve. Regular, systemic, and
feasible aerobic exercise can maintain nerve cell integrity and accelerate lipid metabolism.
Long-term regular aerobic exercise can reduce the incidence of viscera-related diseases and
improve physical and mental health in the elderly<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the current study, the observation and control groups differed significantly in lumbar
spine and femoral bone mineral density levels after treatment (p&#x0003c;0.05). These results
confirmed that combined treatment with raloxifene and aerobic exercise can significantly
improve bone mineral density in patients with senile osteoporosis. As shown in <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2, U</xref>-Pyd/Cr differed significantly between the
two groups (p&#x0003c;0.01), while BGP measurements in the observation group were significantly
higher than those in the control group (p&#x0003c;0.01). These findings confirmed that raloxifene
and aerobic exercise combined can reduce bone absorption rate and promote bone
formation.</p><p>In conclusion, a combination of raloxifene and aerobic exercise in patients with senile
osteoporosis can significantly improve bone mineral density and promote physical and mental
health. This combination is worth further study and widespread use in clinical settings.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Lampropoulos</surname><given-names>CE</given-names></name><name><surname>Papaioannou</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>D&#x02019;Cruz</surname><given-names>DP</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Osteoporosis&#x02014;a risk factor for cardiovascular
