However, when results from day rehabilitation programmes were compared with outpatient or home rehabilitation services, the outcomes were largely similar.</p><p>The merits of day hospitals have been debated, but with rapidly rising demands for rehabilitation services, day hospitals remain an attractive proposition because they allow high numbers of patients to be seen in surroundings which facilitate the delivery of rehabilitation (e.g. gyms, hydrotherapy pools) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. They offer the prospect of easy access to on-site medical staff, a higher dose of therapy which is increasingly thought to be associated with better functional outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and opportunities for social interaction which may be important. Against this, strong evidence supporting home rehabilitation programmes continues to emerge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Following the allocation of funds for a day rehabilitation service for our region, we elected compare approaches for patients discharged from hospital and referred for ambulatory rehabilitation. We compared a hospital-based day rehabilitation centre based on hospital grounds with a home rehabilitation programme on patient instrumental activities of daily living, re-hospitalisation rates and transfer to residential care facility rates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S2a"><title>Setting and participants</title><p>This study took place in three public hospitals in southern Adelaide, Australia. Between 22 June 2005 and 19 June 2006, patients referred for ambulatory rehabilitation at the end of a hospital stay were approached to participate. Very limited outpatient or community therapy is available in southern Adelaide and so high rates of consent were anticipated. Patients were eligible if they were medically stable, ready for hospital discharge and there were rehabilitation goals that required at least 12 therapy sessions as determined by the rehabilitation triage nurse. They were ineligible if they lived out of the health region or if the referring clinician felt they were unsuitable to receive one of the two programmes.</p></sec><sec id="S2b"><title>Recruitment and randomisation</title><p>Once baseline assessments were complete, participants were randomly allocated within 24&#x02009;h to receive their rehabilitation either at home or day hospital. Allocations were computer-generated, stratified by condition at presentation (orthopaedic, stroke, or other) and randomised in blocks of 12. The allocation ratio was 1&#x02009;: 1 (intervention&#x02009;: control). Discharge into the programme occurred within 48&#x02009;h.</p><p>A statistician external to the study generated the randomisation sequence using the random number generator in Microsoft Excel and created sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes containing group allocation for participants. The trial nurse enrolled the participants, and a pharmacist who managed the randomisation allocation assigned participants to the groups. Block size remained unknown to staff.</p><p>The ethics committees at Repatriation General Hospital, Flinders Medical Centre and Noarlunga Health Services approved the study.</p></sec><sec id="S2c"><title>Day hospital (intervention)</title><p>A day rehabilitation programme where patients were transported three to five times per week to the hospital was established. Transport costs to and from hospital were covered by the programme. Patients entered an interdisciplinary programme, providing 4&#x02013;6&#x02009;weeks of high-intensity rehabilitation in either individual or group sessions with the option of extending the programme. Each visit lasted 3&#x02009;h and carers did not usually accompany patients. An education session was available for carers.</p></sec><sec id="S2d"><title>Home rehabilitation (control)</title><p>A home-based one-on-one rehabilitation programme was delivered by a separate interdisciplinary team with three to five sessions per week.</p><p>Both programmes were based on a medical rehabilitation model that included goal setting, early multidisciplinary assessment and weekly case conferences. Length of stay in rehabilitation was not standardised but was dictated by the clinicians based on the achievement of agreed goals, separate from the researchers, and was usually 4 to 6&#x02009;weeks. Therapy sessions involved physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, social work, psychology, dietetics, nursing and access to a rehabilitation medicine physician. The same doctor provided medical services to both groups. Referrals from both groups were made to community services for equipment, self care and domestic supports, as required.</p></sec><sec id="S2e"><title>Sample size</title><p>The primary outcome was the change in the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] instrument from randomisation to 3&#x02009;month follow-up measured for each individual. The AMPS is an observational measure of functional competence in activities of daily living allowing simultaneous assessment of motor and process skills necessary for competent performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The AMPS is assessed by an occupational therapist trained in AMPS assessment and activities of daily livings (ADLs) are selected for each individual that pose some degree of difficulty. A logit score is given for the motor and the process component of the assessment (range from &#x02212;3 to 4). Using previous AMPS data for persons aged 60&#x02009;years or more with stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], 60 participants per group were required to detect a clinically significant change of 0.5 on the AMPS logit scale (power 80%, &#x003b1; 0.05). We increased the sample size to allow for the stratification and for 25% attrition.</p></sec><sec id="S2f"><title>Baseline assessment</title><p>The information collected included socio-demographic variables, co-morbid conditions, medications, admission diagnosis, duration of hospital stay, level of cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]), functional status (Modified Barthel Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]), timed up and go (TUG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]), maximal quadriceps strength, AMPS, depression (Geriatric Depression Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]) and quality of life [Short-Form-36 (SF-36)] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]).</p><p>Programme information including number and type of services received during the programme was collected. Information was also collected from carers including quality of life (SF-36) and carer stress (Caregiver Strain Index (CSI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]) on discharge from the programme.</p></sec><sec id="S2g"><title>Follow-up</title><p>Three months after randomisation, a research occupational therapist blinded to allocation visited participants at home. The follow-up data collection included AMPS, TUG, SF-36, maximal quadriceps strength, place of residence and mortality. Data collected from carers at 3&#x02009;months included the CSI and SF-36.</p><p>The functional independence measure (FIM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]) at baseline and discharge from both programmes was performed by the clinical team which was not blinded to the allocation of participants.</p><p>Readmissions to hospital within 6&#x02009;months of the baseline admission were collected over the phone from the participant or their proxy. Public hospital admissions and length of stay were confirmed by searches of the public hospitals' database matching patient's name, date of birth and admission date for each patient. Place of admission and mortality were also collected. An independent geriatrician reviewed the readmissions.</p></sec><sec id="S2h"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Intention-to-treat analyses were performed by a statistician blinded to allocation group. Means and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for normally distributed continuous variables, and medians and 95% CIs were calculated for continuous variables with a skewed distribution. Independent sample <italic>t</italic> tests or Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-tests were used to assess continuous variables. For categorical variables, chi-square tests of association or Fisher's exact test were used to test for differences between groups. Poisson regression models were fitted to the number of readmissions. A Cox proportional hazards model was fitted, taking time-to-first readmission as the response variable. The time to first readmission was censored at 91&#x02009;days for the 165 participants who were not readmitted.</p><p>Analyses were carried out using SPSS for Windows 12.0 and Stata version 9.0.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Declaration of Sources of Funding</title><p>This study was funded by the South Australian Department of Health.

In relation to the index hospitalisation, 53 (82.9%) of the readmissions in the day hospital group and 23 (67.7%). of the readmission in the home rehabilitation group were considered to be either probably related or possibly related to the index admission.

There was no significant interaction between the groups and age group, gender, marital status or carer status with respect to time to first readmission.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S5"><title>Discussion</title><p>Patients in home rehabilitation and day hospital programmes achieved functional gains and few transfers to residential care. A systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] including trials which compared day hospital rehabilitation with domiciliary care reported that the outcomes achieved were similar for both groups in terms of death or institutional care, or deterioration in activities of daily living. The major difference in our trial was in the utilisation of health services. Participants allocated to day hospital recorded a length of stay some 50&#x02009;days longer (78 versus 28&#x02009;days) and received on average 44 more therapy sessions (68 versus 24) than patients who received home rehabilitation. Furthermore, we showed that when patients entered day hospital they were twice as likely to be readmitted to hospital as those patients who received their rehabilitation at home.</p><p>It was expected that the easy access to medical staff associated with the day hospital would prevent readmission rather than promote it. However, it may be that the on-site medical staff and the proximity to the Emergency Department facilitated readmission and promoted a focus on medical issues. While these may be local effects, the entry criteria for this trial allowed the assessment of a population comparable to that treated by many clinical services. It is possible that the delivery of rehabilitation in a home environment is protective and addresses important but poorly understood issues such as mastery and self-management.</p><p>In this trial, the programmes (therapy dose, length of stay or therapy mix) were not prescribed but left to the clinicians' assessment. Day hospital rehabilitation was a new programme and while the provision of patient transport allowed higher levels of direct patient contact time with staff, it also appears to have encouraged longer patient programmes and more frequent therapy sessions. There was no evidence that the increased levels of therapy in day hospital or the better access to gyms, specialist equipment and hydrotherapy produced better outcomes at 3 or 6&#x02009;months. Although there is work suggesting that increased doses of therapy produce improved clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], our results imply that in a real-life environment with a group of reasonably unselected post-hospital patients, the functional effects of an ambulatory programme can be achieved with smaller doses of treatment.</p><p>A number of limitations should be considered in interpreting the results of this study. The population was heterogeneous with a wide range of conditions and ages and the sample was small. Both groups received active care and there was no non-treatment control group that limits our ability to comment on the significance of the improvements in functional outcomes. A non-treatment control group may also have revealed a high background readmission rate among these patients who are often on the cusp of frailty. The study did not include information on costs, which limits comparisons. The patients of the day hospital group received more therapy during their programme, and were readmitted to hospital earlier, suggesting a higher cost; however, no information was collected on issues such as drug adjustments which may have offset these costs. Day rehabilitation programmes can be important in communities where primary care is difficult for older people to access and can offer more than physical rehabilitation, addressing medication management as well as providing social support. Finally, identifying appropriate outcomes for ambulatory rehabilitation trials remains a challenge. Limited qualitative measures were included in this study and there is some evidence suggesting that questionnaires do not adequately measure outcomes of individuals with chronic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Programmes that include a component of self-reflection such as rehabilitation may lead individuals to re-evaluate their health status prior to the programme as better or worse. This response shift is poorly understood in rehabilitation studies but could confound assessments of quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><sec id="S5a"><title>Implications of results</title><p>Despite providing less therapy, the home rehabilitation programme achieved similar functional gains with a lower risk of readmission. With shorter hospital admissions and the increasing reliance on hospital substitution programmes to address functional recovery in older people, prevention of readmission is an important service goal. Day hospital programmes that involve increased therapy time and easy access to medical staff may increase the rate of readmission to hospital during the programme in comparison to home-based rehabilitation. Although this is a small trial, our results suggest that health services should prioritise providing patients with access to home rehabilitation ahead of day hospital programmes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Key points</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>As acute demand for hospital beds increases, rehabilitation is increasingly offered in ambulatory settings&#x02013;either day programmes or home programmes without information on the relative merits of each.</p></list-item><list-item><p>At 3&#x02009;months, similar outcomes were achieved for recently hospitalised patients in both programmes in terms of function and quality of life; however, the day hospital rehabilitation programme required more resources in terms of length of stay in the programme and the number of therapy sessions.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients in the day hospital programme were more likely to be readmitted to hospital and their carers reported higher levels of strain at the end of the programme.</p></list-item></list></sec></body><back><sec id="S7"><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p>All authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest to declare.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Funding</title><p>This study was funded by a grant from the South Australian Department of Health.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Details of informed consent</title><p>Patients deemed suitable for ambulatory rehabilitation by their treating clinician were referred to the ambulatory rehabilitation triage nurse.
