current stimulation (tDCS) on visual perception and performance of activities of daily
living in patients with stroke. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty subjects were assigned
equally to a tDCS plus traditional occupational therapy group (experimental group) and a
traditional occupational therapy group (control group). The intervention was implemented
five times per week, 30 minutes each, for six weeks. In order to assess visual perception
function before and after the intervention, the motor-free visual perception test (MVPT)
was conducted, and in order to compare the performance of activities of daily living, the
Functional Independence Measure scale was employed. [Results] According to the results,
both groups improved in visual perception function and in performance of activities of
daily living. Although there was no significant difference between the two groups, the
experimental group exhibited higher scores. [Conclusion] In conclusion, the application of
tDCS for the rehabilitation of patients with stroke may positively affect their visual
perception and ability to perform activities of daily living.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)</kwd><kwd>Visual perception</kwd><kwd>Activities of daily living</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Patients with stroke experience overall degradation in visual perception and activities of
daily living (ADLs). In particular, damage to visual perception makes it difficult for
patients with stroke to perform ADLs due to unilateral neglect and damage to spatial
perception abilities. For example, difficulties with dressing, hygiene, and other
independent daily living activities, as well as the ability to learn new activities, have a
significant impact on patient rehabilitation<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In order to improve visual perception and the performance of ADLs
for patients with stroke, plasticity of the brain needs to be supported. As a method to
improve plasticity, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been suggested. tDCS
is used to stimulate the cerebral cortex directly, in order to control the activities of the
cortex. tDCS can impact the function of a specific neural structure and augment treatment
effects during the rehabilitation process through brain stimulation<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Since tDCS is highly portable and safe, as well as
economical, it can be used conveniently for the purposes of research and treatment<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies have reported that
providing tDCS to patients with stroke can help increase hand function, balance, and motor
function in addition to improvements in cognition, such as executive function,
concentration, short-term memory, and a reduction in depression<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, few studies have
been conducted on the effect of tDCS on visual perception and performance of ADLs, which are
important indices for improvement in the rehabilitation of patients with stroke. Thus, this
study aims to determine the effect of tDCS on visual perception and performance of ADLs when
applied to the affected side of patients with stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted for six weeks in patients with stroke who were diagnosed by
computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at M Rehabilitation Hospital in
Busan from January 2015 to November 2015. This study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board at Kaya University (Kaya IRB-115). Subjects participated in this study after
obtaining an understanding of the purpose of the study and providing written consent, in
accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, good clinical
practices, and the applicable laws and regulations. A total of 30 subjects were selected
based on the hospitalization date and were divided into the experimental group (15 subjects)
and control group (15 subjects) randomly. For the experimental group, traditional
occupational therapy treatment and tDCS were applied. For the control group, traditional
occupational therapy and sham tDCS were applied. Prior to applying the treatment
intervention for the two groups, the visual perception abilities of each subject were
evaluated using the motor-free visual perception test (MVPT) and ADL performance was
evaluated using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scale to test homogeneity.</p><p>tDCS was applied by attaching sponge electrodes (4 &#x000d7; 6&#x02005;cm) that were soaked in saline to
the scalp. A current generator, the Phoresor<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> PM 850 (Phoresor<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> II
Auto Model No. PM 850, IOMED, Inc., Salt Lake City, USA) was used, which generates direct
current using a battery. It is certified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is
available commercially. In order to stimulate the occipital lobe, in accordance with the
guidelines of the international electroencephalography system, the anode was attached to C3
(central 3) and the cathode was fixed to the required stimulation area by winding a strap
around the supraorbital area. A current of 1 mA was applied for 20&#x02005;min<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the control group, electrodes were applied to the same
location for the same length of time as above, but the current was discontinued after 30 s.
Subjects in the control group were unaware of this until the test was completed.</p><p>To compare the general characteristics of the study subjects, frequency analysis was used.
A paired t-test was conducted to compare the results of the MVPT and FIM scores before and
after the intervention. For data analysis, SPSS 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used.
The significance level was set to p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The experimental group had ten males and five females and the control group had nine males

occupational therapy simultaneously exhibited greater improvements in visual perception and
ADL performance than the group receiving traditional occupational therapy only, although no
significant difference was shown between the two groups. Through a number of previous
studies, the effects of tDCS have been presented. According to one study, when tDCS was
applied to normal healthy subjects, visual perception improved. tDCS was applied over the
primary visual cortex for 50&#x02005;min in 31 normal healthy adults, after which a two-alternative
forced choice (2AFC) task was performed, with evidence of an increased accuracy rate for the
task following the application of anodal tDCS<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Similarly, in a study by Kraft et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, investigators applied tDCS to 12 healthy subjects over
the visual cortex for 15&#x02005;min per day for one week and reported that subjects demonstrated
improved perceptual learning upon testing<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Basically, tDCS has a positive effect on visual perception in
normal healthy adults as well as in patients with stroke. In particular, stimulation of the
visual area, which is related to visual perception, plays an important role. Along with the
above study results, a study of tDCS in patients with brain damage showed that tDCS, applied
twice over the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) on the right side for 20&#x02005;min, reduced the
tendency for unilateral neglect on cancellation and bisection tests in 15 patients with
stroke with unilateral neglect<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a
single case study, tDCS was applied over the occipital lobe for 30&#x02005;min per day for three
months in a 61-year-old patient with stroke and hemianopsia, resulting in changes in the
peri-lesional visual area along with changes in activity on functional MRI<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The application of tDCS can affect not only visual perception but also ADL performance. A
study on rehabilitation treatment in parallel with tDCS, applied to 14 patients with stroke,
showed that the experimental group, to which tDCS was applied for 10&#x02005;min, five times a week,
for two weeks over the primary motor cortex area, improved in physical function (upper and
lower extremity function and balance) and ADL performance<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. A study showed that the experimental group, receiving tDCS over
the primary sensorimotor cortex for 20&#x02005;min, five times a week, for four weeks along with
physiotherapy, improved on the Barthel Index, a measurement tool for ADLs, by 20 points more
than the control group<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of
these studies are consistent with the results of the present study, in which tDCS and
traditional occupational therapy were conducted simultaneously to determine the impact on
visual perception and ADL performance.</p><p>In the present study, both the experimental group and control group exhibited a significant
difference in visual perception and ADL performance after the intervention, although the
experimental group, which received tDCS, demonstrated a greater change than the control
group, which received only traditional occupational therapy. These results indicate that
although traditional occupational therapy can also have a positive impact on visual
perception and ADL performance, greater positive effects can be obtained by applying tDCS in
parallel.</p><p>Despite the above study results, this study has a limitation. The study contained a small
number of subjects, if the study was powered by a larger sample size, it would be the
possibility of seeing significant differences between the groups. Therefore, a larger study
involving more subjects should be conducted in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Grider</surname><given-names>SL</given-names></name><name><surname>Yuen</surname><given-names>HK</given-names></name><name><surname>Vogtle</surname><given-names>LK</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Visual concerns that interfere with daily activities in
