Almost 5&#x02013;65% of patients suffer from this complication post general anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] General anesthesia and surgery cause several physiological disorders in different organs of the patients that may appear as several complications during recovery, which need to be identified and evaluated. One of these complications is shivering; it occurs at a frequency of around 22% in Iran.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Most anesthetic drugs such as propofol (in general anesthesia) impair the thermoregulation system and cause postoperative shivering.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Postoperative shivering, which is easily diagnosed, involves movements and involuntary contractions over which patients have no control.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Hypothermia is known as one of the major risk factors influencing postoperative shivering.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] There are many risk factors related to the development of hypothermia, including aging, female gender, type of surgery, length of anesthesia, operating room temperature, patient's low weight, and history of infusion of cool fluids.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Shivering leads to an increase in catecholamine releaseICP (intracranial pressure), IOP(intraocular pressure), oxygen consumption, tachycardia, hypertension, metabolic acidosis, coagulation disorders, disorder in the body's nitrogen balance, changes in drug effects, increased postoperative pain, and discomfort for the patient.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Manouchehri Pour and Jabbari Moghadam (2007) believe that patients who undergo major surgical procedures will experience more shivering, and their study on the effect of duration of anesthesia on the incidence of shivering showed that in a surgery of 3 h duration, shivering would increase by 50%.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] One of the analgesic drugs used commonly to treat shivering is pethidine.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] It is well-known that pethidine has several side effects such as respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, and tachycardia.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Due to the complications of pethidine, finding alternative ways to treat postoperative shivering has always been under consideration.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Although pharmacological treatments are commonly used to reduce shivering, non-pharmacological methods can also be used.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Non-pharmacological methods include preventing hypothermia by using blankets, humid-warm oxygen inhalation, intravenous fluids, and forced air warmer.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Humid-warm oxygen inhalation can help prevent some effects such as epistaxis, mucosa dryness, and thick secretion which are difficult to eliminate, as well as cough in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Besides, it can help prevent hypothermia and shivering.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Intravenous warm fluids can also help in treating hypothermia and postoperative shivering.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Chung <italic>et al</italic>. (2012) showed in their study that in the group treated with infusion of warm fluids, the core temperature was higher and the incidence of shivering was low.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Although preventive measures are taken to stop shivering in the operation room, the incidence of involuntary shivering is high in the recovery room.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In the present study, the effects of non-pharmacological methods including intravenous fluids and combined warming (intravenous fluids and humid-warm oxygen inhalation) were compared with those pethidine on the severity of postoperative shivering in patients undergoing abdominal surgery under general anesthesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>The present study was registered in IRCT with the code 2014012016278N1. This double-blind clinical trial was performed with 87 patients who were candidates for abdominal surgery under general anesthesia in the Emam Reza hospital in Birjand from June to September 2014. To begin with, the goal and method of the study were explained to the patients and written consents were obtained from them in accordance with ethical considerations; then they were randomly assigned to three groups including two intervention groups and a pethidine group as routine treatment. The elapsed time of shivering and some hemodynamic parameters (pulse, blood pressure, arterial blood oxygen saturation, temperature) of the participants were assessed for 20 min postoperatively at three time intervals (0, 10, and 20 min after entry to the recovery room).[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] All patients were covered with a normal bed room blanket after the operation in the recovery room. In the recovery room, the presence or absence of shivering was assessed and recorded in the three groups based on the following four-point scale:</p><p>

Maintenance of anesthesia in all patients was performed with 150 &#x003bc;g/kg/min propofol and 0.2 mg/kg atracurium every 30 min and 1 &#x003bc;g/kg fentanyl later at 1.5 h for not feeling pain. All patients received 7 ml/kg Ringer serum at room temperature. Body temperature and recovery temperature, and humidity were measured and recorded using tympanic infrared thermometer (Beurer Medical FT60, ULM, Germany) and wall thermometer (Beurer Medical TFA, Wertheim, Germany). The Manitoring device was manufactured in Iran.</p><p>Data collection tool consisted of a questionnaire to record patients&#x02019; demographic information and a checklist of the recorded postoperative parameters. Validity of the information recording form was confirmed by content validity through references and guides of university professors. Reliability of the measurement tools was confirmed by careful measurement and confirmation of their calibration and sensitivity. The devices (thermometers and monitoring) were calibrated, while their specificity and sensitivity had been determined by the manufacturing company and the medical technologist engineer in the related hospital. The research colleague filling the forms of data record and the subjects were blinded to the study to increase the validity of the data. Upon arrival to the recovery room, the degree of shivering of patients who experienced shivering was first determined; then the patients were randomly assigned to one of three study groups. In this study, the letter A, B, and C were typed on 87 cards in equal numbers. Letter A represented the pethidine group, letter B the intravenous warm serum group, and letter C represented the combined warm group. When patients meeting inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study, the colleague nurse removed one card from the box, based on which the patient entered the respective group. The logged card was not put back in the box anymore. After the data were collected, they were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA), analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test, repeated ANOVA test, least significant difference (LSD) test, Friedman test, Wilcoxon test, Tukey test, Mann&#x02013;Whitney U test, and repeated measurements through SPSS version 18.

In our study, the non-pharmacological methods included warmed intravenous fluids and combined warming (warmed intravenous fluids with humid-warm oxygen), which were compared with pharmacological method (pethidine as routine treatment). The mean elapsed time of pethidine group was 2.8 (0.7) min. This finding is in line with that of Emadi <italic>et al</italic>., who compared the effects of pethidine and tramadol on postoperative shivering in general anesthesia and showed that pethidine can control shivering within 3.5 min.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Also, Zamiri <italic>et al</italic>. compared the effects of intravenous pethidine and clonidine in the treatment of postoperative shivering and recorded the elapsed time of pethidine to be 2.4 min.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Some studies evaluated the effect of warm-humid oxygen on hypothermia and postoperative shivering. Steven Frank <italic>et al</italic>. studied the effect of humid-warm oxygen on body temperature in the recovery room and reported that this method can increase the body temperature and decrease the shivering incidence.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] These findings are consistent with our findings indicating the positive effect of humid-warm oxygen inhalation in preventing shivering. In the present study, humid-warm oxygen inhalation could stop shivering within 6 (1.5) min and could increase the body temperature. Some studies also evaluated the effect of warm intravenous serum on hypothermia and postoperative shivering. A study by Camus <italic>et al</italic>. considered the effects of warm intravenous fluids on intraoperative hypothermia and postoperative shivering during prolonged abdominal surgery and showed that this method combined with skin surface warming could reduce the incidence of postoperative shivering significantly.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Also, Xu <italic>et al</italic>. studied the effect of warm intravenous serum on shivering in abdominal surgery and reported that the method could increase the body temperature and decrease the shivering incidence significantly.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] However, our study results did not show significant increase in body temperature at three intervention time intervals in the warm intravenous group. Oshvandi <italic>et al</italic>. studied the effect of warm intravenous serum on postoperative shivering and showed the incidence of shivering to be 13% in the intervention group and 35% in the control group, which means that shivering incidence in patients who received warm serum infusion was almost one-third of that in the control group.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Our results showed that postoperative warm intravenous serum usage can control shivering at 7 (1.5) min, but using a combined warming can control shivering at 6 (1.5) min, and differences between the two intervention groups were significant. The body temperature in the combined warming group showed significant increase at the three time intervals, implying that combined warming is more effective than warm intravenous fluids on postoperative shivering in the recovery room and is therefore suggested.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Considering the elapsed time and the increase of body temperature in the combined warming group, this method can be suggested in patients undergoing abdominal surgery with grades 2 and 3 of shivering. It can be concluded that application of the convenient, easy, and low-cost method of warm-humid oxygen can be helpful in treating postoperative shivering resulting from general anesthesia in abdominal surgery. Using this method to control shivering can also prevent the complications of analgesic. Combined warming (warm intravenous fluids and warm-humid oxygen) can be effective in controlling postoperative shivering and in increasing the body temperature, and is therefore suggested.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
