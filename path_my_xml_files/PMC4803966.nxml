Introduction</title><p>De Brardis (2014) in his studies entitled &#x0201c;Psychopathology, emotional aspects and psychological counseling in infertility: A review&#x0201d; demonstrated that infertility affects around 80 million people around the world and it has been estimated that psychological problems in infertile couples is within the range of 25-60%. Depression and anxiety in infertile couples is considerably higher than fertile ones and the mental effect of this issue is higher in females compared to males. Psychological consultation can be a useful aid. A study performed by <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Tao (2012)</xref> revealed that male-based infertility has no negative contribution to marital factors. Moreover, infertile male participants expressed higher marital satisfaction from their wives, while females feel their marital relationship less stable and these factors include sexual satisfaction, age of couple, educational level and life quality. Results of various studies demonstrates that mental factors such as depression or anxiety can be a thread for outcome of treating infertility and By improving mental health, psychological treatments together with infertility treatment o effectiveness of infertility treatments, encourage the infertile person to follow up the treatment as well (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Shahrestani et al., 2012</xref>). Treatment recognition is defined based on the consciousness of someone regarding treatment process whose emphasis is over actively attending emotions and instantaneous thoughts of the patient without judging or evaluating that thought or feeling. After attention accompanied with consciousness, patient enters a strengthening situation made by him/herself and this trend finally leads to matching and improvement of thoughts and totally the quality of life (Younesi et al., 2008). In a study performed by <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Shahrestani et al. (2012)</xref> entitled effectiveness of group cognition therapy based on the consciousness in improvement of perceived stress dimensions and illogical cognitions in infertile women under IVF treatment, results demonstrated that cognition therapy based on consciousness is effective in improvement of illogical cognitions of parents and perceived stress of infertile women under IVF treatment. Results of Fili et al. (2012) corresponding to comparison of effectiveness of behavioral cognitions therapy and cognition therapy based on consciousness, revealed that by treatment methods can reduce rumination of infertile women. In a research performed by <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Galhardo et al. (2013)</xref>, results demonstrated that women participating in Mindfulness plans based on plans until its end, showed a meaningful decrease in depression, exterior and interior shame, being trapped and failure. Furthermore, they had a considerable statistical improvement in concentration skills and self-efficiency in confronting infertility, in control group, there was no significant changes in psychological action except reduction of self-judgment. The purpose of this study was to the effectiveness of Mindfulness-based cognitive group therapy on Mindfulness regarding marital satisfaction and general health in woman with infertility.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>2.

Discussion and Conclusion</title><p>Results of MBCT treatment in infertile women revealed that this method has an appropriate contribution to improvement of marital satisfaction which was compatible with similar works. Stress of infertility is correlated to the reduction of marital satisfaction (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Gana et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Rockliff et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Mosalanejad et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Cserepes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Tao et al., 2012</xref>). Mindfulness is sometimes related to romantic relations (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Barnes et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, infertility consultation improves sexual and marital satisfaction in infertile couples (Vizheh et al., 2013). There is a positive relationship between Mindfulness and marital satisfaction and Mindfulness skills may lead to marital satisfaction (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">OmidBeiki et al., 2014</xref>). <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Carson et al. (2004)</xref> showed that Mindfulness treatment improves marital satisfaction. It must be noted that this compatibility may be the result of MBCT treatment characteristics since with regard to MBCT, it is always implied that this strategy is appropriate for those who are depressed, anxious or are not martially satisfied. In study of the second hypothesis, research findings revealed that women treated by MBCT, have meaningfully different mental health from those who are not treated by this treatment method. This means that MCBT treatment is effective in improving mental health of infertile women of Zahedan. This results are in agreement with that of <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Galhardo et al. (2013)</xref>, <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Shahrestani et al. (2012)</xref>, and Fili et al. (2012). Infertility is one of the factors which lead to lower mental health (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Hasanpour et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Baghianimoghadam et al. 2013</xref>; Ahmadi Forooshany et al., 2012; <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Peterson et al., 2003</xref>). <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Sherratt et al., (2013)</xref> showed that MBCT treatment is effective in reducing infertility-related psychological problems and will result in higher wellbeing scores and psychological distress. Research shows that Mindfulness leads to improvement of mental health (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Pots et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Tran et al., 2014</xref>; Caldwell et al., 2014). In explaining the reason of the effectiveness of MCBT in improving psychological health of infertile women, it can be said that one of the factors resulting in reduction of mental health of infertile women, is daily life stresses and social pressures. Therefore, it seems that MBCT can help people recognize situations which lead to stress and sadness and apply MBCT strategies to confront them. Another explanation for the effectiveness of the aforesaid interference is mental support which leads to the change of vision of infertile women toward themselves. They no longer feel loneliness nor consider their problem as unique and get an environment in which they are able to address their feelings and problems.</p><p>Researches prove the mental inconveniences such as anxiety, depression and mental disturbances. Necessary trainings for infertile people through consultation services can improve their mental health and marital satisfaction and significantly help reducing infertile couples&#x02019; problems. In fact, the MBCT exercises seem to be effective in the cognitive system and information processing as people become more aware of the present time through techniques such as paying attention to breathing and body and concentrating on here and now. A widespread application of this technique is therefore recommended, given that this type of education is effective and this technique is beneficial in the considered domains. Based on the findings of the present study and considering the effectiveness of MBCT training, a continuous MBCT usage can be suggested to improve the participants&#x02019; life and reduce their problems.</p><p>Marital satisfaction is a variable influenced by the characteristics of both men and women. Due to men's lack of cooperation and sometimes not being accompanied by women, only the female sample was used. It is suggested that their husbands also be studied by coordinating the families better in future studies. Some other studies are also suggested to be performed on samples with different types of infertility dividing them according to their gender, and study the effect of demographic variables such as age, education, income, and job on infertility levels and types of problems caused by it.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study is a part of a master thesis whith 82/k number which had been done at the Zahedan University of Medical Sciences.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest</bold></p><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest in this study.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ahmadi Forooshany</surname><given-names>S.
