Thus, it is crucial to identify early markers of treatment efficacy. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, a technique that uses radioactively labeled glucose 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG), has been used for the study of cancer, as both a diagnostic tool and, increasingly, as a measure of tumor response to treatment [<xref rid="MDW020C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MDW020C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Compared with conventional radiographic means of gauging tumor response based on diameter, metabolic response by PET may represent a more functional measure of tumor response or progression by directly assessing the degree of metabolic activity [<xref rid="MDW020C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="MDW020C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Tumor response measured by computed tomography (CT) scan has been shown to predict patient survival in metastatic solid tumors [<xref rid="MDW020C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and PET may serve as a complement or improvement in this regard or as a surrogate modality if CT is contraindicated. For example, a change from baseline in the tumor uptake of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG during treatment may be a predictive marker of survival in gastric cancer [<xref rid="MDW020C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although PET imaging has been validated as a marker of therapeutic efficacy in some cancers, such as lymphoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, and melanoma [<xref rid="MDW020C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="MDW020C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="MDW020C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MDW020C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the potential of PET as a marker of efficacy in pancreatic cancer is still under investigation. However, recent results confirm that pancreatic lesions do take up <sup>18</sup>F-FDG (i.e. PET-avid) and can be imaged using PET technology [<xref rid="MDW020C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The correlation between metabolic response and efficacy was evaluated in a phase I/II trial in which patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer were treated with <italic>nab</italic>-paclitaxel (<italic>nab</italic>-P) plus gemcitabine (Gem) [<xref rid="MDW020C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Patients who were treated at the maximum tolerated dose of 125 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 44) demonstrated an overall response rate [ORR; by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0] of 48% and a median overall survival (OS) of 12.2 months [<xref rid="MDW020C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

The median SUV<sub>max</sub> (4.6 and 4.5 in the <italic>nab</italic>-P + Gem and Gem-alone arms, respectively) and high percentage of patients with &#x02265;3 PET-avid lesions at baseline (74%) demonstrate that PET imaging is feasible for response evaluation in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, metabolic response was associated with longer survival regardless of treatment, and the rate of metabolic response by PET was significantly higher for patients who received <italic>nab</italic>-P + Gem versus Gem alone: &#x0223c;30% more patients achieved a metabolic response at any time during the study (similar difference at week 8), and twice as many patients had a metabolic response at week 16. In addition, the treatment difference favoring <italic>nab</italic>-P + Gem for OS, PFS, and ORR in the ITT population [<xref rid="MDW020C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="MDW020C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] was also evident in the PET cohort.</p><p>Metabolic response rates at week 8 were similar to best metabolic response rates during the study, indicating that PET is a useful early predictor of the treatment outcome. Determining that a given treatment is ineffective at an early time point may allow either optimization of an existing regimen or a switch to a different, potentially more effective treatment. Thus, sensitive markers of tumor response are of great value. In the PET cohort of the MPACT study, the rate of metabolic response by EORTC criteria at week 8 was substantially higher than the ORR by RECIST (67% versus 30% for <italic>nab</italic>-P + Gem and 51% versus 10% for Gem alone), suggesting that metabolic response by PET may be the more sensitive measure of tumor response. PET may more effectively measure subtle changes in tumors. For example, an effective treatment might induce a necrotic core in the interior of a large tumor, which would be apparent by PET, but not necessarily by a CT scan. Although it is beyond the scope of the current analysis, understanding the association between tumor biology and likelihood of achieving a metabolic response may warrant further study.</p><p>PET imaging may provide useful information to supplement radiologic findings in guiding treatment decisions in pancreatic cancer. Evaluation of OS based on response by RECIST and metabolic response by PET at week 8 revealed that patients with both types of response experienced the longest OS, and patients with neither type of response had the worst OS. Patients with only one type of response had similar median OS values; however, 126 patients had a metabolic response only versus 7 patients with a RECIST response only. The median OS was &#x0003e;3 months longer for patients with a metabolic response only than for patients who did not experience a response by either measure, suggesting that metabolic response may predict a degree of treatment benefit, even in the absence of a tumor response by RECIST (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="MDW020TB3">3</xref>). Importantly, this study confirms the overall association of a PET metabolic response with OS as observed in the phase I/II study [<xref rid="MDW020C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The metabolic response rate in this study was based primarily on follow-up scans at week 8 (end of cycle 1) or 16. Whether metabolic responses might have been observed at an earlier time point is an interesting question. In gastrointestinal stromal tumor studies, a metabolic response 4 weeks after the initiation of therapy was predictive of tumor response [<xref rid="MDW020C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="MDW020C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; in some forms of gastric cancer, a metabolic response as early as 2 weeks into treatment was predictive of the clinical outcome [<xref rid="MDW020C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="MDW020C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Recent methods for PET imaging that were optimized for early prediction of clinical outcomes should be tested to augment the promising findings of this study [<xref rid="MDW020C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="MDW020C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>In summary, patients who achieve a metabolic response appear to have good clinical outcomes, regardless of treatment. PET imaging for measuring tumor response in this setting was feasible early (week 8) and predicted treatment efficacy, including longer survival. In addition, the PET response data were consistent with other efficacy data in MPACT; significantly more patients receiving <italic>nab</italic>-P + Gem versus Gem alone had a metabolic response. Patients without a metabolic response receiving <italic>nab</italic>-P + Gem had better outcomes than patients without a metabolic response who received Gem alone. Furthermore, at week 8, metabolic response by PET was observed in a 5&#x000d7; higher proportion of patients than RECIST-defined response, indicating that it may be a more sensitive measure of tumor response than radiographic modalities. If validated in other studies, its use may help optimize patient care by allowing a more rapid identification of potentially efficacious treatments and facilitates in treatment decision.</p><sec id="mdw020_s4a"><title>additional quality assurance metrics</title><p>The mean duration of FDG uptake before scanning was 67.4 min at baseline, 68.6 min at week 8, and 67.3 min at week 16.
