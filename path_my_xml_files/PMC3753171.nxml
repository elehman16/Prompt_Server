The antihypertensive action of the drug results from decreased systemic peripheral resistance, without a reflex increase in heart rate. There is no indication of serious or exaggerated first-dose hypotension or rebound effect after cessation of treatment. Blood pressure response is dose-dependent over the range of 2 mg to 32 mg; the usual recommended starting dose is 16 mg once daily. In healthy subjects, once-daily regimen of up to 16 mg of candesartan Cilexetil did not influence the levels of plasma aldosterone; yet administration of the drug at a dose of 32 mg to hypertensive patients was found to decrease the levels. Most of the antihypertensive effect of candesartan is seen within 2 weeks, and the full-effect generally occurs within 4 to 6 weeks of treatment. In patients with moderate hepatic and/or renal dysfunction, or intravascular volume depletion, candesartan should be administered at a lower dose and initiated under close medical supervision.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-dddt-7-841">2</xref> In heart failure, treatment with candesartan reduces mortality, hospitalization due to heart failure, and improves symptoms in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-dddt-7-841">2</xref></p><p>Following oral administration, candesartan cilexetil, which is a prodrug, is converted to the active substance, candesartan, by ester hydrolysis during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-dddt-7-841">2</xref> Food with a high fat content has no effect on the bioavailability of the drug. After single and repeated administration, the pharmacokinetics of candesartan are linear for oral doses of up to 32 mg of candesartan cilexetil. Candesartan and its inactive metabolite do not accumulate in serum upon repeated once-daily dosing. The absolute bioavailability for candesartan is 15% following administration of candesartan cilexetil as a tablet.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-dddt-7-841">2</xref> Peak plasma concentrations (C<sub>max</sub>) were reached approximately within 4.64 hours (4&#x02013;8 hours) after dosing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dddt-7-841">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-dddt-7-841">2</xref> Candesartan is more than 99% bound to plasma proteins and the volume of distribution in healthy individuals is 0.13 L/kg. The total plasma clearance of candesartan is 0.37 mL/minute/kg, with a renal clearance of 0.19 mL/minute/kg. Candesartan is mainly excreted unchanged in urine and feces (via bile). It undergoes minor hepatic metabolism by o-de-ethylation to an inactive metabolite.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dddt-7-841">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-dddt-7-841">2</xref> In healthy subjects, 67% of an oral dose of candesartan is excreted in feces and only about 5% to 10% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine within 24 hours.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-dddt-7-841">2</xref> The terminal elimination half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) of candesartan is approximately 9.7 hours.

The reference preparation (candesartan cilexetil 16 mg tablets, batch number GBHF) was the innovator product (Blopress&#x000ae;; Takeda Indonesia, licensed under Takeda Pharmaceutical Company limited, Osaka, Japan), and was purchased from the local pharmacy.</p><p>Prior to the conduct of the bioequivalence study, the test product was subject to undergo a series of comparative dissolution tests with the innovator product used as the comparator. The dissolution test was performed in three different media of certain pH levels (ie, pH 1.2, pH 4.5, and pH 6.8), each of which represents the pH along the gastrointestinal tract where the absorption of the study drug may occur. The dissolution profiles of both the test and comparator product in each media showed similarity factors of more than 50 (ie, the similarity factors were 74, 95, and 54, in pH 1.2, pH 4.5, and pH 6.8, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment phase and blood sampling</title><p>Subjects attended PT Equilab International (Jakarta, Indonesia) a night before drug administration, and they were requested to fast from any food and drink except mineral water from 9 pm. In the morning (approximately 6 am) of the dosing day (day 1), after an overnight fast, a predose pharmacokinetic blood sample was taken. The study drug (one tablet of the test drug or the reference drug) was given at 7 am with 200 mL of water.</p><p>The date and the time at which each sample was taken were recorded. Lunch and dinner were provided 4 hours and 10 hours after drug administration, respectively. The amounts of food and water intake and physical activity for each individual subject were standardized during the sampling days. Xanthine-containing food or beverages and fruit juices were not allowed for 24 hours before and during the entire sampling days.</p><p>From each subject, venous blood samples (10 mL) were drawn immediately before taking the drug (control), and 5 mL each at 0.5 hours, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 2 hours, 2.5 hours, 3 hours, 3.5 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 7 hours, 9 hours, 12 hours, 16 hours, 24 hours, and 36 hours after dosing. One week after the first dosing (ie, the washout period), the same procedure was repeated with the alternate drug. Blood samples from each subject were collected in vacuum polypropylene tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid by using a 22 G drawing needle during each period. The predose samples were collected within 1 hour prior to drug dosing. The postdose samples were collected within 1 minute of the scheduled time where the end time of collection to the nearest minute was recorded on case report forms. Blood samples were drawn and transferred into ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tubes. Plasma was separated from the blood by centrifugation at 1,500 g (rotor&#x02019;s diameter was 86 mm) for 15 minutes and the plasma was transferred into a clean tube. The separated plasma was divided in duplicate aliquots in pre-labeled polypropylene tubes during each period. These tubes were stored in a sample storage room (ie, in a deep freezer with temperatures maintained at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C) for temporary storage, and at the end of the day, these tubes were then transferred to a deep freezer with temperatures maintained below &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C for long-term storage. All plasma samples were stored at temperatures equal to or lower than &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until assayed.

The cross-over design is preferable for a bioequivalence study since it can eliminate intersubject differences. In this cross-over designed study, the comparison between the two formulations was conducted within subjects rather than between subjects. Since food and water intake as well as the physical activity of all the subjects were standardized in the study, the cross-over design would minimize all the factors associated with subject differences, and would focus only on the differences between the formulations evaluated. The carry-over effect, which may interfere in a cross-over design study, was eliminated by providing each subject a 1-week washout period. A washout period of 1 week is adequate to eliminate candesartan from the body, considering that the t<sub>1/2</sub> of candesartan is only about 9.7 hours.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dddt-7-841">1</xref></p><p>In the present study, the 16 mg candesartan cilexetil tablet formulations were administered to overnight fasting subjects in order to eliminate the influence of food on drug absorption. The pharmacokinetic parameters of the 16 mg candesartan cilexetil tablet were assessed based on the plasma concentrations of candesartan.</p><p>In order to perform the two one-sided test procedures for bioequivalence on log-transformed plasma candesartan concentration data, with bioequivalence limits of 0.80 and 1.25 for AUC and C<sub>max</sub>, alpha = 0.05 and power = 80%, the number of subjects needed for the bioequivalence study was determined by means of CIs, as formerly presented by Diletti et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-dddt-7-841">15</xref> In the present study, the intrasubject coefficient of variance obtained from the ANOVA for the candesartan AUC<sub>t</sub> was 18.33% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-dddt-7-841">Table 2</xref>). Hence, the number of subjects in this study (24 subjects) ensured that this study had adequate power to confirm the statistical conclusions.</p><p>Healthy subjects were selected under the eligibility criteria, which were set to ensure that only a subject population without accompanying diseases interfering with the conduct and scientific evaluation of the study were enrolled in the study. Additionally, involving healthy subjects alone would minimize risk to the subjects&#x02019; well-being.</p><p>In this study, the AUC<sub>t</sub>, AUC<sub>inf</sub>, and C<sub>max</sub> of candesartan were defined as the main parameters in order to assess possible bioequivalence between both preparations. Based on standard bioequivalence guidelines, the criteria for bioequivalence are the 90% CI of the test/reference geometric means ratio in the range of 80% to 125% for both the AUC and C<sub>max</sub>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-dddt-7-841">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-dddt-7-841">5</xref> The results of the present study showed that the geometric mean ratios (90% CIs) of the AUC<sub>t</sub>, AUC<sub>inf</sub>, and C<sub>max</sub> of candesartan were 100.92% (92.15%&#x02013;110.52%), 100.24% (92.24%&#x02013;108.95%), and 106.71% (93.20%&#x02013;122.18%), respectively. The values were within the acceptance range for bioequivalence.</p><p>In each subject, the AUC<sub>t</sub>/AUC<sub>inf</sub> ratio of candesartan was more than 80% (81.45%&#x02013;95.20% for the test drug and 82.07%&#x02013;96.22% for the reference drug), indicating that the sampling time was sufficiently long to ensure an adequate description of the absorption phase.</p><p>The mean (standard deviation) t<sub>1/2</sub> times of candesartan were 7.29 hours (1.72 hours) and 7.63 hours (1.85 hours) for the test drug and reference drug, respectively. These values were around the candesartan t<sub>1/2</sub> value observed in the literature, which was approximately 9 hours.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-dddt-7-841">2</xref> Utilizing Student&#x02019;s paired <italic>t</italic>-test, the t<sub>1/2</sub> values of the test and reference drugs were not significantly different, demonstrating a comparable rate of drug elimination from the body.</p><p>The results obtained for the median (range) t<sub>max</sub> of candesartan was 4.00 hours (2.00&#x02013;7.00 hours) for the test drug and 4.00 hours (2.00&#x02013;7.00 hours) for the reference drug.
