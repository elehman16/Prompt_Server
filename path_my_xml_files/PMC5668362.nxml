Sixty-two male participants were randomly assigned to a stress condition (Trier Social Stress Test) or a control condition. To examine the impact of stress-induced cortisol on attentional bias to threat, participants in the stress group were split into Low- and High cortisol responders. All participants were then administered a modified dot probe task in which the cues were neutral and angry faces. Behavioral results showed a pattern of attentional bias toward threat in the Control group but not in the stress group. For the ERPs, the P100 peaked earlier for the angry-cued targets than the neutral-cued targets in the Control group, which suggests a rapid, adaptive response toward threat. However, this effect was not observed in the stress group, suggesting a suppressed attentional bias under stress. In addition, the stress group (including both Low and High cortisol responders) showed reduced P300 amplitude to target onset than the Control group. These results suggest that acute stress disrupts attentional bias to threat including a reduction in early bias to threat in addition to a subsequent change of attention allocation.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">People can detect and respond rapidly to threats in their environment. In contrast to a neutral stimulus, this hypervigilance to a threatening stimulus is called attentional bias toward threats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. However, this enhanced attention to threat can be altered by stress. Previous studies have found an attentional bias toward threat stimuli in non-stressful contexts. However, the bias may disappear under acute stress. For example, the attentional bias toward threat disappeared when socially anxious individuals were asked to perform public speaking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Likewise, the attentional bias to masked angry face for patients with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures was abolished when they experienced the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Furthermore, researchers have revealed that an increase in cortisol after acute psychological stress is associated with less attentional bias for threat words in a dot probe task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Helfinstein, White, Bar-Haim, and Fox (2008) found that socially anxious individuals showed an attentional bias toward angry faces after a neutral prime, but no attentional bias was found after a threatening prime<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, these studies have solely focused on behavioral outcomes; thus, the exact stage of information processing in which these effects operate remains unknown.</p><p id="Par3">Event-related potentials (ERPs) can be used to distinguish the neural sub-processes that are involved in complex cognitive functions. To our knowledge, only one study has examined the effects of acute stress on attentional bias using ERPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In this study, social drinkers performed an oddball task under acute stress or control conditions. The results showed that there was an increased P300 for target alcohol-related images compared to neutral distracters in the control condition, and this effect disappeared under stress. However, it still unclear how acute stress affects the distinct cognitive steps in attentional bias in healthy populations.</p><p id="Par4">The dot probe task is frequently used to measure attentional bias and has received considerable empirical support as an index of attentional bias for threat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In the dot probe task, participants are instructed to respond to a target when it replaces one of two cue locations that are simultaneously presented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Attention to emotional stimuli can be assessed using emotional facial expressions as stimuli in a dot probe task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In this task, a faster response to the targets that replace a negative stimulus compared to the targets that replace a neutral stimulus suggests attentional bias toward threatening stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In addition, research has reported greater accuracy to targets that appear in the same location as negative stimuli compared to neutral stimuli in dot probe attention tasks. Such a response pattern is considered an indication of enhanced attention to the location of negative stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, which may also suggest an attentional bias toward threat-inducing stimuli.</p><p id="Par5">Performance on the dot probe task entails two different stages: (a) processing the emotional cues and (b) processing the subsequent targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In the cue presentation stage, the P100 peaks at approximately 100 ms after the stimulus is presented and reflects the processing of low-level stimulus features and the mobilization of automatic attentional resources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The N170 is a face perception component that occurs approximately 170 ms after the face is presented, with the largest peak amplitude appearing at lateral posterior electrode sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. When processing subsequent targets, most researchers agree that the attentional bias to threat primarily manifests in the P100 component in response to the target<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. These studies have consistently reported an increased P100 amplitude for targets replacing threat stimuli compared to targets replacing neutral stimuli, suggesting an enhanced attention to threats. Previous studies using the cue-target paradigm have also revealed enhanced contralateral attention-related modulation in the target-evoked occipital P100 component<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In addition, targets elicit a P300 component, which indicates the allocation of attention resources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the finding that the larger ERP (C1) amplitude evoked by the face pair in the cue stage and the larger validity effect on P100 evoked by the target was reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, suggesting potential associations between the processing of the cue and the target.</p><p id="Par6">This study aimed to investigate the effects of acute psychological stress on attentional bias to threat-related stimuli using both ERP and behavioral methods in healthy participants. Acute psychological stress was induced using a modified Trier Social Stress Task (TSST)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. When faced with acute stress, two systems, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis become activated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Further, stress is accompanied by negative affect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The ANS provides the most immediate response to stressor exposure, causing rapidly increased heart rate (HR) and blood pressure within seconds. Cortisol is the final effector of the HPA axis; the activation of the HPA axis is relatively slow and requires several minutes to reach peak levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Thus, HR and subjective emotional state were used to evaluate the fast reactions to stress and cortisol was used to evaluate the slow reaction to stress. In addition, researchers have found considerable individual differences in cortisol response to acute stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In two studies, low cortisol responders became avoidant and high cortisol responders became vigilant to angry faces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The present study examined the relation of stress and attentional bias toward threat, thus, stressed participants were split <italic>post hoc</italic> into Low and High cortisol responders according to the median of cortisol increase induced by stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Attentional bias was measured with a modified dot probe task. According to previous behavioral studies, we expected that attentional bias to threat would be suppressed under acute stress which was measured via behavioral and ERP components. Furthermore, considering the potential links between the processing of the cue and target<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, we were also interested in how these associations were altered under acute stress.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Self-Report Results</title><p id="Par7">No significant Group difference was found for trait anxiety (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05).

The acute stress response was successfully evoked, as indicated by the higher negative affect, increased heart rate, and higher cortisol levels in the stress group compared to the Control group. The behavioral results indicated that the Control group showed a trend of more accurate responses to the valid compared to the invalid trials, while this effect was not seen in the stress group (neither Low nor High cortisol responders). The ERP data showed that the P100 component induced by the target peaked earlier in the valid compared to the invalid trials in the Control group. However, this effect was absent in both the Low and High cortisol responders of the stress group. In addition, we found reduced P300 amplitudes at the target onset in the stress group relative to the control group.</p><p id="Par19">The control group showed marginally higher accuracy on the valid nogo trials than invalid nogo trials, which may be a product of enhanced attention to the location of angry faces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, indicating an attentional bias effect. However, acute stress interfered with the attentional resources necessary to diverting from angry faces and resulted in no attentional bias effect in the Low and High cortisol responders of the stress group. These results support our hypothesis and are similar to previous reports of altered attention under stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, although these studies reported that the effect was on the response time to the negative stimuli, rather than on the accuracy of non-response, as in the current study.</p><p id="Par20">More importantly, the present study found that the Control group showed earlier P100 latencies on valid than invalid trials, but this effect was not found in either the Low and High cortisol responders of the stress group. The P100 component reveals the mobilization of automatic attentional resources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, and its latency reflects the speed of perceptual processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. A shorter P100 latency indicates a faster processing speed of the target that replaces the angry face and suggests a normal, adaptive attentional bias toward the threatening stimulus. However, this difference was not seen under acute stress, and it was not related to the stress level; that is, attention was equally allocated to angry and neutral faces in stressed participants, indicating a stress-induced suppression of the attentional bias. These results were similar to the behavioral results.</p><p id="Par21">This finding could be further evidence supporting the idea that attention orientation to threat is suppressed under stress. These results provide neural evidence for how attentional bias may develop under acute stress. One possibility for the reduced threat bias under stress may be that acute stress shifts the processing priorities from the less threatening stimulus (i.e., angry faces) to the more threatening stimulus (i.e., acute stress)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In this case, lower accuracy or longer response time may be found in the stress group. However, our results did not support this view as relatively higher accuracy was found in the Low cortisol responders and High cortisol responders (though to a lesser degree in the low cortisol responders) compared to the Control group. Another possibility may be that acute stress makes it difficult to distinguish threat from non-threat information. Shackman, Maxwell, McMenamin, Greischar, &#x00026; Davidson (2011) reported that threat of shock can increase neural responses in extrastriate visual cortex, even for neutral visual stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Acute stress can also shift amygdala function toward heightened sensitivity with lower levels of specificity, that is, stress augments amygdala responses to both threat-related stimuli and non-threatening stimuli, thereby diminishing a threat selective response pattern under stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. According to this view, higher accuracy or shorter response time may be found in the stress group. Indeed, our results support this view. However, given the marginally significant results, the conclusion should be treated cautiously and more studies are needed to further test these implications.</p><p id="Par22">Some studies that have assessed stress effects on attention have produced inconsistent results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, in which attentional bias to threat was enhanced in an acute stress condition compared to a control condition. There may be several reasons for these mixed results. One possibility may be different cue presentation times. Mogg <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> used a dot probe task with a 500-ms cue presentation time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, while the present study adopted a modified dot probe task with a 100-ms cue presentation time. Previous research observed that attention orienting to threats typically occurred when the stimuli were presented for a short duration (less than 100 ms)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Attention disengagement from threats tends to occur when the duration is much longer (500 ms or longer), which is sufficient time for attention to shift one or more times<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Using different task paradigms may be another contributing factor to the inconsistent results reported in the literature. Roelofs <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> used a masked emotional Stroop task to show that those who produce the largest stress cortisol responses also showed greater vigilance toward angry faces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The current results from a dot probe task do not show such a pattern. Some researchers have argued that the emotional Stroop task indirectly measures attentional bias and that a longer response time to threat-related information may reflect a response bias rather than an attentional bias<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Finally, gender may also be a potential moderator. In the research by Roelofs <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and Mogg <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, both men and women were included, while only men were included in the present study. Previous studies have revealed that compared to young women, young men have higher cortisol responses after exposure to acute stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, which could make men perceive stressful situations as more threatening, resulting in more conservative, inhibited behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par23">In addition, the Low and High cortisol responders had smaller P300 amplitudes for targets compared to the Control group both in the valid and invalid conditions. The results were consistent with studies in clinical populations (i.e., PTSD and anxiety disorder) who also show reduced P300 amplitudes, suggesting a deficit in the amount of attentional resources allocated during stimulus evaluation and memory updating processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. These results may be attributed to the detrimental effect of acute stress on higher-order PFC abilities, i.e., attentional regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. The attentional regulation can switch from slow thoughtful &#x02018;top-down&#x02019; control by the PFC to reflexive and rapid emotional responses of the amygdala and related subcortical structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Consistent with this argument, an ERP study found that stress can amplify earlier extrastriate activity, but disrupt later activity associated with the evaluation of task-relevant information as reflected by P300 amplitude<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Hence, the smaller P300 in the stress condition may be associated with reduced prefrontal cortex activity under acute stress indicating less efficient cortical processing.</p><p id="Par24">Interestingly, we also found that the N170 amplitudes elicited by the face cue were positively related to the target induced contralateral-invalid P100 latencies and P300 amplitudes both in the valid and invalid trials in the Control group, while these relationships were absent in the Low and High cortisol responders. The correlations in the Control group suggests that higher neural activity at the structural encoding step of face perception may be associated with faster early sensory processing of the subsequent stimuli and more engagement in attention orientation to the following stimuli. Pourtois <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> reported that a larger C1, as evoked by face pairs, was correlated with a larger validity effect on the P100 amplitude<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Because C1 is thought to reflect the initial evoked response in the primary visual cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, Pourtois <italic>et al</italic>. proposed that the correlation might indicate the important functional significance of C1, which allows for processing of the subsequent target that was presented at the same location as the threat. In the present study, N170, another important face-sensitive component, may also have significant functional implication. However, acute stress may interrupt the link between face perception and subsequent target processing, as reflected by the lack of this relationship in the stress condition, which may indicated one mechanism underlying the reduced attentional bias in stressed individuals, as discussed above.</p><p id="Par25">There are several limitations to the current study. First, as only male participants were included in this study, we cannot expand the findings to females. Second, although we examined how and at which stages acute stress influenced the attentional bias, the time frame during which acute stress affects attentional bias is unknown. More research is needed to examine sex differences and how the duration of acute stress affects attentional bias. Finally, the present study used a between-subjects design without measuring the baseline attentional bias before the stress/control treatments, which may have not fully eliminated possible individual differences between the two groups. Further research should use a pre-post treatment design to eliminate individual differences.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par26">In summary, our results suggest that acute psychosocial stress impairs attentional bias.

Participants were required to chew a cotton pledget for 2&#x02009;min. The samples were stored at &#x02212;20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C until they were assayed. An electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Cobas e601, Roche Diagnostics, Numbrecht, Germany) was used to analyze the cortisol concentration, and the following parameters were used: sensitivity, 0.500 nmol/L (lower limit), and standard range in assay, 0.5&#x02013;1750 nmol/L. Intra- and inter-assay variations were less than 10%. Five participants, who were missing three or more samples due to insufficient saliva, were excluded from the final analysis. Participants missing one or two cortisol values were included. Missing baseline values were substituted with the average cortisol concentration of all participants at that time point, and missing values at other time points were substituted with the average cortisol separately for each group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. The number of final participants for the cortisol analysis was 56 (the Control group <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;18, the stress group <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;38).

ECG was measured via three Ag&#x02013;AgCl disposable electrodes, which were placed on the right carotid artery and the left and right medial malleolus after the surface was cleaned with alcohol. Except for the continuous recording during the TSST/control task, HR was collected at the same time as each saliva collection for a 5&#x02009;min. However, 15&#x02009;min post-TSST/control task, the ECG lasted only for 2&#x02009;min to ensure that the attentional bias task was completed during the period of cortisol elevation in response to the TSST. HR was averaged at each assessment point for each participant offline.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>EEG Recording and Preprocessing</title><p id="Par40">During the dot probe task, the EEG was recorded from 64 channels using Ag/AgCl electrodes in a cap conforming to the international 10&#x02013;20 system (Neuroscan Inc., Charlotte, North Carolina, USA), with an on-line reference to the left mastoid and an off-line algebraic re-reference to the average of the left and right mastoids. The electrooculogram (EOG) was recorded by placing electrodes at the outer canthus of each eye as well as above and below the left eye. Impedance was maintained at less than 5 k&#x003a9;. Signals were amplified with a 0.05&#x02013;100&#x02009;Hz bandpass filter and digitized at 1,000&#x02009;Hz.</p><p id="Par41">Scan 4.5 software (Neuroscan, USA) was used to process the EEG data. Ocular artifacts were removed from the EEG signal with a regression procedure that was implemented in the Neuroscan software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Data were digitally filtered using a low-pass filter of 30&#x02009;Hz. An interval of 100 ms before the face and target presentations was used as the baseline for the face and target ERPs. Epochs were created around the face and target onsets (from &#x02212;100 ms to&#x02009;+600 ms) and epochs with amplitudes that exceeded &#x000b1;100 &#x000b5;V were discarded. After epoching, baseline corrections were performed. Finally, the trials that were in the same condition (including the face pair and target onset-locked ERPs) were averaged, and correct rejections of the nogo trials were used to create the ERPs. Overall, for N170 evoked by the face pair, the number of trials for each condition was 144 and less than 36.5% of the trials were rejected in the three groups (Control group, Low and High cortisol responders) because of artifacts and outliers in reaction times. For P1 evoked by the target, the number of trials for each condition was 72 and less than 43.1% trials were rejected in the three groups. For P3 evoked by the target, the number of trials for each condition was 144 and less than 30.6% trials were rejected in the three groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Data Analysis</title><p id="Par42">One-way analysis of variances (ANOVAs) was used to examine the group differences on trait anxiety levels.

For behavioral data, a repeated measures ANOVA was performed on response time (RT) for the go trials with Group as a between-subjects factor and Cue Validity (valid, invalid) and Visual Field (left, right) as within-subjects factors. Similar ANOVAs were also performed on the percentage of hits in the go trials and the rate of correct rejections in the nogo trials.</p><p id="Par44">For ERPs evoked by the face pairs, the P100 and N170 components were analyzed. The P100 and N170 peak amplitudes and latencies were measured at occipital sites (O1/2, CB1/2; time window: 60&#x02013;160 ms) and bilateral occipital sites (PO5/6, PO7/8; time window: 130&#x02013;210 ms) separately. Repeated measures ANOVAs were performed on the P100 and N170 amplitudes/latencies separately with Group as a between<bold>-</bold>subjects factor and Contralaterality (ipsilateral vs. contralateral to the location of the angry face) as a within<bold>-</bold>subjects factor. The ipsilateral waveform was calculated by averaging the left-sided electrodes to the left-sided angry face and the right-sided electrode to the right-sided angry face, and the contralateral waveform was calculated by averaging the left-sided electrodes to the right-sided angry face and the right-sided electrodes to the left-sided angry face.</p><p id="Par45">For ERPs evoked by the target onset, we analyzed P100 and P300 components. P100 peak amplitudes and latencies were measured across the O1/2 and CB1/2 sites (time window: 60&#x02013;180 ms). Repeated measures ANOVA with Group as a between-subjects factor and Cue Validity and Contralaterality (electrode ipsilateral vs. contralateral to the location of the target) as within-subjects factors. For the target-evoked P100, the ipsilateral and contralateral waveforms were calculated in a similar way as for the face pairs according to the location of the target. The P300 component was measured at midline sites Fz, FCz, and Cz (time window: 250&#x02013;600 ms), and the visual field factor was not included in the final analysis as it did not interact with group or cue validity (<italic>ps</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.46). The repeated measures ANOVA was performed on the P300 component with Group as a between-subjects factor and Cue Validity and Site as within-subjects factors. Greenhouse-Geisser correction was used to correct the degrees of freedom and Bonferroni corrections were applied to correct the alpha levels. Interaction tests were conducted using the least significant difference (LSD) method.</p><p id="Par46">To explore the potential correlations between face perception during the cue stage and attentional bias during the target response stage, correlation analyses were conducted for the component that was evoked by the face pair (ipsilateral and contralateral N170 amplitudes) and the components that were evoked by targets (ipsilateral and contralateral P100 latencies and the averaged P300 amplitudes at the midline electrodes in the valid and invalid conditions) for the Control, Low and High cortisol responders, separately. To reduce type I error rate on exploratory correlation analyses, the bootstrapping (number of samples: 1000) were performed and 95% confidence intervals surrounding each correlation coefficient are reported.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>A correction to this article is available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-22368-9">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-22368-9</ext-link>.</p></fn><fn><p>A correction to this article is available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-17923-9">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-17923-9</ext-link>.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Change History:</bold> A correction to this article has been published and is linked from the HTML version of this paper.
