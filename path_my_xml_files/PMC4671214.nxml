Although the brain injury is non-progressive, the neuro-musculoskeletal and movement-related functions may deteriorate and cause activity limitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Most children with CP exhibit an altered gait such as stiff knee gait, crouch gait, excessive hip flexion, intoeing or equinus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Thirty-eight to sixty-five per cent of all children with CP walk independently and are consequently classified on the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) at level I or II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The interdisciplinary interventions addressing impairments that affect the patients&#x02019; gait can be described in four categories: orthopaedic surgery, spasticity management, physical therapy and orthotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Guided by the problems faced by each child with CP, interventions should be individually planned to help the child and family to achieve their goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>In Denmark, a patient-centred and evidence-based approach is pursued. An adapted version of the Swedish Cerebral Palsy follow-Up Program is used, where the healthcare professionals use standardised examinations of the child throughout childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A local team, which usually consists of a paediatrician, a paediatric orthopaedic surgeon and a physiotherapist, is responsible for the follow up and individually tailored interdisciplinary interventions for each child with CP. The local team meets with the child and family once or twice a year to examine the child&#x02019;s development and to plan and coordinate common goals and interventions for the child. As part of the Cerebral Palsy follow-Up Program, the overall gross motor function and walking performance are evaluated by standardised measures such as the GMFCS, the Functional Mobility Scale and sometimes the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, objective features in the gait that reflect underlying neuro-musculoskeletal impairments are not described. This can be done with 3-dimensional instrumented gait analysis (IGA).</p><p>The purpose of IGA is to provide objective and valid measures of gait in three planes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. With the use of infrared camera technology and force plates embedded in the floor, it is possible to determine joint movement (kinematics), joint torque and power (kinetics) and tempo-spatial parameters. IGA thus provides a large amount of interdependent data and variables corresponding to different gait pathologies.</p><p>The quantity and complexity of data have led to the description of different indices that quantify a part of, or the overall, gait pathology into a single score. For example, the Gait Deviation Index (GDI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and Gait Profile Score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] summarise the overall gait into a single score for each patient, whereas the Gait Variable Score is an index for a single gait variable rather than a single score for all variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The use of IGA in combination with clinical examinations and standardised measures provide quantifiable information for clinical decisions regarding individually tailored interventions, in contrast to the current practice (&#x02018;care as usual&#x02019;) where only clinical examinations and standardised measures are used. In the last two decades, pre-operative IGA has developed to the point where it has become an important investigation in ambulant children with CP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Studies have shown that IGA can significantly affect the decisions regarding orthopaedic surgical interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and that there is good agreement between recommendations based on IGA and the surgery performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The effects of individually defined physiotherapy in children with CP based on clinical examinations and IGA have been investigated in a prospective double blind cross-over study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The authors observed a superior effect of individually defined physiotherapy on achievement of treatment goals, gross motor function and some selected gait parameters compared with a generic training program. The use of IGA <italic>per se</italic> has only been investigated in relation to decision-making in orthopaedic surgery and effects of individually defined physical therapy.</p><p>To our best knowledge, the potential added benefit of using IGA in the decision-making of interdisciplinary interventions directed towards impairments in gait has not been investigated in children with CP. Thus, a study investigating potential difference in improvements in overall gait pathology following individually tailored interdisciplinary intervention with or without IGA is needed. The aim of this study is to determine which of two modalities (i.e. individually tailored interdisciplinary intervention with or without IGA) leads to greater improvements in the overall gait pathology, walking performance and patient-reported outcomes of functional mobility, overall health, pain and participation in normal daily activities and health-related quality of life after 52&#x000a0;weeks. However, it is important to note that the study is not intended to document the effect of IGA alone, but to document the difference in the effects of the interdisciplinary interventions, when IGA is implemented in the experimental group.</p><p>The primary hypothesis to be tested is:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>H<sup>1</sup>) The use of IGA in the planning of individually tailored interdisciplinary interventions will be more effective in improving overall gait pathology (evaluated by GDI (primary outcome)) compared with &#x02018;care as usual&#x02019; in children with CP at GMFCS levels I and II.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The secondary hypotheses are:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>H<sup>2</sup>) The use of IGA in the planning of individually tailored interdisciplinary interventions will be more effective compared with &#x02018;care as usual&#x02019; in improving walking performance (1-min walk test) and patient-reported outcomes of functional mobility (Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory), overall health, pain and participation in normal daily activities (Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument) as well as health-related quality of life (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Cerebral Palsy Module) in children with CP at GMFCS levels I and II.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Furthermore, a number of hypothesis-generating analyses will be performed on the effects of the two modalities on the following explorative outcomes: gait, walking performance and the family-centred behaviour of health care providers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>A prospective, single blind, parallel group, balanced randomisation [1:1] study will be conducted in accordance with guidelines of the CONSORT statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

A trained lab technician will perform the data collection and data processing.</p><p>The primary outcome measure is the GDI, which is based upon kinematic data from the IGA, and is an overall quantitative index that summarises the overall gait pathology into a single score for each patient by comparison with non-pathological gait. A GDI value of 100 represents the absence of gait pathology, and each 10-point decrement below 100 indicates one standard deviation from normal gait kinematics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. For the primary outcome measure, the median of the five trials for each leg will be used to calculate the average of both legs to provide a single index for each child.

The sample size calculation is based upon the GDI (primary outcome), collected as part of another study in our laboratory on a comparable group of children with CP (mean GDI 79.3, SD 12.0). A minimum clinically important difference in GDI has been defined as 7.9 points by the current group of authors a priori, which is equivalent to an improvement of 10&#x000a0;%, as suggested by Swartz et al.

Such a trial is warranted because IGA is widely used for orthopaedic surgical planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and has been shown to affect the decision-making in the planning of orthopaedic surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, its effectiveness regarding gait pathology, walking performance and patient-reported outcomes of functional mobility, overall health, pain and participation in normal daily activities as well as health-related quality of life have never been investigated.</p><p>The IGA has been investigated for quality as a measurement tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The current trial seeks to investigate the effectiveness of the IGA when applied in a clinical practice involving multiple steps such as interdisciplinary interventions in regard to changes in the overall gait pathology, walking performance and patient-reported outcomes of functional mobility, overall health, pain and participation in normal daily activities and health-related quality of life after 52&#x000a0;weeks. Consequently, the current trial uses a pragmatic approach and is accordingly not designed to distinguish between the different elements in the two intervention groups but rather to reflect common practice and ensure high external validity. This is in contrast to studies emphasising internal validity that are carried out in an &#x02018;ideal setting&#x02019; with highly selected participants, practitioners and hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>The randomised controlled trial design will be used to assess potential benefits associated with the use of the IGA in interdisciplinary interventions, and thereby, provide novel evidence. The randomised controlled trial design is considered the gold standard for a clinical trial, and provides the most reliable evidence on the efficacy of healthcare interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The study can be used to support the decision-making as to whether IGA should be applied in routine daily practice to all children with spastic CP at GMFCS levels I and II. Thus, the purpose of the study warrants a pragmatic approach as opposed to a more explanatory design. The key differences in the two approaches can be described in terms of purpose, setting, participants, intervention and outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], which will be incorporated in the following sections of the discussion.</p><p>The study will be carried out in the Region of Southern Denmark and the North Denmark Region. Participants will be recruited through the local teams in the Cerebral Palsy follow-Up Program, and will encourage attendance among eligible children. The Cerebral Palsy follow-Up Program makes it possible to gain information to make a thorough description of the &#x02018;reach&#x02019; of recruitment of participants into the population of interest and to document potential study composition differences across the stages of the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The relatively young age group has been chosen to ensure inclusion of children at an early age, before the development of extensive and fixed deformities that cause impairments and associated gait pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. To ensure good data quality from IGA, participants at GMFCS levels I and II have been chosen. However, this may impact the generalisability of findings.</p><p>To reflect the current clinical procedures in Denmark and to emphasise external validity, the experimental intervention will be carried out in five steps. Selected practitioners, who are highly trained, are responsible for the first three steps (<italic>Step 1: IGA, Step 2: Impairment-focused interpretation, and Step 3: Recommendations for interdisciplinary interventions</italic>). Both the selected practitioners and the local team will be involved in the remaining step (<italic>Step 4: Dissemination of recommendations</italic>) and planning of individually tailored interdisciplinary interventions. Paediatric orthopaedic surgeons will perform the orthopaedic surgical procedures while the local teams will carry out other interventions in terms of spasticity management, physical therapy and orthotics. Consequently, only parts of the experimental intervention (<italic>Steps 1,2 and 3</italic>) will be standardised and strictly enforced by researchers responsible for the study, whereas the remaining parts of the experimental interventions will be performed through the collaboration of local teams, the selected practitioners and the researchers. The local teams, regardless of treatment group, will use their standard procedures in the interdisciplinary interventions.</p><p>There is a risk of poor adherence to the recommended interventions by participants and local teams. This has previously been reported in a randomised controlled trial that investigated the impact of gait analysis on surgical outcomes in ambulatory children with CP, where less than half (42&#x000a0;%) of the IGA recommendations were followed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. To improve understanding of the recommended interventions from the IGA, members of the local team will be asked if they have any questions about the results of the report and whether they will follow the recommendations. The identification of individually tailored treatment goals has previously been used in studies concerning physical therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] and orthopaedic surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] for children with CP. Studies have shown that the approach can promote improvement in everyday activities and gross motor function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], and that the approach resulted in goals that were more frequently and smoothly implemented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p><p>As for the majority of studies that involve interventions that cannot be blinded, the current study design has a potential risk of non-compliance of participants with the intervention they are randomised to. In this study, there is a risk that participants randomised to the control intervention (&#x02018;care as usual&#x02019;) will benefit from knowledge obtained by practitioners from participants in the experimental intervention. However, since IGA is only performed in our institution, no one will gain access to the examination without our knowledge. Thus, the risk of non-compliance is primarily believed to be at the physiotherapist level. Consequently, as described above, in cases where physiotherapists are responsible for the interventions for two or more participants, the first randomised patient will determine the allocation of the following patients. The interventions performed at the level of orthopaedic surgery, spasticity management and orthotics will be carried out by relatively few practitioners. Thus, it will be easier to contain this risk and practitioners will simply be requested to continue with their standard care for the &#x02018;care as usual&#x02019; group. These professionals have taken part in the IGA interpretations for a number of years. A consequence of this set-up might be that the interventions in the &#x02018;care as usual&#x02019; group could be influenced by the professional experience gained from previous interpretations of the IGA.</p><p>We have chosen a follow-up period of 52&#x000a0;weeks. This is done to balance the desire for a short follow up for the interventions&#x02019; spasticity management and physical therapy, while the effects of orthopaedic surgery and orthotics might take as long as 24&#x000a0;months to emerge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p><p>A wide range of outcome measures has been used to document the effectiveness of interventions in children with CP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. For this study, we have decided to include assessments of body function and structure, activity and participation levels from the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. The primary outcome measure is at the level of &#x02018;body function&#x02019;, where we use overall gait pathology classified by the GDI as a measure of gait pattern functions that are defined as functions of movement patterns associated with walking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] and can be used to reflect the extent to which the goal of &#x02018;better looking gait&#x02019; has been reached [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Performance on the GDI was chosen as the primary outcome rather than on the Gait Profile Score, because it seems to be more sensitive to change in children with a relatively mildly affected gait [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], as expected with the study population of children at GMFCS levels I and II. The gait pattern function has been found to be one of the important domains for youth with CP, parents and medical professionals, when considering treatment outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p><p>The secondary outcome measures are a range of measures on the level of &#x02018;activity and participation&#x02019;. The measures have been chosen to be relevant to the particular group of children participating in the study. The Gait Variable Score will be calculated to document changes in the nine kinematic variables and will be used to document explorative changes at the joint level. Thus, we have chosen a wide range of outcome measures that covers all levels of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health and seems relevant to participants, their parents and the healthcare professionals.</p><p>One might argue that the Gross Motor Function Measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] could be a relevant outcome measure. However, due to the time-consuming IGA procedure, it would be difficult to motivate the children for further examination and, consequently, difficult to achieve valid output measures. Furthermore, there is a risk of a ceiling effect when the Gross Motor Function Measure is used for children at GMFCS level I after the age of five years, due to their relatively high level of functioning.</p><p>The current trial will provide novel evidence for the effects of an individually tailored interdisciplinary intervention designed to address impairments identified by IGA versus &#x02018;care as usual&#x02019; in children with spastic CP. The results of the trial will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals for publication, irrespective of the outcome, in accordance with the CONSORT statement for the reporting of randomised controlled trials.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CP</term><def><p>cerebral palsy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GDI</term><def><p>gait deviation index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GMFCS</term><def><p>gross motor function classification system</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICC</term><def><p>intra-class correlations coefficient</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IGA</term><def><p>instrumented gait analysis</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
