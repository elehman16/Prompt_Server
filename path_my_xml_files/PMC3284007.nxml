Nevertheless, the inner layer is less frequently contaminated with bacteria and although bacteria may dissolve the mineralized tissue, the cross-banded ultra structure of the collagen matrix is preserved. Accordingly, the dentin of this carious layer can be preserved and remineralized if these bacteria are removed or killed.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Antimicrobial substances may be a potential choice for dentin disinfection, thus decreasing the possibility of infected tissue existence after tooth preparation. Thus, the use of antimicrobial solutions for cleaning the cavity after its preparation has been recommended. Chlorhexidine is a promising antimicrobial agent due to its ability to significantly reduce the levels of oral microorganisms.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Different formulations of chlorhexidine have been used for reducing the number of cariogenic bacteria in the saliva.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] However, the very short-term antimicrobial effect of 2% chlorhexidine digluconate has not been evaluated. This is because in all the previous <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, chlorhexidine-based agents were analyzed after weeks or months[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] and in combination with subsequent restorations.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>The objective was to evaluate a very short-term <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in situ</italic> effect of 2% chlorhexidine-digluconate-based cavity cleanser on the disinfection of dentin contaminated with cariogenic bacteria. The study hypothesis is that 2% chlorhexidine-digluconate is effective in reducing total viable microorganisms, total <italic>streptococci</italic>, <italic>mutans streptococci</italic> and <italic>lactobacilli</italic> in the tested conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Ethical aspects and study population</title><p>This study was performed in conformity with the norms of the Research and Ethics Committee of Federal University of Cear&#x000e1; (Process # 185/08).

For the <italic>in situ</italic> study, the other 40 dentin slabs were selected and inserted into the palatal appliances. An intra oral removable acrylic palatal appliance was fabricated, in which 2 cavities (6 &#x000d7; 6 &#x000d7; 3 mm<sup>3</sup>) were prepared on the left and right sides; and one slab was attached with wax in each cavity [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of the intra oral palatal device used in the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCD-15-22-g001"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Experimental design</title><sec id="sec3-2"><title>In vitro experiment</title><p>Forty-five human dentin slabs were randomly allocated to 3 groups, with 15 experimental units per group, according to a computer generated randomization list.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] The experimental design was performed in triplicate (<italic>n</italic> = 5). In addition to this, the study involved 2 set conditions in which carious dentin was exposed to 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) solution (Control) or 2% chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) for 5 minutes, and a sterile group (untreated) was performed.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>In vitro lesion production</title><p><italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> CTT 3440 was evaluated in this study.

An Ultraviolet &#x02013; visible (UV&#x02013;Vis) spectrophotometer was used on the bacterial growth; a specific optical density was determined, and used for all samples to adjust the inoculum to the same cell number. The dentin slabs were immersed in sterile BHI containing 5% sucrose (w/v).

The microbiological analyses were performed immediately before and after the treatments.

The primary end point was infection of the dentin, quantitatively assessed by microbiological counts and qualitatively showed by AFM images, where <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> could be observed inside dentinal tubules <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, data showed no morphological differences for <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> chains among the tested groups and differences in its quantity were not expected, since bacterial cells were present even after death. Similar to this study, in previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, CHX vehicles were shown to be effective. They inhibited the development of the biofilm with respect to its maturation as well as the metabolism of the exposed bacteria was inhibited.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>]</p><p>Log reduction means obtained by CHX treatment for all tested microorganisms were similar suggesting that this antimicrobial agent is as efficient against <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> as it is against <italic>lactobacilli</italic> and total viable microorganisms. These results for <italic>lactobacilli</italic> are in contrast to those found by Ersin and colleagues,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] who could not demonstrate a significant superior effect of chlorhexidine on <italic>lactobacillus</italic>. It should be emphasized that our study microbiological analysis was performed 5 min after CHX application in contrast to the 6 months period used by the latter authors. In addition, our study utilized a two fold more concentrated CHX solution, and Botelho[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] supplied evidence that lactobacilli are not insensitive to chlorhexidine and the inhibition follows a dose-response manner. Accordingly, one should assume that higher levels of the chlorhexidine digluconate directly applied onto tooth surfaces significantly reduce the counts of lactobacilli, as seen in this investigation. Furthermore, the <italic>in vivo</italic> methodology performed by Ersin and colleagues,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] against the <italic>in situ</italic> methodology used in our study should be considered, since some species of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> are more sensitive to chlorhexidine, whereas some of them are less sensitive.</p><p>With regards to the total viable microorganism count, the present results are in contrast to Wicht and colleagues,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] who found that the total viable counts were not significantly affected after the application of chlorhexidine varnish as a cavity disinfectant onto the carious dentin. A possible explanation for this might be the different treatment procedures and materials. Furthermore, they suggested that using a larger sample, would reflect a more significant influence on the total viable microorganism counts by chlorhexidine. No other <italic>in situ</italic> studies have evaluated the antibacterial effects of CHX-based cavity disinfectant on cariogenic bacteria in dentin. According to our results, 2% digluconate chlorhexidine may be an appropriate disinfecting agent to be used in dentinal caries. Dentin tissue could be better preserved, thereby making patient treatment easier for the dentist and more comfortable for patients, and enabling lesions to be restored with minimal tissue removal, thus improving the long-term prognosis for the repaired tooth.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] Our results showed that CHX was effective in reducing the cultivable microbiota. Furthermore, although the use of chlorhexidine-digluconate-based cavity disinfectant did not completely eliminate the viable microorganisms, it served as a suitable agent in reducing the residual microbiota. However, further clinical trials are necessary to determine its antibacterial and clinical effects in short and long term time frames.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> This research received the fi nancial support of Grant # 477070/2008-6 from National Council for Scientifi c and Technological Development (CNPq).
