There are four serotypes of dengue virus, DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4, each capable of causing the full spectrum of disease. rDEN1&#x00394;30 is a live attenuated investigational vaccine for the prevention of DENV-1 illness and is also a component of an investigational tetravalent DENV vaccine currently in Phase I evaluation. A single subcutaneous dose of rDEN1&#x00394;30 was previously shown to be safe and immunogenic in healthy adults. In the current randomized placebo-controlled trial, 60 healthy flavivirus-naive adults were randomized to receive 2 doses of rDEN1&#x00394;30 (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;50) or placebo (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10), either on study days 0 and 120 (cohort 1) or 0 and 180 (cohort 2). We sought to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of this candidate vaccine in 50 additional vaccinees and to test whether the humoral immune response could be boosted by a second dose administered 4 or 6 months after the first dose. The first dose of vaccine was well tolerated, infected 47/50 vaccinees and induced seroconversion in 46/50 vaccinees. Irrespective of dosing interval, the second dose of vaccine was also well tolerated but did not induce any detectable viremia or &#x02265;4-fold rise in serum neutralizing antibody titer.Only five subjects had an anamnestic antibody response detectable by ELISA following a second dose of vaccine, demonstrating that the vaccine induced sterilizing humoral immunity in most vaccinees for at least six months following primary vaccination.The promising safety and immunogenicity profile of this vaccine confirms its suitability for inclusion in a tetravalent dengue vaccine.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Globally, dengue fever has become the most common clinically significant mosquito-transmitted viral illness. Dengue viruses exist as four serotypes, and increasingly several serotypes co-circulate in the same region. Infection with one serotype increases the risk of severe illness following infection with a second serotype. Therefore, any dengue virus vaccine needs to protect against all four serotypes. We and others are working to develop a live-attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine that contains four monovalent vaccine viruses. Since two or more doses of such a vaccine are thought to be necessary for induction of long-lasting protective immunity, a feasible dose interval needs to be determined. Here, boosting with a second dose of a monovalent dengue type 1 (DENV-1) vaccine at four months or six months was compared in flavivirus-na&#x000ef;ve healthy adult subjects with regard to safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity. We found that both doses of the vaccine were safe and well tolerated. While the first dose infected 92&#x00025; of recipients, the second dose was neither infectious nor immunogenic, irrespective of the dose interval. These findings indicate that in most subjects, a single dose of this monovalent vaccine confers sterilizing humoral immunity against a second dose for at least six months.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dengue fever has emerged as the world's most important mosquito-borne viral disease.

Long-term homotypic immunity is induced by a single infection with DENV <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Imrie1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>; however, heterotypic protection is less durable <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Sabin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, and pre-existing immunity to one DENV serotype has been identified as a risk factor for more severe disease upon secondary, heterotypic infection <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Vaughn1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Papaevangelou1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Guzman1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Burke1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Therefore, a DENV vaccine needs to induce long-lived protective immunity against all four DENV serotypes. In order to do so, more than one dose of a live attenuated tetravalent vaccine may be needed <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Morrison1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Sabchareon1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Sabchareon2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Sun2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Simasathien1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Lang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.

Dengue-like illness was not observed in the more than 500 vaccinees evaluated thus far, and vaccine-related serious adverse events (SAEs) did not occur. The most common reactogenicity events were an asymptomatic faint maculopapular rash over the trunk and proximal extremities and a transient neutropenia that lasted 2&#x02013;3 days without associated clinical signs. Specifically, the rDEN1&#x00394;30 vaccine, when evaluated as a single dose of 10<sup>3</sup> PFU administered subcutaneously, caused low-level viremia (10 PFU/mL) in 9/20 vaccinees, starting around day 10 and lasting for approximately three days <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Durbin2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. None of the volunteers developed a dengue-like illness, nor did any report vaccine-related reactogenicity that interfered with daily activities. Compared to placebo recipients, a significant increase in the occurrence of any solicited clinical sign or laboratory finding other than asymptomatic rash and neutropenia, was not observed in vaccinees.

The 4-month dosing interval was chosen because evaluation of tetravalent dengue vaccine formulations containing rDEN1&#x00394;30 demonstrated that neutralizing antibody responses in rhesus macaques could be boosted with a second dose of vaccine given at 4 months (but not at 1 month) post dose one <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Sabin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001267-BlaneyJE2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.

Two cohorts of 30 subjects were recruited to receive two doses of the rDEN1&#x00394;30 vaccine or placebo with the second dose given either on Day 120 or on Day 180 after dose 1. While the first dose of DEN1&#x00394;30 was safe, infectious, and immunogenic in 92&#x00025; of the vaccinees, the second dose of the vaccine, given at either interval, did not cause detectable viremia and did not boost neutralizing antibody titers, indicating that a single dose of monovalent DEN1&#x00394;30 vaccine induced sterilizing humoral immunity against a second dose of this vaccine for at least 6 months.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The study was performed under a NIAID-held investigational new drug application (BB-IND #11677) reviewed by the US Food and Drug Administration.

Study subjects were enrolled between May 2007 and July 2008 under study protocol CIR-229, registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as Study NCT00473135. The study was designed to evaluate the safety of two doses of the rDEN1&#x00394;30 vaccine, given at day 0 and again at day 120 or day 180, and to evaluate the virologic and serologic response to the vaccine after dose 1 and dose 2.

Within each cohort, subjects were randomized such that 25 would receive vaccine and 5 would receive placebo. A sample size of 25 vaccinees and 5 placebo recipients in each cohort was chosen based on our previous Phase I trial of this candidate DENV-1 vaccine <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Durbin2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and to expand the safety evaluation of this vaccine. Subjects were randomized using a random number generator, by a member of the CIR who was not involved in the clinical or laboratory evaluation of the subjects. Subjects who had been enrolled could be replaced until study day 42 following first vaccination if they did not complete study day 28 or study day 42, or if their specimens were not usable in the immunological assessment at study day 42 due to protocol-defined reasons. If a volunteer was replaced, the safety data and viremia data for that subject, up to the point of replacement, were included in the analysis. Subjects retained the same treatment assignment as the subject they replaced and the treatment assignment remained blinded.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study Population</title><p>Healthy adult male and non-pregnant female volunteers were recruited from the Baltimore, Maryland and Washington DC metropolitan areas. Written informed consent was obtained from each volunteer in accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR 50) and International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (ICH E6). Healthy volunteers 18 to 50 years of age were enrolled if they met the following eligibility criteria: normal findings during physical examination; negative for antibodies to all DENV serotypes, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus; negative for hepatitis B and C; negative for HIV; normal values for complete blood count (CBC) with differential, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine, coagulation studies, and urinalysis. Additional safety-related exclusion criteria were also applied. Female volunteers were required to have a negative result on a urine pregnancy test at screening and on each vaccination day and were required to use a reliable method of contraception.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Clinical Procedures and Evaluation</title><p>On study day 0, volunteers reported to the CIR outpatient clinic and were randomly assigned to receive either vaccine or placebo (vaccine diluent) given as a 0.5 mL subcutaneous injection. The appearance of the vaccine and placebo was identical. All study staff involved in the clinical and laboratory assessment of the subjects remained blinded to the treatment assignment until the study was unblinded at study day 42 following the second vaccination. Subjects were monitored for immediate adverse reactions for at least 30 minutes after vaccination. Each subject was given a digital thermometer and a diary card to record his/her oral temperature three times per day for 16 days. Clinical assessments were performed every other day through study day 16 and again on study days 21, 28 and 42 post-vaccination. During clinical visits, a medical provider performed a focused physical examination to evaluate for local reactogenicity (pain, erythema and swelling at the injection site) and systemic reactogenicity (lymphadenopathy, photophobia, rash, and hepatomegaly) and questioned subjects specifically about dengue-related symptoms (fever, headache, retro-orbital pain, nausea, photophobia, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, and rash). These signs and symptoms as well as the specific clinical laboratory studies described below were classified as solicited reactogenicity. In addition, subjects were questioned at each visit about other intercurrent illnesses. For each dose, blood was drawn at each assessment for detection of viremia through study day 16 post-vaccination and for antibody assay on study days 0, 28 and 42 post-vaccination. Prior to vaccination, baseline CBC with differential, ALT and/or AST and coagulation studies were obtained. After each vaccination, a CBC with differential was obtained every other day through study day 16. Coagulation studies were done every fourth day through study day 16 post-vaccination and again at day 28 post-vaccination. Serum for ALT testing was collected every other day from study day 4 through day 16 and again on study day 21 post-vaccination. Subjects returned to the clinic at study day 90 (cohort 1) or study day 150 (cohort 2) for repeat HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C testing and to assess for continued eligibility for second vaccination. Exclusion criteria for second vaccination included positive HIV-1 serology, active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection, pregnancy, receipt of a live vaccine within 4 weeks prior to second vaccination or a killed vaccine within 2 weeks prior to second vaccination, use of immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids (excluding topical or nasal) or immunosuppressive drugs within 30 days prior to second vaccination, receipt of an investigational agent in the 30 days prior to second vaccination, or history of severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis associated with first vaccination. Clinical and laboratory assessments following the second vaccination were identical to the first vaccination throughout the 42-day follow-up period. All adverse events were graded for intensity and relationship to vaccine. Fever was determined by oral temperature recorded on two consecutive measurements 1 hour or more apart and was defined as grade 1 (38.0&#x000b0;C&#x02013;38.6&#x000b0;C), grade 2 (38.7&#x000b0;C&#x02013;39.1&#x000b0;C), or grade 3 (&#x0003e;39.1&#x000b0;C).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Adverse Events</title><p>Adverse events were graded as mild (no effect on daily activity), moderate (required an intervention or interfered with daily activity), or severe (prevented daily activity).

For comparison of the PRNT<sub>60</sub> values induced by the different vaccine lots, the day 42 samples collected during the previous clinical trial of rDEN1&#x00394;30 were assayed in parallel with those collected during this trial. Seroconversion was defined as a &#x02265;4-fold rise in serum neutralizing antibody to wild-type DENV-1 by study day 42 following each vaccination. Following first vaccination, this corresponded to a PRNT<sub>60</sub> of &#x02265;1&#x02236;20 as all subjects were flavivirus na&#x000ef;ve (PRNT<sub>60</sub>&#x0003c;1&#x02236;5). Following second vaccination, the titer obtained on day 42 post-second vaccination (day 162 or day 222) was compared with the titer from Study Day 120 or Study Day 180.

The mean onset of rash was study day 12.8&#x000b1;0.4 and the mean duration was 11&#x000b1;2.2 days. Because the rash was not noticed by the majority of the volunteers, the reported duration of rash may be longer than its actual duration because subjects were not seen between study days 21 and 28 and the rash was not determined to be resolved until the subject was evaluated by a clinician at study day 28. There were 39 episodes of headache reported by 21 vaccinees throughout the 42-day post-vaccination period. The mean duration of headache was 2.2&#x000b1;0.6 days with a mean day of onset of 10.1&#x000b1;1.2. Sixty-nine percent of headache episodes were of mild severity and 31&#x00025; were of moderate severity.

Three vaccinees (6&#x00025;) reported a mild myalgia lasting 3&#x02013;5 days; one vaccinee reported moderate myalgia lasting 2 days.

The onset of neutropenia ranged from Study Day 4 to Study Day 16, [mean day of onset &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;11.8&#x000b1;0.7 (SE)] and resolved in all subjects. The mean duration of neutropenia in vaccinees was 2.4 days &#x000b1;0.3 days. Four of 5 subjects with severe neutropenia had an ANC&#x0003c;750/mm<sup>3</sup> on a single day and one subject had an ANC&#x0003c;750/mm<sup>3</sup> on days 12 and 14. Two of 11 placebo recipients (18&#x00025;) developed neutropenia, both episodes were mild.

At a minimum, such a vaccine must have an acceptable safety profile and must induce long-lived protective immunity against all four serotypes of wild type dengue virus. Ideally this would be accomplished with a single dose of vaccine. However, tetravalent vaccines currently in clinical development require two or three doses <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Morrison1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Sun2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. A number of dengue viruses have been attenuated either by serial passage in tissue culture or by the introduction of attenuating mutations and/or chimerization of dengue viruses using recombinant DNA technology <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Whitehead1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Guirakhoo1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Guirakhoo2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Durbin5" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Guy1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.

Other investigational vaccines have been abandoned because they were either under or over-attenuated <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Sabchareon1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Sabchareon2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Edelman1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Kitchener1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In addition, there are concerns that viral interference may affect the ability of a live attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine to induce a balanced immune response to all four serotypes. For these reasons, we have attempted to carefully examine the safety profile and humoral immune response to each monovalent DENV vaccine candidate virus prior to formulating a tetravalent vaccine. Clinical examination and laboratory studies performed every other day for the first 16 days post vaccination have helped to fully characterize the reactogenicity and kinetics of replication of these viruses when given as monovalent vaccines.</p><p>The ability of live attenuated dengue vaccines to induce a satisfactory antibody response without clinically significant reactogenicity has been a hurdle to DENV vaccine development. There are few published studies of monovalent DENV-1 vaccines to which we can compare the safety and immunogenicity of rDEN1&#x00394;30 in healthy adult subjects. Three such studies describe the DENV-1 vaccine candidates 16007, 45AZ5 PDK20, and 45AZ5 PDK27 <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Kanesathasan1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Edelman2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. These candidates were attenuated by serial passage in tissue culture, and the parent virus of 45AZ5 PDK20 and 45AZ5 PDK27 underwent chemical mutagenesis prior to passage in tissue culture. Five subjects received DENV-1 16007 as a monovalent vaccine and 12 subjects received 45AZ5 PDK20. Vaccine candidate 16007 was well tolerated: none of the subjects developed an oral temperature &#x0003e;38&#x000b0;C, one subject developed a rash and 2 subjects developed elevated liver function tests <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Kanesathasan1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. However, only 60&#x00025; of vaccinees seroconverted to the vaccine as defined as a PRNT<sub>50</sub> &#x02265;1&#x02236;10.In contrast, 100&#x00025; of vaccinees seroconverted to DEN1 after receipt of the monovalent DENV-1 vaccine 45AZ5 PDK20; however, 5/12 subjects developed a temperature &#x0003e;38&#x000b0;C and 3/12 developed dengue-like illness <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Additionally, 20&#x00025; to 35&#x00025; of subjects who received a tetravalent formulation containing 45AZ5 PDK20 developed a temperature of &#x0003e;38&#x000b0;C <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Sun2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The further passaged DENV-1 candidate vaccine 45AZ5 PDK27 was evaluated as a monovalent DENV-1 vaccine in 10 subjects and was found to be more attenuated than 45AZ5 PDK20 <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Edelman2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. While the reactogenicity profile of 45AZ5 PDK27 was acceptable, only 40&#x00025; of vaccinees seroconverted to DENV-1 following a single dose of 45AZ5 PDK27 <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Edelman2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Although 45AZ5 PDK27 was less immunogenic than 45AZ5 PDK20, it has replaced 45AZ5 PDK27 in the tetravalent formulations currently under evaluation, illustrating the trade-off that is sometimes necessary to balance reactogenicity and immunogenicity. Thus, achieving a satisfactory balance between attenuation and immunogenicity has been difficult to attain by passage and/or mutagenesis of DENV-1. In the rDEN1&#x00394;30 vaccine virus, the attenuating 30 nucleotide deletion is located in the 3&#x02032; UTR but the virus is otherwise wild-type. This might have contributed to its high level of infectivity and immunogenicity.</p><p>The promising safety profile of the rDEN1&#x00394;30 vaccine described in a previous single-dose study was affirmed in the current two-dose study <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Durbin2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. None of the subjects developed fever, a dengue-like illness or any study-related SAE. All of the clinical solicited adverse events were mild or moderate in severity and were transient in nature. As we have reported for our previous dengue vaccine studies, neutropenia and rash were the most commonly reported adverse events in subjects who received rDEN1&#x00394;30. As was seen in the previous study of this vaccine candidate, the onset of neutropenia and rash generally followed the onset of viremia. The definition of neutropenia used in our studies is more inclusive than that utilized in many other dengue vaccine studies. We defined neutropenia as an ANC of &#x02264;1500/mm<sup>3</sup> and obtained blood counts every other day for the first 16 days after vaccination; other studies of leading dengue vaccine candidates have defined neutropenia as an ANC&#x0003c;1,000/mm<sup>3</sup> with less frequent monitoring, e.g. only on day 15, or on days 4, 8, 12, and 16 post vaccination <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Morrison1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Sun2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Lang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Had we used an ANC&#x0003c;1,000/mm<sup>3</sup> to define neutropenia our studies, only 2/71 (ANC measured on day 16 only) or 5/71 (ANC measured on days 4, 8, 12, and 16 only) vaccine recipients would have been described as neutropenic, a rate of neutropenia comparable to that reported in the studies indicated above. In addition, more than 60&#x00025; of our study subjects were of African descent, a population known to maintain a lower mean baseline ANC <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Haddy1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Hsieh1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Reed1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. In comparison, subjects of African descent made up only 5&#x02013;33&#x00025; of volunteers in the studies referenced above. Most importantly, the very short duration of neutropenia observed in recipients of rDEN1&#x00394;30 was not associated with fever or other clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of neutropenia-related illness. In contrast to neutropenia associated with neoplasia or therapeutic interventions, we assume that neutrophil function during DENV infection or following vaccination with a live-attenuated DENV vaccine is not compromised and that the short duration of neutropenia does not compromise protective immune functions. Our monovalent DENV vaccines have been evaluated in approximately 500 subjects thus far and fever of unknown origin or any sign or symptom suggestive of opportunistic infections has not been observed. To our knowledge, neutropenia due to natural dengue illness has not been associated with secondary bacteremia. A review of cases of concomitant bacteremia in patients diagnosed with DHF found that leukopenia was not associated with an increased incidence of bacteremia compared with control patients <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p><p>The investigational vaccine rDEN1&#x00394;30 appears to have a well-balanced safety and immunogenicity profile. In addition to the acceptable reactogenicity of rDEN1&#x00394;30 described above, the vaccine was able to induce an overall seroconversion rate of 93&#x00025; (65/70 subjects) when administered as a single subcutaneous dose to flavivirus-na&#x000ef;ve healthy adults. Importantly, the immunogenicity end-point used in both this and our previously reported study of rDEN1&#x00394;30 was a 4-fold rise in serum neutralizing antibody (i.e., a PRNT<sub>60</sub> titer of &#x02265;1&#x02236;20 defined seroconversion) and is more stringent compared with a PRNT<sub>50</sub> titer of &#x02265;1&#x02236;10 used by others in the studies described above. In addition to the high seroconversion rate that was achieved following a single dose of vaccine, rDEN1&#x00394;30 induced sterilizing humoral immunity to infection with a second dose of vaccine administered 4 or 6 months later in the vast majority of vaccinees, a finding that could be indicative of long-term homotypic protection as has been described following natural DENV infection <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Sabin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001267-Halstead2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, the four subjects who did not develop detectable neutralizing antibody after the first dose of rDEN1&#x00394;30 could not be infected by a second dose of vaccine given 4 months later. Following dose 1, one of the 4 subjects had laboratory findings consistent with infection by the vaccine virus, and another subject had findings that may be suggestive of infection by the vaccine virus. The former had detectable viremia on study day 12 and a mild neutropenia on study day 16, and the latter subject was mildly neutropenic on study day 4 following first vaccination. The other two subjects did not have clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of infection. Of these four subjects, three received a second dose of vaccine but did not develop a detectable neutralizing antibody response following dose 2. It is unclear whether these individuals were vaccine non-responders, completely resistant to infection, or whether their innate immune system was able to abort infection prior to the induction of an antibody response. Loss of vaccine potency was excluded as a cause for the absence of infection following dose 2.</p><p>This study has important implications for the development of a live attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine. First, the expanded safety evaluation of the monovalent rDEN1&#x00394;30 vaccine confirmed it to be well tolerated without vaccine-related fever or dengue-like illness. Second, the vaccine was able to induce seroconversion to DENV-1 in 93&#x00025; of recipients when given as a single subcutaneous dose of 10<sup>3</sup> PFU. The 10<sup>3</sup> PFU dose required for the induction of seroconversion to DENV-1 and the ability to grow this virus to high titer (&#x0003e;10<sup>7</sup> PFU/mL), make this a very economical vaccine component to produce. Third, the vaccine virus behaved immunologically much like wild-type virus in that sterilizing homotypic immunity was induced after a single dose. It is unknown whether this will make boosting of the humoral response to DENV-1 more difficult should multiple doses of the tetravalent vaccine be required. It is also not known whether the observed protection against a second dose of vaccine virus will translate into protection against infection/disease following exposure to wild type DENV-1 virus after vaccination. Future studies with tetravalent vaccine will need to evaluate whether boosting is necessary and will need to be designed to determine a suitable interval for boosting. Lastly, because the replication kinetics of this virus have been very well characterized as a monovalent vaccine, any effect of viral interference on the replication kinetics of the vaccine when administered as part of a tetravalent formulation should be discernable. In summary, rDEN1&#x00394;30 is an excellent candidate for inclusion in live tetravalent dengue vaccine formulations, and clinical evaluation of tetravalent dengue vaccines with this rDEN1&#x00394;30 as DENV-1 component have been initiated.</p><p>Our study has at least two potential limitations regarding the infectivity, safety, and immunogenicity of rDEN1&#x00394;30 when administered as a component of a tetravalent formulation. First, sterilizing humoral immunity to a second dose of monovalent rDEN1&#x00394;30 vaccine at 6 months might not translate into sterilizing humoral immunity six months after vaccination with a tetravalent vaccine. It is not known whether or not the high seroconversion rates achieved following a single dose of the rDEN1&#x00394;30 vaccine, when given as a monovalent virus, will be achievable when the candidate vaccine is included in a tetravalent formulation. Secondly, the results of our studies in flavivirus-naive healthy adults do not necessarily mirror how this investigational vaccine will behave in flavivirus-naive and partially immune children, one of the target groups for vaccination in several hyperendemic areas. Tetravalent vaccine studies will need to carefully proceed from adults into children and from flavivirus-naive into partially immune individuals to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in these vulnerable populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0001267.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>Consort checklist.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0001267.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0001267.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0001267.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0001267.s003"><label>Text S1</label><caption><p>IRB approvals.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0001267.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0001267.s004"><label>Text S2</label><caption><p>NIH cover sheet.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0001267.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank the Regulatory Compliance and Human Subjects Protection Program within the NIAID Division of Clinical Research, the NIAID Data Safety Monitoring Board, the staff at JHSPH, and all the volunteers without whom this study would not have been possible.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>This study was funded and sponsored by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health.
