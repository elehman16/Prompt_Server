Participants recruited inconsultation were younger, had more severe Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure scores and were more likely to withdraw than self-referrals. Parents of 20 (10%) of all the randomised participants reported using the allocated emollient daily for 84&#x02005;days. The use of other non-study emollients was common. Completeness of data collected by parent-held daily diaries and at monthly study visits was good. Daily diaries were liked (81%) but mainly completed on paper rather than via electronic (&#x02018;app&#x02019;) form. Major costs drivers were general practitioner consultations and eczema-related prescriptions.

Incidence peaks in the first 2&#x02005;years of life and decreases thereafter.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It is characterised by dry and itchy skin, and it can have a significant impact on the quality of a child's life and their family.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>In countries with strong systems of primary care, such as the UK, the majority of children with eczema are diagnosed and managed by their family physician or general practitioner (GP) with emollients and topical corticosteroids. Emollients are recommended for the majority of patients and they are primarily used as a &#x02018;leave on&#x02019; treatment to reduce eczema symptoms. Applied directly to the skin, emollients reduce water loss by occlusion and/or directly adding water to the dry outer layers of the skin. However, there are many products and formulations available (lotions, creams, gels and ointments) that vary in their consistency from &#x02018;light&#x02019; to &#x02018;heavy&#x02019;. Despite claims from the manufacturers, evidence that any one is better than another is weak.</p><p>Two recent systematic reviews have highlighted a paucity of research to help guide clinicians and patients in their choice.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In summary, the field is characterised by a lack of good quality, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) directly comparing commonly used emollients, with medium-term to long-term data on clinically relevant outcomes. While undertaking this research represents unique challenges, such as the range of possible emollients to compare and the inability to mask users to emollients of very different consistencies (eg, lotion vs ointment), patients and clinicians have highlighted it as an important issue. In the recent James Lind Alliance eczema treatment research priority setting partnership, &#x02018;Which emollients are the most effective and safe in treating eczema?&#x02019; emerged as one of the highest ranked uncertainties for further research.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>In order to address this uncertainty, we wanted to undertake an RCT of commonly prescribed emollients for the treatment of childhood eczema in primary care. However, the feasibility of being able to conduct such a trial was questionable, because of key issues such as whether parents/carers would be willing to be assigned and use a randomly allocated emollient for several months, and uncertainty about optimal methods of recruitment and data collection. Therefore, we conducted a trial to determine the feasibility of recruiting, retaining and collecting outcome data on young children with eczema in a primary care setting, to inform the design of a full trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design, participants and interventions</title><p>Full details can be found in the protocol paper.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In brief, COMET was a feasibility study of a pragmatic, observer-blinded, RCT to compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness of &#x02018;leave on&#x02019; emollients in the treatment of children with eczema. Throughout this paper, we will use the term &#x02018;parent&#x02019; to denote all carers/guardians with parental responsibility.</p><p>Between July 2014 and April 2015, participants were recruited in primary care (general practice) via two pathways: &#x02018;self-referral&#x02019; (usually in response to a letter sent by their practice inviting them to take part) or &#x02018;inconsultation&#x02019; (an approach during a surgery visit by GP/practice nurse (PN), who also received consent and undertook randomisation). GPs/PNs were asked to record all approaches to potentially eligible participants on a &#x02018;recruitment log&#x02019;. At the end of the study practices also undertook searches to identify the number of potentially eligible children who had at least one contact with the practice during the recruitment period.</p><p>To be eligible, children had to have eczema, be aged 1&#x02005;month to under 5&#x02005;years and not be known to be sensitive or allergic to any of the study emollients or their constituents. Participants were randomly allocated by a web-based system (1:1:1:1 ratio) to one of four emollients (Aveeno lotion 400&#x02005;mL, Diprobase cream 500&#x02005;g, Doublebase gel 500&#x02005;g, Hydromol ointment 500&#x02005;g) to use as their leave-on emollient with the directions to &#x02018;Use twice daily and when required&#x02019;. Study emollients were prescribed for the duration of the study by participants' GP surgeries and issued by pharmacies, as per usual care. The trial manager telephoned participants 1&#x02005;week after randomisation to ensure that the allocated treatment had been received and started. All other care (appointments, prescriptions, referrals) was as per usual care. Research team members (&#x02018;observers&#x02019;) undertaking the baseline and follow-up visits (but not clinicians, parents or participants) were blinded to emollient allocation.</p><p>Three key changes to the original protocol were implemented in the final 4&#x02005;months of recruitment. First, the diagnostic criterion was relaxed from &#x02018;doctor diagnosis of eczema&#x02019; to &#x02018;diagnosed by a doctor or an appropriately qualified health care professional with oversight from a medically qualified doctor&#x02019;. Second, the upper age limit was raised from under 3&#x02005;years to under 5&#x02005;years of age. Third, the number of practices was increased from 16 to 22. These additional practices were only asked to do the mail-out, not use the inconsultation recruitment pathway as well.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Participants were followed-up for 12&#x02005;weeks (84&#x02005;days). During this time, study visits were scheduled to take place 28, 56 and 84&#x02005;days after baseline and parents were asked to complete a daily diary (paper and electronic &#x02018;app&#x02019; versions were offered). In addition, the primary care electronic medical records (EMR) were reviewed for the 3&#x02005;months participants were in the study.</p><p>Data were collected on:

Of the 1849 invitation letters sent, responses were received from 20% (374/1849) with 66% (246/374) declining to take part. Again, the most common reason for not taking part was the child having either no or only mild eczema (62%, 152/246). A further 4 children were recruited by word-of-mouth or after seeing a study poster/being given a study flyer, giving a total of 132 potentially eligible participants who were screened by the research team. Of these, 19% (25/132) were not recruited, mainly because the carer could not be contacted (12/25, 48%).</p><p>Recruitment by inconsultation pathway: Retrospective searches identified 2552 potentially eligible children who had at least 1 contact with their practice, and therefore could have been approached via this pathway. Recording of these contacts by clinicians was poor, with only 6 practices returning &#x02018;recruitment logs&#x02019;, which detailed 66 encounters. Of these, the most common reasons given for not recruiting were that clinicians either forgot to ask or were too busy (47%, 31/66).</p><p>The majority of participants (62%, 54/87) recruited during the first 6&#x02005;months came via the self-referral pathway (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">supplementary figure S1</xref>). However, during the final 4&#x02005;months of recruitment, the number of inconsultation referrals increased so that by the end of the study, 90 (46%) of the total 197 participants came via this route.

treatments (n=25), clothes (n=14), household items (n=12), toiletries (n=11) and food and drink (n=9). Time off paid employment or school/day care was reported infrequently: over the entire follow-up period, only 3&#x02005;days off paid employment and 2&#x02005;days off school/day care were reported across all participants.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first study to show that it is feasible in a primary care setting to recruit and randomise young children with eczema to &#x02018;leave-on&#x02019; emollients and follow them up, keeping observers blinded to their allocation. We exceeded our recruitment target, although in the final 4&#x02005;months, we enlisted the help of six more practices than originally planned and relaxed the age and diagnostic eligibility criteria. Reported daily use of the study emollients was low, however, and the use of other emollients was common.</p><p>We conducted a well-executed, pragmatic trial overcoming many practical and logistical challenges, meeting regulatory requirements of a Controlled Trial of an Investigational Medicinal Product (CTIMP). More detail on trial conduct can be found in the published trial protocol<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and we report the findings in accordance with the CONSORT guidelines.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> These findings have implications for future trials of emollients and other treatments for children with eczema, but also for trials of treatments of other long-term conditions in primary care with medium-term follow-up.</p><p>A strength of this study is its exploration of the two possible recruitment pathways and their feasibility in a main trial. By asking most practices to try and recruit via the two routes, we now have a strong understanding of the number (and characteristics) of children likely to be recruited in a definitive trial, and the proportion likely to withdraw (and reasons why). While having the two pathways into the study helped the trial meet its recruitment target, we are mindful that the characteristics of participants, and their commitment to staying in the trial differed for participants recruited via these two routes. Of 90 participants recruited via the inconsultation pathway, 21 (23%) withdrew and 53 (59%) attended their final appointment, compared with 7 (7%) and 98 (92%), respectively, for participants recruited via self-referral (most mail-out). With respect to the mail-out invitation, the high number of children identified with mild or no eczema reflects the fact that for many, their diagnosis will be historical and for others, erroneous. One way to improve this may be to limit invitations to children with a recent relevant prescription (suggesting &#x02018;active&#x02019; disease), as per the BATHE study.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The rise in the rate of children recruited inconsultation may reflect both the staggered nature in which the practices came into the study but also a learning and confidence effect among recruiting clinicians. Although all practices were members of the Clinical Research Network, they had variable levels of experience in recruiting to studies of this type and each study has its unique processes that have to be followed.</p><p>In addition to investigating recruitment and retention, we have also collected important adherence, outcome (including corneometry) and health economic data. We found that it is feasible to collect and cost the data required to perform an economic evaluation in this setting. EMR records provided a rich source of complete healthcare resource use data, indicating that in further studies, healthcare resource use collected from diaries could be reduced. Given that time away from paid employment and school were very rarely reported, capturing these data in a future trial would likely be less important. Our assessment of additional items bought due to eczema has highlighted a list of important categories to include in future studies. At inception, no generic measure of health-related quality of life that was psychometrically and conceptually robust enough for young children under the age of 3 was available. For this reason, we used the ADQoL, from which we were able to estimate QALYs. However, given that this is a condition-specific preference-based measure, the results may not be comparable across conditions.</p><p>Reported use of study emollients was low and use of other emollients either alongside or instead of the allocated treatment common, but our ability to interpret these findings is limited by missing data. While completion of the daily diary was generally good, questions on the use of eczema treatments (including study emollient) were the most poorly completed. We think this is because parents left an item blank when a treatment was not used, rather than recording &#x02018;None&#x02019; or &#x02018;0&#x02019;, meaning it was classed as &#x02018;missing&#x02019;. For example, if missing data on &#x02018;other&#x02019; emollient use are treated as &#x02018;no use&#x02019; on those days for which complete data are available on the use of the study emollient, then only 6% (10/162) (compared with 25%) of parents of participants used a non-study emollient every day and 71% of parents of participants (115/162) (compared with 51%) reported using another emollient on up to 50% of days. Another limitation in the data on emollient use is that we are unable to distinguish between use as leave-on therapy (in the same way as the study emollients) and use as soap substitute. Missing data would have been less of a problem had the &#x02018;app&#x02019; version of the diary worked better and been used by more parents&#x02014;one of the attractions of collecting data from parents this way is the ability to automatically monitor data entry in real time and prompt parents to answer all the questions.</p><p>Although initial interest among parents in using our &#x02018;app&#x02019; was high, its development and incorporation in this study was challenging because: (1) regulatory requirements for CTIMPs meant, additional and time-consuming testing to ensure that data were transmitted securely; and (2) the cost required to develop a fully functional app for the most common smart phone and tablet platforms (iOS and Android). Therefore, while we cannot conclude that studies similar to ours should not consider data collection via bespoke apps, we would certainly caution against underestimating the time, cost and technical implications of doing this. In future studies, automatic email prompts to parents to complete online questionnaires are probably a safer and more cost-effective way of maximising data collection. For parents who would still prefer paper questionnaires, clear instructions should be given about the importance of positively indicating &#x02018;no treatment use&#x02019; (as opposed to leaving an answer blank). We also recommend that future studies involving young children should be realistic about parents' ability to adhere to strict follow-up schedules, with study protocols providing realistic &#x02018;windows&#x02019; (eg, &#x000b1;10&#x02005;days if permissible) within which to expect data collection; and where it is desirable to keep the observer blinded, giving unambiguous instructions to parents to avoid accidental disclosure.</p><p>For future trials comparing emollients, researchers should be encouraged that participants who consent to taking part generally stay in the trial, although they may wish to recruit participants using just the self-referral pathway. Researchers also need to be aware that couse of emollients appears to be common, and the extent to which this matters will depend on where future studies sit on the efficacy&#x02013;effectiveness spectrum. Whatever the design, this study provides the foundations for future definitive studies to answer the prioritised research question &#x02018;Which emollient is the most effective and safe in treating eczema?&#x02019;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank all the children, parents and surgeries who took part in the study and the joint Trial Steering/Data Monitoring Committee (TS/DM-C) and Dr Stephanie MacNeill for her assistance in analysing the adherence data.
