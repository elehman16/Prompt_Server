We used a two-dimensional RT device, so only the length of the esophagus exposed to radiation was analyzed. The lengths of esophagi ranged between 14 and 21 cm. The length of esophagus exposed to the radiation was not associated with the grade of radiation-induced esophagitis, so there were no statistically significant differences between them.</p><p>Metabolized enteral glutamine has similar advanced intestinal protection as the parenteral form [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Either an enteral or parenteral form of glutamine should be given to patients for nutritional support [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. During metabolic stress, and active tumor growth, 20 &#x003b3; to 40 &#x003b3; of glutamine should be applied. Due to costs, glutamine powder forms should be preferred to pills and capsules. The powder form is easy to use and is more absorbable and tolerable. Higher doses of glutamine in this form can be applied to protect intestinal epithelium. Oral glutamine is given three times a day to increase cell connections [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Oral glutamine intake before, during, and after RT is recommended in some studies to prevent, delay, and repair radiation-induced esophagitis [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In our study, a powder form of oral glutamine was applied (30 &#x003b3; per day) by dividing three equal doses during thoracic RT and for three weeks after treatment, like all of these studies. Oral glutamine application before RT was not possible since our study was retrospective. There is a great need for prospective studies with more patients to obtain more accurate results.</p><p>Kozelsky <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] gave oral glutamine to patients and reported that there were no statistically significant differences between the patient group and the control group, who did not receive glutamine, according to incidence and grade of radiation-induced diarrhea, in a 129-patient randomized trial.</p><p>Some clinical studies indicate that oral glutamine and L-alanyl-L-glutamine prevent mucositis [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Cerchietti <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] determined that intravenous L-alanyl-L-glutamine prevented chemotherapy-induced mucositis in head and neck cancer patients. Also, some other studies reported similar results. However, several studies claim that oral glutamine's protective effect on chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis is insufficient [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Savarese <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] reviewed human and animal trials over a 23-year period and reported that oral glutamine decreased the grade and incidence of chemotherapy-induced mucositis, irinotecan-induced diarrhea, neuropathy caused by paclitaxel, hepatic veno-occlusive diseases after high-dose chemotherapy or root cell transplantation, and anthracycline cardiotoxicity.</p><p>In a 70-patient randomized study, Daniele <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] reported that 18 g of oral glutamine per day decreased the incidence and severity of diarrhea caused by 5-fluorouracil.</p><p>In conclusion, in this retrospective study, we aimed to determine the protective effect of oral glutamine on radiation-induced acute esophagitis in patients with lung cancer. We established the reduction of the incidence and severity of acute radiation-induced esophagitis during thoracic irradiation resulting from oral glutamine with the data from our study.</p><p>The results show that oral glutamine may be an effective protector of esophagus from radiation-induced injury in patients receiving thoracic RT. However, based on comparisons of similar studies, clearly, prospective studies with larger populations of patients are needed.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title/><p>The authors declare no conflict of
