The Copenhagen Trial Unit performed the randomisation centrally, using a computer generated block randomisation sequence that was unknown to the investigators. Participant inclusion began in February 2010 and the last patient was randomised in July 2011. Owing to an unequal allocation of the trial participants to one of the two groups in the beginning of the trial (there were only a few participants in one of the groups), the block size was reduced from 12 to 4 and a stratification variable (HDRS score &#x02265;22 points) was removed. The block sizes were at all times unknown to the trial investigators, and the Copenhagen Trial Unit performed these changes without informing the investigators of the changes.

Furthermore, our trial demonstrated the feasibility of conducting the trial with low risks of bias. However, when only 44 out of the planned 84 participants (52%) of the projected sample size is obtained in a trial, it is necessary to interpret the results cautiously. Had this been an interim analysis, any independent safety and data monitoring committee would have recommended continued randomisation and completion of the trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014004903F2">figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014004903F3">3</xref>).<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Furthermore, the two interventions do not seem to have significant differential effects on BDI (subjective depressive symptoms), SCL 90-R (psychological distress) and WHO 5 (well-being).</p><p>Compared with the baseline scores, both intervention groups improved during the trial period on all continuous outcomes. We did not include a control group receiving no intervention in this head-to-head trial so it is unclear whether it was trial intervention effects, regression towards the mean or the natural progression of the disorder in this sample which was responsible for these changes.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> More randomised clinical trials are needed to assess the effects of third-wave cognitive therapy and mentalisation-based treatment for major depressive disorder.</p><sec id="s5a"><title>Strengths</title><p>First of all, the trial was conducted with an overall high level of methodological quality and we assessed the validity of the trial results according to the procedure proposed by Jakobsen <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, including adjusting the thresholds for significance according to the number of randomised participants and the planned sample size. We also proved the feasibility of our trial design, which can be used for larger trials provided that funding can be raised. Our trial has a number of additional strengths: (1) The trial protocol was registered before randomisation began at ClinicalTrials.gov. In this protocol the outcome hierarchy and plans for analyses were presented. Our trial was altogether conducted according to good clinical research practice, with low risk of bias (adequate allocation sequence generation, adequate allocation concealment, adequate blinding, no risk of selective outcome reporting, low risk of incomplete outcome data bias, no risk of &#x02018;for profit&#x02019; bias) and a high degree of external validity.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40&#x02013;44</xref> (2) Both of the trial interventions were conducted using manuals (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ctu.dk/publications/supplementary-material.aspx">http://ctu.dk/publications/supplementary-material.aspx</ext-link>) and adherence to the manuals was assessed as relatively high by an independent Danish psychologist trained in mentalisation-based therapy and third-wave cognitive therapy. The manualisation of the trial interventions makes it possible, to some extent, to implement the two trial interventions in clinical practice and to replicate or refute our results in future trials, but both treatment manuals are currently only available in Danish, which limits the possibility for non-Danish speakers to assess the quality of the treatment manuals. We are in the process of translating the third-wave cognitive manual, which will be published at a later time point. The mentalisation-based treatment is described thoroughly elsewhere.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;16</xref> Nevertheless, it is a clear limitation that the manuals are not currently available in English. Both the cognitive therapists and the mentalisation therapists were involved in developing the treatment manuals for the respective psychotherapeutic treatments, which might make the therapist enthusiasm and thoroughness similar in the two intervention groups. (3) We have used the most commonly used outcomes in trials assessing the effects of psychotherapeutic interventions for depression (ie, HDRS and BDI).<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>
<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> This makes it possible to relate our results to results from other trials examining the effects of interventions for depression. Moreover, using HDRS as outcome makes it possible to perform blinded objective outcome assessment, which is a further strength of our trial. (4) The baseline characteristics of the trial participants as well as the psychopharmacological medication in the two groups were comparable which indicates that the randomisation succeeded in allocating comparable participants to the two intervention groups. (5) Only 2 out of the total of 44 participants were not assessed after end of treatment, which decreases the risk of biased results.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> (6) All outcomes suggested that the participants randomised to third-wave cognitive therapy had improved more than the participants randomised to mentalisation-based treatment. This supports the validity of our results, even though most of these differences were non-significant.</p></sec><sec id="s5b"><title>Limitations</title><p>Our trial has a number of limitations. This small-scale trial was in essence failed because we only included 44 out of the planned 84 participants. The trial inclusion lasted for about 2&#x02005;years as planned but we had problems with recruiting participants. Basically, not enough eligible depressed patients were referred to the clinic within the planned trial period. The great advantage of the randomised clinical trial in general is that all known and unknown participant characteristics will be similar at baseline in compared intervention groups.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> However, even though our baseline characteristics indicate similarity between the two groups on assessed baseline characteristics, it is unlikely that all baseline characteristics will be similar when only 44 participants are randomised. The low number of randomised participants in this small-scale trial increases the risks of wrong results due to type I errors, and type II errors<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>
<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> and our adequate trial methodology cannot necessarily compensate for these increased risks. Moreover, our results do not show anything about long-term effects of the two interventions.</p><p>The chief consultant prescribing the psychopharmacological treatment was not blinded to intervention allocation. Although we assessed the psychopharmacological treatment to be comparable in the two randomised groups at cessation of the trial interventions (see online supplementary material 1), the lack of blinding might have influenced the psychopharmacological treatment. The chief consultant is a mentalisation-based therapist and was involved in developing the mentalisation-based treatment manual. The first author and primary investigator conducted the third-wave cognitive therapy and wrote the manual for the third-wave cognitive therapy programme, which may also increase the risks of bias.</p><p>We did not perform power calculations for the secondary outcomes before randomisation began, which is a further limitation. If an analysis of a secondary outcome has a power of less than 80%, then either the secondary outcome should be classified as an exploratory outcome or the p value and the CI thresholds for significance should be adjusted, just as the thresholds are adjusted if a sample size has not been reached.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>Owing to an unequal allocation of the trial participants to one of the two groups in the beginning of the trial, the block size was reduced from 12 to 4 (see &#x02018;Randomisation&#x02019; section). The block sizes were at all times unknown to the trial investigators, and the Copenhagen Trial Unit performed these changes without informing the investigators. However, a block size of four is small making it possible to foresee which group a given eligible participant will be allocated to before randomisation. This might question whether the allocation concealment was effective.</p><p>The trial was conducted at an outpatient psychiatric clinic with special interest for treatment of personality disorders and depressive patients were not routinely refereed to the clinic before the trial began randomisation. Our results showed that a high proportion of the trial participants had comorbid personality disorder and depression. This might explain why the baseline HDRS scores indicated that the trial participants were only moderately depressed although all of the trial participants were on sick leave due to psychological problems. Some of the trial participants might suffer primarily from psychological problem other than depressive symptoms, that is, personality-related problems. We did not assess number of prior depressive episodes in the included participants, which makes it unclear whether our trial results demonstrate intervention effects in participants with a first time depression or recurrent depression. Our results can only be related to patients comparable to our trial participants, that is, patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder on sick leave due to psychiatric problems.</p><p>Highly specialised mentalisation-based treatment was the primary psychotherapeutic method used at the outpatient clinic prior to the trial, the cointerventions (communal breakfast and psychoeducation) were also a part of the treatment programme prior to the trial, and experienced and specialised third-wave cognitive therapists were members of the staff at the psychiatric clinic where the trial was conducted. Furthermore, all patients refereed to the psychiatric clinic were on sick leave due to psychiatric problems, and even though the evidence behind the specialised treatments is lacking we considered that some form of specialised treatment was needed for all patients at the psychiatric clinic. We did, therefore, not consider it ethically justifiable to use a control group receiving no intervention, placebo or only the cointerventions. All these considerations and practical circumstances led to the choice of the psychotherapeutic interventions and the design of this head-to-head trial comparing third-wave cognitive therapy and cointerventions versus mentalisation-based therapy and cointerventions. The cointerventions where delivered similarly to both treatment groups and the possible effects of cointerventions will therefore even out between the compared intervention groups unless there are significant interactions. Nevertheless, it is a clear limitation that our interventions are not and have not been compared versus no intervention or a more simple and basic form of psychotherapy plus cointerventions.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> If a trial comparing the effects of two active interventions shows no difference in effect it is not clear whether the two interventions are equally effective or equally ineffective&#x02014;and if an experimental intervention seem superior compared with a control intervention then the effect size of the experimental intervention will be unclear because any beneficial or harmful effects of the control intervention might influence the trial results.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> All interventions should be assessed versus no intervention before being introduced into clinical practice.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Furthermore, the combination of specialised psychotherapy and cointerventions constitute a relatively comprehensive treatment, which might not always be accessible to psychiatric patients in clinical practice&#x02014;this might limit the generalisability of our results.</p></sec><sec id="s5c"><title>Mentalisation-based treatment</title><p>We did not find any relevant treatment manual we could use for the mentalisation-based treatment, and we therefore created our own manual (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ctu.dk/publications/supplementary-material.aspx">http://ctu.dk/publications/supplementary-material.aspx</ext-link>).<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The therapists in the mentalisation-based treatment group were educated and experienced in psychodynamic therapy and group therapy and had underwent basic training and education in mentalisation-based treatment according to Bateman and Karterud.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;16</xref> Mentalisation-based treatment was originally designed to treat borderline personality.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Few participants were diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2014004903TB1">table 1</xref>), and it can be argued that mentalisation-based treatment was not a relevant intervention for the depressed participants of this trial. However, mentalisation-based treatment is now used to treat a number of different disorders other than borderline personality disorder, including depression.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Furthermore, a study has shown that female inpatients with depression showed a significantly lower capacity for mentalisation compared with healthy controls&#x02014;and deficits in mentalising capacity were related to illness duration, number of admissions and cognitive impairment.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The authors conclude that the investigation of mentalisation may be of particular importance for the development of targeted psychotherapeutic interventions for depression.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p></sec><sec id="s5d"><title>Comorbid personality disorders</title><p>A large proportion of the included participants were diagnosed with cluster C personality disorders (anxious or fearful personality disorders).<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> It has been debated if a diagnosis of a personality disorder is accurate when patients are acutely depressed.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Our results indicate that comorbid personality disorder and depression does not lead to a poorer outcome compared to patients with depression alone&#x02014;but this could be because the diagnoses of the personality disorders in our trial are inaccurate because the depressive symptoms might mimic pathological personality traits. Furthermore, the limited number of included participants significantly reduces the power of this analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s5e"><title>BDI compared to HDRS as outcome</title><p>It is a common belief among clinicians that BDI is a more &#x02018;reactive&#x02019; outcome than HDRS,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> and it might be surprising to some why we identified a borderline significant effect on the HDRS results but no significant effect on the BDI. However, two systematic reviews with meta-analysis have included trials that simultaneously used HDRS and BDI to assess the effects of the same interventions.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>
<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> The results showed that BDI under such circumstances shows significantly less effect sizes compared to the HDRS.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>
<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> A greater percentage of participants would be considered improved if ratings of change were based on the HDRS rather than BDI.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> The results from these two reviews<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>
<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> are in agreement with our present results and may explain why we found a borderline significant effect on HDRS and no significant effect on BDI. On the other hand, it is also possible that HDRS compared to BDI overestimates participant improvement.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></p><p>It was impossible to blind the participants to treatment allocation. To ensure some degree of blinding we chose HDRS over BDI because it was possible to perform objective blinded outcome assessment using the HDRS. BDI is a self-administered questionnaire, which makes blinded objective outcome assessment impossible. We therefore expected the results on HDRS to be a more clinically valid compared to the BDI results&#x02014;but we cannot exclude that breaking of blinding and biased assessment of the HDRS may have occurred. In accordance with the CONSORT Statement we did not assess degree of unblinding.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p></sec><sec id="s5f"><title>Implications</title><p>First of all, if a larger more definitive trial has to be conducted then a more realistic estimate of the recruitment rate will be needed and more centres should be involved. On average, we recruited approximately one participant every third week and we expected to be able to recruit approximately one participant every week. Basically, not enough eligible participants were referred to the clinic during the inclusion period and we had to terminate the trial due to economical and practical constraints&#x02014;this was the primary reason why we did not randomise more participants. Before the randomisation began, we did not systematically assess how many participants it was possible to recruit. This should also be carried out before a larger trial is conducted so the sample size can be reached. Moreover, we did not take any specific actions promoting the trial outside the clinic. If a future trial is to be conducted it should be considered to promote the trial through advertising or use of other measures to motivate potential referrers to refer more eligible participants. Besides the problems with recruiting enough participants, it was otherwise feasible to conduct a randomised clinical trial with low risk of bias assessing the effects of third-wave cognitive therapy versus mentalisation-based treatment for major depressive disorder.</p><p>The apparent difference in intervention effect found on the HDRS might be caused by random error (&#x02018;play of chance&#x02019;), unaccounted bias or a signal of a real effect.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have suggested a mean difference between two compared interventions of three HDRS points as a criterion for &#x02018;clinical significance&#x02019;.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> Most interventions for depression, both psychopharmacological as well as psychotherapeutic, rarely exceed having a beneficial effect of more than three HDRS points.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53&#x02013;55</xref> We used an anticipated intervention effect of five HDRS points to estimate the necessary sample size and this anticipated intervention effect was optimistic. Calculating Bayes factor based on the anticipated intervention effect, the observed intervention effect, and the SE of the observed intervention effect shows a Bayes factor of 0.14, which is above the recommended threshold for significance of 0.1.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> This underlines that our results should be regarded as insignificant and that an anticipated intervention effect lower than five HDRS points ought to be used in sample size calculations in future trials assessing the effects of third-wave cognitive therapy and mentalisation-based therapy. We found a mean difference of more than four HDRS points which, compared to other interventions, is relatively high. These results might be used to calculate a necessary sample size in a larger more definitive trial. However, HDRS might not at all be a clinically relevant outcome and other more clinically relevant outcomes might be more valid to use in future trials. Severity of depression as measured by the total HDRS score has failed to predict suicide attempts,<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>
<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> and some publications have questioned the usefulness of the HDRS and concluded that the scale is psychometrically and conceptually flawed.<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>
