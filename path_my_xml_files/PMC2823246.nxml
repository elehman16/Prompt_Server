This indicates that the risk of loosening is determined peroperatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">Ritter et al. 1999</xref>) or that crucial pathophysiological events occurring during the first postoperative months determine the risk of late loosening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">Mj&#x000f6;berg et al. 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">van der Vis et al. 1998a</xref>).</p><p>From radiostereometric (RSA) studies, it has been established that tibial components migrate postoperatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">Ryd et al. 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">Ryd 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">Nilsson et al. 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">Hilding et al. 1995</xref>), mainly by sinking into the bone bed. Most implants have become settled by 6 months to 1 year, but some continue to migrate. A study of 143 knee implants followed longitudinally by RSA showed that all knees that were finally revised due to aseptic loosening had been migrating continuously since the primary implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">Ryd et al. 1995</xref>). Furthermore, continuous migration is associated with inducible displacement, i.e. immediate motion between implant and bone upon loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">Hilding et al. 1995</xref>). Since the tibial component of a knee prosthesis, or the cement surrounding it, rests directly on bone postoperatively, inducible displacement suggests that the superficial layer of the bone has been resorbed and replaced by soft tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">Levitz et al. 1995</xref>).</p><p>The tibial bone bed is likely to be necrotic after surgery, because of trauma and damaged microcirculation. Thus, the remodeling that ensues has similarities with fracture repair or bone modeling rather than with normal remodeling. The coupling between resorption and new bone formation, which is seen in normal remodeling, cannot be expected here. Thus, if the necrotic bone trabeculi are resorbed before new ones are produced, softening and collapse may occur. This may reduce the mechanical support of the prosthesis. If this scenario is correct, reducing resorption would be a more efficacious way of inhibiting or preventing loosening of implants than addressing the pressure in the effective joint space, i.e. the periprosthetic regions that are accessible to joint fluid or the wear particles generated in all joint replacements. Bisphosphonates are effective inhibitors of bone resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">Wise et al. 2005</xref>). Enhancing effects of bisphosphonates on postoperative bone mineral density in distal femurs and proximal tibias after joint replacement have already been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027">Wang et al. 2006</xref>). The effect on fixation of implants, as measured by RSA, has been studied with cemented prostheses and a bisphosphonate (clodronate) given daily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">Hilding et al. 2000</xref>). The aims of our study were to enhance the initial fixation also in uncemented prosthesis and to simplify the treatment by using alendronate administered on a weekly basis. The treatment period was from surgery to 6 months. The primary effect variable was the maximal total point motion, as measured by RSA after 2 years.</p></sec><sec id="S002" sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>60 patients were recruited for this study, after performing power calculations (see below). Inclusion criteria were gonarthrosis stage 3&#x02013;5 according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">Ahlb&#x000e4;ck (1968)</xref>, and age 50&#x02013;80 years. Exclusion criteria were cortisone or bisphosphonate medication, rheumatoid arthritis or any other systemic illness affecting the skeleton, or generally poor health. Patients were randomly allocated to the treatment (alendronate) group or a placebo group. The patients were randomized after surgery by opening a sealed envelope, when the operative procedure had ascertained that the case was suitable for uncemented fixation. Age and sex distribution were similar in the 2 groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>). The patients were informed before they were to be operated with total knee arthroplasty, and written consent was obtained. Merck, Sharp and Dohme provided the tablets, either alendonate (70 mg) or placebo. The unit catering for clinical trials at the pharmacy of Lund University Hospital packed and labeled the tablets, and neither the patients nor the investigators were aware of the coding.</p><table-wrap id="T0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Demographic data</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" id="table1"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean age</th><th colspan="2" rowspan="1">No. of patients</th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">at surgery</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">at surgery </th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">at follow-up</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Alendronate</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">68 (51&#x02013;80)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">30 (17 F)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">24 (14 F)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Placebo</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">69 (54&#x02013;80)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">30 (18 F)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">21 (14 F)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>2 surgeons performed the operations in a standardized manner with an uncemented, non-hydroxyapatite coated, porous-coated total knee prosthesis (Duracon; Stryker Inc.). Tantalum markers of 0.8 mm were implanted in the proximal tibia (8&#x02013;10 markers) and in the plastic insert (4 markers). Radiographs for RSA were taken on the fifth to seventh postoperative day, and at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and 1 and 2 years. 2 films were taken simultaneously at a 90&#x000b0; angle with the knee inside a calibration cage, according to standard RSA. The digitization of the radiographs and the calculations by the programs X-ray, Kindat, and winRSA were performed in Lund. The ethics coSORTtee of Lund University and the Swedish Medical Products Agency approved the protocol of the study.</p><p>On the day after the operation, the patients started the oral medication according to the routine for weekly osteoporosis treatment.</p><p>In order to secure patient compliance a nurse had regular telephone contact with the patients, to ensure that they remembered to take their tablets. The tablets were given to the patients on 3 occasions, the first when leaving hospital after surgery, the second at the 6-week follow-up, and the third after 3 months. After the treatment period, the patient compliance regarding the pharmacological treatment was calculated from the amount of tablets in the packages that were returned.</p><sec id="S2001"><title>Statistics</title><p>The power analysis was mainly based on another study dealing with the specific type of uncemented prosthesis to be used in this study. Prosthetic migration (as maximal total point motion, n = 14) was log-normally distributed with an SD of 0.20. A decrease of 30% meant a difference in log value of 0.15. This yielded a power of 83% to find a significant (p = 0.05) decrease in migration with 2 groups of 30 patients.</p><p>Results were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">Hollis and Campbell 1999</xref>), so that all patients were considered to belong to the group to which they were originally randomized, regardless of whether they took take their tablets or not. Maximum total point motion (MTPM) at 2 years served as primary effect variable, but at all time points the results of segment motion with 6 degrees of freedom were also studied. Segment motion was analyzed using Student&#x02019;s t-test. The primary effect variable was not normally distributed in both groups, and was tested by Mann-Whitney U-test.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S003"><title>Results</title><p>In the alendronate group, 24 patients (14 females) remained after exclusion due to the onset of severe disease causing inability to fulfill treatment (2), RSA problems (3), or unwillingness to complete the study (1).

In uncemented replacement, the bone bed is usually spared from the high-pressure lavage and from the toxic and thermal trauma of polymethylmetacrylate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">Mj&#x000f6;berg 1994</xref>). On the other hand, the mechanical loading of the trabeculae underlying the prosthesis will be unevenly distributed, leading to local overload, microfractures and increased sinking, compared to cemented prostheses. Regardless of whether the prosthesis is cemented or not, loss of primary stability will lead to formation of a fibrous membrane, and micromotion will prevent osseous anchorage from being re-established. The membrane thus formed may then allow further osteolysis with time, due to fluid pressure effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">Robertsson et al. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">Aspenberg and van der Vis 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">Van der Vis et al. 1998b</xref>) or possibly effects from particles entering the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">Horowitz et al. 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">Kadoya et al. 1997</xref>). These secondary phenomena may lead to clinical loosening.</p><p>Several authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">Levitz et al. 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">Regner et al. 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">Li and Nilsson 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">Abu-Rajab et al. 2006</xref>) have described periprosthetic osteopenia after knee replacement. It could be argued that this bone loss should compromise fixation of the prosthesis. However, this has not been confirmed in studies of revision rate or clinical scoring.</p><p>One way of avoiding some of these possibly disadvantageous events is to inhibit bone resorption with bisphosphonates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">Wise et al. 2005</xref>). A study of clodronate given daily for 6 months postoperatively after knee replacement showed less migration, using RSA, in the treated group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">Hilding et al. 2000</xref>). All prostheses in that study were implanted with cement and the patients had to take the medication daily for 6 months. Weekly medication with alendronate, as in our study, would simplify the treatment.</p><p>In a Cochrane review it was concluded that bisphosphonate treatment reduced periprosthetic bone loss to a higher degree in cemented arthroplasties than in uncemented ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">Bhandari et al. 2005</xref>). One possible explanation for this may be that the thermal and toxic trauma from the cement increases bone trauma. This might induce a more intense remodeling reaction than after an operation without cement. The lack of an effect of the bisphosphonate in our study might be explained in several different ways. The study appears not to have been under-powered, as the confidence interval for a difference between the groups was reasonably small. Experiences from a previous study with clodronate and cemented prostheses indicate that 50 patients may be enough to show a decrease by 25% (p = 0.01) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">Hilding et al. 2000</xref>).</p><p>Although we tried to ensure good compliance to the treatment protocol, we cannot be absolutely sure that the patients were actually treated as planned. The medication was not started until the first postoperative day, since we had to know if the fixation had been done without cement before including the patient. This is an obvious difference compared to the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">Hilding et al. (2000)</xref>, where lower migrations of the tibial components in the bisphosphonate-treated group were found. We had hypothesized that the choice of using uncemented prostheses would be an even better model to test the effects of the bisphosphonates, because uncemented implants migrate more initially, and should therefore have a wider margin for improvement. Our results do not support this theory. One reason for this may be that mechanical fracture of bone trabeculi (rather than bone resorption) causes a large part of the migration of uncemented prostheses, making the advantage of bisphosphonates too small to be measured. There is also the possibility that the treatment dose was too low. We used the dose recommended for treatment of osteoporosis, the dose that has also shown effects in other pathological conditions such as osteonecrosis of the femoral head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">Lai et al. 2005</xref>). In the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">Hilding et al. (2000)</xref>, clodronate was used at a dose recommended for treating hypercalcemia and metastatic bone destruction. This can be regarded as a rather high dose. Previous animal studies have indicated that the doses required for inhibition of bone resorption induced by implant instability are higher than the doses needed to affect normal bone remodeling (&#x000c5;strand and Aspenberg 2002).</p><p>We found no effect regarding migration of the tibial component in uncemented total knee prostheses after 2 years, when using oral alendronate (70 mg weekly) for 6 months starting on the day after surgery. Improvement of the fixation of uncemented prostheses either requires a higher dosage of bisphosphonate, or more attention to surface geometry, more attention to macro and microtexture, or a hydroxyapatite coating.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="CIT0001"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abu-rajab</surname><given-names>RB</given-names></name><name><surname>Watson</surname><given-names>WS</given-names></name><name><surname>Walker</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Peri-prosthetic bone mineral density after total knee arthroplasty.
