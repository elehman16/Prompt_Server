The importance of the problem is more noticeable in low and middle income countries which carry a higher degree of risk factors for TBI and on the other hand their healthcare systems are inadequately equipped to deal with the associated health outcomes.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Traumatic brain injury results in functional deficits due to both primary and secondary mechanisms. Now there is general agreement that there may be two kinds of injury during the pathophysiological course of head trauma: Primary and secondary. Primary injuries are the result of direct physical force to the brain and usually are not reversible whereas secondary brain injuries are potentially responsive to prevention or reversal.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] This kind of brain injury is caused by a dynamic interplay between ischemic, inflammatory and cytotoxic processes.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The second stage of the pathophysiological cascade is marked by terminal membrane depolarization along with excessive release of excitatory neurotransmitters (i.e. glutamate, aspartate), activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate, a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4 isoxazolpropionate, and voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> channels. The resultant Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> influx initiate self-digesting intracellular processes. Ca<sup>2+</sup> activates lipid peroxidases (Px), proteases, and phospholipases which then increase the intracellular concentration of free fatty acids and free radicals. These series of events ends in membrane destruction of vascular and cellular structures and finally cause necrosis or programmed cell death.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The time between primary and secondary injury provides a window for therapeutic intervention to reduce unfavorable outcomes. In the past decades tremendous efforts have been made for illuminating mechanisms responsible for cerebral injuries happen after TBI. Unfortunately, these efforts did not translate into more successful therapeutic interventions for decreasing progressive damage after TBI in a considerable amount. This is in part due to complex and multi-factorial entity of these pathologic mechanisms. Furthermore, it seems that there are important gaps in our knowledge about pathogenesis of harmful events after TBI.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Nonsurgical management of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) due to cerebral edema is mainly based on osmotic therapy. Mannitol and hypertonic saline (HTS) have been widely used and tested as preferred agents for hyperosmolar therapy.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Historically mannitol has been used more often as an agent of choice for this purpose. However in recent years, some studies provided more evidence supporting the superiority of HTS in decreasing ICP and brain edema both in animal models and humans.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Evidences derived from laboratory investigations have shown a link between the effects of hypertonicity and the innate and adaptive immune responses, which could produce the dysfunctional inflammatory and oxidant responses, posttraumatic injury. These studies suggest that the immunomodulatory effects of hypertonic fluids may have an attenuating effect of organ injury and immune suppression seen after severe injury.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Still there is inadequate knowledge regarding safety, optimum duration and dose of HTS in TBI patients. Bolus administration of HTS resulted in the acute increase in serum sodium concentrations which were associated with the rapid reduction of ICP and increased in cerebral perfusion pressure.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] However, continuous infusion of HTS have increased serum sodium gradually and maintained it for a large period.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Although to our knowledge, few studies investigated HTS and mannitol with respect to their antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] This prospective controlled study was designed to evaluate the oxidant and antioxidant effects of mannitol and two different regimens of HTS 5% in TBI patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This open label randomized clinical trial (clinical registration ID: 201011055107N1), which conducted at three Intensive Care Units (ICUs) in Iran (between October 2009 and May 2011), was approved by the Ethic Committee of Tehran University of Medical Sciences and health services and all patients&#x02019; relatives gave written informed consent before participating in the study.</p><p>Hundred patients were registered into the trial during the study only 39 subjects met the inclusion criteria.

Using HTS 5% were accompanied by a higher degree of reduction in ROS and NO levels with respect to mannitol, which in turn could results in better cell protection against unfavorable effects due to oxidative stress. In addition, we observed that the serum level of TAP decreased in all treatment groups during study period. This could imply that following TBI, increased production of ROS and NO surpass the antioxidant power of the body. However, only in the mannitol group this reduction was significant.</p><p>Searching previous studies reveals that there is not enough number of well-controlled clinical trials that could provide evidence for the best concentration, administration interval and duration of therapy with HTS. Although numerous studies on TBI have been conducted, most of these investigations are observational or retrospective, which could not provide strong evidence for the quantitative evaluation of the effect of HTS on clinical outcomes.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] To our knowledge, this was the first study which compared oxidant and antioxidant effects of both methods of administering HTS (bolus and continuous infusion) versus mannitol in TBI patients.</p><p>Posttraumatic cerebral inflammation is described by glial activation, leukocyte recruitment, and up-regulation and release of mediators such as cytokines and chemokines[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Activated microglias let various neurotoxic substances, such as reactive oxygen, nitrogen species and glutamate, to be flow out which may further hasten neuronal death. While astrocyte reactivation, proliferation, and migration occurring after TBI seems to deleteriously affect axonal regrowth, the existence of these cells around the site of injury could positively supply a supporting environment via providing the tissue with neurotrophic factors that could possibly accelerate repair and neurogenesis.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Oxidative stress is precipitated by an imbalance between pro-oxidant and antioxidant substances synthesized as a consequence of excessive production of ROS. ROS could act as a double edged sword, which could play their role in normal physiological processes, or on the other hand participate in a number of disease processes, whereby they are involved into the injuries to cellular building blocks such as lipids, membranes, proteins, and DNA. It has been shown that the total antioxidant reservoir of brain homogenates and water-soluble antioxidant reservoir decreases after TBI.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Susceptibility of the brain tissue to oxidative damage could be understood in the light of the facts such as its extensive oxidative metabolic activity, enormous generation of reactive oxygen metabolites, partially low level of antioxidant capacity, low repair mechanism activity, nonregenerating nature of its neuronal cells, and the high membrane surface to cytoplasm ratio. The extensive amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids located in the membrane lipids of the brain is a major source for the decomposition reactions named &#x0201c;lipid peroxidation,&#x0201d; in which a single initiating free radical can cause decomposition of the nearby molecules.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>In concordance with previous studies[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] TBI patients in our study had significantly higher initial serum levels of ROS at ICU admission with respect to a healthy control group. This result is in agreement with studies that postulated TBI could cause an uncontrolled increase in the amount of ROS, which could subsequently result in damages at cellular and molecular levels through different mechanisms. This rapid burst of increase in ROS level could be considered as a consequence of a sudden release of excitatory neurotransmitters parallel to limited antioxidant ability of the neuronal cells to overcome oxidative stress.</p><p>A number of therapeutic approaches, based on scavenging radicals and reducing oxidative stress have been tried in experimental models as well as in the clinical circumstances. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a precursor of glutathione (GSH), a potent antioxidant, and free radical scavenger has been clearly shown to decrease oxidative stress and inflammation.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Animal model studies indicate that a single dose of NAC given 15 min after trauma could have some advantages in ameliorating lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzyme activity and neuronal protection following closed head trauma.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</p><p>To our knowledge, few studies investigated HTS and mannitol with respect to their antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Yilmaz <italic>et al</italic>. compared oxidant and antioxidant effects of mannitol and HTS 7.5% in rats exposed to TBI. They have found that mannitol is more effective than HTS on reduction of malondialdehyde, catalase and GSH-Px in the cellular level in TBI rats.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</p><p>In our study, using HTS were accompanied by a higher degree of reduction in ROS concentration in comparison with mannitol. This indicates that HTS could potentially provide more pronounced neuroprotection, which in turn decrease secondary brain insults and help to achieve a greater degree of neuronal and glial cell survival. Examination of NO (a rapid nitrogen species) also showed that TBI patients had significantly higher initial serum levels of NO at ICU admission compared to the healthy control group. With respect to this result, it could be concluded that TBI also increases concentration of rapid nitrogen species. Interestingly during study period, the serum levels of NO significantly decreased in HTS treatment groups especially in infusion group but significantly increased in the mannitol group. This finding is also in favor of HTS, confirming its ability in reducing damage due to NO, a rapid nitrogen species which in part could explain better clinical outcomes observed in the treatment with HTS as demonstrated by Hendoui <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Studies, which have been done on the time course of oxidative stress, suggest that the production of free radicals happens shortly after TBI. On the other hand the extent of reactive species generated throughout the course of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) of brain is determined by antioxidant defense mechanisms. The TAP of body fluid is a consequent of joint action between different antioxidants and is vital for the maximal prevention of free radical reactions in the extracellular compartments. Endogenous antioxidants have an indispensable role in coping with extensive increase in free radicals that are produced after I/R injury in the brain.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] This defence against free radical insults is accomplished by enzymatic (catalase, superoxide dismutase, GSH-Px etc.) and nonenzymatic (GSH, Vitamin A, C, E, coenzyme Q, uric acid) free radical scavenging systems and metal chelators.</p><p>This study demonstrated that the serum level of TAP had decreased in all treatment groups during study period so it could be speculated that following TBI increased production of ROS and NO surpass the antioxidant power of the body which shows itself as a decrease in TAP at the time of ICU admission in our patients. Furthermore, the serum levels of TAP had decreased in all treatment groups but this reduction was significant in the mannitol group. Reduction of TAP during the time period ended to 2<sup>nd</sup> day after TBI and then its increase from the 2<sup>nd</sup> day to 3<sup>rd</sup> day is a valuable finding which could help us through designing proper antioxidant regimens that could be a potential treatment for preventing secondary damages in TBI patients. These findings are in concordance with previous studies that showed oxidative stress begins as early as 30 min after injury[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and continues for at least 24 h after TBI.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] In fact in all treatment groups the least measured TAP was in 2<sup>nd</sup> day of admission and after that TAP increased in all groups in 3<sup>rd</sup> day of admission up to about the amount of the baseline measure for each group. A possible explanation for this observation is that during pervasive brain I/R, the organism is trying to deal with the harmful effects of free radicals by rising the production of endogenous antioxidants (e.g. uric acid, ascorbic acid), a finding which is in agreement with the study of Sivonov&#x000e1; <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</p><p>Our study had some limitations. limited number of TBI patients in each group caused a significant difference with respect to sex of the patients at baseline, as in mannitol group percentage of female patients were 40% that was significantly different from those of HTS bolus group (0%) and HTS infusion group (8%). Some of the previous studies provided evidence indicating a more pronounced neuroprotection in females rather than males. It has been proposed that this is due to direct and indirect sex hormone-mediated antioxidant mechanisms. Progesterone administration reduces brain levels of F (2)-isoprostane, a marker of lipid peroxidation, after experimental TBI in male rats and estrogen provide neuroprotection in experimental neurological injury.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</p><p>As a result, the greater percentage of female patients in the mannitol group could interfere with our judgment about different interventions, because it seems that female subjects may have a better prognosis even in the absence of any intervention. However, results of measurements of TAP indicated that in the mannitol group, the decrease in TAP was more significant than HTS groups. In other word, despite the fact of having more women in the mannitol group which could result in favor of mannitol for producing better outcomes, TAP reduced more prominently in this group which means that mannitol was less successful in ameliorating oxidative stress. More studies are necessaries with larger sample size and direct ICP monitoring in TBI patients under mannitol and two different regimens of HTS 5%.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our data are suggesting that TBI could cause an uncontrolled increase in the amount of serum concentrations of ROS and NO which could subsequently result in damages at cellular and molecular levels through different mechanisms. HTS 5% has significant effects on the oxidant responses compared with mannitol following TBI that makes HTS as a prefect therapeutic intervention for reducing unfavorable outcomes in TBI patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHOR'S CONTRIBUTION</title><p>MM participated in designing the trial, evaluated the clinical data; he also participated in drafting the manuscript.
