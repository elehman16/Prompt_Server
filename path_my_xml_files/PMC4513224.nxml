There is a large inter-patient variability in plasma concentrations of sunitinib, which may be due to patient non-compliance, drug&#x02013;drug interactions [cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4-modulating drugs], and inter-patient variability in pharmacokinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Besides inter-patient variability in drug exposure, variability within a patient due to intra-patient variations in pharmacokinetic processes may also exist.</p><p>After oral intake, sunitinib is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in peak plasma concentrations 6&#x02013;12&#x000a0;h after administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Food has no significant effect on the exposure to sunitinib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In the liver, sunitinib is mainly metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme to its primary active metabolite SU12662, which is further converted by CYP3A4 into several inactive compounds. Both sunitinib and SU12662 are eliminated from the body via the bile in the feces through efflux transporters in the liver, namely the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 (ABCB1) and sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Enzymes and transporters involved in the pharmacokinetics of drugs, such as CYP3A4 and ABCB1, have time-dependent variations in expression which may have a profound effect on the exposure to several drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These variations may change the efficacy and/or toxicity profile of drugs. This was previously shown in patients treated with tacrolimus, a drug frequently used to prevent organ rejection after transplantation, where morning administration resulted in higher area under the concentration&#x02013;time curve (AUC) levels than evening administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Two previous studies have compared the toxicity levels of patients treated with sunitinib in the morning with those of patients treated with sunitinib in the evening. No differences in toxicity levels between morning and evening dosing of sunitinib were found in either study. Although the authors concluded that it is safe to take the drug either in the morning or at night, sunitinib pharmacokinetics were only examined during morning sunitinib administration and these studies were not designed to study the chrono-efficacy and chrono-tolerance of sunitinib exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have shown an association between higher exposure to sunitinib and improved survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In order to improve the efficacy of sunitinib treatment, we wanted to gain insight into possible time-dependent changes in sunitinib pharmacokinetics, for which we designed a translational study. The primary aim of this study was to examine whether the administration time of sunitinib influences its pharmacokinetics. We studied the effect of administration time on pharmacokinetic parameters of sunitinib by measuring sunitinib and its active metabolite in plasma and organ tissue of mice as well as in plasma of cancer patients treated with sunitinib monotherapy. As a secondary aim, we studied the daily variation in the activity of sunitinib-metabolizing enzymes and transporters in murine hepatocytes and bowel tissue and through the midazolam clearance test in patients, which is a well-known marker of CYP3A activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Mice</title><p>Seven groups of 18 male FVB mice 8&#x02013;12&#x000a0;weeks of age were used in this study. For logistic reasons, mice were housed under normal and reversed 12&#x000a0;h light/12&#x000a0;h dark cycles (lights on/off or off/on at 8&#x000a0;a.m. and 8&#x000a0;p.m.) for at least 1&#x000a0;week before the start of the experiment. Mice were fed a standard diet ad libitum. The mice were fasted from 3&#x000a0;h before pharmaceutical treatment to 1&#x000a0;h after administration. Water was available ad libitum throughout the entire experiment. This study was approved by an independent Animal Ethical Committee under protocol number EMC139-12-19.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Protocol</title><p>Sunitinib was dissolved in acidified water with a maximum pH of 6.0, at a concentration of 5&#x000a0;mg/mL. All mice were administered a fixed single dose of 1.06&#x000a0;mg, which was based on a dose of 42.4&#x000a0;mg/kg and a mean weight of mice of 25&#x000a0;g. Every 4&#x000a0;h, one group consisting of 18 mice was administered a single dose of sunitinib through gavage, starting at 8&#x000a0;a.m.</p><p>At six different times after the administration of sunitinib (<italic>t</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1, 2, 3, 5, 10, and 20&#x000a0;h), three mice with an identical sunitinib dosing time were administered isoflurane as anesthetic followed by 1&#x000a0;mL blood withdrawal by eye extraction and euthanasia by cervical dislocation. Directly after euthanasia, one liver lobe and the small bowel were removed. Blood from each single mouse was separately processed to plasma. Both plasma and tissue samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C until further analysis.</p><p>The seventh group of mice served as a control group and was administered solvent. Mice in this group were sacrificed at 4-h intervals. Blood and organs of the mice in this group were collected and stored under the same conditions as those of the treated mice. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was applied to tissue samples to reveal potential time-dependent changes in the circadian expression of murine orthologs of genes encoding drug transporters and metabolizing enzymes involved in sunitinib pharmacokinetics, using known core clock genes as a control (see the Electronic Supplementary Material).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Patients</title><p>A prospective randomized crossover trial was performed in patients treated with sunitinib at the Department of Medical Oncology of the Erasmus MC-Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Patients were allowed to participate in the study at any time during sunitinib treatment, with both 4&#x000a0;weeks on/2&#x000a0;weeks off treatment and with continuous dosing regimen. Patients could participate in the study if (1) they were aged &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years; (2) they had a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced RCC, GIST, or pNET for which treatment consisted of sunitinib monotherapy; (3) they were using any stable dose of sunitinib at study entry (defined as at least 2&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; continuous dosing without dose modifications); (4) hematologic, renal, and liver functions were adequate; and (5) written informed consent was given. Exclusion criteria consisted of (1) pregnancy or breastfeeding; (2) medical unstable condition requiring treatment; (3) symptomatic central nervous system metastases or a history of a psychiatric disorder that would prohibit the understanding and giving of informed consent; (4) major surgery within 2&#x000a0;weeks before start of the protocol; (5) use of CYP3A4-inhibiting or -inducing drugs; (6) problematic blood withdrawal; and (7) a known allergy to sunitinib and/or midazolam.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study Protocol</title><p>Patients were randomized to start intake of sunitinib either at 8&#x000a0;a.m. (group A) or 6&#x000a0;p.m. (group B) in the next treatment course after inclusion.

Accordingly, the sequence of the time of dosing of sunitinib in group A was morning&#x02013;evening and in group B was evening&#x02013;morning. During both courses, patients were hospitalized for 24&#x000a0;h in the third or fourth week of the treatment cycle, when steady-state plasma concentrations were achieved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic measurements were taken at timepoints <italic>t</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24&#x000a0;h after oral sunitinib intake.</p><p>During both hospitalization days, patients were subjected to a midazolam clearance test as a marker of hepatic CYP3A activity 2&#x000a0;h after administration of sunitinib.

Sunitinib and SU12662 AUCs follow a similar oscillation pattern as a function of administration time, with a 14&#x02013;27&#x000a0;% higher combined plasma AUC when sunitinib was administered at 4&#x000a0;a.m. or 4&#x000a0;p.m., which is in the middle of the active or inactive phase of the mice respectively, rather than at 8&#x000a0;a.m. or 8&#x000a0;p.m. Although a recent study in rabbits revealed significant differences in the exposure to sunitinib between dosing at 8&#x000a0;a.m. or 8&#x000a0;p.m., this was not seen in our study in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Both the sunitinib and the SU12662 AUCs in plasma follow a similar pattern in an apparent 12-h rhythm. The oscillation pattern is probably due to circadian rhythms in both <italic>Cyp3a11</italic> enzyme activity and expression of the efflux transporters <italic>Abcb1a</italic>, <italic>Abcb1b</italic>, and <italic>Abcg2</italic>. The 12-h rhythm in sunitinib and SU12662 pharmacokinetics may be due to counteracting activities of these drug transporters and metabolizing enzyme, since we observed variation in mRNA expression with peak concentrations at different times of the day.</p><p>In the 16 patients treated with sunitinib, the plasma AUC was equal at three dosing times, which is in contrast to our pre-clinical results. Despite the equality in daily exposure to sunitinib, the <italic>C</italic><sub>trough</sub> values of sunitinib were significantly lower when patients were administered sunitinib in the morning than with noon or evening dosing. <italic>C</italic><sub>trough</sub> values were sampled just before the intake of a new dose of sunitinib. In this phase of the pharmacokinetic process, metabolism and elimination are the most important determinants of drug concentrations.</p><p>This study showed that the midazolam clearance test in patients was similar at 10&#x000a0;a.m. and 8&#x000a0;p.m., suggesting similarity in hepatic CYP3A activity between these timepoints. Since CYP3A4 has a key role in sunitinib metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], this suggests that sunitinib metabolism was similar at morning and evening dosing. Based on the midazolam clearance test, it can be assumed that metabolism did not vary between these timepoints. Therefore, it is hypothesised that the difference in sunitinib <italic>C</italic><sub>trough</sub> values may be attributed to daily changes in elimination.</p><p>The daily variation in sunitinib <italic>C</italic><sub>trough</sub> values is relevant for future research. For sunitinib and other TKIs, a threshold concentration for efficacy is known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is currently being investigated as a potential improvement of sunitinib therapy, using <italic>C</italic><sub>trough</sub> values of sunitinib and SU12662 as an indicator for daily exposure. In these studies, dose levels of sunitinib are increased if <italic>C</italic><sub>trough</sub> values are below the threshold. A recently published study revealed that it is feasible to administer sunitinib based on <italic>C</italic><sub>trough</sub> values, with threshold concentrations between 50 and 100&#x000a0;ng/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Patients in our study had fewer fluctuations in the daily sunitinib concentration when sunitinib was administered at noon or in the evening. Therefore, the chance of dropping below the threshold of 50&#x000a0;ng/mL, where sunitinib is thought to be ineffective, is smaller when the drug is administered at these times of the day, although the daily exposure is the same. Patients dosed in the morning may therefore potentially undergo erroneous dose escalations and suffer from more toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, the daily variation in sunitinib AUCs observed in mice was not confirmed in patients. The discrepancy between pre-clinical models and patients may be due to various reasons. First, the pharmacokinetics of sunitinib may be different between mice and humans due to species specificity in the orthologous CYP enzymes and drug transporters involved in the pharmacokinetics of sunitinib. Second, the mice in this study only received a single dose of sunitinib and therefore steady-state plasma concentrations were not reached at the time of pharmacokinetic sampling. This is in contrast with the patients in our study who were administered sunitinib for at least 2&#x000a0;weeks before pharmacokinetic sampling took place. A third explanation can be that while mice were kept under strict light/dark cycles resulting in synchronized behavior, the circadian rhythm in the patients in this study may be disturbed by lifestyle or during the hospital stay for pharmacokinetic sampling. Pharmacokinetic samples were taken both during day times and during night hours, which resulted in waking of the patient. Fourth, the mice in this study were genetically homogeneous, while in the human population there is genetic heterogeneity.</p><p>Of note, there were some limitations in the pre-clinical study. Only one blood withdrawal for pharmacokinetic determination was possible from each mouse. Therefore, the AUC is calculated from sunitinib concentrations that are measured in different mice, which showed a large inter-individual difference in sunitinib and SU12662 concentrations. These large variations in pharmacokinetics may have been due to several causes. For instance, sunitinib was administered through gavage. Possibly, the solvent was partially left in the gavage tube and it was not noticed whether mice vomited after gavage. Also, mice ranged in age from 8 to 12&#x000a0;weeks and therefore may differ in weight. In addition, mice were fasted from 3&#x000a0;h before gavage until 1&#x000a0;h after oral gavage to make sure the stomachs of all mice were empty at the time of sunitinib administration. However, this may have caused stress to the animals and may have affected the phase of peripheral circadian rhythms, although analysis of mRNA levels of the core clock genes excluded the latter possibility.</p><p>This study was not designed to detect differences in pharmacodynamics (efficacy of treatment and toxicity) between different dosing times of sunitinib. Patients were allowed to participate at any time during sunitinib treatment, and there was a broad variation in the on-treatment time between patients. Six out of 16 (38&#x000a0;%) patients had previously undergone dose reductions due to severe toxicity, and at the time of participation in the study these patients were treated at a dose level with an acceptable toxicity profile. Therefore, differences in toxicity levels between dosing times were not an endpoint in this study. However, previous studies have reported that toxicities from sunitinib treatment are similar in morning and evening dosing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Altogether, we conclude that daily variation in the pharmacokinetics of sunitinib exists, most likely resulting from differences in sunitinib elimination. Patient&#x02019;s plasma sunitinib <italic>C</italic><sub>trough</sub> values are higher when administered in the afternoon or evening, and during these dosing times more stable drug concentrations are achieved than when administered in the morning. It is therefore advised that sunitinib should be dosed in the afternoon or evening in daily clinical practice, and if TDM is implemented in clinical practice, the administration time of sunitinib should be taken into account.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec15"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="40262_2015_239_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary material 1 (DOCX 23 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM2"><media xlink:href="40262_2015_239_MOESM2_ESM.tif"><caption><p>Supplementary material 2 (TIFF 23851 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM3"><media xlink:href="40262_2015_239_MOESM3_ESM.tif"><caption><p>Supplementary material 3 (TIFF 17231 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Ton Boersma, Inge Ghobadi Moghaddam-Helmantel, Annemieke Nieuweboer, Ellen de Morr&#x000e9;e, Cindy Bolder, Anna Pagani, Stefanie Vester, Xander den Dekker, Anne-Joy de Graan, Els Moltzer, Dennis de Meulder, and Dominique Kuiper for their specific contributions to this study.</p><p>This research received no grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</p><p>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Sunitinib prescribing information, 2009. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=607">http://labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=607</ext-link>.
