In a balanced oral environment, saliva contributes to tooth remineralization by supplying mineral components necessary to form HA. The critical pH for enamel dissolution is about 5.5 [<xref rid="b1-jod-11-406" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Although several methods such as local/systemic fluoride therapy, diet control and use of fissure sealants are used to prevent dental caries, they are not efficient enough to completely prevent tooth decay [<xref rid="b2-jod-11-406" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Hydroxyapatite is an important biomaterial and a major component of the mineralized structure of the teeth and bones [<xref rid="b3-jod-11-406" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b5-jod-11-406" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It is also an important bioceramic for medical and dental applications (including dental implants, orthopedics, alveolar reconstruction and drug delivery systems) due to its biocompatibility and biological and chemical similarity to the bone structure [<xref rid="b6-jod-11-406" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>HA can be used for bone, cementum and artificial root formation and can induce tooth remineralization. With the development of nanotechnology, nano-HA particles are extensively studied in the fields of biomaterials and medicine.</p><p>Compared to typical HA, nano-HA has some unique properties such as higher solubility, higher surface energy and optimal biocompatibility. Substituting bone and tooth with have several advantages including high toughness, high strength, high density, long shelf life and optimal biocompatibility [<xref rid="b7-jod-11-406" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, it has been reported that nano-HA particles have superior bioactivity compared to larger crystals [<xref rid="b8-jod-11-406" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>In spite of the reports of HA application in various fields of medicine, only a few studies have evaluated the relationship between nano-HA and dental caries.</p><p>Results of a study comparing the remineralization effect of combined nano-HA and sodium-fluoride (NaF) on primary carious lesions showed that the greater the amount of nano-HA in NaF mouthrinse, the higher the remineralization of enamel. They suggested a synergetic role for nano-HA combined with a fluoridated mouthrinse [<xref rid="b2-jod-11-406" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Another study evaluated the effect of nano-HA solution on erosive lesions and showed that enamel microhardness (decreased due to erosive lesion) enhanced significantly after exposure to nano-HA solution [<xref rid="b9-jod-11-406" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of this study was to compare the remineralization effect of nano-HA and NaF mouthrinses on the initial carious lesions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>In this experimental study, nano-HA (Nanoshel Co., USA) was added to distilled water in predetermined weight percentages (0, 2, 5, 10%) in order to prepare nano-HA mouthrinses of different concentrations.</p><p>Sound premolars extracted for orthodontic purposes were collected and fixed in acrylic blocks. After cleaning and polishing the teeth, all surfaces were coated with nail polish, except for one surface. Ten teeth were randomly selected as controls and stored in distilled water during the study. Eventually, Vickers hardness number (VHN) of all samples was measured using Vickers microhardness tester (Shimadzu M g5037, Japan).</p><p>In order to develop artificial caries, the samples were immersed in 13 ml of 0.1 M lactic acid and 0.2 M poly acrylic acid with a pH of 5. After demineralization, VHN was measured by applying 200gr force. Then, the samples were randomly divided into 5 groups (one group was exposed to NaF mouthrinse and the remaining 4 to nano-HA mouthrinses of different concentrations). For the initiation of remineralization, all teeth were immersed in artificial saliva for 12 hours [<xref rid="b10-jod-11-406" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] before the microhardness testing. Then, 4 groups were prepared as follows:

P-values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS 20 for windows (Chicago, IL, USA)</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The mean baseline microhardness in the 5 groups (control, 2% nano-HA, 5% nano-HA, 10% nano-HA and NaF mouthrinse) was 349.5, 351.5, 373, 379.1 and 369.2 Gpa, respectively and it decreased to 86.7, 65.8, 74.2, 119.4 and 127.8 after immersion in cariogenic solution, respectively. After demineralization, the teeth were immersed in distilled water, NaF and different concentrations of nano-HA mouthrinses. The microhardness of each group was as follows:</p><p>Group 1= 60.9, group 2= 78, group 3= 81, group 4= 199 and group 5= 128.1. Repeated measures ANOVA showed that the microhardness values decreased in the test groups (repeated factor P value &#x0003c;0.001) but the magnitude of reduction was not significantly different between the groups (interaction P value=0.615).</p><p>The before and after microhardness values were not significantly different between the groups either (between subject P value=0.142). <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-jod-11-406">Table 1</xref> shows the mean microhardness of each group before the induction of caries, after the induction of caries and after immersion in the mouthrinses.</p><p>Figure 1 shows the mean microhardness of each group, before the induction of caries (1), after the induction of caries (2) and after immersion in the mouthrinses (3).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Dental caries is the most common chronic disease in childhood. It develops as the result of the function of cariogenic microorganisms on fermentable carbohydrates.</p><p>Tooth decay can be prevented by the elimination of etiologic factors. Saliva can greatly help in this respect [<xref rid="b1-jod-11-406" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Use of nano-HA mouthrinse is one way to prevent dental caries. Nano-HA is a calcium-phosphate compound with a similar structure to that of the mineralized part of dentin and enamel and has the potential to remineralize initial carious lesions [<xref rid="b11-jod-11-406" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It is bioactive and biocompatible [<xref rid="b12-jod-11-406" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Our study results revealed no significant difference between the effect of various concentrations of nano-HA and NaF mouthrinses on initial carious lesions. Huang examined the effect of Galla Chinensis combined with nano-HA on the remineralization of primary lesions and showed that the increase in enamel microhardness following the application of these materials was greater than distilled water [<xref rid="b13-jod-11-406" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; which confirms our results. However, we compared the effect of different concentrations of nano-HA on the remineralization of initial lesions in human teeth.</p><p>Huang evaluated the remineralization effect of nano-HA on animal teeth by means of measuring the surface and cross-sectional microhardness by polarized light microscopy.</p><p>The results showed that nano-HA enhanced mineral apposition of surface enamel and was able to repair enamel lesions [<xref rid="b14-jod-11-406" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We also concluded that remineralization of primary enamel lesions increased with the use of different nano-HA concentrations. The results of a study conducted by Min demonstrated that erosive enamel lesions were repaired effectively by the use of 0.25% nano-HA [<xref rid="b15-jod-11-406" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; these findings are in accordance with our results. However, Min used cone-focal laser scanning and scanning electron microscopy on animal teeth.</p><p>Mensinkai and Mathews assessed the effect of different types of fluoride mouthrinses on erosive lesions.</p><p>The results of both studies revealed that fluoride mouthrinses were advantageous for lesion remineralization; which is consistent with our study results [<xref rid="b16-jod-11-406" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="b17-jod-11-406" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Haghgoo studied the remineralization of erosive lesions using nano-HA. The results demonstrated that the microhardness of demineralized enamel increased following the application of nano-HA [<xref rid="b9-jod-11-406" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is in agreement with our result but we compared different nano-HA concentrations with NaF mouthrinse.</p><p>Kim compared the remineralization effect of nano-HA combined with NaF mouthrinse and concluded that nano-HA has a synergetic role in dental remineralization [<xref rid="b2-jod-11-406" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]; this result is consistent with ours. Huang investigated the effects of nano-HA on the remineralization of initial enamel lesions and found that nano-HA has a remineralization potential for initial enamel lesions and this finding is similar to our results [<xref rid="b18-jod-11-406" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, we studied the remineralization potential of nano-HA mouthrinse on human enamel using VHN and this is the main difference between our study and Huang&#x02019;s investigation. In our study, human teeth were used as samples, but one limitation was to collect premolar teeth only.</p><p>We suggest further studies to determine the effect of these solutions on lesion depth and various parts of lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study showed that both nano-HA and NaF mouthrinses can greatly enhance remineralization and increase tooth microhardness.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors appreciate the assistance of Dr. Nazila Ameli (postgraduate student of orthodontics, Shahid Beheshti Dental School) for her kind efforts.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="b1-jod-11-406"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>McDonald Ralph</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Avery David</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Dean Jeffry</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><source>Dentistry for the child and adolescent</source><year>2011</year><edition>9th ed</edition></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-jod-11-406"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Xiangcai</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Xingyi</surname><given-names>LI</given-names></name><name><surname>Kuilong</surname><given-names>LU</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Study of Nano-Hydroxyapatite on the Remineralization of Dismineralized Teeth</article-title><source>J Materials Science Forum</source><year>2005</year><volume>475&#x02013;479</volume><fpage>2423</fpage><lpage>2426</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3-jod-11-406"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kenney</surname><given-names>EB</given-names></name><name><surname>Lekovic</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Carranza</surname><given-names>FA</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name><name><surname>Dimitrijevic</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The use of a porous hydroxyapatite implant in periodontal defects.
