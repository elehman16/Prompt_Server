Within the general North American population 16-52% have suboptimal vitamin D status; the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency increases to 86% in the diabetic population and those with concurrent kidney disease are 1.78-fold more likely to be vitamin D deficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Patients living in northern communities are at particular risk for vitamin D insufficiency due to limited sunlight exposure, further increasing their risk for low bone mineral density (BMD) and fragility fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Recent evidence indicates that up to 40-90% of patients with stage 3&#x02013;4 CKD have insufficient/deficient vitamin D status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. By the time CKD patients reach dialysis, approximately 75% have metabolic bone disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Unlike other nutrients, recommendations for vitamin D are not based on food sources as there are very few dietary options available (e.g. fish, liver and fortified dairy products), but rather are designed to compensate for a deficiency of sunlight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This places the individual living in northern climates at particular risk for inadequate vitamin D status, especially in the winter months when sunlight exposure is unlikely to contribute to overall vitamin D status. Most evidence suggests that when vitamin D requirements are met, it is with a combination of dietary vitamin D and a supplement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Patients with diabetic nephropathy are at increased risk for poor dietary intake of vitamin D due to restrictions on vitamin D rich foods/beverages (e.g. dairy based products) as these products also have a high carbohydrate, phosphorus and/or potassium content. It is unknown what level of vitamin D supplementation will ameliorate or improve suboptimal vitamin D status in patients with diabetic nephropathy or contribute to improved bone health, particularly for those living in northern climates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A recent study in patients with stage 3&#x02013;4 CKD demonstrated that daily oral supplementation of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (1,000&#x000a0;IU/d) for three months resulted in a mean increase in serum 25(OH)D of 25&#x000a0;nmol/L (40&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;15&#x000a0;nmol/L pre- vs. 68&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;25&#x000a0;nmol/L post-supplementation); a significantly lower level of 25(OH)D than is thought to optimize bone health (&#x0003e;100&#x000a0;nmol/L) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Emerging literature suggests that adherence to daily vitamin D supplementation may be an important factor influencing vitamin D status, and compliance with therapies for bone health (like other asymptomatic conditions) is a major challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Chronic diseases, such as poor bone health, as well as suboptimal vitamin D status, have been associated with reduced quality of life (QoL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Despite the potential for improved functional ability and independence, only 50-69% of individuals prescribed osteoporosis medications (e.g. bisphosphonates, vitamin D and calcium) comply to them regularly (e.g. consume 80% of the time), and only 25-35% are compliant for more than one year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. This suggests that current modes of vitamin D supplementation in adults with diabetic nephropathy, particularly low dose daily administration (&#x0003c;1,000&#x000a0;IU/d), may be ineffective at optimizing vitamin D status. Higher daily doses (&#x0003e;1,000&#x000a0;IU/d) or the use of high dose, less frequent modes of administration (monthly vs. daily), need to be explored to ensure improved compliance to dosing strategies and adequacy of overall vitamin D status, particularly in those populations at high risk for vitamin D insufficiency and suboptimal bone health (e.g. diabetic nephropathy).</p></sec><sec><title>Purpose</title><p>The first study aim was to investigate the impact of daily vs. monthly vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation on vitamin D status and markers of bone health in adults with diabetic nephropathy. The second study aim was to compare participant adherence and satisfaction between two different vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation strategies (daily vs. monthly), and quality of life (QoL).</p><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>1. Examine the impact of two approaches to high dose, oral, vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation (2,000&#x000a0;IU/d vs. 40,000&#x000a0;IU/m) for 6&#x000a0;months on overall vitamin D status (25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D) and markers of bone turnover (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, N-telopeptide of type 1 collagen) in adult patients with diabetic nephropathy.</p><p>2.

Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation (2,000&#x000a0;IU/d vs. 40,000&#x000a0;IU/m) for 6&#x000a0;months will result in significantly improved overall vitamin D status and improved markers of bone health in adult patients with diabetic nephropathy. Serum 25(OH)D will increase by a minimum of 25&#x02013;50&#x000a0;nmol/L post-supplementation. Markers of bone resorption will decrease and markers of bone formation will increase after 6&#x000a0;months of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation when compared to baseline levels.</p><p>2. Monthly dosing of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (40,000&#x000a0;IU/m) over 6&#x000a0;months will result in improved patient adherence and satisfaction with vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation when compared to daily dosing of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (2,000&#x000a0;IU/d) resulting in improved overall vitamin D status, bone health parameters, and quality of life.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The study design was a randomized, controlled, open-label trial comparing the effectiveness of two vitamin D<sub>3</sub> dosing strategies (monthly vs. daily) on vitamin D status and markers of bone health in adults with diabetes and nephropathy over a 6&#x000a0;month period. Patients were randomized to one of the two vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation strategies in blocks of 30 using a random number generator (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomizer.org">http://www.randomizer.org</ext-link>) by one graduate student (SJ): once monthly (40,000&#x000a0;IU/m; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;60) or once daily (2,000&#x000a0;IU/d; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;60) for six months. All members of the research team (with the exception the graduate students (SJ/MH)) were blinded to study allocation. Both vitamin D supplements contain vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (cholecalciferol) in gel capsule form; Jamieson Natural Sources&#x000ae; Vitamin D 1,000&#x000a0;IU Soft gel (NPN 80017530), and EURO-Pharm International Canada Inc.&#x000ae; EURO D 10,000&#x000a0;IU (DIN 02253178). The two dosing regimens were: 2 capsules of 1,000&#x000a0;IU vitamin D daily (total dose&#x02009;=&#x02009;2,000&#x000a0;IU/d), or 4 capsules of 10,000&#x000a0;IU vitamin D at the end of each month (total dose&#x02009;=&#x02009;40,000&#x000a0;IU/m). The daily dose was selected based on results from findings that showed that patients with diabetes with stage 3&#x02013;4 CKD in Northern Alberta where supplementation with 1000&#x000a0;IU/D vitamin D3 resulted in serum increases of 25(OH) vitamin D less than 25&#x000a0;mmol/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. A monthly dose of 40,000&#x000a0;IU/m vitamin D<sub>3</sub> was chosen to achieve equivalent supplementation to daily dosing assuming an adherence rate of 69%, and with the goal of obtaining a serum 25(OH)D concentration of 100&#x000a0;nmol/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>This study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Board at the University of Alberta (File Number: Pro00022639), has received a &#x0201c;No Objection Letter&#x0201d; from Health Canada (Control File Number 148625), and is a registered clinical trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=NCT01476501&#x00026;Search=Search">NCT01476501</ext-link>).

This is a multidisciplinary program (endocrinologists, nephrologists, registered nurses (RN), registered dietitians (RD), pharmacists and social workers) that provides care to over 1,500 patients with diabetic nephropathy in northern Alberta. Sixty adults with diabetes and nephropathy per vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation group were recruited into this study (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;120 total). Potential participants were approached by a member of the clinical team (e.g. RD or RN) and asked if a research team member could discuss this study with them. If verbal consent was provided, then a research team member contacted the patient, explained the study to them and determined their eligibility for participation in this RCT; if eligible and agreed by the patient, informed consent was signed and the baseline study appointment was booked. Subsequent study visits (e.g. 3&#x000a0;month and 6&#x000a0;month follow-up appointments) were booked via telephone calls made approximately 2&#x000a0;months later to follow-up with the participants and address any questions or concerns they may have had about their supplement strategy. Patient eligibility for this RCT was determined upon information available in the medical chart at time of screening. Inclusion/exclusion criteria are as follows:</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>1) Adult (18&#x02013;80 years) patients diagnosed with diabetes (Type 1 and Type 2) and stage 1&#x02013;4 CKD (Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) 15&#x02013;89&#x000a0;mL/min/1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>1) Patients with co-morbid conditions known to affect vitamin D metabolism including gastrointestinal, liver, rheumatoid or bone disorders (e.g. hyperthyroidism, untreated celiac disease, cancer, Paget&#x02019;s disease, sarcoidosis, malabsorption, etc.). Individuals with severe, permanent vision impairment will be excluded as this will preclude them from reading supplement labels accurately and safely. Pregnant women will be excluded as Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans are not recommended during pregnancy.

Analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel 2010 and Statistical Analysis Software (SAS; version 9.3 SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Statistical significance was determined at p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05. Continuous variables were expressed as mean, median, ranges, and standard error (SE) or standard deviation (SD). The differences between dosing type (daily vs. monthly) over the intervention period were assessed by repeated measures analysis of variance, followed by a post-hoc pair-wise t-test with Bonferroni corrections to assess for within and between group comparisons.

Bivariate and univariate analysis were done to assess the potential effect of these variables on vitamin D status and bone health (bone turnover markers).Variables shown to be associated with a poor vitamin D status were assessed using multivariate logistic regression models to determine risk for development of vitamin D deficiency and poor bone health. Regression analysis was also conducted to assess correlation between biochemical parameters (PTH, 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, albumin, eGFR, RBG) and bone turnover markers. Analysis of variance was performed to assess for significant differences in vitamin D status and bone turnover markers over the intervention period in both groups. Regression analysis was performed with serum 25(OH)D and plasma PTH as categorical variables; e.g. 25(OH)D sorted by greater/less than 75&#x000a0;nmol/L and plasma PTH sorted by greater/less than 7.15 pmol/L, the optimal concentrations for bone health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Where necessary, vitamin D was adjusted for potential confounding variables (e.g. age, gender, ethnicity, disease severity) using an analysis of co-variance. When adherence to daily vitamin D dosing regimen was greater or less than 69%, the variation in compliance was also accounted for in an analysis of co-variance.

Dietary restriction of vitamin D-rich food sources (e.g. dairy products) is a common issue due to concerns around phosphorus, potassium and carbohydrate content. Avoidance of sunlight is also common due to instructions for concomitant medications. Vitamin D supplementation is required in this population, yet the most effective dose and most efficient dosing strategy is unknown. Low adherence rates to routine vitamin D supplementation is also an inherent challenge and therefore developing alternative approaches such as alterations in dosing frequency (monthly verses daily) is also an important consideration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Previous studies have been limited by small sample size, short intervention duration or retrospective design. This study prospectively investigated the impact of two different oral vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation dosing strategies (2,000&#x000a0;IU/d vs. 40,000&#x000a0;IU/m) for 6&#x000a0;months on markers of vitamin D status and bone health in a large group of adults with diabetes and nephropathy.</p><p>Measurement of markers of dynamic expression of bone turnover, enables evaluation of changes over time versus assessment of static changes in bone physiology that could be observed via DXA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] is a conferred added strength. Markers of collagenous bone resorption (e.g. serum NTx), bone formation (e.g. serum BAP and OC), and the bone-kidney axis/mineral homeostasis (e.g. plasma FGF-23) will allow for exploration of dynamic bone remodeling during vitamin D supplementation. These markers have also been suggested as valuable tools for assessing adherence to bone health therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p><p>Conferred additional strengths to the study design include the evaluation of socio-demographic, co-morbidities, concomitant medication use and quality of life factors; all factors known to influence adherence to vitamin supplementation. Ongoing analysis will enable a comprehensive evaluation of both lifestyle and physiological factors that influence response to vitamin D supplementation in this population. Dietary intake will be analyzed using validated methodologies for its contribution to total vitamin D intake and status, as well as intake of other nutrients that are known to impact bone health (e.g. calcium, magnesium, phosphorus). Finally, participants were enrolled throughout two calendar years, thus accounting for seasonal variations in vitamin D status. They completed sunlight exposure and weight-bearing physical activity questionnaires at each appointment so that potential impact of sunlight exposure during the different seasons as well as indoor and outdoor activity can be assessed for impact on vitamin D status and BMD.</p><p>Increasing evidence suggests that current recommendations for vitamin D intake are inadequate, particularly for populations at risk for suboptimal vitamin D status, such as those with diabetes, kidney disease or living in northern climates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].
