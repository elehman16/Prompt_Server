Chunking refers to the process of recognising or enforcing patterns upon information, and compressing it into a more efficient state, thereby creating complex &#x02018;chunks&#x02019; of information that can be held within the limited capacity working space of working memory. The ability to use chunking is preserved in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease,<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> potentially providing a promising target for effective cognitive training in Alzheimer's disease.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Cognitive training involves the use of theoretically driven exercises targeting specific cognitive domains in order to optimise cognitive function.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Cognitive training can lead to improvements in the cognitive tasks and domains specifically trained in healthy people,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and there is growing evidence that working memory training can lead to generalised improvements in non-trained tasks,<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> particularly tasks that depend on working memory and the control of attention.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Evidence for the efficacy of working memory training in Alzheimer's disease, however, has so far been limited.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Furthermore, cognitive training studies in Alzheimer's disease rarely apply the rigorous control interventions required for a formal clinical trial.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p id="P12">Successful generalisation of cognitive training benefits to non-trained tasks may have a basis in altered processing within &#x02018;domain general&#x02019; neural systems that make a broad contribution to cognition. Animal and human studies have demonstrated that encoding, storage and retrieval of information in working memory is associated with activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC).<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Several groups have identified activation in the PFC and left PPC accompanying the executive control of information within verbal working memory.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> This network is also associated with a range of higher-level executive processes,<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> including the successful use of chunking strategies.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Consequently, effective cognitive training may be associated with training-induced plasticity in this common prefrontal&#x02013;parietal network<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and chunking has been postulated as a major strategy underlying these successful cognitive training regimes.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> We conducted a parallel randomised controlled trial to investigate whether training individuals with early Alzheimer's disease using an adaptive chunking working memory task would improve their working memory capacity. We hypothesised that training-related improvements in working memory capacity would generalise across different modalities of working memory tasks, as well as measures of general cognitive functioning and executive function, and that these improvements would be accompanied by evidence of plasticity of functional activity in the PFC and parietal cortex.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S1"><title>Method</title><p id="P13">A total of 30 participants with early Alzheimer's disease (according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>) were recruited from memory services of the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. Of these, 27 had diagnoses of probable Alzheimer's disease and 3 had diagnoses of possible Alzheimer's disease, having recently converted from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease. Diagnoses were made by experienced old age psychiatrists unconnected to the study. Inclusion criteria were a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of &#x0003e;22/30 and age &#x0003e;60 years (see online supplement DS1 for further details). Exclusion criteria included coexistent neurological or psychiatric disease, substance misuse or significant auditory or visual impairment. All participants had capacity to provide written informed consent to participate in the study, which was approved by the NRES Committee East of England-Cambridge East (REC reference number 10/H0304/68) and registered prior to the onset of the study (trial number: ISRCTN43007027). Following informed consent and baseline functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), participants were randomised to either training (<italic>n</italic> = 15) or control groups (<italic>n</italic> = 15) using an online block randomisation program.</p><sec id="S2"><title>Outcome measures</title><p id="P14">The primary outcome measure was a computerised verbal working memory span task, involving both structured (chunkable) and random sequences (see online Fig. DS1). Structured trials consisted of digits presented in runs of consecutive numbers or numbers increasing or decreasing in 2s or 3s (for example, 2,4,6,8 or 9,7,5,1,2,3). Previous studies have demonstrated that structured trials significantly encourage chunking, lessening working memory demand and significantly improving working memory performance.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Near transfer of training effects to untrained working memory tasks was assessed using a spatial span task. Both structured and random versions of the task were used, with structured trials consisting of consecutive blocks presented in the same row or column, or in recognisable shapes. In the random version of these tasks, number sequences or blocks were presented in random combinations.</p><p id="P15">Transfer of training effects to clinical measures of general cognitive function were examined using the MMSE and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale &#x02013; Cognitive Section (ADAS-Cog). Transfer of training effects to episodic memory was assessed using the Logical Memory II task and Paired Associates Learning task (PAL). Transfer of training effects to executive function was assessed using a verbal fluency task, trail making tasks A and B and computerised grammatical reasoning, &#x02018;odd one out&#x02019; and &#x02018;self ordered search&#x02019;, tasks. See online supplement DS1 for descriptions of all tasks and statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>fMRI</title><p id="P16">All participants underwent pre- and post-intervention fMRI on a Siemens 3T scanner. While undergoing fMRI, participants performed a five-digit span working memory task adapted for people with Alzheimer's disease from a previous fMRI study in young healthy individuals,<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> requiring them to encode, retain and then verbally recall the five digits in order. Three blocks of twenty trials were performed and structured or random span sequences were presented pseudo-randomly. See online supplement DS1 for details of fMRI acquisition and analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Interventions</title><p id="P17">Participants randomised to the training group underwent 18 sessions of training over approximately 8 weeks, in line with recent studies demonstrating effective cognitive training interventions.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Each session consisted of 30 trials of an adaptive structured digit span task. The initial span length was a three-digit sequence, presented on a computer screen. If the participant correctly recalled the sequence, then the number of digits to be recalled (span) would increase by one for the subsequent trial. Conversely, if the sequence was incorrectly recalled, the next trial would have one fewer digits. In this way participants reached and then oscillated around their maximum span, which could adapt to performance both within and across training sessions. Control participants underwent 18 sessions of an active control intervention involving 30 trials of a fixed, non-adaptive unstructured three-digit span task. This controlled for most aspects of the experimental intervention, apart from the adaptive chunking elements.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S5"><title>Results</title><p id="P18">The study was conducted between February 2011 and August 2014.

Further, the observed cognitive benefits were accompanied by evidence of change in the functional activity of cortical networks that are known to be involved in the task. Although training led to improvements compared with the control group on the MMSE and ADAS-Cog (both clinical measures of general cognitive function), there was no transfer of benefits to non-verbal working memory or episodic memory tasks, or to specific measures of executive function. This apparent discrepancy can be resolved if it is assumed that there was no improvement in intelligence or executive function <italic>per se</italic> as a consequence of training. Instead, training on this digit-based chunking task may have only increased the application of verbal recoding strategies in other tasks. Indeed, generalised benefits were only seen on those tasks that were amenable to the adaptive use of similar chunking strategies. For example, both the story recall in the logical memory task and word recall lists of the ADAS-Cog could potentially be chunked, based on linguistic or verbal-semantic links between test items.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion|results" id="S8"><title>Interpretation of fMRI results</title><p id="P31">The consistent pattern of training-related plasticity seen in the brains of participants was of a decrease in functional activity in all ROIs following training. This was in contrast to increased activation in all examined ROIs in control participants between the baseline and follow-up scans. This pattern of results is consistent with a growing literature reporting that cognitive training leads to a decrease in cortical functional activity.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Initially a task may require large attentional and executive resources in order to be successfully performed. This executive resource may be underpinned by a &#x02018;scaffold&#x02019; of cortical regions, including the PFC and PPC.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> As training continues, the requirement for attentional and executive resources diminishes, and therefore activation in this network correspondingly decreases as the &#x02018;scaffolding falls away&#x02019;.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> A number of potential neurobiological mechanisms at the synaptic, neuronal and neural network level may be important in such &#x02018;scaffolding&#x02019; and efficiency.</p><p id="P32">Several studies examining the effects of practice have described a decrease in cortical activation within the course of a single session.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> This suggests that functional redistribution can occur over short timescales of around an hour. However, in keeping with the current study, other studies have also demonstrated similar redistribution dynamics that developed over longer training periods of several weeks.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p id="P33">The initial increase in activation in the PFC&#x02013;PPC network predicted by the scaffolding/efficiency theory may also explain the results observed in control participants. The active control intervention was a low-level cognitive demand task of only three digits. Therefore, the five-digit span task performed in the scanner would represent a considerable increase in task difficulty from the control intervention. In keeping with this theory, control participants would require increased executive resources to perform the five-digit task, which would be reflected in increased PFC&#x02013;PPC activity, in contrast to the participants in the training group, who had been adaptively trained. However, while this may explain an increase in activity in the PFC&#x02013;PPC in untrained participants performing the working memory task, the observation that the activation in control participants increased from baseline to follow-up, rather than remaining at a constant level, needs to be explained. It has been observed that, in line with the efficiency theory, activation in PFC and PPC areas may follow an inverted U-shaped quadratic function, with activity increasing early in training, prior to decreasing.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> It is possible that control participants, due to the low-level training they had received, were still at a point near the top of the inverted U-shaped curve, and that adaptive training led to participants in the training group being much further along the curve, so that decreasing activation was observed.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> It may also be possible that the increase in activity reflects the improved span performance seen in controls, as they may have been more engaged and trying harder at the task at follow-up compared with their baseline exposure to fMRI.</p><p id="P34">Critically, however, the current study provides evidence of the potential for functional plasticity following training in an Alzheimer's population. Functional plasticity is increasingly reported in older adults and in mild cognitive impairment;<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> however, the extent to which training-related plasticity may be possible in Alzheimer's disease remains unclear. These findings provide important and encouraging support for the presence of continued plasticity in the early stages of dementia.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="P35">Limitations of this study include the small number of participants, and it is possible that the study was underpowered to find further areas of significant improvement or plasticity on fMRI. The study, although randomised and well controlled, was not blinded. Therefore, observer bias may be present in the behavioural outcome measures, although attempts were made to avoid this through the use of computerised tasks and validated outcome measures.</p><p id="P36">This study also demonstrated that computerised working memory training was acceptable to participants with Alzheimer's disease and their carers. Once training had commenced, no participants dropped out of the study, despite the considerable commitment required. Anecdotally, participants enjoyed engaging with the training and control interventions and felt empowered that they were investing in a potentially useful exercise. This reflects the significant public and patient interest in cognitive training, which has become a billion dollar industry; however, there remains a clear need for the efficacy of cognitive training tools to be assessed in well-controlled randomised trials in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The observed benefits of adaptive chunking training in the verbal domain should be broadened in future studies focusing on exploring the utility of this method. For instance, benefits of strategy training could be tracked in the longer term, and similar training in other domains such as object- or spatial-based working memory could be explored. The ability of patients with mild Alzheimer's disease to access and engage with computerised cognitive training tools presented online also needs further investigation, as this approach would enable cognitive training to be made widely available in a cost-effective manner.</p><p id="P37">Worldwide, in 2013 there were 44.4 million people with Alzheimer's disease, projected to rise to 135.5 million by 2050.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Any tool that could help this very large and highly disabled clinical population would have a profound positive effect on society. We have here described one such potential tool, chunking-based cognitive training, which could be an effective future technique to help maintain cognitive function in early Alzheimer's disease.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of interest</bold></p><p>None.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding</bold></p><p>J.D.H was funded by an <funding-source>MRC research training fellowship</funding-source> (grant number <award-id specific-use="grant">G0901982</award-id>).
