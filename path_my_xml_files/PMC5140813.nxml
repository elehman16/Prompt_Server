between traction and decompression therapies, and their clinical therapeutic significance.
[Subjects and Methods] The subjects were 31 patients aged 35 to 50&#x02005;years who had
unilateral or bilateral lumbar and radicular leg pain. An intervention program was
implemented in 31 patients with lumbar herniated intervertebral disks. For the
experimental group, 15 subjects were randomly selected to receive decompression therapy
and trunk stabilization exercise. For the control group, 16 subjects were randomly
selected to receive traction therapy and trunk stabilization exercise. [Results]
Activities of the rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, and external oblique muscles
increased significantly in both groups. However, the activity of the erector spine muscle
decreased, which was the only significant change in muscle activity among those of the
other muscles in both groups. The disk herniation index in the experimental group
decreased significantly in comparison with that in the control group, and the difference
in the change in disk herniation index between the groups was significant. [Conclusion]
Decompression therapy was demonstrated to be more effective clinically than conventional
traction therapy as an intervention method for disk disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Decompression therapy</kwd><kwd>Herniated intervertebral disk</kwd><kwd>MRI</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Human beings walk upright and maintain their postures with a narrow base of support and
with the center of gravity of the upper trunk. Even if muscle tension slightly loosens, low
back pain occurs because of stress from the mechanical posture of the muscle involved<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. This causative factor of low back pain can
lead to problems in sense and timing of muscle contraction awareness, sense of heaviness,
acting force, and acting load force<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Of
the cases of low back pain syndrome, 80% are related to the lumbar disk; and herniation of
disk material is known as a secondary inflammatory response to stimulation of the dorsal
root ganglion and nerve root is known as the cause of low back pain. The remaining 20% of
cases are directly related to posterior elements such as lumbar facet joint, ligament,
lamina of the vertebral arch, and fascia. In addition, the action of the local muscles
attached directly to the spine plays an important role in maintaining spinal segmental
stability<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> and providing trunk stability
generally<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, lumbar disk
herniation causes herniation of part or all of the nucleus pulposus by rupture of the mid,
internal, or lateral fiber of the annulus fibrosus through an external force or lumbar disk
degeneration. It is a disease that induces neurological signs such as hypoesthesia, muscle
weakness, and radiating pain in the constricted innervation area, with back pain in the
local part by pressing the dura mater or nerve root. Therefore, management of these
neurological signs is important<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Generally, thermotherapy and electrotherapy have been used in physical therapy as
interventions for low back pain syndrome. In addition, application of surface heat such as a
hot pack and infrared light, and deep heat such as ultrasonography, short waves, and
microwaves has been used in thermotherapy<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Spinal stabilization exercise is another widely used intervention
method that improves muscle strength and trunk endurance, and stabilizes nervous system
control of muscles and muscle coordination. This exercise focuses on muscle reconditioning
for spinal stabilization<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therapeutic
methods for herniated intervertebral disks are divided into conservative and operational
therapies. Excluding 5% of patients, most undergo conservative therapy but anti-inflammatory
drugs, joint mobilization, acupuncture, traction, and so on are being used as interventions
to recover degenerative disks and improve neurological symptoms<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among these interventions, traction therapy is essential in
clinical therapy, but its effect is not clear and differences in viewpoints at home and
abroad are evident<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recently, spinal
decompression therapy is being performed to improve the limitations of traction therapy, as
it does not have to set a direction and traction force unlike traction therapy. Adjusting
the angle and direction of the traction force by adjusting the position of the disk by using
a computer program has an advantage<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, this study measured disk height after decompression therapy and measured the
activities of muscles that provide overall trunk stability by overcoming the gravity applied
to the body. These muscles are not directly attached to the spine. In addition, we aimed to
clarify the difference between the therapeutic effect of traction therapy and that of
decompression therapy, and their clinical therapeutic significance by comparing low back
pain disability index between the two intervention groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was approved by the bioethics committee (institutional review board) of Sehan

intervertebral disks. Fifteen subjects were randomly selected for the experimental group and
received decompression therapy and trunk stabilization exercise. Sixteen subjects were
randomly selected for the control group and received traction therapy and trunk
stabilization exercise. These intervention programs were conducted for 3 weeks, and the disk
heights at L4 and L5 were measured by using MRI. Moreover, trunk muscle activities were
measured by using surface electromyography (sEMG), and the lumbar pain disability index was
calculated by using the ODI and then analyzed and compared between the groups. The
participants understood the purpose of this study very well and agreed to participate in
this study voluntarily by providing written informed consent.</p><p>Vertebral height and disk herniation index were determined by using MRI (Signa HDe 1.5 T,
GE Corporate, USA). Disk height was analyzed by using T2-weighted axial-section MRI, and the
images were analyzed by using the PACS (picture archiving and communication system). The
subject lay supine, and then the researcher put a cushion under the subject&#x02019;s knee and had
the subject bend the knee at a 25&#x000b0; angle. In this position, the lumbar vertebral L4 and L5
segments were photographed. Disk height was analyzed by using the image obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Measurement of lumber disk height.

intercept of the axial direction. The sagittal distance of the herniated disk was recorded
as the maximum anteroposterior disk height (AB), and that of the vertebral foramen was
recorded as the maximum anteroposterior canal length (EF). The width of the herniated
material was measured by drawing a line at the mid level of the maximum anteroposterior disk
length (CD). The width of the spinal canal was calculated at the same level (GH). The
formula used for calculating the disk herniation index was ([AB &#x000d7;CD]/[EF &#x000d7;GH]) &#x000d7;1,000 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Measurement of the lumber disk herniation index.

trunk muscles, and the sampling rate for collecting EMG signals was set at 1,000&#x02005;Hz. A
frequency band-pass filter was set at 20&#x02013;450&#x02005;Hz. The subjects&#x02019; skin was cleaned by removing
hair, and dead skin cells were removed by using thin sandpaper to minimize skin resistance
to the EMG signals. Then, the skin was rubbed with alcohol cotton and kept clean. Two
Ag/Agcl surface electrodes were attached to the belly of each muscle in a direction parallel
to the muscular fiber at 2-cm intervals. Standard electrodes were attached to the spinous
process of the 12th thoracic vertebrae and scapula spine, which are the protruding parts.
The EMG signals from the right rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, external oblique
abdominis, and erector spine muscles were collected. The sampling rate for EMG signal
collection was set at 1,000&#x02005;Hz, and the notch filter was set at 60&#x02005;Hz. The band pass filter
was set at 20&#x02013;450&#x02005;Hz. Signals from the measured muscles were converted to root mean square
(RMS), and EMG signal analysis was performed by using the Acqknowledge 3.9.1 software
program (Biopac). EMG data of the rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, and external
oblique abdominis muscles were collected while the subject was touching the knees with both
hands in supine position for 5 seconds. For the measurement at the erector spine muscle, the
subjects lay in a prone position and flexed both arms maximally and then extended their
trunks maximally for 5 seconds. The EMG signal produced while performing this movement was
set as a particular action, and the EMG signal while standing motionless for 5 seconds was
set as the standard action. It was regarded as the reference voluntary contraction (RVC),
and the %RVC method standardized based on RVC was used. Patients who complained of pain and
difficulty in performing movement were excluded from this experiment.</p><p>The ODI was measured by using the Korean version of the ODI questionnaire to quantify
physical difficulty in daily life due to lumbar pain. It is composed of 10 items, and each
item was evaluated on a scale of 0&#x02013;5 points. In this questionnaire, the higher the score,
the more severe the disability. In the Korean version, in consideration of the Korean
culture, the item about sexual life is excluded. Thus, it consists of 9 items; and each item
was evaluated with a score from 0 to 5, and the highest possible total score was 45 points.

traction therapy. The duration of traction was 15 minutes, and the ratios of hold and rest
times were 2:1 and 60:30 sec, respectively. The traction force for resting time was set to
half of the traction force used in hold time. Traction force was started at one fourth of
each weight and gradually increased in each session until the subjects did not feel
uncomfortable. In the last week, the standard of the maximum traction force was half of the
subjectsthweights. The pelvis was fixed with a pelvic stabilization belt, and the thorax was
fixed with a thorax stabilization belt.</p><p>Spinal decompression therapy was performed by using a lumbar decompression device MAX-D
(Medirex, Korea), and the subjects lay on a traction table in the supine position. Their
knees were naturally positioned in a 90&#x000b0; angle on the knee support fixture installed in the
device. The ankle was fixed with a hydraulic device according to the subject&#x02019;s body type.
Traction force and movement of the low extremity were supposed to be delivered through the
fixed ankle. The upper extremity was fixed by using a trunk stabilization belt and an air
pumping apparatus to maintain lumbar lordosis. A pelvic tilt of 15&#x000b0; was applied for patients
with a lumbar herniated intervertebral disk at the L4 and L5 levels. The subjects were
comfortably positioned in the device; then, their lower limbs were pulled within range so as
not to make them feel uncomfortable during steps 1 to 5 of delivering traction force through
the hydraulic device. The subject&#x02019;s upper extremities were pulled within range so as not to
make them feel uncomfortable during steps 1 to 5, using a trunk stabilization belt. First,
the multi-mode of an automatic program of a decompression therapy device was used for steps
1 to 5. This multi-mode was programmed to make the lower part move in multiple directions.
Traction force was started at one fourth of the subjects weight and increased by 2&#x02005;kg at a
steady rate daily. When pain occurred according to the increase in traction force, the
traction force was lowered or maintained. The duration of the traction therapy was 30&#x02005;min.
The ratios of hold and rest times were 2:1 and 60:30 sec, respectively. The traction force
for rest time was set to half of the traction force used in hold time. Both the traction and
decompression therapy groups received their respective therapies once a day and five times a
week for the first week and then once a day, four times a week (total 8 times) for the next
2 weeks.</p><p>Data analysis was performed by using SPSS 18.0 for Windows. The normality of the general
characteristics of the subjects, and the respiratory muscle and physical activities of both

to receive either trunk stabilization exercise and decompression therapy or traction therapy
and trunk stabilization exercise. The intervention program was conducted for 3 weeks. The
disk heights of the L4 and L5 segments were measured before and after the intervention by
using MRI. In addition, trunk muscle activities were measured by using sEMG, and lumbar pain
disability index was calculated by using the ODI questionnaire and then analyzed and
compared between the groups. The discussion that follows is based on these results.</p><p>Guehring et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that while
decompression by distraction in an animal model with degenerative disk was conducted for 28
days, the detection rate of degenerative change on MRI decreased, gene expression levels of
disk matrix components increased, and the nucleus pulposus was regenerated. Formation of the
structural material of the matrix increases with the increase in hydrostatic pressure
through decompression, moisture content increases through the improvement in the combining
ability with moisture, and nutrition supply can be expected to increase owing to the
improvement of degenerative change. Apfel et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> insisted that 30 patients with discogenic low back pain or disk
herniation received treatment by using decompression therapy equipment for 6 weeks and
conducted a cohort study that compared disk heights by using CT. Disk height increased
significantly, and pain decreased. They insisted that disk height can be recovered based on
their results. Kwon et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> performed
acupuncture, cupping therapy, medicine treatment, and decompression therapy in six patients
with disk disease. They reported significant differences in disk height and disk herniation
index, and positive changes as results of their research. Moreover, Park and Kim<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> compared disk herniation index and disk
height by using MRI after applying traction and decompression therapies in 60 patients. As a
result, they observed a significant difference in disk herniation index but no significant
difference in disk height. This study supported the results of advanced studies because no
significant difference in disk height was found in both groups, but a significant difference
in disk herniation index was found in the decompression therapy group. Various factors cause
the discrepant results between the present study and the advanced study, such as disk
disease duration and activities of daily living. In particular, the reasons for having no
difference in disk height could be that the patients were exposed to gravity in daily living
and that treatment periods differed between the two studies. However, a significant
difference in disk herniation index was found between the two groups. This verified the
effect of decompression treatment on disk herniation index. The cause can be inferred from
the research of Macario et al<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Only
disk separation was discussed as the mechanism that explains the effectiveness of
conventional traction therapy, and the effectiveness of automatic traction therapy for
patients with chronic discogenic back pain in relation to spine decompression remains
unclear. By comparison, Kwon et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>
suggested that decompression therapy supplemented the limitation of traction therapy and had
a great advantage of inducing physical change to the disk. It is known that it can measure
load applied to the spine by using an electronic control system and allows delivery of
traction force to the spine because based on the result, muscle tone did not occur by
controlling the speed of traction therapy. In terms of muscle activity, the activity of the
erector spine muscle in the decompression therapy group decreased significantly.
Inflammation, pain caused by the inflammation, and neurological manifestations were observed
in the paraspinal muscles as symptoms of disk disease. Inflammatory reaction of the spine
surroundings made the paraspinal muscles hypertonus. Increased intervertebral foramen
diameter by decompression can induce an increase in blood flow in the blood vessel within
the foramen and intervertebral foramen, and increased blood flow can lead to decreased
muscle tension and pain by removing inflammatory exudation<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Based on these results, the paraspinal muscles were verified to
have a positive response to trunk stabilization exercise after decompression therapy, it is
considered more effective clinically than conventional traction therapy as intervention
method for patients with disk disease.</p><p>This study was conducted at only one medical institution. Normalizing the general
characteristics of the study subjects was difficult because the study period was short and
the subjects&#x02019; daily lives were not properly controlled. However, decompression therapy can
be considered a more effective intervention method for patients with disk disease in the
light of disk height and disk herniation index, change in muscle activity, and many advanced
research studies. Prospective research on this intervention with adjustment of the study and
disease periods will be needed in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This paper was supported by the Sehan University Research Fund in 2016.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Al-Obaidi</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Al-Zoabi</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Al-Shuwaie</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>The influence of pain and pain-related fear and disability
