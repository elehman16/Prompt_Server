Patients will be randomised to one of two treatment groups: a combination of benidipine 4&#x02013;8&#x02005;mg/day and fosinopril 20&#x02005;mg/day; or a combination of HCTZ 12.5&#x02013;25&#x02005;mg/day and fosinopril 20&#x02005;mg/day. Patients will be followed up for 24&#x02005;months after a month's fosinopril run-in. There will be dose-titration after 1 and 2&#x02005;months. The primary endpoint is changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from baseline to month 24. Secondary endpoints include changes in home blood pressure (BP), ambulatory BP, proteinuria, urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, and composite renal events in 24&#x02005;months.

China has a high overall prevalence of CKD of 10.8% and the number of CKD patients is estimated to be approximately 119.5 million.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The prevalence, awareness and treatment of hypertension (HTN) in non-dialysis CKD patients has been reported at 67.3%, 85.8%, and 81.0%, respectively.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> However, of the hypertensive CKD patients, only 14.1% had controlled blood pressure (BP) to &#x0003c;130/80&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg. Racial and geographical differences play important roles in HTN of Chinese CKD patients. With successive CKD stages, the risk of uncontrolled HTN increased, and uncontrolled HTN was associated with renal disease progression. Managing BP effectively in CKD patients is still a large unmet medical need in China.</p><p>Abnormal activation of the renin&#x02013;angiotensin&#x02013;aldosterone system (RAAS) in CKD plays an important role in the pathogenesis of HTN. Renin&#x02013;angiotensin system inhibitors (RASI), including ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs), have been confirmed as having apparent renoprotective effects in patients with CKD. The guidelines recommend that ACEI or ARB is the preferred antihypertensive agent in CKD patients with HTN or albuminuria. However, RASI monotherapy does not usually achieve adequate BP control. Patients with CKD usually need combination antihypertensive therapy to achieve the recommended BP goal of &#x0003c;130/80&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Co-administration of diuretics and calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) with ACEIs or ARBs are the most common combinations. Dihydropyridine-type CCB plus RASI is a preferred combination in clinical practice with mild adverse effects.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic plus RASI is another widely used combination, providing the synergistic function of antihypertensive action while offsetting mutual adverse effects (such as hyperkalemia and impaired glucose tolerance).</p><p>In recent years, clinical studies focusing on the addition of a CCB or diuretic to RASI have led to inconsistent results. The GUARD trial found that the reduction of albuminuria in the hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) plus benazepril group was greater than in the amlodipine plus benazepril group in hypertensive patients with diabetic nephropathy.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Hayashi <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> found the addition of diuretics or CCB to ARB was equally effective for the control of HTN in CKD, while diuretics may be better than CCB in reducing proteinuria (PROTECT study). However, Ishimitsu <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> found losartan plus nifedipine showed a superior antihypertensive and renoprotective effect in CKD patients compared to losartan plus HCTZ, but nifedipine was not associated with lower urinary albumin excretion compared to HCTZ. The ACCOMPLISH study<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> concluded that hypertensive patients treated with benazepril plus amlodipine had a lower risk of progression to CKD than those treated with benazepril plus HCTZ.</p><p>Until now, no large-scale studies have compared the effect of initial treatment with two different combinations of antihypertensive drugs in CKD patients on the progression of kidney disease, especially in subsets of diabetes, non-diabetes, microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria. Moreover, CKD patients have elevated levels of cardiovascular disease risk and endothelial dysfunction markers compared with healthy individuals (such as serum aldosterone (SA), Von Willebrand factor (vWF) and E-selectin (ES)). These markers are elevated early in the disease and are associated with decline in renal function. Based on this knowledge, we aim to investigate changes of the markers in response to antihypertensive therapy.</p><p>Recent studies found that CCBs varied in their effects on glomerular arterioles, reflecting the results of differential blockage of T-channel receptors (on the afferent and efferent arteriole) versus L-channel receptors (predominantly on the afferent arteriole).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Previous studies found benidipine had more favourable renoprotective effects when compared with other CCBs.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> T-channel blockade leads to a reduction in intra-glomerular pressure, and accordingly may lead to a fall in the concentration of urine albumin. This study will use benidipine (L/T-type CCB), which is different from ACCOMPLISH study.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>BEAHIT (Benidipine and Hydrochlorothiazide in Fosinopril Treated Chronic Kidney Disease Patients with Hypertension) will test whether the superiority of benidipine in protecting renal function exists over 2&#x02005;years' treatment. This trial is large enough for estimates such as proteinuria, BP and other related clinical parameters. In consideration of the controversy between diuretic and CCB in renal protection, we aim to conduct a large-scale study to compare benidipine with HCTZ in fosinopril treated hypertensive CKD patients. This protocol was approved by the Changzheng Hospital Ethics Committee and registered in clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02646397).

Patients will be recruited for the BEAHIT trial through local advertising and identification from a CKD patient database. The screening in each site will continue until the target number is achieved during the enrolment period (12&#x02005;months). A medical investigator will provide patients with written informed consent forms. Nurses will record baseline variables, take urine and blood for baseline haematology and biochemistry tests, and record medical histories. Blood samples will be analysed at the local laboratory centre by the usual methods. Serum and blood for future analyses will be stored at the local centre. First, patients need to sign the informed consent forms and meet the exclusion and inclusion criteria. Then, patients will be treated with fosinopril (10&#x02005;mg) for 2&#x02005;weeks in order to screen and washout previous antihypertensive medications. Two weeks later, the dose will increase to 20&#x02005;mg for another 2&#x02005;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Eligible subjects will then be randomised (1:1) to one of the following two groups: a combination of fosinopril 20&#x02005;mg/day plus benidipine 4&#x02005;mg/day; or a combination of fosinopril 20&#x02005;mg/day plus HCTZ 12.5&#x02005;mg/day. Research staff responsible for recruitment will request the randomisation codes from the statistics research section (SRS) of the second military medical university. Then the SRS will send the randomisation code to the research physicians in sealed opaque envelopes. Each physician will open the envelope and assign the treatment to the relevant patient. The physician is not allowed to provide information about the treatment allocation to either the patient or the recruitment staff. The randomisation code will not be released until the patient has completed baseline measurements and has been included in this trial.</p><p>The randomly assigned codes will be generated by the SRS through a dynamic allocation method after stratification by gender and the presence/absence of diabetes according to the data at the first screening. The randomisation lists will remain with the SRS for the duration of the study without influence from the principal investigators, the TMC or the physicians.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Blinding</title><p>Trial patients and outcome assessors will be blinded to the allocation. Trial patients also will be blinded to the study hypothesis. Outcome assessors will attend an assessment training programme. Employees outside this research team will enter data into the computer on separate datasheets so that the outcome assessors can analyse data without knowing the allocation. Trial medication will be provided in identical containers with blank labels for each of the two assignments at the Changzheng Hospital Pharmacy. The time of the final unblinding of all trial patients will be after the creation of the locked dataset.</p><p>Emergency unblinding should happen only in exceptional circumstances when knowing the actual intervention is absolutely necessary for further treatment of the patient. The DMC provides 24&#x02005;hour telephone unblinding services. Physicians will be encouraged to maintain the blinding as long as possible. Actual allocation should not be open to the patient or other study investigators after the emergency unblinding.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Trial treatments</title><p>Initial treatments for the two groups are as described above. After 1&#x02005;month, patients who do not fulfil the home BP target in each group will be force-titrated to twice the starting dose, namely a combination of fosinopril 20&#x02005;mg/day plus benidipine 8&#x02005;mg/day or a combination of fosinopril 20&#x02005;mg/day plus HCTZ 25&#x02005;mg/day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016013672F1">figure 1</xref>). Add-on antihypertensive agents (ie, &#x003b2;-blockers, &#x003b1;-blockers or clonidine) will be allowed at month 2 in patients who still have not reached the target home BP after titration. A &#x003b2;-blocker is suggested as the third agent in both groups.

The tests should be performed at each visit (V0&#x02212;V2&#x000b1;2&#x02005;days, V3&#x02212;V12&#x000b1;1&#x02005;weeks). After randomisation, included patients will need to receive follow-up over the study period. Safety parameters, the interim endpoints and adverse events (AEs) will be recorded at each visit. At each visit, blood and urine will be collected for determination of eGFR, 24&#x02005;hour urine protein, albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR), biochemical analysis and other related clinical parameters. BP will be measured in triplicate at visits by the same doctor. If the study medication is withdrawn by the investigators for any reason, the patient should finish the last follow-up according to V12 as soon as possible. If a patient needs to start therapy for a specific clinical indication or emergency such as an infection, the investigator could prescribe additional therapy on top of the study drug.</p><table-wrap

An SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its status of seriousness. All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilisation. A non-SAE is an AE not classified as serious. Non-serious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilisation, or reported as SAEs if they become serious.

They will also be analysed with a linear mixed-effects model as a function of treatment group, and month, with adjustment for age, sex, race, baseline eGFR, diabetes or non-diabetes, baseline ACR and clinical site. We will test slopes for overall 24-month changes; 24&#x02005;hour proteinuria will be transformed with the use of the natural logarithm.</p><p>The incidence of renal events will be evaluated using the time-to-event analysis. The cumulative incidence rates will be calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, defining the random allocation date as the starting point. The comparison between treatment arms is conducted using the log-rank test.
