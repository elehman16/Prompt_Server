The randomized cluster was based in characteristics of production sectors. A total cluster will be 4 sectors, and 957 workers will be recruited from a textile industry and randomly allocated into intervention or control groups. Both groups will receive training on ergonomics guidelines. In addition, the intervention group will perform job rotation, switching between tasks with low, moderate, and high risk for musculoskeletal complaints. The primary outcome will be the number of working hours lost due to sick leave by musculoskeletal injuries recorded in employee administrative data bases. Secondary outcomes measured via survey include: body parts with musculoskeletal pain, the intensity of this pain, physical workload, fatigue, general health status, physical activity level, and work productivity. Secondary outcome measures will be assessed at baseline and after 3, 6, 9, and 12&#x000a0;months.

In case of productive cells characterized by tasks that require some type of physical burden and/or the adoption of cognitive interventions to reduce the level or duration of exposure of workers, such as: redesign of jobs, suitable furniture and tools, ergonomic guidelines, rest breaks and rotation function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The latter, considered organizational measures are generally adopted in tasks whose exposure level cannot be lowered due to the characteristics of the job or through physical measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Job rotation is one of the most practiced organizational interventions, such as cost reduction and/or prevention and health promotion for workers. Cost reduction is achieved by training workers to perform a greater number of functions for flexible allocation of worker activity. The prevention and health promotion for workers occurs through switching between different tasks with different levels of exposure and biomechanical applications, which in theory reduce the cumulative and or average exposure that should in turn promote the reduction of musculoskeletal and cognitive overloads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].Thus, the job rotation has been adopted in repetitive, static, or monotonous activities, aiming to relieve the effects of muscle and cognitive overload, monotony, absenteeism, and stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Regarding the assessment of the effectiveness of the job rotation and the prevention of musculoskeletal complaints strategy, studies show conflicting results. Hinnen et al. evaluated supermarket workers by a cross-sectional study and found a 40% reduction in complaints of neck pain and a 20% reduction in complaints of pain in the shoulder for those who carried out labor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Another study compared groups who performed or did not perform job rotation, and also found significant reductions in physical burden on workers of a garbage collection department who underwent rotation between the driving task and collecting trash [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, while performing in a longitudinal study, it was observed that in the long run, the job rotation increased overload on other body regions, and workers began to report more back pain, especially in the group who had just completed the driving task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Probably, it is because the groups continued exposure to the same risk factors, even when switching the task. Similar results were obtained by Frazer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], who evaluated two tasks of material handling, with low and high overhead level. The risk of lower back pain increased as a greater amount of time was used to perform the task with higher overhead, due to the cumulative and peak force [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The different study methods and criteria used for deployment of job rotation may partly explain the heterogeneity of results. This, plus the absence of clinical, controlled, randomized studies evaluating the effectiveness of the job rotation and the prevention of musculoskeletal complaints strategy, complicates the clinical decision making of professionals in the health and safety of the worker.</p><p>Importantly, positive results for the worker's health will only be achieved if the planning of the job rotation meets some important criteria such as number of workers and tasks involved, exposure level, requested body region, frequency of movements, duration of exposure, and duration of rest break, among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. To assist in this planning, some methods and algorithms have been developed using the variables mentioned before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]; however, the proposed rotation as reported in the literature, has not been evaluated in controlled clinical studies or randomized, and the effect of reducing absenteeism caused by musculoskeletal disorders in the workplace is not yet proven.</p><p>All these limitations point to the need for implementing a well design job rotation program along with a well-designed intervention study in order to fully and robustly evaluate the theory of job rotation and its application. Hence, we aimed to develop such a well-designed job rotation program that has specific criteria to reduce the cumulative and average biomechanical exposure and then to evaluate the effect of this newly developed job rotation program in the prevention of musculoskeletal disorders in industrial textile workers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design, approval and registration</title><p>This is a randomized cluster controlled trial, prospectively registered, and with blinded assessment will be used to investigate the effectiveness of job rotation to prevent musculoskeletal disorders in industrial workers. The procedures and consent form were approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Cidade de S&#x000e3;o Paulo University (protocol no. 18170313.5.0000.0064) and were prospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov &#x02013; NCT01979731. The study is being funded by the National Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq), Brazil (473651/2013-0).</p></sec><sec><title>Study population and setting</title><p>Study participants will be production line workers, recruited from the textile industry of a large company in Bahia, Brazil. The productive sectors of this industry will be classified according to the level of exposure to risk factors for musculoskeletal pain and disorders. The sectors to be included should have production lines that allow switching between tasks with different biomechanical demands and levels of risk for musculoskeletal pain and disorders, and further, that the work is carried out in cell production. Sectors whose production lines are automated or semi-automated, possessing the pace of work determined by machinery where work stoppage is not possible will be excluded. All workers in selected sectors will be invited to participate in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>The number of working hours lost due to sick leave by musculoskeletal injuries (M Group International Classification of Diseases, ICD-10) was used to estimate the sample size. The average time lost during the last three months in companies that the study observed was approximately 1,100&#x000a0;hours. The authors assume that interventions will enable a reduction of this number by 10%, that is, the groups will have a difference of 100 lost working hours, with a standard deviation of 250&#x000a0;hours. A statistical power of 80%, an alpha of 5%, and a possible sample loss of up to 15% is considered. Therefore, 116 participants are needed per group, or 232 in total. But, in this study the calculation of sample size was made by clusters and considered the number of production sectors included. The clusters number was four sectors (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;957). The intervention group has 504 workers selected from Finishing Socks and Finishing Underwear departments, and the control group is 453selected from Sewing Socks and Sewing Underwear departments (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study flow diagram.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2474-15-170-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>Randomization was performed at the group level (departments/productive sectors), in order to avoid contamination from workers allocated in the intervention to those in the control group. The productive sectors included in the study were pre-stratified by the level of exposure to risk factors for musculoskeletal pain and disorders. Sectors with similar demands were grouped and randomly divided between intervention and control groups. Using a computer-generated randomization (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomizer.org">http://www.randomizer.org</ext-link>) with random numbers to define groups, the randomization was performed by an independent researcher who was not involved in recruitment and assessment. Sealed envelopes will be used. The randomization was performed before baseline measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>Obviously, the nature of the intervention used in this study made it impossible to blind workers and ergonomists. However, the workers&#x02019; interview researcher will be blind to the study design and the group assignment. To test blinding, after assessment of outcomes, the worker&#x02019;s assessment researcher will note his opinion as to the type of intervention received by workers. Moreover, all workers in both groups will receive ergonomic guidelines, used as a placebo intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Study groups</title><sec><title><bold><italic>Control group</italic></bold></title><p>Workers allocated in the control group will be invited to attend training with ergonomic guidelines, taught by a physiotherapist/ergonomist. The training will be held on a single day over 4&#x000a0;hours, with lectures on: ergonomic risk factors and their influence on the development of musculoskeletal symptoms, improvements and adaptations for workstations, work postures, and preventive exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Participants in the intervention group will receive the same information.</p></sec><sec><title><bold><italic>Intervention group</italic></bold></title><p>Workers allocated in intervention sectors will receive the same ergonomic guidelines as the control group. In addition, they will realize job rotation, as described below.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><sec><title><bold><italic>Job rotation</italic></bold></title><p>The job rotation is proposed in order to modify exposure, so that workers will perform tasks alternating between low, moderate, and high risk for musculoskeletal pain and disorders and exposure to risk for injury to different body regions. Therefore, an ergonomic analysis will indicate, based on the main posture adopted to carry out the task, the body regions of higher overload level and intensity of exposure. The autonomy of the work (techniques and work rate) and the use of machines and tools will also be evaluated. The level of exposure to risk of musculoskeletal pain and disorders will be assessed by Quick Exposure Check (QEC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. These methods enable the characterization of worker exposure to the task because they assess the main risk factors for musculoskeletal disorders (frequency of movements and postures performed by spine and upper limbs, amount of weight handled, time to perform the task, manual force, visual demands of the activity, presence of vibration, work pace, and stress) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The structure of the job rotation will be proposed from the results obtained by ergonomic assessment, according to the following priority criteria: (1) level of exposure intensity (low, moderate, high, or very high), (2) posture predominantly adopted for conducting task (sitting, kneeling, standing, walking), (3) the main physical demand (material handling, repetition of movements, static posture), and (4) body regions of higher overhead (shoulders, elbows, wrists, hands, spine) (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Tasks that have similarity of these criteria will be grouped to then be alternated, so that: (1) tasks with exposure level will be low or moderate risk tasks alternated with high and very high, (2) tasks that require a predominantly standing posture will alternate with tasks that require a sitting posture, (3) handling tasks will be alternated with tasks requiring repetition of movements, and (4) the tasks alternate body regions of higher overhead (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The completion of the rotation will take place at intervals of 2&#x000a0;hours. It is estimated that this time is compatible with a lower lactic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summarized description of the job rotation definition</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="center"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>Step</bold></th><th align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>Definition</bold></th><th align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>Description</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">1<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>Ergonomic work analysis</bold><hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Evaluate the main demand of work posture adopted in the task, movements per body region (amplitude and frequency), autonomy, work rate, percentage of occupation in work cycles<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">2<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>Ergonomic exposure risk level assessment</bold><hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Classify the activity exposure level ergonomic (low, moderate, high and very high) by two observational protocols: Quick Exposure Check (QEC) and Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA)<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center">3</td><td align="center"><bold>Job rotation definition</bold></td><td align="center">Propose the structure of job rotation in accordance with the following priority criteria: (1) the level of exposure intensity (low, moderate, high or very high), (2) predominantly stance taken by the completion task (sitting, kneeling, standing, walking), (3) the main physical demand (material handling, repetition of movements, static posture), (4) body regions of higher overhead (shoulders, elbows, wrists, hands, spine), (5) production&#x02019;s specificities</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Job rotation design.</bold> Group A (operate Alome machine; Firsan- shaping socks; separation of product&#x02019;s color and size; stamping; Tecma machine packaging; silicon preparing); Group B (Alome - choice of pair of socks; operate Satellite machine; operate Sealing machine; fix fast pin; automatic packaging); Group C (Firsan- choice of pair of socks; Satellite packing socks; Alome &#x02013; socks review; manual packaging; operate Autotex machine; application of silicon; seamless products review).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2474-15-170-2"/></fig></sec></sec><sec><title>Assessment instruments and outcomes</title><p>Although the intervention is applied to the production sectors, the outcomes are on an individual level, since they reflect aspects of the health of workers.
