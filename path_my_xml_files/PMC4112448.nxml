During its use as an anaesthetic, it was noted that the analgesia extended into the postoperative period,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> reducing the need for opioids. Analgesia at sub-anaesthetic doses is a feature of methoxyflurane not shared by other halogenated inhalational anaesthetics,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and methoxyflurane continued to be given in low doses (inhaled as a vapour) for conscious analgesia as its anaesthetic use declined. The onset of action of methoxyflurane is rapid, with the onset of analgesia within 2&#x02013;5&#x02005;min. Analgesia persists for a period of time after cessation of inhalation.</p><p>The major concern in the past with methoxyflurane has been nephrotoxicity, which was reported following deep methoxyflurane anaesthesia.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Studies found that the nephrotoxicity was associated with inorganic fluoride levels, and was dose related.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> There was no evidence of nephrotoxicity associated with sub-anaesthetic doses of methoxyflurane, and the biochemical evidence demonstrated that the resulting levels of metabolites were well below levels associated with subclinical toxicity.</p><p>In 1968, Abbott Laboratories introduced the Analgizer device worldwide for low-dose self-administration of methoxyflurane by inhalation for pain relief. This technique was used effectively and safely in obstetrics<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and postoperative analgesia,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>

The Penthrox inhaler, an improved version of the Analgizer, permits the use of a smaller dose to achieve adequate analgesia (3&#x02013;6&#x02005;mL vs 15&#x02005;mL). In Australia, it is used by ambulance services, the military, first-aid officers, in ski-fields and mines, and in the emergency departments (EDs) of several major hospitals. It is also used for short surgical procedures such as changing dressings, biopsies<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and colonoscopies.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Despite a large volume of published literature supporting the efficacy and safety of methoxyflurane at analgesic concentrations in both adults and children, a limited number of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) controlled studies have been conducted. Grindlay and Babl<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> conducted a review of the literature on the use of methoxyflurane in EDs and prehospital settings. Their conclusions were that (1) methoxyflurane is likely to be an efficacious analgesic and (2) no significant adverse events (AEs) have been associated with it at analgesic doses.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> They state, however, that a paucity of data from controlled trials needs to be rectified, and recommend that large, blinded, placebo-controlled studies investigating its analgesic efficacy should be conducted.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>This double-blind, randomised, controlled clinical study was conducted to investigate the safety and efficacy of methoxyflurane at analgesic doses in patients aged &#x02265;12&#x02005;years presenting to the ED with pain associated with minor to moderate trauma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>STOP! was a randomised, double-blind, multicentre, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted at six sites in the UK. Use of an active comparator, although preferred, would have posed considerable challenges to keep the study blind because of the unique mode of delivery and smell of methoxyflurane. A total of 300 patients, 90 of whom were adolescent patients (age 12&#x02013;17&#x02005;years), were randomised 150:150 to receive either methoxyflurane via a Penthrox inhaler or placebo.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the short-term efficacy of methoxyflurane for the treatment of acute pain in patients 12&#x02005;years of age or older presenting to an ED with minor trauma (where trauma refers to &#x02018;a physical wound or injury&#x02019;, such as fractures, lacerations, burns, dislocations, contusions or injury due to foreign bodies). The primary end point of the study was the change in pain intensity as measured using the visual analogue scale (VAS) from baseline to 5, 10, 15 and 20&#x02005;min after the start of study drug inhalation. The secondary objective was to evaluate the safety of methoxyflurane in this context.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>A total of 300 eligible patients (210 adults and 90 adolescents) were to be randomised in a 1:1 ratio; 150 patients (105 adults and 45 adolescents) were each to receive either methoxyflurane or placebo. Randomisation sequences, stratified by centre and age group (adolescent/adult) were prepared by an independent statistician, and study medication was packaged according to the randomisation sequences. At enrolment, each individual patient was allocated the next randomisation number in the appropriate stratum. Treatment allocation as per the randomisation scheme was maintained by allocating study medication with the next sequential patient number. To maintain the randomisation strata for adolescents/adults, study medication for adolescents and adults were identified by different coloured labels. To prevent selection bias, the assembling and dispensing of study medication was only performed by the unblinded research team member after the patient had consented to the study. The inhalers were visually indistinguishable, but as methoxyflurane has a characteristic odour, one drop of methoxyflurane was placed on the outside of the primed inhaler to support blinding. The research nurse, the treating physician and the patient all remained blind to the treatment administered.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Protocol</title><p>Patients were supplied with one inhaler containing 3&#x02005;mL methoxyflurane or 5&#x02005;mL placebo as soon as possible after enrolment and initial assessment. A second inhaler containing 3&#x02005;mL methoxyflurane or 5&#x02005;mL placebo (depending on the treatment arm) was only supplied if requested by the patient. The research nurse assisted the patient to self-administer methoxyflurane/placebo. It was anticipated that each inhaler could provide up to 1&#x02005;h of pain relief when used intermittently. Patients were advised that rescue medication would be available immediately on request at any time during or after completion of their treatment with the study medication. Pain intensity (VAS) was measured 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30&#x02005;min after the start of inhalation of study medication; thereafter it was measured every 30&#x02005;min until rescue medication was administered or before ED discharge, whichever was sooner. Global medication performance for patient, treating physician and research nurse was assessed before ED discharge. The patients also received 16&#x000d7;500&#x02005;mg paracetamol tablets at the time of discharge from the ED for pain relief, if required, during the 14-day post-study period. The expected duration of the study for each patient was up to 16&#x02005;days, which included a 14-day post-treatment safety follow-up. Safety laboratory samples for haematology and biochemistry were drawn &#x02212;10 to +5&#x02005;min from the start of inhalation of methoxyflurane, as well as at the 14-day follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Eligibility</title><p>Eligible participants were 12&#x02005;years of age or older who had a pain score &#x02265;4 to &#x02264;7 due to minor trauma as measured using the numerical rating scale at the time of admission and were able to give written informed consent or who were accompanied by a parent(s)/legal guardian able to provide written informed consent on their behalf.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary efficacy variable was the VAS pain intensity (100&#x02005;mm sliding scale ruler).

The primary analysis was the overall test for treatment effect. The treatment effect was estimated as the average (least squares mean) difference between the methoxyflurane-treated group and the placebo group. The significance of the interaction term was also tested.</p><p>All hypothesis testing was carried out at the 5% (two-sided) significance level unless stated otherwise.

This study has demonstrated that the effect of methoxyflurane on pain is clinically significant, as it reduced pain severity by more than 30%.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In addition, the median time to first pain relief for the methoxyflurane group was 4&#x02005;min. This compares favourably with a median time to onset of meaningful pain relief of 11&#x02005;min with intranasal fentanyl (IF),<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> 16&#x02005;min with oromucosal fentanyl,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and 5&#x02005;min with intravenous morphine sulfate.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> There was a higher occurrence of AEs in methoxyflurane-treated patients than in those treated with placebo; however, in general, methoxyflurane was well tolerated, with the majority of adverse reactions being mild, transient and in line with anticipated pharmacological action. The majority of patients successfully completed treatment, with no relevant difference in incidence, severity, or proportion of events leading to withdrawal between the methoxyflurane and placebo groups.</p><p>The rapid pain relief provided by methoxyflurane has also been reported by Johnston <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> who found in a retrospective, observational prehospital study of 1024 patients that Penthrox provided a more rapid onset of pain relief than IF, and as a sole agent was not associated with any AEs, whereas IF was implicated in several patients becoming hypotensive. There is also evidence that methoxyflurane provides analgesia that is greater than or equal to that of Entonox.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In a prospective, randomised, crossover study that compared nitrous oxide with Penthrox in 20 dental patients,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> there were minimal adverse effects with either gas, with the number of AEs similar between treatments.</p><p>Chin <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> conducted a pilot randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of using Penthrox inhaler for acute pain relief in children with upper limb fracture. They reported that there was a significantly greater reduction in pain score (4.0 vs 1.3; p&#x0003c;0.05) in patients using the Penthrox inhaler than those treated with placebo. In a related study, McCaskill <italic>et al</italic> (unpublished data; 2002) evaluated the effectiveness of methoxyflurane via an inhaler (brand not stated) in children with isolated upper limb fractures, and also in children undergoing venepuncture, in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. In the venepuncture group, there was no significant difference in the median change in pain scores during the procedure, and no increase in the proportion of children in the methoxyflurane-treated group with unchanged or improved pain scores. In contrast, in the upper limb fracture component of the study, children receiving methoxyflurane had significantly improved median change in pain scores compared with those receiving placebo. Spruyt <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> conducted a randomised, double-blind, single-centre, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and efficacy of Penthrox for the treatment of incident pain in adult patients undergoing a bone marrow biopsy. The results indicated that methoxyflurane significantly improved mean worst pain overall (p=0.011), and significantly improved pain during the aspiration component (p=0.001). Although the number of AEs was significantly higher in the Penthrox than the placebo arm, most AEs were mild, and there was no difference in the number of serious AEs in the two treatment arms. No serious AEs were considered to be related to the study drug.</p><p>The main limitation of the present study is the fact that an active comparator was not included in the design. The use of an active comparator, although preferred, would have posed insurmountable challenges to keep the study blind because of the unique mode of delivery and smell of methoxyflurane. The study design therefore included a placebo (normal saline) comparison to ensure that patient, physician and research nurse blinding was maintained.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this study support the evidence found in previous trials that methoxyflurane used as an analgesic is efficacious and safe. Although it appears to cause more adverse reactions than placebo, this is to be expected given its pharmacological action, and all such reactions have been found to be mild and transient.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Mark Roberts of ORION Clinical Services for editorial assistance.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> FC was involved in study design development, patient screening and data acquisition and assisted in writing and reviewing the manuscript for important intellectual content.
