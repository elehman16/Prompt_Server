The asthma component of the SLS is not yet reported but the COPD component, done over a 12-month period, found a statistically significant 8.4% reduction in COPD exacerbations when compared to usual care. No differences in adverse events, including serious adverse events and pneumonia, were noted. The importance of real-world findings, such as those found in the SLS COPD trial with inhaled FF/VI, is discussed in comparison to classical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with inhaled FF/VI in COPD patients. The real-world, community-based pragmatic RCT like the SLS provides additional generalizable data with direct clinical applicability and potential usefulness in the development of practice guidelines. The results from the SLS, along with those of large and small RCTs, are supportive of the use of once-daily FF/VI in COPD maintenance therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Salford Lung Study</kwd><kwd>pragmatic randomized controlled trials</kwd><kwd>asthma</kwd><kwd>COPD</kwd><kwd>fluticasone furoate</kwd><kwd>FF</kwd><kwd>vilanterol</kwd><kwd>VI</kwd><kwd>COPD exacerbations</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction and limitations of the randomized controlled trial</title><p>The last 50 years has seen an amazing increase in the number of therapeutic agents available to the clinician. During this period, the anchor to proving the initial efficacy and safety of a new drug has been the randomized controlled trial (RCT). The RCT attempts to reduce variability between groups, decrease confounders, and insure equipoise resulting in the need for smaller sample size to show a positive drug effect. However, smaller sample size makes the detection of rare side effects less likely.</p><p>Two examples of the potential limitations of relying solely on RCTs for safety and efficacy determinations are reviewed. In the late 1950s, thalidomide was approved in Europe as a nonaddictive and nonbarbiturate sedative/hypnotic agent. It quickly became one of the top-selling drugs worldwide, gaining approval in 46 countries, not including the United States. Its effectiveness and safety were emphasized and it was also found to have efficacy as an antiemetic in pregnancy.<xref rid="b1-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Thalidomide was eventually banned in late 1961 after two investigators &#x02013; Lenz in Germany, and McBride in Australia &#x02013; noted congenital birth defects associated with its use. Increased miscarriages and over 10,000 children with severe birth defects were reported.<xref rid="b1-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Lack of appropriate preclinical teratogenic testing, limited number and size of RCTs, a shift in clinical indications resulting in the use of thalidomide in pregnant patients, and the lack of real-world testing put large numbers of patients and fetuses at risk with this drug. A second example is the use of the appetite-suppressant or anorectic agents fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine, or combinations of these drugs with phentermine (often called &#x0201c;fen/phen&#x0201d;).<xref rid="b2-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> These drugs were shown in RCTs to have efficacy in reducing weight in obese patients, but only later epidemiological and observational studies generated by initial case reports found a strong association between their use and both cardiac valvular abnormalities<xref rid="b3-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b6-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and pulmonary hypertension.<xref rid="b7-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Perhaps, instead of just more or larger RCTs, more real-world experience and analysis before and at the time of drug approval would have detected these problematic side effects earlier, even before the release of the drug.</p><p>The daily use of vitamin K antagonists offers another example of the potential variability seen between RCTs and real-world rates of medication adherence. A study of Ohio Medicaid patients with new-onset nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) found only 9.7% of all patients and 11.9% without contraindications filled a warfarin prescription 7 days before to 30 days after the new AF diagnosis.<xref rid="b9-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> This study does not necessarily reflect adherence, as the number of the 11,699 patients who were advised to go on vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants or were actually prescribed them was not known. In another study, a large clinical trial of 18,113 patients with AF studied dabigatran versus warfarin and found the mean percentage of time that patients on warfarin had an international normalized ratio (INR) within the therapeutic range (2.0&#x02013;3.0) was 64%.<xref rid="b10-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> A meta-analysis evaluating both retrospective and prospective trials assessing the quality of warfarin control in patients with atrial fibrillation in the United States found that patients spent a mean 55% (95% confidence interval [CI], CI 51%&#x02013;58%) of the time in therapeutic INR range.<xref rid="b11-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Warfarin use adherence was prospectively studied in a real-world setting in two anticoagulation clinics serving 22,425 patients.<xref rid="b12-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The authors found warfarin nonadherence was common (21% of patient-days observed.). A number of risk factors for warfarin nonadherence including younger age, male sex, lower stroke risk, poor cognitive function, poverty, and higher education attainment (beyond high school) have been identified.<xref rid="b12-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Drug adherence is an important variable and can affect the actual efficacy of a drug when used in a real-world setting.</p><p>The RCT may have higher drug adherence rates than would be seen in real-world use because the drug is provided, and a kind of &#x0201c;Hawthorne Effect&#x0201d; could occur with the constant encouragement of investigators and research staff. The Hawthorne Effect can be seen in RCTs when the inhaled placebo-treated group shows significant improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV)<sub>1</sub> after treatment that is still statistically less than the improvement seen in the &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; drug-treated group. This improvement has been suggested to be the result of factors like psychologist support, better adherence to concurrent medications, and better control of comorbid conditions.<xref rid="b14-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A recent observed trial on hand washing has quantified the Hawthorne Effect.<xref rid="b15-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Therapeutic use of the Hawthorne Effect has been advocated in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).<xref rid="b14-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Trial participants can experience the Hawthorne Effect in an RCT when there is a &#x0201c;change in the trial&#x02019;s participants&#x02019; outcome attributable to the awareness of being in a research study.&#x0201d;<xref rid="b16-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> This can reduce the generalizability of the RCT results to &#x0201c;real-world&#x0201d; health care settings.</p><p>The RCT is a well-controlled efficacy or explanatory trial designed to determine, under experimental conditions, whether an intervention such as a drug produces a reproducible result under optimal conditions.<xref rid="b17-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In contrast, the pragmatic RCT (pRCT) is a type of effectiveness or pragmatic trial that measures the potential beneficial result of an intervention such as a drug in real-world conditions.<xref rid="b17-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> When an intervention or drug is tested in both an RCT (efficacy) and a pRCT (effectiveness), the intervention is being evaluated in a pragmatic&#x02013;explanatory continuum that expands the potential generalizability of a positive response.<xref rid="b19-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>The average total cost of developing a new drug from preclinical discovery, through clinical trials with one or more RCTs, to gaining market approval is estimated to be a staggering $2.5 billion.<xref rid="b20-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Despite successes, the number of new drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration per inflation-adjusted billion US dollars spent on drug development has fallen dramatically from 1950 to 2010.<xref rid="b21-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>The need to get more relevant clinical drug data and yet not make the clinical drug development phase even more expensive has led to a call for considering changing from a Bayesian RCT model that uses a fixed design to an adaptive design.<xref rid="b21-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The &#x0201c;adaptive trial design&#x0201d; used in phase 3 trials allows changes in some important trial design features during the trial after unblinded data analysis has occurred and, thus, still controlling the overall Type I error level.<xref rid="b21-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Another approach is to get real-world data by retrospective analysis of multiple large RCTs or epidemiological approaches in patients taking the drug after approval. These approaches can often allow detection of rare side effects, drug use adherence, and frequency of specific drug use or usage patterns.<xref rid="b23-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Real-world data such as that from a pRCT can be seen as another layer of effectiveness data &#x02013; not replacing the RCT or efficacy data but rather providing a more comprehensive evaluation of a drug.

The lack of an increase in serious adverse events in the SLS-COPD study with FF/VI use, particularly pneumonia, was also an important practical finding.

This is particularly interesting because a meta-analysis of ICS use, alone or in combination with a LABA, in 10,150 COPD patients in 17 trials found that the use of ICS was associated with increased risk of serious pneumonia events without affecting mortality compared to controls.<xref rid="b47-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> The SUMMIT RCT and the SLS-COPD pRCT provide complementary &#x0201c;efficacy&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;effectiveness&#x0201d; data on the use of inhaled FF/VI in the treatment of COPD patients.</p><p>Additional recent trials include the FLAME trial, which was a 52-week, double-blind, double-dummy, non-inferiority RCT in 1,680 COPD patients with heightened cardiovascular risk who had had at least one eCOPD during the previous year. It found that inhaled once-daily LAMA glycopyrronium (GYP; 50 mcg) with the LABA indacaterol (IND; 110 mcg) was more effective than the inhaled twice-daily ICS fluticasone proprionate (FP; 500 mcg) with the LABA salmeterol (SAL) in reducing the annual rate of exacerbations (0.98 vs 1.19, rate ratio, 0.83; 95% CI 0.75&#x02013;0.91).<xref rid="b48-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> The time to first exacerbation was longer in the inhaled GLY/IND-treated group than in the inhaled FP/SAL-treated group. Another recent RCT was the LANTERN trial. This double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group RCT in 744 COPD patients compared inhaled GYP/IND (50/110 mcg) daily to twice-daily inhaled FP/SAL (500/50) in a 26-week study.<xref rid="b49-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> The LAMA/LABA combination of GYP/IND demonstrated a significant improvement in both trough FEV<sub>1</sub> and the area under the curve of FEV<sub>1</sub> between 0 and 4 hours after dosing. In COPD patients at high risk for exacerbations, a dry-powder once-daily inhaled triple-combination agent with FF, VI, and the LAMA umeclidinium is under development with early promising data.<xref rid="b50-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></p></sec><sec><title>The SLS real-world pragmatic RCTs &#x02013; conclusion</title><p>The pRCT SLS-asthma and -COPD studies with inhaled FF/VI offer complementary effectiveness data to traditional RCTs. If the drug effect is strong enough to show a statistically significant signal despite the real-world setting, with its challenges including drug-use adherence and multiple medical and social confounders, then it is likely to be generalizable to clinical practice. Demonstrating drug effectiveness and safety in a practical clinical setting and in a much less selected population than in a normal-efficacy RCT provides important data for the clinician. The cost of new drug approval is already prohibitively expensive. A pRCT like the SLS-asthma and -COPD trials had to be expensive, with as many as 150 GlaxoSmithKline-funded health care personnel working on the study at one time.<xref rid="b25-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Unless these trials can either replace some of the required RCTs for approval or can be done at a reasonable cost, it is unclear how the new drug-approval process can require large pRCT in addition to multiple, large RCTs as a routine required step in the drug-approval process. Another limitation of the pRCT is that it is easiest done in a single-community setting where a single EMR and pharmacy system exists. This potential population homogeneity is unlike a recent large FF/VI study on eCOPD that enrolled more than 16,000 patients in 43 countries insuring patient heterogeneity.<xref rid="b39-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> In addition to pharmaceutical approval studies, another important role for the pRCT is in treatment guideline formation and validation. Having RCTs defining the efficacy and safety and confirming those findings in a real-world pRCT defining effectiveness would insure the appropriateness of the therapy in the formulation of disease treatment guidelines. The real-world pRCT is likely to become more common and will likely be done in large organized health care systems built around integrated pharmacies and EMR systems. The pRCT provides evidence of drug safety and effectiveness outside the ideal conditions of the classical efficacy RCT.<xref rid="b51-por-8-175" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> When primary and secondary caregivers, pharmacies, hospitals, home nurses, and social workers are all on the same electronic record, studies could be relatively inexpensive to evaluate drug therapy or other interventions in the future in a real-world environment.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research did not receive any funding.
