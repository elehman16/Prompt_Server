The BACH study found higher mortality rates if patients presenting with dyspnea were treated with antibiotics and their procalcitonin (PCT) levels were low indicating absence of bacterial infection. Yet the BACH study was observational and causal inference cannot be drawn. Herein, we analyzed the effects of PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship in CHF patients from a previous trial (ProHOSP).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This is a secondary analysis of a previous randomized trial of adult ED patients with respiratory symptoms and a history of CHF. Patients were randomized to administration of antibiotics based on a PCT algorithm (PCT group) or standard guidelines without knowledge of PCT levels (control group). The primary endpoint of this analysis is the risk of adverse outcome defined as death or ICU admission within 30 days after ED admission.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 233 patients met the inclusion criteria, with 116 in the PCT-guided group and 117 in the control group. In the subgroup of patients with low initial PCT levels &#x0003c;0.25 ng/l (<italic>n </italic>= 110), PCT-guided patients had a significant reduction in antibiotic exposure (mean 3.7 vs. 6.5 days, difference -2.8 (95% CI -4.4, -1.2), <italic>P &#x0003c;</italic>0.001). Furthermore, PCT-guided patients had a significant lower risk for death and ICU admission (4% vs. 20%, odds ratio 6.0 (1.3, 28.2), <italic>P </italic>= 0.02).

Whether inadequate antibiotic therapy in these CHF patients requiring diuretic treatment explains this difference in clinical outcomes needs verification.</p></sec></body></article>
