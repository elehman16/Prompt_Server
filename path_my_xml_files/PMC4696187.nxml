In women, research has shown that between the ages of 18 to 55&#x000a0;years, the largest population risk for heart disease is attributable to smoking (particularly in young women) and physical inactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Despite steady declines in smoking prevalence over the past thirty years, in 2011&#x02013;12, 16&#x000a0;% (1.4 million) of Australian women aged 18&#x000a0;years and over smoked daily. The 2009 National Preventative Health Strategy calls for a target of 10&#x000a0;% or less for smoking prevalence by 2020. This target will not be reached unless rates of cessation substantially increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. More than half of all smokers want to quit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], but many struggle to achieve abstinence, and relapse is common, with only 5&#x000a0;% of smokers who quit without any assistance still abstinent at 6&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. As many smokers cite &#x02018;wanting to get fit&#x02019; as a motivation for quitting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], linking strategies that will simultaneously promote improvement in fitness and assist quitting has the potential to change both behaviours simultaneously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>There is evidence for a positive effect of exercise when quitting smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], with physical activity (PA) reducing cigarette cravings and withdrawal symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, the evidence for the efficacy of PA as an aid to quitting smoking is mixed. A recent systematic review of 15 randomised controlled trials highlighted insufficient exercise intensity as a potential limitation of interventions tested in previous trials which did not improve smoking abstinence rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) could overcome the potential limitation of insufficient intensity, by providing alternating short bursts of high intensity exercise with recovery periods of light exercise. HIIT provides rapid physiological adaptations, as indicated by improvements in maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>max), anaerobic threshold and stroke volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this project are to: (1) compare the effects of two exercise interventions (HIIT and a &#x02019;10,000 steps&#x02019; pedometer based intervention) combined with usual care smoking cessation support, on cessation rates in female smokers who wish to quit; (2) assess the effects of HIIT and 10,000 steps interventions on weight change and (3) assess whether improvements in fitness, vitality and intrinsic motivation are mediators of the relationship between activity and smoking cessation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design, participants and recruitment</title><p>The study has received ethical approval from the Medical Research Ethics Committee of The University of Queensland (#2014001266).

The treadmill test will use a ramp protocol where the inclination is constant (5.5&#x000a0;%) and the speed increased 0.5&#x000a0;km/h every minute, starting at 4&#x000a0;km/h. The cycle protocol includes a 2&#x02009;<bold>&#x000d7;</bold>&#x02009;4 min warm-up at 25&#x000a0;W and 50&#x000a0;W. The test starts at 50&#x000a0;W and increases by 25&#x000a0;W every minute. We will ask participants to refrain from smoking two hours before the test, and from drinking alcohol, or doing any vigorous or moderate intensity activities 12-h before the test.</p><p><italic>Lung function</italic> will be assessed by forced vital capacity [FVC], forced expiratory volume in 1&#x000a0;s [FEV<sub>1</sub>] and FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio, using a Vitalograph (2150, Ennis, Ireland). We will ask participants to inhale completely and rapidly through the mouth (not the nose), then exhale maximally and forcefully, with their lips creating an airtight seal around the mouthpiece, until no more air can be expelled (minimum of six seconds). Participants will repeat the manoeuvre three times, with a rest period of &#x02265;1&#x000a0;min between efforts. Peak expiratory flow rate [PEFR]) will be assessed using a portable peak flow meter (Assess, Cedar Grove, USA), using the same technique as described above. Participants will repeat the manoeuvre three times, with a rest period of &#x02265;1&#x000a0;min between efforts.</p><p><italic>Body composition</italic> will be assessed by researcher measured body mass index (height, weight), and waist circumference. Standing height and weight will be measured using a stadiometer (SECA 217-172-1009, Hamburg, Germany) and electronic scale (Charder MS 3200, Hamburg, Germany) respectively. Waist circumference will be measured using a tape passed around the narrowest point of the abdomen. We will take each measure twice and use the average measure obtained, unless the first and second measures vary by more than 1&#x000a0;%, in which case we will use the median of three measurements. Body mass index will be calculated as weight (kg)/height<sup>2</sup> (m<sup>2</sup>).</p><p><italic>Physical activity and sedentary time</italic> will be measured using a wrist-worn GENEActiv accelerometer, which will be worn for one week at each measurement time. The GENEActiv is a tri-axial, &#x000b1; 6&#x000a0;g seismic acceleration sensor. It is small (36x30x12 cm), lightweight (16&#x000a0;g), waterproof, and offers a near body temperature sensor to help improve the confirmation of wear and non-time. GENEActivs will be configured with a sampling frequency of 80 Hz, with data uploaded and converted to 15&#x000a0;s epoch .csv files using GENEActiv PC software version 2.1. We will import the epoch files into custom built Excel spreadsheets that will compute the most likely posture (lying, sitting, standing, ambulation), activity intensity (sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous) and sleep. This will provide information on average daily sedentary, active and sleep patterning and behaviour, and will provide a measure of overall weekly physical activity.
