Losing weight has a well-documented short-term positive effect on intermediate outcomes such as glycaemic control, blood pressure, and dyslipidemia [<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Indeed, weight loss is regarded by many clinicians as an effective secondary prevention for cardiovascular disease in overweight patients with diabetes. This view is not only supported by the favorable clinical effects of weight loss on risk factors, but also by results from cohort studies, suggesting that intentional weight loss reduces mortality in these patients [<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Nevertheless, the large randomized Look AHEAD trial was unable to confirm the health benefits related to weight loss, and Look AHEAD was stopped prematurely after 9.6 years of intervention with diet and exercise [<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Results from Look AHEAD showed, that despite a greater weight loss in the intervention compared with the control group, neither mortality nor cardiovascular morbidity was reduced. The participants in Look AHEAD were a selection of relatively healthy overweight adults with prevalent type 2 diabetes, and the authors stated that the results could not be generalized, as the participants in Look AHEAD were not representative of the background population of patients with type 2 diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to the Look AHEAD study, the randomized clinical trial, Diabetes Care in General Practice (DCGP), included a population-based sample of consecutive patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 1989&#x02013;92. The participants were representative of the background population with incident type 2 diabetes 25 years ago in a Northern European setting. This paper is a cohort study of the group of overweight patients in the well-monitored intervention arm of DCGP. Unintentional weight loss, caused by unrecognized fatal disease (pathological weight loss) is an important bias when studying the association between therapeutic weight loss and survival [<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, our primary interest was to examine weight changes among patients who reported an intended aim to lose weight. The objective was to estimate the long-term all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cardiovascular morbidity risk attributable to weight change in a population-based sample of overweight patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Our hypothesis was that therapeutic intentional weight loss, supervised by a medical doctor, improves health and prolongs life in these patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>The study design at a glance</title><p>The timeline and basic design of this cohort study of overweight participants in the intervention arm of the DCGP trial is explained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146889.g001">Fig 1</xref>.

The patients were aged 40 years or older. The family physicians/general practitioners (GPs) were randomized to give either routine care or the intervention: structured personal care [<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The intervention aimed at managing glycaemia, blood pressures, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and unhealthy lifestyle by means of individualized goal setting. The personal goals were set in an agreement between the doctor and the patient, and the goals were continuously adjusted. Altogether, 761 patients were included in the intervention arm, and every third month, over a period of 6 years, patients were invited to check-ups with their GP. Among other measures, body weight and a goal for weight change during the next 3 months were recorded at each visit. For overweight patients, the doctors in the study were encouraged to reach an agreement with patients on obtaining small and realistic weight reduction, recording it, and following it up at the next check-up. It was suggested to the intervention doctors that they recommend increased physical activity and simple dietary changes to patients. Dietary changes included eating 5&#x02013;6 meals per day, an increase in the intake of complex carbohydrate to at least 50% of the diet, and, in particular, an increase in the intake of water soluble fibers, a reduction in alcohol, and restricting fat intake to a maximum of 30% [<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The doctors in the intervention group were supported by clinical guidelines and continuous medical education. The recommended management of patients did not differ according to the patients&#x02019; level of overweight.

Thus, mortality/morbidity attributable to weight change in these two categories of intention was not compared but the risk was estimated separately for each category.</p><p>The main model included only covariates with an anticipated causal effect on both the exposure (weight change over 6 years) and the outcomes. Intermediate variables like the mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> in the monitoring period and the blood pressure, or triglyceride level at diagnosis, were included in additional sensitivity analyses to further adjust for disease severity. Other sensitivity analysis with a more narrow definition of the &#x02018;intention to lose weight&#x02019; (6 or more recorded goals of weight loss, with at least one of these goals recorded in one of the 3 last check-ups), or for subgroups of patients with the &#x02018;intention to lose weight&#x02019; further stratified on BMI (&#x0003c;30 vs. BMI&#x02265;30), microalbuminuria (&#x02265;15 vs. &#x0003c;15 mg/L), or established macrovascular disease (+/-) at diagnosis, were planned and performed. A post hoc sensitivity analysis adjusting for use of acetylcholine esterase inhibitors or angiotensine receptor blockers was made. No patients used glitazones and only 8 patients used statins at year 6. Therefore, no sensitivity analyses were made regarding use of these medications. There were no data available on use of acetylsalicylic acid.</p><p>As we expected most patients with pathological weight loss in the monitoring period to die within the first two years of the follow-up, the HR for the outcomes were analyzed separately for this period (year 6&#x02013;8) and for the subsequent 11 years period (year 8&#x02013;19). We regarded an association between weight loss in the monitoring period and mortality in the latter 11 years of follow-up (year 8&#x02013;19), as being less affected by potential confounding from pathological weight loss. As we did not expect the associations to be linear, we modeled the relations by restricted cubic splines [<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Only patients who were not registered as having cardiovascular morbidity (as defined for outcomes) by the end of the monitoring period were included in the analyses relating weight changes to cardiovascular morbidity. For 62 patients (14%), information on one or more of the covariates was missing, and they were omitted from the analyses. There was no loss to follow-up. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS statistical software, version 9.2.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was approved by the research ethics committee of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg (V.100.869/87).

Among these overweight patients aiming to lose weight there was no difference in mortality rate attributable to weight loss between the first two years and the rest of the follow-up period (P = 0.72), and there was a trend toward a linear association between weight change and increased all-cause mortality 1.20 (95% CI 0.97&#x02013;1.50, P = 0.10). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146889.g004">Fig 4</xref> the adjusted HR for all-cause mortality is depicted as a spline function of the yearly weight change rate (the &#x003b2;-coefficient from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146889.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Zero on the x-axis signifies that the weight on average was maintained throughout the monitoring period, whereas a negative value denotes a general weight loss. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146889.g004">Fig 4</xref> suggests a V-like association between weight change and all-cause mortality suggesting a trend towards the lowest mortality in those maintaining their weight despite their intention to lose weight.</p><fig id="pone.0146889.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0146889.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Weight change and mortality among overweight diabetes patients with an &#x02018;intention to lose weight&#x02019;.</title><p>The figure demonstrates the association between the yearly weight change during the 6-year monitoring period after the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and the subsequent 13-years HR for all-cause mortality.

The inclusion of the mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> in the monitoring period, the triglyceride level, the diastolic or systolic blood pressure at diagnosis as covariates did not substantially change the estimates. A more narrow definition of &#x02018;intention to lose weight&#x02019; (as defined in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec006">Methods</xref>) also gave essentially similar results. Analyses stratified by BMI indicate that associations between weight loss and all-cause mortality may be driven by patients with a BMI&#x02265;30 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0146889.t003">Table 3</xref>). In these obese patients, intentional weight loss was associated with an increased mortality (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.01&#x02013;1.84, P = 0.04), whereas in overweight patients with BMI&#x0003c;30 weight loss was not associated with mortality (0.65, 0.37&#x02013;1.13, P = 0.12). In patients with microalbuminuria at diagnosis, intentional weight loss was associated with increased all-cause mortality (HR 1.90, 1.03&#x02013;3.48, P = 0.04), while in patients without established cardiovascular disease or microalbuminuria at baseline, intentional weight loss was not associated with mortality (HR 1.00, 0.59&#x02013;1.71, P = 0.99). Furthermore, a post hoc analysis of patients who became or remained physically active did not indicate a protective effect of intentional weight loss (HR 1.07, 0.83&#x02013;1.37, P = 0.61). Adjustment for the use of acetylcholine esterase inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers did not change the association (HR 1.20, 0.96&#x02013;1.50, P = 0.10).</p><table-wrap

Rather, the lowest mortality was seen among those patients who maintained their weight during the period.</p><p>Among all 444 overweight patients included in the study, weight loss (regardless of intention) was an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality, but this association was primarily driven by unintentional weight loss in patients with the &#x02018;intention to maintain weight&#x02019;. However, excess all-cause mortality was also related to intentional weight loss among patients with BMI&#x02265;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and among patients with microalbuminuria at diagnosis. In patients with BMI&#x0003c;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> there was a trend towards decreased mortality in relation to intentional weight loss, but this association was not significant. This could be a chance finding. Other possible explanations could be a higher degree of residual confounding from comorbidity among the obese patients or differences in weight loss methods between overweight and obese patients. Our finding that intentional weight loss was associated with increased mortality in patients with microalbuminuria at diagnosis could indicate that the weight loss in these patients was a consequence of disease severity, or that therapeutic weight loss was, in fact, detrimental in these patients. Nevertheless, intentional weight loss was not associated with survival in patients without established cardiovascular disease or microalbuminuria at baseline.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Strengths and weaknesses of the study</title><p>There are several strengths to this study. For instance, the study was truly population based, the participants were prospectively monitored with numerous physical examinations, they were followed up in the nationwide Danish health registers [<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and there was no loss to follow-up. Also, the analyses were carefully designed to minimize confounding from wasting: 1) The very conservative definition of &#x02018;intention to lose weight&#x02019; ensured that only patients persistently intending to lose weight were included in the main analysis; 2) The analyses were adjusted for incident comorbidity and changes in antidiabetic medication in the monitoring period [<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; 3) All patients with prior or incident cancer were excluded; 4) Multiple indicators for disease severity were included in the sensitivity analyses, but the results were robust; 5) The follow-up period was divided in two (the first two years and the remaining 11 years). The mortality rate attributable to weight loss did not differ between these two periods among patients with an &#x02018;intention to lose weight&#x02019;, indicating low bias from pathological weight loss. Still, it is a limitation that cannot be excluded that the results may be partly explained by residual confounding from pathological weight loss.</p><p>It is also a limitation that patients younger than 40 years were not included, as patients with diabetes, in most settings, are diagnosed earlier today than they were 25 years ago. In 1990, patients were commonly diagnosed with clinical diabetes, while most patients today are diagnosed by screening. Thus, the results can only be generalized to patients with clinical diabetes. The control group from the original trial was not included in the study, but since the study was randomized the participants we included are still representative of patients with incident diabetes in the general population 25 years ago. This is actually a strength because all the patients included received the intervention that later became the standard care for patients with type 2 diabetes in Denmark. However, risk factors for cardiovascular disease are treated much more aggressively today than they were 25 years ago, while lifestyle recommendations are largely unchanged.</p><p>There was considerable intra-individual variation in weight development, and a slope of a regression line may seem too simple a method to describe the individual weight change pattern. For instance, a patient with high compliance may lose 6 kilos fast and then maintain that weight for 6 years. This would result in a relatively flat slope compared to a patient who loses 1 kg a year, resulting in a steeper slope. Consequently, the patient with slow weight loss would get a higher numeric value for the exposure. Still, this method certainly better describes the general weight change than retrospective and self-reported weight changes that earlier studies of intentional weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes have used [<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The analysis was adjusted for baseline BMI, which to some degree correlates with fat mass [<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], but we did not have access to advanced data on our participants&#x02019; body composition or the tissue composition of the weight loss.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Strengths and weaknesses in relation to other studies</title><p>The present study is the first cohort study to examine intentional weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes where the diagnosis was biochemically verified, intentions for weight change were prospectively described, and body weight was assessed by clinical examination. In contrast to most other observational studies in the field, our study does not compare mortality between those who lost weight intentionally, and those with stable weight and unknown intention or intention to maintain weight [<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Gregg et al demonstrated that the mere &#x02018;intention to lose weight&#x02019; in subjects both with and without diabetes was associated with reduced mortality regardless of whether they actually lost weight or not [<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Intending to lose weight is most likely not in itself protective, but may be a good proxy for true explanatory factors like health literacy, compliance, and a healthy lifestyle in general. Thus, comparing weight loss among participants with diverse weight loss intentions may well bias the result towards a favorable effect of weight loss. The present study avoided this bias by exploring the correlation between weight change and the outcomes <italic>within</italic> the group of patients intending to lose weight. As weight change was a continuous variable in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146889.g003">Fig 3</xref>), there was no categorical control group in the multivariable analysis.</p><p>In a previous study of weight history among participants in the DCGP study we found an average weight loss after diagnosis in all age categories [<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], which may suggest that weight loss is part of the natural history of diabetes, and that an average weight loss trend started at diabetes diagnosis. However, the individual variability was large, and the present study explored this variability.</p><p>Several studies have reported reduced mortality in obese patients with diabetes or established cardiovascular disease, compared with lean patients [<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This &#x02018;obesity paradox&#x02019; is seen in study designs exploring the association between a single measurement of weight/BMI and subsequent mortality. The phenomenon may well be an artifact coming from pre-existing illness (that results in pathological weight loss and higher mortality among lower BMI groups, making obesity appear protective) and collider stratification bias [<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Our study does not explore a relation between weight/BMI and mortality, but analyzes implications of <italic>weight change</italic> over 6 years.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Results in relation to other studies</title><p>Our main findings are in opposition to results from other observational studies in the field. For instance, Harrington&#x02019;s meta-analysis of weight loss found that among unhealthy obese subjects (in this context BMI&#x02265;25&#x02013;27) intentional weight loss was associated with reduced mortality [<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This result was mainly based on studies of patients with type 2 diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, as indicated above data quality and bias favoring weight loss may pertain to these studies. Furthermore, our results are in line with the Look AHEAD trial that found no cardiovascular protective effect of an intensive lifestyle intervention that resulted in substantial weight loss. However, it is not straightforward to interpret a randomized trial with a complex &#x02018;intensive lifestyle intervention&#x02019;, as both diet and physical activity by themselves may affect both the weight loss and the disease outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0146889.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Thus, it is not possible to conclude whether the effect of the lifestyle-based weight loss therapy on the hard outcomes was caused by the weight loss per se, or by the change in the composition of the diet, the increase in exercise, or by other effects of the intervention. Unlike Look AHEAD, the present study is an analysis of the weight change itself.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, our results do not support our hypothesis that overweight patients with type 2 diabetes who undergo a successful therapeutic intentional weight loss, supervised by a medical doctor, experience reduced mortality or cardiovascular morbidity. Rather, the patients who maintained their weight had the best prognosis. The findings in this population based cohort study are in line with those of the Look AHEAD trial.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the patients and general practitioners who volunteered to take part in this study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0146889.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Maggio</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Pi-Sunyer</surname><given-names>FX</given-names></name> (<year>1997</year>) <article-title>The prevention and treatment of obesity.
