using co-contraction of both the transverse abdominal muscle (TA) and pelvic floor muscle
(PFM) and examine the intervention effect in middle-aged women with stress urinary
incontinence (SUI). [Subjects] The subjects were fifteen women with SUI who were divided
into two groups: the TA and PFM co-contraction exercise group (n=9) and the control group
(n=6). [Methods] Participants in the exercise group performed TA and PFM co-contraction
exercise. The thickness of the TA was measured before and after 8 weeks of exercise using
ultrasound. The thickness of the TA was measured under 4 conditions: (1) at rest, (2)
maximal contraction of the TA, (3) maximal contraction of the PFM, and (4) maximal
co-contraction of both the TA and PFM. [Results] There were no significant differences
among the results of the control group. In the exercise group, the cure rate of SUI was
88.9% after the intervention. There were significant differences in the thickness of the
TA during maximal co-contraction of both the TA and PFM after the intervention.
[Conclusion] The TA and PFM co-contraction exercise intervention increases the thickness
of the TA and may be recommended to improve SUI in middle-aged women.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stress urinary incontinence</kwd><kwd>Transverse abdominal muscle</kwd><kwd>Exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Urinary incontinence (UI) is well-known to profoundly affect the QOL (quality of life) of
women. Many cases of UI are stress urinary incontinence (SUI), and the success of pelvic
floor muscle (PFM) exercise in the management of SUI has been confirmed by multiple
randomized controlled studies. PFM exercise has been reported to be from 50% to 69%
effective at reducing urine loss episodes in women<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many UI cases are the
result of PFM weakness, suggesting that risk of UI can be evaluated by PFM. Recently,
several studies reported that the PFM, as the inner unit along with the transverse abdominal
muscle (TA), multifidus muscle, and diaphragm, acts to maintain the stability of the trunk,
and the PFM has begun to be used in approaches for not only UI but also lumbar pain<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In our previous study, we found a
significant relationship between the thickness of the TA and the iEMG of the levator ani
muscle<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. This result suggests that
changes in the thickness of the TA may be used to indicate changes in the electrical
activity of the PFM.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to devise a new urinary incontinence exercise using
co-contraction of both the transverse abdominal muscle and pelvic floor muscle and examine
the intervention effect in middle-aged women with stress urinary incontinence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were fifteen women who had experienced one or more SUI events in the past 1

experimental procedures in this study were reviewed and approved by the Ethical Review
Committee of Jilin Dianli Hospital.</p><p>All subjects completed a questionnaire about SUI. We evaluated the thickness of the TA
using ultrasound. The thickness of the TA was measured in all subjects under four conditions
at random in the supine position. 1) The first condition was the resting state. 2) The
second condition was maximal contraction of the TA. For this, the subjects were instructed
to draw in the lower abdominal wall toward the spine, an action that specifically activates
the TA. The subjects were asked to breathe in a relaxed manner. No movement of the lumbar
spine was allowed. 3) The third condition was maximal contraction of the PFM. For this the
subjects were instructed to contract the muscles around the vagina &#x0201c;like a drawstring&#x0201d; and
to lift them internally. No posterior tilt of the pelvis was allowed. There was no
instruction to either use or not use the abdominal muscles. 4) The fourth condition was
maximal co-contraction of both the TA and PFM. Subjects were instructed to draw in the lower
abdominal wall toward the spine, an action that specifically activates the TA. When the TA
sustained isometric contraction, the subjects were instructed to contract the muscles around
the vagina &#x0201c;like a drawstring&#x0201d; to lift them internally and to keep this position for 3
seconds.</p><p>Under each condition, the subjects were in the supine position with the knees flexed at 90&#x000b0;
and a pillow under the head. A Biofeedback Stabilizer was used to provide visual feedback.
The three-chamber pressure cells were placed under the lumbar spine, and the subjects were
asked to keep the baseline at 40 mmHg. If the pressure of the Biofeedback Stabilizer
decreased under conditions 2, 3, or 4, abdominal muscle re-education was provided by a
physical therapist.</p><p>Ultrasound images of the anterolateral abdominal wall were obtained using a SonoSite
ultrasound (SonoSite 180PLUS,B mode,5&#x02005;MHz linear transducer). Gel was interposed between the
transducer and the skin. The transducer was positioned adjacent to and perpendicular to the
abdominal wall, 25&#x02005;mm anteromedial to the midpoint between the ribs and ilium on the
midaxillary line, and parallel to the muscle fibers of the transversus abdominis<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The same person, a midwife, made the
measurements to avoid inter-rater errors. Ultrasound images were saved as still images. All
thickness measurements were of muscle only, that is, between the fascia boundaries. To judge
the effect, the measurements were performed before the intervention, 4 weeks after the
intervention, and 8 weeks after the intervention.</p><p>Subjects in the exercise group were provided with an 8-week TA and PFM co-contraction
training program. The exercises prescribed were 40 repetitions (2 sets of 20 repetitions) of
a 3-second co-contraction of both the TA and PFM. The women were told to perform 1 session
of exercise 3 times per week. The women in the control group were asked not to exercise at
home during the study but were offered the possibility of receiving a treatment at trial
completion.</p><p>To determine whether there were differences between the exercise group and the control
group, the independent t-test was performed on subject characteristics. The Mann-Whitney
test was performed to investigate the differences between groups. The Friedman test and
Wilcoxon test were performed to investigate the differences between before and after the
intervention. Data were analyzed using SPSS Ver. 17.0 for Windows. The chosen level of
statistical significance was 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were no significant differences between the exercise group and control group subject

co-contraction of both the TA and PFM was 5.00&#x02005;mm. This result indicates that the
detectability of the risk of urinary incontinence is high and that quantitative assessment
of the risk of UI is possible through measurement of the thickness of the TA during maximal
co-contraction of both the TA and PFM<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, when the SUI
disappeared, the thickness of the TA was greater than the cutoff value. The TA and PFM
co-contraction exercise intervention increases the thickness of the TA and may be
recommended to improve SUI in middle-aged women.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Henalla</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Hutchins</surname><given-names>CJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Robinson</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Non-operative methods in the treatment of female genuine
