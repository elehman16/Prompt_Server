Patients were eligible if they had an ECOG performance status of 0&#x02013;1 and an estimated life expectancy of longer than 3 months. Patients were given first-line cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy (25 mg/m<sup>2</sup> cisplatin and 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> gemcitabine [on days 1 and 8 every 21 days, for up to eight cycles]) with either 20 mg oral cediranib or placebo once a day until disease progression. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) with a minimisation algorithm, incorporating the stratification factors: extent of disease, primary disease site, previous treatment, ECOG performance status, and centre.

Up to now, no randomised trial has shown superiority of any systemic therapy over this combination. Targeting angiogenesis, one of the hallmarks of cancer and a known predictor of adverse outcome in advanced biliary tract cancer, is a logical step and has proven to be effective in a number of tumour types; however, no randomised studies have been done of this approach in advanced biliary tract cancer building on the cisplatin and gemcitabine regimen.</p><p><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p>This study assessed the effect of adding cediranib (an oral VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with additional activity against PDGF receptors and c-KIT) to cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy in a double-bind, placebo-controlled manner. The study did not meet its primary endpoint (improvement in progression-free survival); however, we recorded signals that would support further anti-angiogenesis approaches. Additionally, we showed that elevated baseline levels of the tumour markers CEA and CA125 (in addition to CA19-9) and total cytokeratin 18 and VEGFR2 are prognostic in advanced biliary tract cancer. This is the first study to show that the presence of circulating tumour cells confers an adverse prognosis, and offers an opportunity to interrogate these in future studies. Finally, baseline PDGFbb concentrations might predict for cediranib activity.</p><p><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p>Cisplatin and gemcitabine remains the reference regimen for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer; there is no evidence that cediranib improves progression-free survival. The effect of a better-tolerated anti-angiogenic in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine, with consideration of our exploratory findings with respect to circulating biomarkers, warrants further investigation.</p></boxed-text></p><p>Cediranib is an oral VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and VEGFR3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with additional activity against PDGF receptors and c-KIT.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Although the maximum tolerated dose of cediranib was not reached in a phase 1 study<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> in patients with lung cancer, the recommended dose was 30 mg once a day in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine (using a different schedule to that of the ABC-02 study, namely 1250 mg/m<sup>2</sup> gemcitabine on days 1 and 8 and 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> cisplatin on day 1 every 3 weeks). However, based on the totality of the available safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic data at the time of study setup, the manufacturer's recommended dose of 20 mg cediranib once a day for combination with chemotherapy regimens was selected for this trial.</p><p>In this trial, ABC-03, we aimed to assess the effect of the addition of cediranib to standard cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy on progression-free survival in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer.</p></sec><sec id="cesec20"><title>Methods</title><sec id="cesec30"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>In this multicentre, randomised phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled, investigator-initiated study, we recruited patients aged 18 years or older with a histopathological or cytological diagnosis of non-resectable, recurrent, or metastatic biliary tract carcinoma (intrahepatic or extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma), gallbladder, or ampullary carcinoma from hepatobiliary oncology referral centres in the UK. Patients were eligible if they had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0&#x02013;1 and an estimated life expectancy of longer than 3 months.</p><p>Patients were required to have adequate haematological function (haemoglobin &#x02265;10 g/dL; white blood cell count &#x02265;3&#x000b7;0&#x02008;&#x000d7;&#x02008;10<sup>9</sup> cells per L; absolute neutrophil count &#x02265;1&#x000b7;5&#x02008;&#x000d7;&#x02008;10<sup>9</sup> cells per L and platelet count &#x02265;100&#x02008;&#x000d7;&#x02008;10<sup>9</sup> per L), hepatic function (total bilirubin &#x02264;1&#x000b7;5 times the upper limit of normal except for patients with known documented cases of Gilbert's syndrome; alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase &#x02264;2&#x000b7;5 times the upper limit of normal [if liver metastases were present, alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase had to be less than five times the upper limit of normal] and alkaline phosphatase less than or equal to five times the upper limit of normal), and renal function (serum urea &#x0003c;1&#x000b7;5 times the upper limit of normal, serum creatinine &#x0003c;1&#x000b7;5 times the upper limit of normal, and calculated glomerular filtration rate &#x02265;45 mL/min using a validated creatinine clearance calculation such as Cockroft-Gault or Wright formula [if the calculated glomerular filtration rate was below 45 mL/min, an isotopic method was done to confirm the glomerular filtration rate was &#x02265;45 mL/min]). Additionally, patients could not have evidence of active uncontrolled infection (patients on long-term antibiotics were eligible provided signs of active infection had resolved) and women of childbearing potential were required to have a negative pregnancy test before study entry and to be using two methods of adequate contraception, which was to be continued for 3 months after completion of treatment.</p><p>The following previous treatment was allowed (provided there had been a full recovery): a non-curative operation (ie, R2 resection [with macroscopic residual disease] or palliative bypass surgery only); curative surgery with evidence of non-resectable disease relapse requiring systemic chemotherapy; radiotherapy (with or without radio-sensitising low-dose chemotherapy) for localised disease provided there had been clear evidence of disease progression before inclusion in this study; adjuvant chemotherapy provided neither gemcitabine nor cisplatin were used and the treatment was completed more than 6 months before trial entry; and photodynamic treatment provided that there was clear evidence of disease progression at the local site or at a new metastatic site. Previous systemic chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease was not allowed.</p><p>Patients were excluded from the study in the event of incomplete recovery (common terminology criteria for adverse events [CTCAE] grade &#x0003e;1) from previous anticancer treatment; unresolved biliary tree obstruction; continuing severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases which, in the view of the investigator, made it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial (eg, unstable or uncompensated respiratory, cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease); or untreated unstable brain or meningeal metastases. Pregnant or breastfeeding women; patients with a history of cancer likely to interfere with the response assessment (exceptions include in-situ carcinoma of the cervix treated by cone-biopsy or resection, non-metastatic basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin, any early stage [stage I] cancer adequately resected for cure &#x0003e;5 years previously); and patients in receipt of treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days before randomisation were excluded.</p><p>Cediranib-directed exclusions included substantial haemorrhage (&#x0003e;30 mL bleeding or episode in previous 3 months) or haemoptysis (&#x0003e;5 mL fresh blood) within 4 weeks of randomisation; poorly controlled hypertension with resting blood pressure higher than 150/100 mm Hg in the presence or absence of a stable regimen of antihypertensive treatment, or patients requiring maximum doses of calcium channel blockers to stabilise blood pressure; proteinuria of greater than +1 on two consecutive dipsticks taken no less than 1 week apart, unless urinary protein less than 1&#x000b7;5 g in 24 h or protein to creatinine ratio less than 1&#x000b7;5; a mean QTc with Bazett's correction longer than 480 ms in screening ECG or history of familial long QT syndrome; recent major thoracic or abdominal surgery (&#x0003c;14 days) before randomisation, or an incompletely healed surgical incision; known hypersensitivity to cediranib or any of its excipients; or a history of gastrointestinal impairment that would substantially affect the absorption of cediranib or placebo. Because of the intensity of laboratory processing of blood products, we also excluded patients with known risk of transmitting HIV, hepatitis B or C via infected blood.</p><p>The trial was done according to the principles of the International Conference on Harmonisation of Good Clinical Practice. It was coordinated by the Cancer Research UK and University College London (UCL) Cancer Trials Centre and sponsored by UCL. All patients provided written informed consent before randomisation.</p></sec><sec id="cesec40"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p>Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either cediranib or matching placebo in addition to cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy. Treatment was assigned by computer (undertaken centrally at UCL Cancer Trials Centre, UK) with a minimisation algorithm incorporating the stratification factors: extent of disease (locally advanced <italic>vs</italic> metastatic), primary disease site (gallbladder <italic>vs</italic> bile duct <italic>vs</italic> ampulla), previous treatment (none <italic>vs</italic> adjuvant chemotherapy <italic>vs</italic> other), ECOG performance status (0 <italic>vs</italic> 1) and randomising site, and including a random element.</p><p>Supply and allocation of oral drug packs was managed by an interactive web-based response system (Cenduit, Stirling, UK). The allocated oral treatment was masked to the respective patients, treating clinician, local site staff, and UCL Cancer Trials Centre staff until analysis. An emergency unmasking procedure was established at each study site for patient safety.</p></sec><sec id="cesec50"><title>Procedures</title><p>Once deemed eligible at study screening, all patients received 25 mg/m<sup>2</sup> cisplatin and 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> gemcitabine chemotherapy, each on days 1 and 8 of a 21 day cycle, continued to eight cycles in the absence of disease progression. Additionally, patients received either 20 mg oral cediranib once a day or placebo throughout and beyond the completion of chemotherapy in the absence of disease progression. Treatment was discontinued in the event of disease progression, unacceptable adverse events, intercurrent illness preventing further treatment, a patient's decision to withdraw consent, or any alteration in the patient's condition justifying discontinuation in the site investigator's opinion. In these cases, patients remained within the trial for the purposes of follow-up and data analysis according to the treatment group to which they were allocated.</p><p>Disease status was assessed by CT scans (and MRI scans, if appropriate) at baseline, and every 3 months until disease progression (including patients who discontinued treatment for any reason other than disease progression). Response was assessed by local investigators according to RECIST (version 1.1; no central review was done); with reporting radiologists masked to the patients' treatment. Additionally, the tumour markers CA19-9, CEA, and CA125 were assessed at baseline, on day 1 of every cycle of chemotherapy, monthly when on cediranib or placebo, and then at end of treatment.</p><p>Adverse events were graded according to CTCAE (version 4.03). To proceed with administration of full dose gemcitabine and cisplatin on days 1 and 8 of each cycle the following were required: white blood cell count of 2&#x02008;&#x000d7;&#x02008;10<sup>9</sup> cells per L or higher, absolute neutrophil count of 1&#x02008;&#x000d7;&#x02008;10<sup>9</sup> cells per L or higher, platelets 100&#x02008;&#x000d7;&#x02008;10<sup>9</sup> per L or higher, and glomerular filtration rate of 45 mL/min or higher. If gemcitabine was deferred, the cisplatin was also deferred. Day 8 treatment was deferred for toxic effect by 1 week only. If a second deferral was needed, the treatment was omitted and the patient moved on to the next treatment cycle.</p><p>Only one dose reduction for cediranib, from 20 mg once a day to 15 mg once a day (or placebo equivalent, maintaining treatment masking), was allowed. Protocol-specific guidance was provided for adverse events of interest, particularly diarrhoea, hypertension, fatigue, proteinuria, hypothyroidism, and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome. Dose interruptions were used as the first approach to manage adverse events related to cediranib; for adverse events of grade 3 or more, dosing with cediranib or placebo was interrupted. For patients with several low-grade adverse events (eg, diarrhoea, weight loss, dehydration, and fatigue) short dose interruptions (ie, 2&#x02013;5 days) of the cediranib or placebo tablets were instituted. Treatment was then restarted on resolution of the adverse event at the same dose. An interruption of up to 14 days for management of cediranib or placebo adverse events was allowed. If the adverse event promptly resolved with supportive care, cediranib or placebo restarted at the same dose along with appropriate continuing supportive care. If the adverse event was deemed related to cediranib and did not resolve to grade 1 or lower with maximum supportive care and following a dose delay of up to 14 days, cediranib or placebo was restarted at 15 mg once a day. If the adverse event failed to resolve, and it was regarded as medically appropriate, cediranib or placebo was permanently discontinued; if cediranib or placebo could not be restarted at either full or reduced dose after 14 days, it was permanently discontinued.

This required a sample size of 68 per group. The main analysis involved estimating the HR, 80% CI, and p value. If the HR was less than 1 and the p value was less than 0&#x000b7;2, the study would be deemed to have provided sufficient evidence to do a larger trial, after considering toxic effects, with a high threshold of activity. This was based on seeing an improvement in the median progression-free survival from 8 months to 12&#x000b7;5 months, with recruitment lasting for 18 months and patients followed up for 12 months beyond last recruitment; requiring 92 progression-free survival events. No formal interim analysis was planned or done for this trial. During the conduct of the study, the end of recruitment became fixed by date (Sept 30, 2012) rather than by accrual following the decision by the manufacturer to cease development of cediranib; consequently, the power of the study was reduced to 75% and the target sample size adjusted accordingly to include at least 116 patients.</p><p>We plotted Kaplan-Meier curves for progression-free survival and overall survival; treatment effect HR (with 80% and 95% CIs and p values) were obtained from Cox proportional hazards regression models. An HR lower than 1 favoured the cediranib group. The proportionality assumption of the Cox model was tested with Schoenfeld residuals. We calculated adjusted and unadjusted HR and reported unadjusted HR. The principal analysis included all patients by allocated treatment group on an intention-to-treat basis. Survival endpoints were measured from date of randomisation to date of event. For progression-free survival, symptomatic deterioration was accepted as disease progression (patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time were classified as having symptomatic deterioration).</p><p>Best overall response was summarised as frequencies, and the difference of proportions test (with 95% CI and p value) was used to compare responses and disease control between the two groups.

All overall survival and progression-free survival models were adjusted for treatment group and baseline characteristics (age, sex, ECOG performance status, primary site, stage, and previous treatment). Overall survival and progression-free survival Cox models were used to test for interactions between treatment and each biomarker (handled as continuous and binary variables). Treatment effect on overall survival and progression-free survival were assessed for lower and higher values of each baseline biomarker. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to graphically represent the findings. All Cox models were assessed for the proportionality of hazards assumption.

As a result, disease control was achieved by 46 (78%) patients in the cediranib group and by 35 (65%) in the placebo group (p=0&#x000b7;12).

Cox models for the association between baseline tumour markers and overall survival (treatment-adjusted HRs) showed that increased baseline CA19-9 concentration was associated with an increased risk of death (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). This was also the case with raised CEA and CA125 (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). Circulating total CK18 concentrations were also prognostic, with raised baseline concentrations associated with a shorter overall survival (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>).</p><p>Blood samples for circulating tumour cell enumeration were available from 95 patients before treatment; 51 (54%) of 95 patients had a circulating tumour cell count of no cells per 7&#x000b7;5 mL blood, 21 (22%) had a count of one cell per 7&#x000b7;5 mL blood, and 23 (24%) had a count of two cells or higher per 7&#x000b7;5 mL blood, with a median of 0 per 7&#x000b7;5 mL blood and mean of 2 per 7&#x000b7;5 mL blood (range 0&#x02013;44 per 7&#x000b7;5 mL blood). We noted an association between the presence of circulating tumour cells (based on the CellSearch criteria) and increased risk of death (HR 1&#x000b7;05, 95% CI 1&#x000b7;02&#x02013;1&#x000b7;09); p=0&#x000b7;001; <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>).

However, when adjusted for treatment and baseline characteristics, we noted that raised concentrations of baseline VEGFR2 were associated with an increased risk of death (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). This same pattern could be seen when we assessed VEGFR2 by tertiles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref>).</p><p>We recorded an interaction between baseline PDGFbb concentrations and treatment with cediranib for overall survival; with the median as the cutoff, we noted that patients with concentrations below the median did not benefit from cediranib (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">figure 5A</xref>) whereas patients with PDGFbb concentrations higher than the median derived benefit from cediranib in terms of overall survival (p<sub>interaction</sub>=0&#x000b7;002; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">figure 5B</xref> and <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>).

Earlier studies have provided only limited information, largely because of their single-group phase 2 design. Sorafenib (an oral multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor) was deemed to have low activity as monotherapy, albeit in a mainly second-line setting;<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> bevacizumab (a monoclonal antibody against VEGF) with erlotinib (an oral EGFR inhibitor) was feasible in the first-line setting although, with a median overall survival of 9&#x000b7;9 months, does not seem better than upfront chemotherapy.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> In another study,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> bevacizumab was tolerable in combination with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin; however, we could not work out the incremental value of the anti-angiogenic in this single-group study. Most recently (contemporaneous to our study), sorafenib has failed to improve progression-free survival when added to gemcitabine in a randomised phase 2, placebo-controlled study of 102 patients.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref></p><p>Our approach is the first to build on the cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy regimen, now established as a reference regimen; we assessed the effect of adding cediranib, a pan-VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity against PDGF receptors and c-KIT in a placebo-controlled manner. The study did not meet its primary endpoint (to detect a progression-free survival HR of 0&#x000b7;64). Despite this shortcoming, some efficacy findings warrant additional attention; namely significantly greater number of overall responses and proportion of patients who achieved disease control in those receiving cediranib, mainly at the first (3 month) reassessment scan. Response is notoriously difficult to assess in patients with biliary tract cancer, although the risk of bias this could introduce was mitigated by the use of a placebo control in this study. Irrespective, patients remained on cediranib for a median of 4&#x000b7;6 months, stopping earlier than the median progression-free survival (8&#x000b7;0 months), mainly because of toxic effects; moreover, the proportion of patients stopping treatment because of toxic effects was higher in the cediranib group than the placebo group. An examination of the progression-free survival Kaplan-Meier curves suggests a separation in the period during which cediranib was tolerated, which rapidly converged after the median cessation point of cediranib. Consistent with this finding is the numerically greater number of responses in the cediranib group. These data suggest that cediranib is effective during the period of treatment but toxic effects leading to cessation prevent longer-term benefit; we postulate that a better-tolerated anti-VEGF treatment might potentially result in overall benefit in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine.</p><p>We did not note any unexpected safety signals; the addition of cediranib to cisplatin and gemcitabine did result in a significantly greater incidence of grade 3&#x02013;4 toxic effects, which were mainly expected off-target toxic effects for VEGF inhibitors (namely hypertension and diarrhoea). There were three deaths attributed to treatment in each group, with no clear additional effect from cediranib. However, these toxic effects were clearly significant in this study and need to be considered in any future angiogenesis-targeting studies.</p><p>The effect on the quality of life of patients is important in the event that the study had shown benefit from the addition of cediranib as part of the assessment of the relative merits of a potentially new agent. However, because there was no improvement in progression-free survival, quality-of-life findings from this study will be reported separately, most likely in a pooled analysis with that of other studies of advanced biliary tract cancer.</p><p>We assessed surrogates of disease volume and biology (other than radiological extent) including assessment of the tumour markers CA19-9, CEA, and CA125 and total CK18. The role of CA19-9 as a marker of volume of disease, prognostic factor, and measure of response to treatment is well documented.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> However, because this is linked to the Lewis blood-group antigen, not all patients express this (32% were CA19-9-negative in our series). We have been able to show that in roughly one in five cases (22%), CEA or CA125 might be used as an alternative and that each of these also has prognostic value, with increased baseline levels independently correlating with an adverse overall survival.</p><p>Cancers of epithelial origin contain large intracellular pools of cytokeratins; during necrotic or apoptotic cell death CK18 and other cytokeratins are released into the blood in either their intact or their caspase-cleaved forms where they remain stable in the circulation.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> CK18 is proposed as a surrogate biomarker of drug-induced epithelial cell death<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> and thus might not only represent epithelial tumour cell death but may also reflect toxic effects in epithelial host tissues.
