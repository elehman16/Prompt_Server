<bold>Background:</bold> In sub-Saharan Africa the burden of death and disease from malaria is particularly severe. Most affected are young children under the age of five, in whom natural immunity against the malaria parasite has not yet developed. There are not yet any approved vaccines that would reduce this burden, although many research groups are currently developing potential vaccines. One such candidate vaccine is FMP1/AS02A. This vaccine is designed to trigger an immune response against a protein (merozoite surface protein-1, or MSP-1) found on the surface of the infectious, blood-stage form of the malaria parasite. Early-stage clinical trials have already been performed in healthy people in the United States, who were not exposed to clinical malaria, and in Kenyan adults who are exposed to malaria throughout the year. These studies did not identify any safety concerns regarding the candidate vaccine, which meant that it could progress further in clinical testing. As part of this next stage, a group of researchers wanted to examine the safety and ability of the vaccine to boost immune responses in an area of sub-Saharan Africa where people are not exposed to malaria throughout the year, but rather only in the wet season. The trial reported here was carried out in northeast Mali, in which 40 adults received either the FMP1/AS02A vaccine or a rabies vaccine for comparison, just at the start of the malaria transmission season. The researchers primarily looked at safety outcomes, collecting data on certain specific signs or symptoms up to 8 d after immunization, other reported symptoms up to 31 d after immunization, and any serious adverse events during a follow-up period of 364 d after immunization. The researchers also examined antibody levels in the participants' blood against the MSP-1 protein.</p><p>
<bold>What this trial shows:</bold> The researchers found that participants receiving the FMP1/AS02A vaccine had more immediate symptoms at the injection site (for example, pain or swelling) than the comparison group did. Other general symptoms, both solicited and unsolicited, such as headache, muscle aches, fever, and infections, were also more common in the malaria vaccine group than in the group receiving the rabies vaccine. There were two serious adverse events in the vaccine group, but these were not judged to be related to the vaccination. Antibody levels against the MSP-1 protein increased in both study groups through the course of the rainy season (when individuals would be likely exposed to bites from malaria-infected mosquitoes) and subsequently fell after the end of the malaria transmission season. However, participants receiving the vaccine had higher antibody responses at all timepoints measured; the differences were statistically significant at some timepoints, but not at others. Finally, the researchers looked at antibody reactions against three different variants of the MSP-1 protein in sera from participants receiving the candidate vaccine and found that the sera reacted similarly to all three variants.</p><p>
<bold>Strengths and limitations:</bold> The study protocol followed established procedures for phase I clinical trials of this type, which allows the data to be compared across studies. Randomization procedures were appropriate, and steps were taken to blind participants in the trial, as well as those assessing outcomes, to the intervention participants received. A limitation of this study, which can apply to other phase I studies in general, is that small numbers of participants were recruited. Therefore, the trial was not powered to detect statistically significant differences between participant groups. It is also not clear whether the higher antibody levels seen in the participants receiving the FMP1/AS02A vaccine would be biologically significant (that is, act to prevent clinical malaria cases), a question that would need to be addressed in further trials.</p><p>
<bold>Contribution to the evidence:</bold> The safety results from this study are similar to those from other trials and confirm that no safety concerns have thus far been identified regarding the FMP1/AS02A vaccine, which has now progressed to efficacy testing. This study was also conducted in a population exposed to seasonal malaria, whereas previous trials had been done among people exposed to malaria year-round. Finally, results from the trial also suggest that this vaccine induces antibodies that recognize genetically diverse forms of the vaccine antigen.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Thera MA, Doumbo OK, Coulibaly D, Diallo DA, Sagara I, et al.

At the time of this study, this vaccine had been evaluated in two clinical trials evaluating a total of 60 malaria-na&#x000ef;ve North American adults ([<xref rid="pctr-0010034-b006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and D. G. Heppner, unpublished data), and in a further trial in 20 Kenyan adults exposed to intense year-round malaria transmission [<xref rid="pctr-0010034-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In these trials FMP1/AS02A was well tolerated and no safety concerns were identified.</p><p>The vaccine was highly immunogenic in malaria-na&#x000ef;ve volunteers, inducing antibodies that recognized parasites by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA), were reactive against recombinant fragments of MSP-1<sub>42</sub> (including subdomains) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and measurably inhibited parasite growth. Kenyan adults exposed to intense year-round malaria transmission had high and variable background levels of anti-MSP-1<sub>42</sub> antibodies, and differences in antibody levels between malaria vaccine and control groups were not significant at any post-immunization timepoint; however, significant differences in antibody levels were measured when a longitudinal model was applied [<xref rid="pctr-0010034-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of malaria vaccines may be affected by the intensity and pattern of local malaria transmission, which determines levels of pre-existing natural immunity and potential natural &#x0201c;boosting&#x0201d; of the immune response to vaccines, and may affect the prevalence of different allelic parasite types. Western Kenya and Bandiagara, Mali, represent two sites with very different transmission patterns, both representative of other malaria-endemic areas where a vaccine would eventually be offered. We assessed the FMP1/AS02A malaria vaccine compared to rabies vaccine in adults living in Bandiagara, Mali, where malaria is highly seasonal and naturally acquired immunity is lower than in western Kenya. To investigate the specificity of vaccine-induced antibody responses, antibodies to diverse MSP-1<sub>42</sub> alleles and subunits were measured.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Setting</title><p>The Bandiagara Malaria Project research clinic is adjacent to the district hospital in Bandiagara, a rural town of 13,634 inhabitants in the Dogon Country in northeast Mali.

Malaria transmission is strictly seasonal, with virtually undetectable transmission at the height of the dry season in March, less than one infected bite per person per month at the start and end of the transmission season in June and December, respectively, and peaks of up to 40&#x02013;60 infected mosquito bites per person per month in August or September [<xref rid="pctr-0010034-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> represents 97% of malaria infections, with 3% due to <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. malariae</named-content> and rare infections with <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. ovale</named-content>. Despite the seasonal transmission pattern, the malaria burden is heavy: each year, children aged under 10 y old have an average of two clinical malaria episodes every transmission season [<xref rid="pctr-0010034-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and severe malaria afflicts 1 in 50 children aged under 6 y old [<xref rid="pctr-0010034-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].

Starting on day 180, monthly home visits were made to check the health status of participants and to encourage them to come to the research clinic if they felt ill. Study physicians were available at all times throughout the 12-mo study to assess and treat adverse events.</p><p>Clinical evaluations consisted of measurement of vital signs and assessment for local injection site and general solicited signs or symptoms. Local signs and solicited symptoms included pain, swelling, erythema at the injection site, and limitation of arm abduction at the shoulder. General signs and solicited symptoms included fever (oral temperature &#x02265;37.5 &#x000b0;C), chills, nausea, headache, malaise, myalgia, and joint pain. Any other signs or symptoms were considered to be unsolicited, as were signs or symptoms that occurred more than 7 d after immunization. Solicited symptoms were considered to be related to the study vaccines. Unsolicited signs and symptoms were recorded during the 30 d after each immunization, whereas serious adverse events were monitored throughout the 12-mo study.</p><p>Blood was collected at screening, on immunization days, 14 d after each immunization, and on study days 90, 180, 272, and 364 to determine complete blood count, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and serum creatinine.</p><p>Adverse events were graded by severity and judged for relatedness to study vaccines. Mild adverse events were easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with daily activities. Moderate adverse events were sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities. Severe adverse events prevented normal daily activities. Swelling, erythema, fever, and limitation of arm motion had specific definitions not based on interference with daily activities. Injection site swelling and erythema were graded based on their widest dimension: mild, &#x0003e;0&#x02013;20 mm; moderate, &#x0003e;20&#x02013;50 mm; and severe, &#x0003e;50 mm. Fever was classified as severe if the oral temperature was &#x02265;39 &#x000b0;C , whereas severe limitation of arm motion was classified as abduction limited to 30&#x000b0;.

In general, we observed more solicited adverse events in the FMP1/AS02A group when compared to the rabies group, with the most common reactions being short-lived swelling and mild pain at the injection site. Although swelling was often classified as severe based on the size of the reaction, these episodes were well tolerated and were usually unnoticed by participants. No participants were withdrawn from the study because of adverse events. No serious adverse event related to the vaccine was observed. No clinically significant laboratory abnormality related to the vaccine occurred. Hemoglobin levels remained at or above normal ranges for all participants during the study period.</p><p>Immunization with FMP1/AS02A led to increased antibody titers against MSP-1<sub>42</sub>, which peaked with a 6.5-fold rise over baseline 1 mo after the third immunization. A boosting effect was seen after each of three immunizations, in contrast to a trial of this vaccine in malaria-na&#x000ef;ve North Americans [<xref rid="pctr-0010034-b006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], in which the third immunization did not lead to a significant additional rise in titer.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Generalizability</title><p>While cellular immune responses, antibody avidity assays, growth inhibition assays, and other potential alternative surrogate markers may eventually prove more predictive of clinical protection than MSP-1<sub>42</sub> antibody titers, the validity of these assays as endpoints for clinical trials will need to be demonstrated in appropriate target populations (e.g., infants and children in malaria-endemic areas) in which protective efficacy is demonstrated. For this small phase I trial in malaria-experienced adults, we chose to use MSP-1<sub>42</sub> antibody titers as the immunogenicity endpoint to inform clinical development decisions.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Overall Evidence</title><p>Immunizing at the start of the of the malaria transmission season permitted observation of the effect of natural boosting on MSP-1<sub>42</sub> antibody titers in the control group, which rose nearly 3-fold over the malaria season. The difference in MSP-1<sub>42</sub> antibody levels between the FMP1/AS02A and rabies vaccine groups was much greater in this trial than in a virtually identical trial conducted in an area of intense year-round malaria transmission in Kenya [<xref rid="pctr-0010034-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The same reference laboratory measured antibody titers in both trials using the same methods, ruling out methodological reasons for the different immunogenicity results. Most of this difference can be attributed to the lower baseline antibody levels at the beginning of the malaria transmission season in Mali: in the FMP1/AS02A vaccine group, antibody titers rose from &#x0003c;6,000 to a peak of nearly 38,000 in Mali, compared to an increase from 17,000 to 46,000 in Kenya [<xref rid="pctr-0010034-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This conclusion is supported by the observation that the rates of increase in vaccine-induced antibody responses to the 3D7 alleles of MSP-1<sub>42</sub> and MSP-1<sub>19</sub>, as measured by the slopes of the regression lines fitted using data from day 0, 74, and 90, were not different between the two study sites (data not shown).</p><p>The vaccine induced responses against all alleles tested: 3D7 (homologous to the vaccine antigen), Camp/FUP (different in three amino acids in the second EFG-like domain), and FVO (different in four amino acids in MSP-1<sub>19</sub>, and the most divergent in MSP-1<sub>33</sub>). Longitudinal antibody responses showed a tendency toward stronger reactivity against the 3D7 and Camp/FUP alleles than against the FVO allele, which is consistent with the greater degree of homology between 3D7 and Camp/FUP than between 3D7 and FVO. Whether these in vitro allele-specific analyses predict in vivo efficacy against diverse parasites is not yet known.</p><p>The dramatically different immune responses to FMP1/AS02A seen in Mali and Kenya highlight the need to assess malaria vaccines in different transmission settings early in their development. Conceivably, high background immunity could obscure vaccine-induced immunity to the extent that a potentially efficacious vaccine tested only in high transmission settings would be prematurely abandoned. Settings with seasonal transmission offer the advantages of relatively lower background immunity yet high clinical attack rates [<xref rid="pctr-0010034-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] that make them particularly suitable for phase I and II malaria vaccine trials.</p><p>In a recent trial in Mozambique, the pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS02A provided significant, sustained protection against both severe and uncomplicated malaria [<xref rid="pctr-0010034-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010034-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Presently, a randomized, placebo-controlled efficacy trial of FMP1/AS02A is underway in 400 Kenyan children 1&#x02013;4 y of age. If clinical protection is demonstrated, FMP1/AS02A may have the potential for development as a vaccine and/or to enhance the protection conferred by RTS,S in a multi-antigen, multistage malaria vaccine [<xref rid="pctr-0010034-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>SUPPORTING INFORMATION</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0010034-sd001"><label>CONSORT Checklist</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0010034.sd001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>(49 KB DOC)</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0010034-sd002"><label>Trial Protocol</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0010034.sd002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>(376 KB PDF)</p></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Other members of the Mali FMP1 Working Group not in the author list are listed here.
