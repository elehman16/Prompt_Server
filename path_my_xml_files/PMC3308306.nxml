The type of exercise to recommend for potential improvements in glycemia in this population is still uncertain. Intervention studies of aerobic exercise training have not shown consistent effects on blood glucose control, as measured by HbA<sub>1c</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Two small (<italic>n</italic> = 8&#x02013;10) studies examining the chronic effects of resistance exercise training have found &#x0223c;1 percentage point reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>Including short bursts of intense activity, where anaerobic metabolism plays a major role in providing fuel, may assist in preventing hypoglycemia during and up to 2 h postexercise in individuals with type 1 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). However, two studies using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems suggested that the risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia after such exercise sessions is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and perhaps even more than after moderate aerobic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The effects of resistance training, another form of anaerobic exercise, on acute glycemia in type 1 diabetes is currently unclear. In one study, insulin sensitivity (measured by euglycemic clamp) was unchanged 12 and 36 h after resistance exercise, thereby suggesting that resistance exercise may not cause as much of a postexercise hypoglycemic response compared with aerobic exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>The American Diabetes Association Standards of Medical Care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) encourages individuals with diabetes to follow the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&#x02019; Physical Activity Guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), which suggest including both aerobic and resistance exercise in fitness programs. Individuals who are actively engaged in training often wish to perform both types of exercise within the same session. We previously found that aerobic exercise causes a more rapid decrease in blood glucose and a greater need for carbohydrate supplementation during exercise than resistance exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). We are unaware of previous research examining the acute effects in individuals with type 1 diabetes of combining these exercise modalities in a single session or whether there is an advantage related to the order in which they are undertaken. We sought to determine if the order of exercise in combined sessions has a differential effect on blood glucose during and postexercise (as measured by CGM) in this population.</p><p>In individuals without diabetes, performing aerobic exercise immediately after resistance exercise results in an increased reliance on lipids as a fuel source during activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that performing resistance exercise before aerobic exercise would lead to less of a decline in blood glucose during exercise in individuals with type 1 diabetes than when exercise is performed in the opposite order. Because performing resistance exercise first may result in a diminished reliance on carbohydrate for fuel during exercise, we anticipated that less nocturnal hypoglycemia would be found where aerobic exercise was preceded by resistance exercise.</p><sec id="s2"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>The University of Ottawa and Ottawa Hospital Research Ethics Boards approved the experimental protocol.

After being informed of the purpose, protocol, and possible risks of the study, participants gave written consent and completed physical activity readiness questionnaires (American Heart Association/American College of Sports Medicine Health/Fitness Facility Preparticipation Screening Questionnaire). Hand-held glucose meters (OneTouch Ultra, Lifescan, Johnson &#x00026; Johnson, Milpitas, CA) and test strips (with identical code) were provided for capillary glucose tests.</p><p>On a separate visit, participants underwent an incremental workload running test on a treadmill with a monitored electrocardiogram (Quinton Q4500, Quinton, Bothell, WA) to determine peak oxygen consumption (&#x00056;&#x00307;<sc>o</sc><sub>2peak</sub>). &#x00056;&#x00307;<sc>o</sc><sub>2peak</sub> was determined by measuring the volume and concentration of expired oxygen and carbon dioxide (AMETEK model S-3A/1 and CD 3A, Applied Electrochemistry, Pittsburgh, PA).

A venous blood sample was drawn for determination of HbA<sub>1c</sub>, which was measured by automated heterogeneous immunoassay with latex-enhanced turbidimetric detection on a Roche Cobas Integra 800 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>CGM</title><p>The CGMS System Gold (Medtronic, Northridge, CA) was used in this study. Participants were blinded to their glucose values and could not change their regular behavior patterns based on real-time glucose monitoring. Twenty-four hours before each experimental session, the CGM sensor was inserted subcutaneously in the abdomen or in the upper gluteal area. The same insertion site was used for both trials. Training on calibration and operation of the CGM units was provided. Participants performed capillary glucose tests and calibrated the CGM unit four times daily using the hand-held glucose meter provided. On the third day, 24 h postexercise, participants removed the sensors and the researchers retrieved the monitors. Data were downloaded using a Medtronic Com-Station and Minimed Solutions Software version 3.0 (Medtronic).</p><p>Participants maintained diaries of food intake and insulin administration while wearing the CGM sensor. They ate the same breakfast, same lunch, and same supper each day of sensor wear and kept their insulin doses the same each of these days to the greatest extent possible. Participants avoided exercise (apart from that performed in our laboratory) for 24 h before inserting the sensor (48 h before each study exercise session) as well as during the 3 days of sensor wear. They also avoided caffeine and alcohol during this time.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Experimental sessions</title><p>Participants arrived at the laboratory at 1600 h.

A further 25% basal rate decrease was made for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion patients if their capillary glucose was &#x02264;5 mmol/L upon arrival at the laboratory. Adjusted rates were maintained throughout exercise. Standardized snacks (Glucerna Chocolate Graham Snack Bars, 150 calories, 25 g of carbohydrate; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) were provided and consumed at 1600 h each day of monitoring.</p><p>Before starting exercise, participants were required to have blood glucose levels between 5.5 and 13.9 mmol/L. Capillary glucose tests were performed upon arrival at the laboratory, 30 min before and immediately before exercise. If capillary glucose levels were &#x0003c;4.5 mmol/L, participants were provided with 32 g of glucose (Dex4, AMG Medical, Montreal, QC, Canada) before levels were checked again 15 min later.

Capillary glucose tests were then performed every 10 min, and an additional 16 g of glucose was provided when necessary until a level of &#x02265;5.5 mmol/L was achieved and exercise resumed.

Hypoglycemia was defined as any value &#x0003c;3.5 mmol/L detected by CGM, and values &#x0003e;10.9 mmol/L were categorized as hyperglycemic. Total time spent in hypoglycemia, euglycemia, and hyperglycemia for the predetermined periods and the area under the curve (AUC, defined as the absolute distance from the described limits, multiplied by the time spent outside those limits) for time spent hypo- and hyperglycemic was determined along with the maximum, minimum, and mean interstitial glucose for each time period. Variables were compared between exercise treatments, and pre- and postexercise values were compared within treatments using related-samples Wilcoxon signed rank tests. These tests were also used to examine differences in insulin and carbohydrate intake (calculated from the participants&#x02019; food and insulin diaries) between days within exercise treatments (day 1 vs. 2), and between exercise treatments (days 1 through 3). Pearson correlation analyses were performed comparing capillary glucose values recorded by the participants during nonexercise periods to CGM data to assess the accuracy of the sensors throughout each 3-day measuring period.

As we had anticipated, performing resistance exercise before aerobic exercise rather than the reverse resulted in attenuated declines in glucose concentration during exercise, fewer exercise-induced hypoglycemic events, and less need for carbohydrate supplementation. Furthermore, we observed beneficial effects from this sequence on subsequent 12-h glycemic trends where the duration and severity of hypoglycemia was reduced. The benefits of performing resistance exercise before aerobic exercise instead of the reverse were observed despite overall energy expenditure being equal between experimental sessions.</p><p>Resistance exercise is a primarily anaerobic activity. Other types of high-intensity exercise combining aerobic and anaerobic metabolism (e.g., high intensity cycling) can increase the rate of glucose appearance to a greater extent than the rate of glucose utilization (seven and four times, respectively) during exercise in type 1 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). This may cause glucose levels to increase during exercise, producing postexercise hyperglycemia if intense exercise is sustained for 12 or more minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Shorter anaerobic exercise bouts (intermittent 4-s sprints or 10-s sprints before or after low-intensity aerobic exercise) attenuated declines in blood glucose both during and after exercise when combined with low-intensity (40% &#x00056;&#x00307;<sc>o</sc><sub>2peak</sub>) cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Elevated glucose production from very high-intensity exercise is generally attributed to increased levels of circulating epinephrine [known to triple with short sprints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and increase up to 14 times its resting value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) after 12 min of exhaustive cycling] and norepinephrine, which augment glycogenolysis throughout exercise and early recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>Although we did not measure catecholamines during the sessions, responses to high-intensity exercise are known to be comparable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) or slightly attenuated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) in individuals with type 1 diabetes compared with nondiabetic counterparts. Catecholamines can increase to three or four times resting values during moderate-intensity resistance exercise in individuals without diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), with responses increasing in proportion to exercise intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). If our participants experienced similar responses to resistance exercise as individuals without diabetes, then increases in epinephrine may have contributed to the attenuated rate of decline in blood glucose during the first 15 min of aerobic exercise in RA, and to the increase in glucose during resistance exercise in AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The latter should be interpreted with caution, because most participants needed glucose supplements to prevent hypoglycemia during aerobic exercise in this session.</p><p>It is also possible that exercise-related growth hormone (GH) secretion differed between treatments, potentially affecting fuel selection during exercise. Goto et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) found that in nondiabetic individuals, endurance exercise performed before resistance exercise produced lower GH secretion than resistance exercise alone. They also found that resistance exercise performed 20 min or less before endurance exercise produced elevated levels of GH and greater rates of lipolysis during the subsequent aerobic activity compared with endurance exercise alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Because higher GH levels are known to decrease muscle glucose uptake and increase lipolysis in nondiabetic individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), this may have been a factor in the attenuated declines in blood glucose during aerobic activity in RA.</p><p>High-intensity cycling increases blood lactate levels during and up to 40 min after exercise in individuals with type 1 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). We are unaware of published data describing lactate responses to resistance exercise in this population. Resistance exercise protocols similar to the one we used have produced lactate concentrations up to four times those measured at rest, with levels remaining significantly higher than baseline until 30 min postexercise in trained nondiabetic individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Because elevated lactate could serve to increase gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), it could be a contributing factor in the attenuated decline in glucose during the first 15 min of aerobic exercise in RA as well as in the increases in postexercise glucose levels in AR.</p><p>Studies suggest that high-intensity exercise may be associated with a greater frequency of nocturnal hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetic individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Our participants experienced nocturnal hypoglycemia as frequently postexercise as on nonexercise nights. Nocturnal hypoglycemia has been identified as a risk inherent with intensive insulin therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), and it is possible that overnight hypoglycemia in our study was more related to insulin therapy than to exercise. It is noteworthy that hypoglycemic events occurring after AR tended to be longer and more severe than those experienced in RA, as demonstrated by a greater AUC. Studies using glucose clamp found that counter-regulatory responses to subsequent hypoglycemia were blunted after exercise, even in the absence of significant changes in glucose levels during exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). In addition, even mild hypoglycemia (3.9 mmol/L) in nondiabetic individuals is sufficient to elicit counter-regulatory reactions that can blunt neuroendocrine responses to subsequent hypoglycemia within 24 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Because decreases in blood glucose were greater during AR (reaching a mean of 5.5 &#x000b1; 2.4 vs. 6.9 &#x000b1; 3.1 mmol/L in RA), it is plausible that subsequent responses to declining blood glucose could have been subject to impairment after exercise.</p><p>Although there are advantages to admitting study subjects the night before testing to control participant activity and food intake, we chose a study design more reflective of real-life conditions. Participants controlled their meals and insulin but were asked to eat the same breakfast, lunch, and dinner at the same time for every day of sensor wear and to match their insulin intake as closely as possible. Exercise took place at 1700 h when many individuals who work during the day opt to exercise, unlike several other studies where midmorning exercise was performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>Several aspects of resistance training in type 1 diabetic individuals require further scrutiny. Glucose responses may be different if exercise is performed at another time of day because hormone and exogenous insulin concentrations are both likely to be different. Our participants were fit, habitual exercisers, and the effects of exercise may be less pronounced in unfit individuals exercising at the same relative intensity because the activity would be at a lower absolute intensity. In nondiabetic subjects running at very high relative intensity, glucose production and catecholamine concentrations increase more in athletes than in physically untrained individuals, resulting in hyperglycemia after exercise in the former group because glucose production falls more slowly than glucose utilization when exercise ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Further research on different subpopulations of type 1 diabetic individuals, including those with lower fitness levels and poorer glycemic control, is warranted.</p><p>This study is limited by its small sample size (<italic>n</italic> = 12), which may have prevented us from finding all of the significant differences in plasma glucose levels during exercise. To examine our participants in a real-life scenario, we compromised a certain amount of experimental control such as having complete control over all food and insulin intake. The ability to interpret the data would have been improved by having catecholamine, lactate, and GH measurements. Finally, having a relatively fit sample with moderate to good control of their diabetes makes the applicability of the outcomes to individuals who are inactive or have poor glycemic control uncertain.</p><p>In summary, our findings suggest that trained individuals with type 1 diabetes who perform both resistance and moderate aerobic exercise should consider performing their resistance exercise first if they tend to develop exercise-associated hypoglycemia because doing so may attenuate declines in glucose levels during subsequent aerobic exercise. This order of exercise could lead to a lower reliance on glucose supplementation during exercise and might also decrease the severity of potential nocturnal hypoglycemia. Conversely, individuals having exercise-associated hyperglycemia may wish to perform aerobic exercise before resistance training. Both approaches should still be accompanied by careful monitoring of blood glucose levels, both during and after exercise.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1" fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>This article contains Supplementary Data online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-1844/-/DC1">http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-1844/-/DC1.</ext-link></p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>J.E.Y. was supported by a Doctoral Student Award from the Canadian Diabetes Association, an Excellence Scholarship from the University of Ottawa, and funds from the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute Research Chair in Lifestyle Research.
