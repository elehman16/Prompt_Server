Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI), renal scarring, and the subsequent end-stage renal disease can be life threatening in these children. The main goal of treatment of VUR is to prevent further episodes of UTI and to avoid progressive renal scarring.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Open surgical reimplantation can be attempted intravesical, extravesical, or a combined intra- and extra-vesical approach. Each of these techniques has its own indications and advantages. Various authors have reported an increased incidence of postoperative bladder spasms, hematuria, and prolonged hospital stay with intravesical repairs.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The purpose of this article is to assess the outcomes of the extravesical ureteral reimplantation (EVR) of modified Gregoir Lich technique and intravesical Cohen's ureteral reimplantation (CUR).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Between 2003 and 2014, children diagnosed with primary VUR and undergoing ureteric reimplantation at our institution were evaluated for inclusion in this study.</p><p>Patients with Grade 1&#x02013;2 VUR, who were conservatively managed with antimicrobial prophylaxis and were not included. Those with higher Grade of reflux were initially conservatively managed, but those who developed recurrent breakthrough UTIs/worsening of scars were intervened surgically. Those with secondary VUR (posterior urethral valves, neurogenic bladder, or bowel bladder dysfunction), associated anomalies such as ureteroceles, duplex systems, and ectopic ureters were excluded from our study. Those patients who did not have a follow-up evaluation or who did not turn up for follow-up were also excluded from our study.</p><p>Among the remaining patients with primary VUR, EVR was performed in Group 1, whereas CUR in Group 2 Modified nerve sparing EVR[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] was performed in children younger than 2 years with bilateral VUR, as gaining adequate transtrigonal tunnel by a CUR would have been difficult in this cohort (Group 1a) and in those with unilateral VUR (Group 1b; the ureteric orifices would be placed one over the other with CUR in unilateral reflux, and this may cause confusion in instrumentation of the ureteric orifices later in life, if needed). CUR (<italic>n</italic> = 67) was performed in children older than 2 years with bilateral VUR [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Selection criteria for type of reimplantation.

Postoperative evaluation included ultrasound + voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) at 3 months and ultrasound + radionuclide imaging at 1 year postoperatively. The mean duration of follow-up was 3 years (1&#x02013;7 years). Urodynamic assessment was not performed in the pre/postoperative period as a part of this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Over a period of 11 years, between 2003 and 2014, 750 children with VUR were diagnosed and 188 ureteric reimplants were performed in our institution. After excluding 70 patients as per our exclusion criteria, a total of 118 patients were recruited into the study. EVR was performed in 51 patients (Group 1), whereas CUR in 67 (Group 2). The mean age at operation was 15 months for Group 1 (range 10&#x02013;24 months), whereas in Group 2, it was 36 months (range 24&#x02013;60 months). The median age for the two Groups was 16 months and 40 months, respectively. There was a female preponderance (male:female = 43:75). Among Group 1, 32 underwent bilateral EVR (Group 1a), whereas the remaining underwent unilateral EVR (Group 1b). All patients in Group 2 underwent bilateral CUR.</p><p>The mean duration of bilateral reimplantation was significantly less (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0001) in Group 1a (<italic>n</italic> = 32; mean 104 min; standard deviation [SD] 18 min) compared to that in Group 2 (<italic>n</italic> = 67; mean 128 min; SD 15 min). The mean (SD) postoperative stay was significantly lower (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0001) at 4.5 (1.5) days in Group 1a compared to 6.5 (0.5) days in Group 2. Postoperative bladder spasms were significantly lower (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03) at 10/32 in Group 1a compared to 37/67 in Group 2. All patients responded well with anticholinergics. Postoperative hematuria was significantly lower (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03) at 10/32 in Group 1a compared to 31/67 in Group 2.</p><p>On a repeat VCUG at 3 months, persistent VUR was noted in 4/51 (7.85%) in Group 1 compared to and 5/67 in Group 2 (7.5%). There was no significant difference between the Groups and none of these patients developed recurrent febrile UTI to warrant further intervention.

However, patients undergoing EVR needed fewer pain medications and lesser anticholinergics to control bladder spasms. They also noted that patients undergoing bilateral extravesical approach were associated with transient urinary retention. They recommended minimal dissection of the region of trigone during bilateral procedures.</p><p>Wacksman <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] in 1992 performed EVR in 132 patients and observed that EVR and detrusorrhaphy are associated with a reduced postoperative morbidity and shortened hospital stay. In our study, the EVR technique was found to be superior to that of CUR, in terms of duration of surgery, postoperative hospital stay, incidence of hematuria and bladder spasms, and overall postoperative complications. The long-term outcomes were comparable to that of CUR. The difference in the age distribution between Groups could be a pitfall in the current study design.</p><p>Lipski[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] reported higher voiding dysfunction following bilateral EVR. However, a nerve-sparing technique proposed by David[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] reduced these complications, and in our study, none of the patient, who underwent bilateral EVR developed retention. Several authors[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] have reported successful EVR as a day case procedure.</p><p>The significant advantage of EVR is short convalescence and less morbidity. In addition, a relatively straight access of ureter makes it easier for upper tract instrumentation, if needed at a later date. With the advent of laparoscopic and robotic techniques,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] the morbidity is further reduced for both EVR and CUR. Further studies should through more light on the superiority of these techniques via a minimally invasive route.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>EVR has less postoperative discomfort and hospital stay compared to Cohen's reimplantation.
