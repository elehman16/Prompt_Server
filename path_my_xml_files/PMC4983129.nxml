Of the 16 rams, 12 that were clinically fit for the experiment at the end of the acclimatization period were randomly divided into four groups: Groups I, II, III, and IV, each having 3 rams. Groups I and II were each challenged singly with experimental <italic>Trypanosoma brucei brucei</italic> (Federer strain) and <italic>Trypanosoma evansi</italic> (Sokoto strain), respectively, while Group III was challenged with mixed <italic>T. brucei brucei</italic> and <italic>T. evansi</italic> parasites (50% of each species in the infective inoculum) and Group IV was left as an uninfected control.

These diseases usually cause debilitating symptoms manifested by anemia and cachexia which may result in death. In Nigeria, demand for ram is on the increase due to its importance in religious and naming ceremonies, and its culinary attraction at barbeque stands; but parasites, especially trypanosomes, have become a major threat to sustainable livestock production resulting in a decline in production [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Apart from hematological and pathogenic aberrations that do occur in animals infected with the parasites, recent studies show that they cause a wide range of reproductive disorders in animals, including degeneration of the hypothalamus, pituitary glands, and gonads with consequent disruptions in the secretions and plasma concentrations of the hormones necessary for normal reproductive processes in both sexes [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>In female animals, the effect includes severe genital lesions, temporary or permanent anestrus, and abnormal estrous cycles. In addition, trypanosomal-induced death during pregnancy, abnormal pregnancy, dystocia, abortion, premature birth, low birth weight, stillbirth, transplacental fetal infection, neonatal death, and other pathogenic effects on fetuses and offspring have been reported by Batista <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and Silva <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>In the males, the effects include delayed puberty, loss of libido, severe degenerative changes of the genitalia, manifested by the production of very poor quality semen, and loss of epididymal and gonadal sperm reserves [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Testicular atrophy has also been reported with the presence of dead spermatozoa in the seminiferous tubules of goats [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Infection in rabbits with <italic>Trypanosoma brucei brucei</italic> causes increased scrotal circumference, scrotal inflammation, severe testicular degeneration, abnormal spermatogenesis, aspermatogenesis, and incomplete resolution of the genital organs [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The presence of <italic>T. brucei brucei</italic> in the genital tract and the brain, in addition to severe lesions resulting in the degeneration of testes which involved the Leydig cells, basement membrane, Sertoli and germ cells, with resultant loss of libido was reported in boars [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Animals that survived infection often remained infertile [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In <italic>Trypanosoma vivax</italic> or <italic>Trypanosoma congolense</italic> infected Yankasa rams, the effects on reproduction ranges from scrotal edema, poor semen quality or the cessation of semen production, genital lesions, degeneration of the testes, loss of libido as well as infertility and loss of epididymal and gonadal sperm reserves [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Considering the fact that sheep are often graze alongside cattle or camels from northern Nigeria toward the southern vegetation belts by herdsmen in search of greener pastures, there is the possibility of exposing them to the risk of bites by tsetse flies and other stomoses, which are invertebrate hosts of trypanosomes. This study was, therefore, designed to determine the extent of <italic>T. brucei brucei</italic> and <italic>T. evansi</italic> and mixed infections on the testes, epididymal, and gonadal sperm reserves of Yankasa rams.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The experimental protocols and treatments were done in accordance with the principles of Animal Use and Care (ABUCAUC) of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Experimental animals</title><p>A total of 16 apparently healthy and intact Yankasa rams, aged between 24 and 30 months and weighed between 22 and 25 kg, were purchased from Sheme market, an apparently tsetse-free zone, in Katsina State of the Nigerian Sudan-Guinea Savannah. The ages of the animals obtained from the market were confirmed by the presence of temporary and permanent incisors as described by Wilson and Durkin [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], that is, by the eruption of permanent incisors at permanent corners of the cheek.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Housing and screening of experimental animals</title><p>The purchased animals were housed in an insect-proof animal pen at the Department of Veterinary Parasitology and Entomology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, where they were screened for the presence of ectoparasites, endoparasites, and hemoparasites. The rams were thereafter treated with Oxytetracycline (Tridax<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) intramuscularly, at a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight and Albendazole (Sambezole<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Sam Pharmaceutical Ltd; Animal Care, Nig.

During the 8 weeks acclimatization period, they were subjected to routine handlings such as physical examination, determination of the body weight, rectal temperature, scrotal circumference, semen collection, and collection of blood samples for screening of hemoparasites and determination of baseline semen and hematological indices. Before commencement of the experiment, the rams were ensured to be clinically free of trypanosomes and other hemoparasites in their blood using buffy coat centrifugation technique [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Source of trypanosomes</title><p><italic>T. evansi</italic> was obtained from an infected camel at slaughter in Sokoto abattoir, Sokoto State, North-Western Nigeria, while <italic>T. brucei brucei</italic> was obtained from the Nigerian Institute for Trypanosomiasis Research, Kaduna, Nigeria, originally isolated from a natural infection in cattle, in Kaduna State. Both parasites were maintained in Wistar rats by serial passage and were transported to the Protozoology Laboratory, Department of Veterinary Parasitology and Entomology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, for proper identification using the Giemsa-stained thin blood smear diagnostic technique [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. <italic>T. evansi</italic> was identified morphologically by the characteristic free and long flagellum with well-developed undulating membrane, subterminal kinetoplast, and an elongated and centrally placed nucleus while <italic>T. brucei brucei</italic> was identified by the presence of short posterior kinetoplast, long and conspicuous undulating membrane with no free flagellum. Both parasites were sub-inoculated intraperitoneally into 10 Wistar rats each and were kept in separate cages. The rats were fed with commercial pelleted feed and water supplied <italic>ad-libitum</italic>. Before inoculation into experimental rams, blood samples were collected daily from each of the rats to determine the level of parasitemia using the hematocrit centrifugation technique (HCT) as described by Woo [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and Biryomumaisho <italic>et al</italic>.

They were slaughtered to determine their gonadal sperm/spermatid reserves; that is, their integrity to support gonadal functions. The two testes of each of the 8 rams were carefully removed and labeled for proper identification. A small portion of the testes from each of the sacrificed ram was removed and preserved in Bouin solution for histopathological examinations. The weight, length, and volume of each testis were determined. Gonadal sperm/spermatid reserves were determined according to the methods described by Rekwot <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Ogunlade <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Briefly, the tunica albuginea of each testis was removed using a scalpel blade to expose the testicular parenchyma which was weighed, sliced, and homogenized with a high speed blender for 2 min with 50 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) containing antibiotics (sodium penicillin G, 100 IU/mL and streptomycin sulfate, 1 mg/mL) to prevent bacterial growth. The homogenate volume, after rinsing the blender container with 20 mL of saline was measured. About 5 mL of the homogenate was transferred to a conical flask and further dilution was made with 40 mL of saline, and the homogenate was stored overnight at 5&#x000b0;C to allow sperm cells to ooze out of the tissues. Finally, the gonadal sperm/spermatid concentration was determined with a hemocytometer according to the method of Coles [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The concentration of spermatozoa was determined using the erythrocyte counting chamber of the hemocytometer that was crossed with microscopic grids containing small squares. Sperm cells and spermatids were counted diagonally from top left to bottom right in five large squares as described by Rekwot <italic>et al</italic>.

The samples were thereafter, filtered through gauze and the filtrate volume was measured and recorded. 1 mL each of epididymal portion was diluted separately with 2 mL of saline solution.

Observed clinical signs among the rams in the infected Groups I, II, and III were similar and include intermittent pyrexia, roughy hair coat, reduced and or selective feed intake, reduced body weight gain, pale ocular membrane with peri-orbital edema, loss of body condition, poor semen output, loss of libido, drowsiness, and death. By day 49 p.i., 1 ram (R6) in Group II (<italic>T. evansi</italic>) began to lose its body condition, and balance because it could not stand on its limbs. The PCV decreased severely (from mean pre-infection value of 30.0% to mean post-infection value of 13.5% by 56 days p.i.), its total plasma protein value also decreased significantly (from the pre-infection value of 6.0-3.0 by day 56 p.i.). Body weight was significantly (p&#x0003c;0.01) reduced from a pre-infection value of 22.95 kg to p.i. value of 16.95 kg by day 56 p.i. The ram totally lost its balance and could not ejaculate during semen collection. Animal neck became very stiff and died by the evening of day 57 p.i. Post mortem examination was done promptly. Necropsy revealed the presence of congested lungs, very pale and anemic carcass, serous atrophy of fats in the kidney, heart and intestine, severe lymphomegaly and hepatomegaly, and testicular atrophy. However, the remaining 2 rams within the group (<italic>T. evansi</italic>) survived the infection up to the end of the experiment as they began to recover, evidenced by gradual gain in weight, gradual increase in PCV value and the animals appeared normal by the end of the experiment (day 98 p.i) with absence of parasitemia in peripheral blood circulation. By day 75 p.i., there was severe scrotal atrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure-1c</xref>) of ram R7 in Group I (<italic>T. brucei brucei</italic>) as compared to those of the control Group IV that had a normal scrotum throughout the study period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure-1a</xref>).

As the infection progressed, another ram (R8) in Group I (<italic>T. brucei brucei</italic>) died by day 77 p.i. Before its death, there was decrease in weight (from pre-infection value of 23.40 kg to p.i. value of 21.44 kg at day 70 p.i.). The ram completely lost its appetite and could not stand on its limbs. The PCV decreased as low as 15% (from pre-infection value of 34% at day 0), severe decrease of scrotal circumference and the ram died overnight (day 77 p.i.). Post mortem result also revealed the presence of severely pale carcass, swollen lymph nodes, and swollen liver and serous atrophy of body fats, with severely degenerated testes (at histology).

Such lesions in the skin, skeletal muscles, and testicles gave rise to severe edema, which on palpation elicited painful reactions in affected animals. Similar observations were reported by Okubanjo <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The swelling of the scrotum (scrotal edema) at the early stage of this experiment may be associated with inflammation process (orchitis) of the testes due to invasion by trypanosomes, thereby resulting in the increase in scrotal circumference as well as increase in body temperature. Such inflammatory processes within the testes or scrotum incited by the trypanosomes also resulted in degeneration of the testicular and scrotal tissues leading to decrease in scrotal circumference. Similarly, Okubanjo <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] also reported variation in scrotal sizes of rams infected with <italic>T. congolense</italic>.</p><p>Decrease in the gonadal and epididymal sperm reserve of the infected groups as compared to the uninfected control group in this study may be attributed to the inflammatory lesions on the reproductive organs by the trypanosomes which resulted in the degeneration of the seminiferous tubules with consequence disappearance of spermatozoa, spermatids and less commonly spermatocytes. The latter results in a reduction of the mean seminiferous tubules diameter and epithelial thickness which resulted to the decreased semen volume, decreased spermatozoa concentration and motility, and increased number of abnormal and dead spermatozoa, hence leading to reduction or absence of the gonadal and epididymal sperm reserve. Impairment of the seminiferous tubule together with germ and Sertoli cells will consequently alter the process of spermatogenesis which may render the rams infertile or sterile (if untreated), and the overall effect will be a reduction or complete absence of gonadal sperm reserve. This agrees with earlier reports in boar [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], bulls [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], gazelles [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and sheep and goat infected with <italic>T. vivax</italic> or <italic>T. congolense</italic> [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Testicular damage sequel to trypanosomosis in <italic>T. brucei brucei</italic>-infected rams and those with mixed infections compared to those of <italic>T. evansi</italic> infected rams, suggests that the <italic>T. brucei brucei</italic> strain used in this study was more virulent than the <italic>T. evansi</italic> strain (Sokoto isolate).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Infertility caused by <italic>T. brucei brucei</italic>, <italic>T. evansi</italic>, or mixed infections in Yankasa rams is perilous.
