We hypothesized that changes in lymphocyte subpopulations would be associated with elevated metal ion concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p> A randomized trial involving 85 patients matched for age and sex and randomized to receiving metal-on-metal (n = 41) or metal-on-polyethylene total hip arthroplasty (n = 44) was conducted. 36 patients were eligible for follow-up after mean 7 (6&#x02013;8) years. Concentrations of chromium and cobalt were analyzed by high-resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Leukocyte subpopulations and immunoglobulins in patient blood were measured using standard laboratory methods.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p> Patients with a metal-on-metal hip had higher serum concentrations of chromium (1.05 vs. 0.36 &#x003bc;g/L; p &#x0003c; 0.001) and cobalt (0.86 vs. 0.24 &#x003bc;g/L; p &#x0003c; 0.001) than those with metal-on-polyethylene. The percentage of HLA DR<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells was higher in the metal-on-metal group (10.6 vs. 6.7%; p = 0.03) and correlated positively with chromium and cobalt concentrations in patient blood (Pearson's correlation coefficient: 0.39, p = 0.02; 0.36, p = 0.03, respectively). The percentage of B-cells was lower in the metal-on-metal group (p = 0.01). The two groups were similar with respect to immunoglobulin concentrations and Harris hip scores, and there were no radiographic signs of loosening.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p> We conclude that immunological alterations appear to be associated with increased cobalt and chromium concentrations. It is tempting to speculate that HLA DR<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells are involved in the pathogenesis of allergic reactions, implant loosening, and lymphocytic pseudotumors.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Immunological phenomena&#x02014;both local and systemic&#x02014;that are attributed to elevated metal ion concentrations have been described after modern metal-on-metal arthroplasty: 1. Lymphocyte-mediated inflammatory reactions occur in the vicinity of metal-on-metal articulations, and polyethylene-independent osteolysis has been characterized histologically in such cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">Davies et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">Willert et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">Lazarinis et al. 2008</xref>). 2. The development of periprosthetic soft-tissue masses containing large numbers of lymphocytes has been identified as a cause of persistent pain, especially in females, after metal-on-metal hip resurfacing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">Pandit et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">Toms et al. 2008</xref>). 3. At the systemic level, the induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity directed against metal ions has been observed after metal-on-metal THA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">Hallab et al. 2004</xref>). 4. A decrease in the amount of circulating CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells has been described in patients with elevated metal ion levels subsequent to metal-on-metal THA, indicating further systemic immunological effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">Hart et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">2009</xref>).</p><p>We have recently published a study of patients who were randomized to receive either a metal-on-polyethylene or a metal-on-metal bearing with a 28-mm metal head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">Dahlstrand et al. 2009</xref>). Clinical parameters, radiology results, and concentrations of chromium, cobalt, nickel, and manganese were followed, and we found elevation of all metal ions after 2 years in the metal-on-metal group. In the present study, we hypothesized that immunological changes can occur as a consequence of elevated metal ion concentrations in the medium term. Specifically, in the light of previously published findings, we expected changes in subsets of CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes, but no gross changes in other lymphocyte subpopulations or in serum immunoglobulins.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="ss2"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="ss3"><title>Study design and population</title><p>This prospective randomized study was performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the Helsinki declaration. Informed consent was obtained from all patients and the study was approved by the local ethics committee (no. 2006/958). The primary endpoints of the study were (1) the determination of concentrations of the heavy metal ions chromium, cobalt, nickel, and manganese in patient blood and (2) implant migration relative to surrounding bone, as determined by radiostereometry in 2 groups of patients that were randomized to receiving either a metal-on-metal bearing or a metal-on-polyethylene bearing. The investigation of immunological parameters was added as a secondary endpoint for this study at a later stage.</p><p>166 patients, referred to the Department of Orthopedics, Karolinska Hospital, Sweden because of osteoarthritis of the hip, were eligible for study participation. Inclusion criteria were pain due to radiographically verified osteoarthritis and age between 40 and 75 years. Exclusion criteria were refusal to participate in the study, previous surgery with either osteosynthesis or joint replacement, weight over 105 kg, previous infection or surgery in the affected hip, local or general osteoporosis, intake of systemic cortical steroids for more than 3 months during the previous year, abuse of alcohol or drugs, and mental disorders including dementia. Strict application of inclusion and exclusion criteria left a cohort of 85 patients who were allocated to one of two groups according to the minimization method: 44 patients received a metal-on-polyethylene bearing and 41 patients received a metal-on-metal bearing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The groups were matched according to sex, smoking habits, body weight, and age. Neither the patients nor the authors involved were blinded as to the type of bearing; however, for determination of the Harris hip score, a physiotherapist blinded to the type of bearing collected the data. All patients were followed for 2 years, but 10 were subsequently lost to follow-up. Furthermore, 39 patients had to be excluded from the analysis presented here because they had received additional metal implants, rendering the measurement of metal ion concentrations meaningless. This left a study population of 36 patients, 19 in the metal-on-metal group and 17 in the metal-on-polyethylene group, who were followed for a mean of 82 (72&#x02013;97) months.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow chart.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ORT-0300-9734-082-006_g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="ss4"><title>Implants</title><p>In all patients, a matte, tapered stainless steel stem (MS30; Sulzer, Winterthur, Switzerland) with a modular 28-mm head was combined with a low-profile cup. Two types of bearings were used: one consisted of a wrought high-carbon, cobalt-chromium alloy head against a cobalt-chromium liner fitted in a polyethylene cup, making it a metal-on-metal bearing (Metasul; Sulzer). The other articulation was a similar cobalt-chromium head (Protasul; Sulzer) against an all-polyethylene cup (M&#x000fc;ller, Durasul; Sulzer). The alloy of the heads and liner consisted of a minimum of 50% cobalt, 26&#x02013;30% chromium, 7% molybdenum, 1% nickel, and 1% manganese. The Metasul head is more polished than the Protasul, in order to minimize friction against the metal liner. Stem and cup were cemented with Palacos with gentamicin (Heraeus, Hanau, Germany) in all cases. All procedures were performed through a standard posterior approach by the same senior surgeon (AS) between October 1998 and January 2001.</p></sec><sec id="ss5"><title>Clinical outcome measures and radiology</title><p>The Harris hip score (HHS) was determined preoperatively and at follow-up visits 3, 6, 12, 24, and 72 months after surgery. In all patients, follow-up included anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the hip.</p></sec><sec id="ss6"><title>Analysis of ion concentrations in serum</title><p>Samples of serum were collected from patients preoperatively and at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 72 months, in a standardized manner by a registered nurse using an 18-gauge intravenous cannula with the central stainless steel needle removed. The first 5 mL of blood drawn from each patient was discarded. The containers used were 10-mL polypropylene tubes with sodium heparin (Teklab Ltd., Durham, UK). One batch of cannulas and tubes was used throughout the study. All materials used to collect and store samples were chosen for their lack of metals investigated in this study.</p><p>The whole blood samples were centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 10 min; the serum was then transferred to acid-washed polypropylene storage tubes using disposable plastic pipettes and stored at &#x02013;20&#x000b0;C until further analysis. All samples were subsequently sent to an accredited external laboratory specialized in trace metal analysis and analyzed for concentrations of cobalt and chromium by high-resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry using a commercially available device (Element; Finnigan-MAT, Bremen, Germany). The detection limit for chromium was 0.2 &#x003bc;g/L (4 nMol/L) and that for cobalt was 0.05 &#x003bc;g/L (0.8 nMol/L). To facilitate comparisons with previous literature, ion concentrations are presented as mean concentrations in &#x003bc;g/L with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).</p></sec><sec id="ss7"><title>Immunological analysis</title><p>Leukocyte subpopulations were investigated by flow cytometry on a Coulter EPICS-XL-MCL using commercially available antibodies (CD3, CD8, CD45, CD4: Tetracrome Beckman Coulter, Bromma, Sweden cat. no. 6607013; CD3, CD16/56, CD45, CD19: Tetracrome cat. no. 6607073 and Becton-Dickinson cat. no. 332779; HLA DR: Becton-Dickinson cat. no. 6604366; CD4: Becton-Dickinson cat. no. 345768; CD8: Dako cat. no. C7079). Results are given as numbers per nL, or as percentages. Immunoglobulins and IgG subclasses were analyzed by nephelometry (DADE Behrings BNll); subclasses were determined using a commercially available kit (The Binding Site Group Ltd., Birmingham, UK) and the results are expressed in g/L.</p></sec><sec id="ss8"><title>Statistics</title><p>Before the study, a power analysis indicated that 20 patients per group would be sufficient to detect differences in metal ion concentrations (our primary endpoint) of one standard deviation with a power of 80%, given a two-tailed p-value of 0.05. The investigation of immunological parameters was not planned at the onset of the study, but was deemed to be relevant at a later stage. Thus, the power estimation was not based on this secondary endpoint. In addition, a large number of patients had to be excluded from follow-up due to the implantation of a contralateral THA, which rendered analysis of metal ion concentrations meaningless.</p><p>All variables were summarized using standard descriptive statistics such as frequencies, means, medians, and standard deviations. The distributions of metal ion concentrations were severely positively skewed; i.e., most subjects were found at the lower ends of concentration ranges, contrasted by outliers with high concentrations. By calculation of the natural logarithms of metal ion concentrations, they were transformed to normal distributions and metal ion concentrations were therefore subsequently analyzed using a linear model with cobalt or chromium concentrations after 6 years as the dependent variable, the type of bearing as the fixed factor, and preoperative cobalt or chromium concentrations as a covariate. Model residuals were normally distributed, and Cook's distances were &#x0003c; 1. Most immunological parameters were normally distributed, but baseline data were not available for these parameters; thus, inter-group comparisons of immunological parameters were performed using the independent t-test. Correlation analysis of logarithmically transformed metal ion concentrations with immunological parameters was performed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. The level of significance (two-tailed) was 0.05 in all analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="ss9"><title>Results</title><sec id="ss10"><title>Clinical and radiographic outcome</title><p>The two groups of patients did not differ with respect to age, sex, or BMI.

Against the background of the previously described reduction in the total population of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">Hart et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">2009</xref>), a decrease in the number of HLA DR<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells could have been anticipated. However, in contrast to the data described by Hart et al., we found no reduction in the number of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells in patients who underwent metal-on-metal THA. This discrepancy could be explained by differences between the various study settings. Our trial was randomized, the two groups of patients in our study were matched for age and sex, and there were no differences in BMI or time to follow-up between the two groups. In contrast, Hart et al. performed a retrospective review of a heterogeneous population; the groups investigated differed in sex distribution, age, BMI, and length of follow-up. The findings by Hart et al. are also contradicted by reports of an increased proportion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells and CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells in the peripheral blood of patients undergoing revision arthroplasty due to aseptic loosening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">Case et al. 2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="ss17"><title>Immunological reactions around arthroplasty implants</title><p>Several reports have described predominantly lymphocytic infiltrates in the neo-capsule of revised metal-on-metal THAs, consisting mainly of CD3<sup>+</sup> T-cells and CD20<sup>+</sup> B-cells, but also containing considerable numbers of macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">Davies et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">Willert et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">Witzleb et al. 2007</xref>). This type of infiltrate appears to be rather specific for metal-on-metal bearings; it is quite distinct from infiltrates that can be seen around metal-on-polyethylene THAs or in situations involving conventional deep infection. In addition, expression of interferon-&#x003b3; and the presence of activated T-cells have been described in the pseudomembrane surrounding implants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">Weyand et al. 1998</xref>). An immunohistochemical analysis of loose orthopedic implants with a cobalt-chromium component revealed an elevated level of HLA DR<sup>+</sup> macrophages and enrichment of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells at the bone-implant interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">al Saffar and Revell 1994</xref>).</p><p>It has also been reported that women with a metal-on-metal resurfacing arthroplasty are predisposed to development of periprosthetic pseudotumors with extensive connective tissue necrosis and mainly lymphocytic infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">Pandit et al. 2008</xref>). We therefore stratified our study population by sex but found no differences between the sexes. Thus, our findings cannot explain the observed predisposition of women regarding this phenomenon.</p></sec><sec id="ss18"><title>Sensitization to heavy metal ions after THA</title><p>Sensitization to various heavy metals after THA was already described after the use of first-generation metal-on-metal arthroplasties during the 1970s, but even today it &#x0201c;&#x02026; remains uncertain whether the loosening causes the sensitization or vice versa&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">Elves et al. 1975</xref>). Even with the use of modern metal-on-metal THA, immunological reactions to heavy metal ions are known to occur, as increased lymphocytic reactivity to both cobalt and nickel has been described in patients with metal-on-metal articulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">Hallab et al. 2004</xref>). Furthermore, the lymphocytes of patients reacting to chromium more readily release interferon-&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">Hallab et al. 2008</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms behind the immunological reactions after metal-on-metal THA are not yet understood. Macrophages at the prosthesis/tissue interface are considered to present haptenic metal ions in the context of self peptides (metal ion-altered self) as antigens in combination with MHC class II molecules, leading to T-cell priming. The mediation of metal sensitization via T-cells has been suggested by several authors: T-cell infiltrates at the implant interface suggest an association with type IV, cell-mediated sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">Lalor et al. 1990</xref>), and CD3- and CD28-related signaling was observed in T-cells after exposure to cobalt/chromium-particles in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">Ogunwale et al. 2009</xref>).</p><p>There was a correlation between the percentage of HLA DR<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells in our study and the concentration of chromium and cobalt, although the correlation was weak. We therefore speculate that heavy metal ions released from the implant may be processed on HLA DR<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells&#x02014;either like superantigens by forming and stabilizing bridges between the T-cell receptor and MHC class II molecules, or as neoantigens created by metal-protein interactions. We did not analyze cytokine release and cellular activation markers, however.</p></sec><sec id="ss19"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>The analysis of immunological parameters was added as a secondary endpoint after patient recruitment had been completed, and was not included in the primary study protocol. The present study, based on only 36 individuals eligible for immunological analysis, was therefore open to type-II error. At the same time, small cohorts are vulnerable to outliers, and type-I errors can therefore also occur. Approximately equal numbers were lost to follow-up or were excluded from final analysis in both study groups; we therefore believe that there was no selection bias. Taken together, our findings must be regarded as being derived from a pilot study on a small cohort of patients.</p></sec><sec id="ss20" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study indicates that elevated chromium and cobalt concentrations after metal-on-metal THA correlate with immunological reactions, reflected by an elevation in HLA DR<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells and a decrease in the percentage of B-cells. We currently have no evidence that the elevation of this subtype of lymphocytes is the cause of allergic reactions, aseptic loosening, or periprosthetic pseudotumors that have been described after metal-on-metal arthroplasty. Future studies investigating a possible association between these phenomena must be performed on larger groups of patients.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The study was conceived by AS who also performed all surgeries and interpreted data.
