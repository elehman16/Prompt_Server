Introduction</title><p>Procedures to monitor and enhance treatment fidelity are the necessary methodological components of clinical trials that help ensure internal and external validity and reliability of behavioral interventions [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Systematic implementation of strategies to maintain and optimize intervention fidelity is prerequisite for establishing credible data, drawing conclusions on intervention efficacy or effectiveness, and future replication in other studies or dissemination in clinical practice [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Drawing on existing evidence, guidelines, and experience of content experts, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Behavior Change Consortium's Treatment Fidelity Workgroup [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] conceptualized fidelity as consisting of several methodological areas: strategies to address treatment integrity<italic> (Was the study design and the intervention appropriate for the research question? Was the intervention delivered as intended?)</italic>; strategies to assess and improve treatment receipt<italic> (Were the participants able to understand and perform intervention taught techniques during intervention delivery?)</italic>; and strategies to evaluate and optimize treatment enactment<italic> (Were the participants able to apply the intervention-taught techniques in &#x0201c;real-life&#x0201d;?)</italic>. Gearing et al. [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] further delineated core ingredients of fidelity that should be assessed as an integral part of behavioral intervention research.</p><p>Following the growing public, clinical, and scientific interest in mind-body approaches for general well-being and a variety of health problems, Mindfulness Meditation (MM) programs, often based on the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), or Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention (MBRP) models [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], have been incorporated into the clinical care for substance use disorders (SUDs) [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The conceptual framework described in the literature supports the application of MM for relapse prevention in SUDs and suggests that combining MM with traditional, standard-of-care cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques for SUDs may produce additive benefits [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Although promising, research on the efficacy of MM-based interventions in SUDs is inconclusive and limited by relatively small sample sizes and heterogeneity of used methods, including a variety of targeted populations, tested interventions, and strategies for treatment fidelity monitoring [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The recent Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) report called for clinical trials of MM-based interventions to rigorously incorporate both monitoring and reporting on treatment fidelity [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>To address this gap, we conducted a 26-week randomized controlled trial (RCT; <italic>N</italic> = 123) evaluating efficacy of the MM-based intervention for alcohol relapse prevention and, using existing guidelines [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], developed and applied methods to measure and enhance the intervention's fidelity. This article describes treatment fidelity related methods and findings, which can be relevant to other behavioral intervention trials.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Study Design</title><p>The main study was a 26-week parallel-arm RCT assessing the efficacy of the MBRP for Alcohol Dependence (MBRP-A) intervention, adjunctive to usual care, and compared to usual care alone, for relapse prevention in alcohol dependence. The efficacy findings will be described elsewhere. The trial procedures were approved by the University of Wisconsin Health Sciences Institutional Review Board and registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">https://clinicaltrials.gov/</ext-link> prior to participant enrollment.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Participants/Settings</title><p>Participants were alcohol dependent adults in early recovery recruited from eight local addiction treatment centers. Eligibility was determined in a two-step process, based on self-report. The initial screen was conducted by phone; those who &#x0201c;passed&#x0201d; this screen were invited for an in-person final screening, during which the extent of alcohol and drug use and related harms were assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Eligibility criteria were age &#x02265; 18 years; English fluency; a SCID-confirmed diagnosis of alcohol dependence in an early remission (defined by lack of heavy drinking: men 5 drinks/day, women 4 drinks/day [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; and lack of any drinking on &#x02265;3 consecutive days) of 2&#x02013;14 weeks; completed at least 2 weeks of outpatient treatment (&#x02265;2 therapy sessions/week) in one of the collaborating treatment centers; having a home address, phone number, and ability to reliably participate; absence of regular MM practice, preexisting bipolar or delusional disorders, current pregnancy, and a SCID-determined diagnosis of active (past 2 weeks) drug abuse or dependence; and, because stress reduction was the hypothesized mechanism of MBRP-A's action, an elevated total score (&#x0003e;13 points) on the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Randomization</title><p>The study statistician prepared the randomization envelopes (1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1), which were consecutively distributed to participants by the study coordinator after the baseline assessment.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. Study Procedures</title><p>Eligible and interested individuals completed the informed consent procedures, then baseline data collection, followed by randomization (64 MM; 59 control participants) and scheduling of the MM participants for the MBRP-A course. Control participants were reminded about their eligibility to receive the intervention after completing the follow-up (wait-list controls). Outcome data were collected at baseline, and 8-week (after intervention; F1) and 26-week (F2) follow-up, and included surveys focused on substance use, drinking-related consequences and psychological health, and serum levels of stress-responsive biomarkers (interleukin-6; liver enzymes) assayed from a venous blood sample.</p><p>The study team primarily consisted of the study coordinator and the principal investigator (PI) who also functioned as the main study physician. All participants were contacted by the study coordinator prior to scheduled activities as a reminder, to facilitate protocol adherence and assist with transportation, if needed. They were also contacted by phone by the PI for adherence problems and by the study physician to discuss any concerns (e.g., intent to harm; worrisome symptoms; elevated liver enzyme levels) and were sent a letter with liver enzyme results that included a personalized note summarizing any phone conversations about abnormal findings.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>2.5. Study Intervention</title><p>At baseline, all participants reported engaging in outpatient therapy for alcohol dependence (&#x0201c;usual care&#x0201d;) that typically included motivational enhancement, relapse prevention, and 12-step facilitation strategies [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], but not MM. They were encouraged to continue usual care per recommendations of their regular clinicians. In addition, the MM participants received the MBRP-A intervention.</p><p>With permission and assistance from MBRP's authors, the MBRP-A intervention was adapted from the existing, manualized MBRP program for SUDs [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] to address the needs of alcohol dependent adults. MBRP-A consisted of eight weekly, therapist-led, manual-driven 2-hour group sessions. It provided intensive training in MM, linking MM to CBT-based relapse prevention strategies to create a foundation for acquiring complementing MM and CBT skills for alcohol relapse prevention, as detailed elsewhere [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. At the first session, participants received a study binder with session-specific handouts; CDs with guided formal meditations (body scan recorded by the study therapist (FL); a set of CDs with meditations by Kabat-Zinn [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]); and a meditation cushion to facilitate home practice. Each MBRP-A session followed the same format: introduction and review of participants' home practice (experiences, questions, and concerns); practice of 2&#x02013;4 different techniques separated by a discussion of participant experiences and MM as a means of coping with challenges (e.g., stress, craving) that may contribute to relapse and a review of home practice recommendations for the following week (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). In addition, experimental participants were asked to practice MM at home throughout the 26-week study (formal practice: 30 minutes/day, &#x02265;6 days/week; informal practice, e.g., &#x0201c;mindfulness of daily activities,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;urge surfing:&#x0201d; daily).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>2.6. Considerations and Measures Related to Treatment Fidelity Monitoring</title><p>Efficacy-related findings, describing the effects of the MBRP-A intervention on alcohol consumption (primary outcome, assessed retrospectively with the Timeline Followback method [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]), and the severity of drinking-related consequences (secondary outcome, assessed with Drinker Inventory of Consequences [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]) will be presented elsewhere. The considerations and measures, detailed below, pertain to fidelity monitoring of the MBRP-A intervention.</p><p>Following the existing recommendations [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], we grouped treatment fidelity related methods and measures into four categories (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>), addressing the core components: (1) study/intervention design so that it is rooted in a conceptual model or existing clinical practice and enables hypothesis testing; (2) standardized training of therapists to ensure appropriate implementation of the intervention; (3) monitoring and enhancement of intervention delivery so that it is implemented as intended; and (4) monitoring and improving participant understanding and performance of the taught skills (treatment receipt) and their appropriate application in real-life settings (treatment enactment).</p><sec id="sec2.6.1"><title>2.6.1. Study/Intervention Design</title><p>During the study development phase, a theoretical framework behind the application of MM for relapse prevention in SUDs had already been described, suggesting that MM, especially when combined with standard-of-care relapse prevention CBT strategies, can be effective for SUDs [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], leading to the creation of MBRP, which leverages both MM and relapse prevention CBT techniques [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. We adapted the MBRP program to serve the specific needs of alcohol dependent adults (MBRP-A) and tested the main hypotheses that MBRP-A will reduce the rates of alcohol relapse and the severity of drinking-related consequences. To address these aims, we considered several study designs and settled on a parallel, two equal-arm 6-month RCT comparing MBRP-A plus usual care to usual care alone; therefore, we enrolled only those who reported engagement in a treatment program for alcohol dependence. We elected to add MBRP-A to usual care, rather than assess MBRP-A as a stand-alone intervention, because alcohol dependence can have serious health consequences if left untreated and evidence-based treatments for alcohol dependence exist. This design facilitated cost-efficient data collection and efficacy analysis but led to differences in &#x0201c;treatment dose&#x0201d; (i.e., therapist contact time, group effect) across the two study arms, as only the intervention group received MBRP-A, therefore, limiting our ability to draw conclusions about &#x0201c;true efficacy&#x0201d; of MBRP-A versus nonspecific intervention effects. If shown efficacious in the present RCT, the next study could compare MBRP-A against an &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; comparison condition so that the &#x0201c;treatment dose&#x0201d; is the same across the study arms. With the aim of evaluating the effects of MBRP-A on relapse prevention, the study targeted alcohol dependent individuals in a recovery of 2&#x02013;14-week duration, a period during which the risk for alcohol withdrawal is reduced while the risk for relapse is increased [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Therapists needed to have a degree in clinical psychology, social work, or substance abuse counseling; &#x02265;2 years of experience in mental health and/or substance abuse counseling and group therapy facilitation; &#x02265;2 years of a personal MM practice; and experience teaching MM in group settings. Several candidates were interviewed by the PI who then selected one primary therapist (FL) and one main back-up therapist (VGS).</p><p>The intervention manual for MBRP-A (available upon request) was adapted from the MBRP's curriculum [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and provided a scripted protocol for intervention delivery. The MBRP intervention [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] included MM, with its curriculum patterned after the MBSR [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and MBCT [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] programs, and relapse prevention CBT strategies [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] for SUDs. At the time of our project start date, no conclusive data were available for the MBRP's efficacy. With the study focus on alcohol dependence, MBRP's manual [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] was adapted by the PI (with Alan G. Marlatt (deceased) and other authors' permission) to the needs of our study population. The PI (AZ), a family medicine and addiction medicine physician and MM practitioner, received training in the MBRP delivery from the MBRP's authors. The initial MBRP-A manual (Version 1) was pilot-tested in a 16-week uncontrolled clinical trial (<italic>N</italic> = 19), which showed promising results [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Afterwards, the manual was revised (Version 2), then retested in an 8-week uncontrolled clinical trial (<italic>N</italic> = 7; unpublished results), and refined further (Version 3) prior to its implementation in the RCT. All revisions were finalized by the PI and informed by the therapist and participant feedback, the PI's direct observation of the intervention delivery in both pilot trials, and expert input [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; disagreements were resolved by consensus, with Dr. Marlatt, an expert in MM and CBT-based relapse prevention, designated to make decisions in case a consensus was not reached.</p><p>An a priori plan for potential implementation set-backs was developed. A plan for when to cancel/reschedule an intervention session was prepared. Two trained back-up therapists (VGS served as the main back-up therapist) were available to replace the primary therapist if needed. A safety protocol was developed, with all staff trained in its implementation by the PI in how to approach participants presenting with worrisome medical or mental health symptoms; the safety protocol binder, containing standardized materials, was available at each intervention session. In addition, to ensure personnel and participant safety and facilitate high-quality intervention delivery, at least two study team members (the therapist and additional research staff) were present at the intervention sessions, which were held in a quiet conference room of a centrally located community hospital with the proximity of emergency and security services. Guided by our pilot study experience [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the sessions were scheduled in the evening to accommodate a typical work schedule, and light snacks and water were provided to improve adherence. No breaks were scheduled during the sessions; smokers were encouraged to abstain and consider cessation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6.2"><title>2.6.2. Therapist Training</title><p>The primary therapist (FL) had 26 years of experience in mental health and substance abuse-related counseling and over 29 years of experience in MM practice, including instruction and a 7-day residential training in the MBSR delivery. The main back-up therapist (VGS) had a similar background and experience. The therapists received a protocol-driven training from the PI prior to delivering the intervention in the RCT. This training included a review of the intervention manual by the therapist, followed by a PI-led one-day, intensive workshop on MM theory, MM application to alcohol relapse prevention, and the review of the manual content and approach to intervention delivery, including role-play practices. The PI was present during the first study intervention (eight sessions) to ensure the primary therapist's competence and adherence, and provide feedback. The back-up therapist cofacilitated delivery of one intervention (eight sessions) with the primary therapist. The therapists also completed professional residential training in the delivery of MBRP offered by its developers. The primary therapist had also delivered the study interventions in two pilot trials led by the PI. In addition to the training in intervention delivery, both therapists and research staff were trained in the rationale for and implementation of the safety protocol by the PI and the research coordinator during a 2-3-hour in-person meeting.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6.3"><title>2.6.3. Intervention Delivery Monitoring</title><p>We implemented several strategies to maximize treatment fidelity. One therapist was selected to deliver all intervention sessions, with a back-up therapist available as needed to minimize the &#x0201c;therapist effect.&#x0201d; The PI observed the delivery of the first intervention (8 sessions) and was present at the beginning of each first MBRP-A session to meet with the therapist, introduce herself and the study to the participants, answer questions, encourage adherence and reporting of concerns, and thank participants for their time and effort. She was readily available to the therapist by phone and e-mail throughout the study.</p><p>
<italic>Therapist Adherence and Competence</italic>. The therapist adherence (ability to use the strategies outlined in the intervention manual) and competence (the quality of implementation of these strategies), important components of treatment fidelity [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], were formally assessed with the modified<italic> MBRP Adherence and Competence (MBRP-AC) scale</italic> [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] for the delivered 10 MBRP-A courses. A trained research staff member, present at the intervention session, filled out the scale, rating the therapist adherence and competence after each session with scoring sheets submitted to the PI weekly. In addition, the intervention sessions were audio-recorded; recordings of all sessions from the first, &#x0201c;middle&#x0201d; (5th), and last (10th) interventions and two randomly selected sessions from the remaining courses were audited by a PI-trained research staff (JS) who scored therapist adherence and competence using the modified MBRP-AC scale [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The PI audited randomly selected individual sessions; in case of a score discrepancy between the main rater and the PI, the session was audited again and discussed until a consensus was reached. Feedback obtained through audits was communicated back to the therapist by the PI.</p><p>The original MBRP-AC scale, developed for treatment integrity monitoring of the MBRP intervention, was adapted and modified by the PI to both align its &#x0201c;checklist&#x0201d; with the content of the MBRP-A intervention and improve scoring efficiency. The audited audio-recorded sessions were scored using the modified MBRP-AC scale [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which evaluates two session-specific dimensions of therapist performance: competence and adherence. Rating of the therapist adherence to the Key Concepts was accomplished while listening to a recording. Rating of other aspects was conducted after the session had been audited in its entirety and written notes, taken while listening to the recording, had been reviewed. For the scoring of the competence dimensions, the coder assumed a beginning score of 3 and moved to a higher or lower score from there as appropriate. If a portion of the recording was missing, preventing scoring of a given item, that item was left unscored (missing value). To enhance scoring accuracy, once all items were scored, the evaluator reaudited the session to &#x0201c;double-check&#x0201d; any suboptimal ratings or missing values.</p><p>Using the modified MBRP-AC scale, therapist<italic> adherence</italic> was assessed by rating the following (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>): (A) key treatment components, itemized in a session-specific checklist (1 = present; 0 = absent); and (B) discussion of the four Key Concepts during the session (awareness of the current experience; acceptance of the current experience; acceptance versus aversion; acceptance and action) rated on a 0 (not explained) to 3 (completely explained) scale. Therapist<italic> competence</italic> was evaluated by rating the following (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>): (A) Therapist Style/Approach in general and in the four mindfulness-related competence areas (inquiry or ability to elicit feedback and respond to verbal and nonverbal feedback; attitude or ability to model and embody the spirit of mindfulness; use of key questions or extent to which they were used to elicit discussion about practices/experiences; use of clarifying questions or extent to which the therapist addressed and clarified ideas or misconceptions about MM), rated on a 1 (absence of the desired style/approach) to 5 (consistent presence of such style/approach) scale. (B) Overall Therapist Performance in terms of the quality of intervention delivery in four areas (the overall quality of the therapy during the session; therapist/researcher ability to work as a team; therapist ability to keep the session focused and on topic; and the overall quality of MM training delivery), rated on a 1 (not satisfactory) to 5 (excellent performance) scale.</p><p>The therapist received regular feedback from the PI, stemming from the direct observations, findings from the modified MBRP-AC scoring and participant feedback throughout the study to ensure protocol competence and adherence, and prevent &#x0201c;therapist drift.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6.4"><title>2.6.4. Treatment Receipt and Enactment</title><p>
<italic>Adherence to the intervention protocol</italic> was assessed among the MM group participants by their attendance at the intervention sessions (recorded by the research staff), completion of session-specific &#x0201c;homework&#x0201d; worksheets (discussed during a subsequent session), and participant reports (logs) of home MM practice. If a participant missed a session, they received a follow-up call from the study coordinator and offered a brief (approximately 15 minutes) in-person or by-phone meeting with the therapist prior to the next session to &#x0201c;catch up&#x0201d; and encourage continued attendance and home practice. To obtain data on home MM practice, the participants were provided with &#x0201c;calendar&#x0201d; log sheets and asked to log practice minutes daily during the MBRP-A course (with logs collected weekly) and, following the MBRP-A course, to log weekly the average number of days/week and minutes/day of formal practice, and number of days/week of brief, informal MM practice, with logs collected at the follow-up assessments. These data enabled calculation of the total number of minutes of formal and times of informal practice per week. Participants were encouraged to engage in a formal practice 6 days/week, 30 minutes/day, and in informal practice daily. Participant understanding of the taught concepts and techniques (treatment receipt), and skill application (treatment enactment) were assessed through the means of a therapist-led discussion during each session about participant questions, concerns, views, and experiences, including application of the MM skills to relapse prevention and participant engagement in home practice; practicing implementation of the taught skills in hypothetical high-risk situations during the sessions; and completion and review of skill-reinforcing worksheets.</p><p>
<italic>Treatment experience and satisfaction</italic> of the MM group participants were assessed at the last MBRP-A session by the Treatment Satisfaction Survey, developed by the research team and successfully implemented in our prior study [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The survey contained four questions rating a participant experience on an 11-point Likert scale (0 = &#x0201c;not likely at all/not important,&#x0201d; 10 = &#x0201c;very likely/very important&#x0201d;): (1) How important this meditation course has been to you?; (2) How useful this course has been in helping you maintain sobriety?; (3) How likely are you to continue a formal meditation practice in the future?; and (4) How likely are you to continue brief mindfulness practices in the future? At the 8-week follow-up, the MM participants also completed three Global Assessment of Treatment questions about their satisfaction with the received MBRP-A intervention (1&#x02013;7 Likert scale: 1 = &#x0201c;extremely dissatisfied,&#x0201d; 7 = &#x0201c;extremely satisfied&#x0201d;); change in their alcohol problem compared to preenrollment (1&#x02013;7 Likert scale: 1 = &#x0201c;very much worse,&#x0201d; 7 = &#x0201c;very much improved&#x0201d;); and helpfulness of the intervention for their alcohol problem (1&#x02013;5 Likert scale: 1 = &#x0201c;very helpful,&#x0201d; 5 = &#x0201c;not helpful, and has made things worse&#x0201d;). In addition, the participants were encouraged to report side effects/adverse events at each contact point.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2.7"><title>2.7.

Intervention Delivery Monitoring</title><sec id="sec3.2.1"><title>3.2.1. Therapist Adherence and Competence</title><p>Over the course of the study period, 10 MBRP-A intervention cohorts (eighty sessions altogether) were delivered; 77 of these sessions were delivered by the primary therapist (FL) and 3 by the back-up therapist (VGS). Each intervention cohort included from 5 (the smallest cohort) to 18 (the largest cohort) participants. Among the 59 control group participants, 53 completed their 26-week follow-up and were able to receive the MBRP-A intervention (wait-list controls); 37 of these individuals elected to receive the intervention and participated in the MBRP-A training.

A 100% adherence was achieved during nineteen audited sessions; 90% adherence during eleven sessions; 80% adherence during three sessions, and 70% adherence during two sessions, with lower adherence related to omitted key treatment components in Session 5 (Coping Cards, Mindful Walking in cohort 1) and Session 7 (Coping Cards, Coping Styles or Mindful Walking in cohorts 1, 5, 6, and 9). With corrective feedback, adherence increased to 90% for Session 5 in the subsequent cohorts and for Session 7 in the final cohort. Adherence to the Discussion of Key Concepts (rated on a 0&#x02013;3 Likert scale) was scored at 2.8 &#x000b1; 0.4 points, with the average scoring similar across the four domains (awareness of the current experience: 2.9 &#x000b1; 0.4; acceptance of the current experience: 2.7 &#x000b1; 0.5; acceptance versus aversion: 2.8 &#x000b1; 0.5; and acceptance and action: 2.9 &#x000b1; 0.4 points).

This participant was assessed by the PI who determined the symptoms did not raise concerns for safety. Worrisome symptoms displayed by two participants during the intervention session (they were noted by other session attendees to have a smell of alcohol, without appearing intoxicated) were deemed as unlikely to be intervention-related; following the study safety protocol, these participants were assessed by the PI for disposition.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>Treatment fidelity monitoring is essential to methodological rigor of clinical trials evaluating behavioral therapies, especially complex interventions, such as MBRP-A. However, procedures for monitoring and maintenance of treatment fidelity have been inconsistently applied, limiting the strength of such research. Following the recommendations of the NIH Behavior Change Consortium [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], the present study, a 26-week RCT, systematically implemented procedures for fidelity monitoring of the MBRP-A intervention tested for alcohol relapse prevention. The study intervention was rooted in both conceptual framework and clinical practice and followed a detailed manual, fine-tuned in pilot studies. The protocol-driven approach to therapist selection and training, and the incorporation of the methods to evaluate participant treatment receipt and enactment, increased confidence that the intervention was skillfully delivered and appropriately understood and applied by the participants. The assumption of skillful intervention delivery was corroborated by the findings stemming from the measurement of the therapist competence and adherence to the treatment protocol.</p><p>Use of the existing MBRP-AC scale [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], adapted to the needs of this study, enabled a structured approach to the assessment of therapist competence and adherence, integral elements of ensuring treatment integrity [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Quantification of therapist adherence and competence allowed us to identify early signs of therapist skill &#x0201c;drift&#x0201d; and, through corrective feedback, to resolve this unintended variation in intervention delivery. The original and the modified MBRP-AC scales could be applied, with adaptation, to other studies of behavioral interventions, especially those based on the MBRP model, to provide a rigorous monitoring of intervention delivery.</p><p>
<italic>Limitations</italic>. Several study design elements, which fall within the spectrum of treatment fidelity considerations, could impact our ability to draw conclusions from this study. Though self-reporting on alcohol consumption and MM home practice is the gold standard for this type of study [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], the use of self-reported data can introduce a reporting/recall bias [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], especially when the recall window includes an extended period of time, such as during the final study follow-up. Although the reliance on one primary therapist to deliver the study intervention limits the therapist effect, it also makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the generalizability of the intervention's efficacy, as it does not allow for a separation of the therapist-specific effect from the intervention effect, and the findings will be confounded by the therapist effect in this early-stage RCT.</p><p>
<italic>Future Research</italic>. Future research evaluating behavioral or behavior change interventions, including MM-based modalities, should strive to incorporate methods for treatment fidelity monitoring with respect to design, interventionist training, intervention delivery, receipt, and enactment. Although the specifics of a given study/intervention design as well as financial, personnel, and other constraints may determine which of the recommended procedures are appropriate and feasible, the development of treatment fidelity procedures should start during the study development stage.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5.
