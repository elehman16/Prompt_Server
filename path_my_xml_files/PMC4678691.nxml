Yet, there is only low-quality evidence on its effect on pain and function. This randomised controlled trial will investigate the effects of a theory-based SMT in rehabilitation of chronic (&#x0003e;3&#x000a0;months) non-specific low back pain (CNLBP) patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A pilot study with a parallel, single-blinded, randomised controlled design. Twenty adult patients referred to the clinic for CNLBP treatment will be included, randomised, and allocated to one of two groups. Each group will receive 9 x 30&#x000a0;minutes of standard physiotherapy (PT) treatment. The experimental group will receive an added 15&#x000a0;minutes of SMT. For SMT, proprioceptive postural exercises are performed on a labile platform with adjustable oscillation to provoke training effects on different entry levels. The active comparator group will perform 15&#x000a0;minutes of added sub-effective low-intensity endurance training. Outcomes are assessed on 4 time-points by a treatment blinded tester: eligibility assessment at baseline (BL) 2&#x02013;4 days prior to intervention, pre-intervention assessment (T0), post-intervention assessment (T1), and at 4&#x000a0;weeks follow-up (FU). At BL, an additional healthy control group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20) will be assessed to allow cross-sectional comparison with symptom-free participants. The main outcomes are self-reported pain (Visual Analogue Scale) and functional status (Oswestry Disability Index). For secondary analysis, postural control variables after an externally perturbed stance on a labile platform are analysed using a video-based marker tracking system and a pressure plate (sagittal joint-angle variability and centre of pressure confidence ellipse). Proprioception is measured as relative cervical joint repositioning error during a head-rotation task. Effect sizes and mixed-model MANOVA (2 groups&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;4 measurements for 5 dependent variables) will be calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first attempt to systematically investigate effects of a theory-based sensorimotor training in patients with CNLBP.

The State Secretariat for Economic Affairs in Switzerland has released corresponding numbers in the context of preventive measures for occupational settings. According to its author, 18&#x000a0;% of all employees in Switzerland have reported some form of work-related back pain accounting for 26&#x000a0;% of occupational absence with corresponding socio-economic consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although the bulk of the direct costs have been attributed to care by medical physicians and non-physicians, it is the indirect costs through absenteeism and social isolation that cause more than 80&#x000a0;% of health costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Hence, research promoting return to normal activity and prevention of chronicity of pain remains of great importance.</p><p>CNLBP persists for more than 12&#x000a0;weeks and cannot be attributed to a recognisable, known specific pathology (<italic>International Classification of Diseases</italic> (ICD) 54.5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Lack of variable sensorimotor input has been described as a contributing factor to the development of CNLBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In modern society, dynamic movements are becoming ever more neglected and repetitive tasks seem to dominate most of our activities. It has been well-established that occupations requiring prolonged periods of static standing are associated with development of musculoskeletal disorders including CNLBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Long-term monotonous afferent input is believed to impair the sensorimotor system; circuits regulating the appropriate amount of symmetric muscle force, needed to adapt the correct posture in any given situations, are thought to be disturbed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. If not restored, this constant malfunctioning of muscular control and regulation of dynamic movement may lead to inappropriate muscular activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and is thought to contribute to taut muscles, imbalanced muscle activation, poor posture, and ultimately to musculoskeletal pain in lumbar regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Consequently, neuromuscular rehabilitation techniques addressing sensory deficiencies have emerged in recent years and have received increasing therapeutic attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These techniques could broadly be summarised as sensorimotor training (SMT) methods aiming at increased proprioceptive input to improve motor response in dynamic environments. This might lead to improved quality of postural control, which in turn may alleviate postural specific musculoskeletal pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>There has been some doubt whether SMT can actually improve proprioceptive acuity in a functional way at all. In a recent review, Ashton-Miller et al. outlined a row of concerns (e.g. lack of neurophysiological evidence) about the validity of current proprioceptive exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Although many therapists and clinicians report successful treatment cases, the exact effect and validity of sensorimotor interventions is still discussed controversially [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Despite extensive research activity on the topic of CNLBP, which has significantly contributed to the understanding of pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], the European guidelines on the management of CNLBP conclude that the effects of specific exercises, such as SMT, must be further evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study is to compare the effects of SMT on pain and functional status with sub-effective low-intensity training (SLIT) in patients with CNLBP: Is a sensorimotor training added to physiotherapy (PT) more effective than physiotherapy with added sub-effective low-intensity training regarding pain and functional status in patients with non-specific low back pain? It is first hypothesised that functional status and self-reported pain will reduce significantly in both groups, but the SMT group will show significantly more improvement when compared to SLIT.</p><p>With novel methods available, it has become possible to quantitatively analyse the influence of pain on postural control strategies. Using the uncontrolled manifold approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], this study has the secondary aim to describe how much compensatory variability is being applied to maintain the postural control during perturbed stance and whether proprioceptive integration improves with SMT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethics and reporting</title><p>The study protocol follows the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement on randomised trials of non-pharmacological treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidance for protocol reporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

This was used as a quasi-sham [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] to control time spent with therapist.</p><p>There is a wide variety of ways in which SMT can be performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. For this study, proprioceptive postural training (PPT) will be applied using the neuro-orthopaedic therapy device Posturomed (Haider Bioswing GmbH, Pullenreuth, Germany). The Posturomed consists of a labile platform, with adjustable damped swaying behaviour. Mediolateral and anteroposterior sway are increased when the two damping brakes, one at the front and one at the back, are released. This allows three specific configurations with increasing levels of instability. The Posturomed is used for therapy, but has also been used for assessment of postural control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In contrast to most proprioceptive training devices, the exercise plan for PPT is clearly defined, quickly explained to the patient and easily understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>Taking part in the study will not affect the patient&#x02019;s prescribed treatment plan but PPT will not be part of the PT sessions. Other than that, the study protocol does not dictate the PT content or restrict any concomitant care. Detailed documentation of provided treatments will be recorded on therapy documentation sheets. Interventions are described in detail according to the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> on page 5.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Description of study interventions based on the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Item</th><th>Experimental group</th><th>Control group</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1. Brief name</td><td>Sensorimotor training</td><td>Low-intensity cardiovascular training</td></tr><tr><td>2. Why?</td><td>Sensorimotor control is believed to be impaired in chronic non-specific low back pain. PPT is a well- defined SMT method with standardised applications. PPT is indicated for postural specific back pain, functional instability of weight-bearing joints (e.g. knee or ankle instability), hypermobility, and other postural deficiencies</td><td>Physical activity at low intensity for only 15&#x000a0;minutes is not expected to induce a specific treatment effect to the sensorimotor system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] but can improve the global perception of well-being and can, therefore, be recommended as part of CNLBP treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>3. What materials?</td><td>PPT uses the Posturomed therapy device [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], which is a labile platform restricted to damped anterior-posterior and mediolateral sway. Patients will receive an exercise diary to record adherence and progress</td><td>Cardio-exercise machines: elliptical cross-trainer, treadmill, stationary bike-ergometer. Patients will receive an exercise diary to record adherence and progress.</td></tr><tr><td>4. What procedures?</td><td>Nine therapy sessions, each lasting 15&#x000a0;minutes. Therapy instructions advise seven stages of difficulty. On all stages the patient is asked to provoke oscillation by stepping on site. After 3 steps, the patient must stand still on 1 leg for 2&#x000a0;seconds before he or she repeats the steps. Difficulty is increased by a) decreasing the damping through release of the breaks and b) through added juggling of a ball during the motor task and trunk rotation (dual-task and divided attention). The next stage is reached once stabilisation in the previous stage is secured. The exercise is repeated for as many times as it can be performed adequately without losing balance. The moment where sensory depletion is observed by the supervising therapist, the exercise is interrupted. The exercise should be repeated for approximately 15&#x000a0;minutes</td><td>Nine therapy sessions, each lasting 15&#x000a0;minutes. Choosing either the treadmill, elliptical cross-trainer, or a stationary bike, the patient will be instructed and positioned according to body constitution. Next, patients will be asked to begin the exercise at a comfortable pace where speaking is still possible (Borg scale 6&#x02013;9) and to maintain this intensity for 15&#x000a0;minutes</td></tr><tr><td>5. Who provides?</td><td>Physiotherapists trained in PPT</td><td>Physiotherapists and sport scientists</td></tr><tr><td>6. How?</td><td colspan="2">Both intervention groups will receive initial instruction by a therapist.

Where?</td><td colspan="2">Both interventions will be performed in the medical training centre for physical exercise within the clinic</td></tr><tr><td>8. When and how much?</td><td colspan="2">During the 4.5-week intervention program, patients will receive the same allocation of 9 sessions for 15&#x000a0;minutes each (twice a week).

It is based on the assumption that the central nervous system (CNS) does not control each degree of freedom (DOF) individually but rather selects a subspace of lower dimensionality (a manifold) that corresponds to a value of a performance variable that needs to be stabilised (i.e. centre of mass, COM). When a task is repeatedly analysed, the variance of the control variables (i.e. joint angles) across the attempts can be partitioned into two components: parallel and orthogonal to the UCM. As shown by Sholz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], the variance of the performance variable COM orthogonal to the UCM is usually smaller as compared to the variance parallel to it when standing in response to surface perturbation. In other words, the CNS allows relatively high variability of control variables (joint angles) as long as this variability does not cause the COM to move further away from its steady state prior to perturbation. Basically, a UCM spans a subspace consisting of all joint angles that support fast return to stability. Joint angle configurations that lie orthogonal to the UCM lead to a deviation from this stable condition and, therefore, affect the controlled variable. The relation of both subspace values to one another will be reported as the UCM-Index. For detailed description of the application refer to Scholz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Proprioception</title><p>To assess conscious proprioceptive acuity, cervical joint repositioning error (C-JRE) will be measured. C-JRE is defined here as the relative error of a blindfolded replication of a verbally instructed head position at 0&#x000b0;, 30&#x000b0;, and 60&#x000b0; in the horizontal plane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Measurement set-up</title><p>The experimental set-up consists of a labile platform (Posturomed 202, Haider Bioswing, Pullenreuth, Germany), an attached provocation module with manual 3-cm deflection (Haider Bioswing GmbH, Pullenreuth, Germany), 2 high-speed cameras (Basler acA165-uc &#x02013;-Basler AG, Ahrensburg, Germany), a personal computer with a Windows 8 (Microsoft Inc., Redmond, WA, USA) operating system to which both cameras are attached over a USB3.0 cable, a motion analysis software (Templo v.8.2, Contemplas GmbH, Kempten, Germany), an accelerometer attached to the base plate of the Posturomed, and optical markers to measure segmental joint angle variation and joint motion. For the C-JRE task, a custom 1-size lightweight helmet with an attached laser pointer and retro-reflecting markers was developed. For each head position (&#x02212;60&#x000b0;, &#x02212;30&#x000b0;, 0&#x000b0;, +30&#x000b0;, +60&#x000b0; rotation) a vertical mark is fixed to a screen facing the subject. Video-based analysis of the joint-angle and marker-position deviation will be conducted. The camera will track the reflecting markers with a spatial resolution of 1024 x 760&#x000a0;pixels and a temporal resolution of 100 frames per second, which has shown to suffice for the purposes of the analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The algorithms to track the 15.9-mm reflective markers are included in the motion analysis software. Marker configuration follows the proposed scheme by Scholz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] with nine sagittal markers (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) and additional two frontal markers to record shoulder girdle and hip girdle lateral flexion and mediolateral translation: at the corner of the eye, the mastoid process, shoulder (acromion), hip (greater trochanter and anterior superior iliac spine), knee (lateral femoral condyle), ankle (lateral malleolus), toe, heel and the platform surface. For calibration purposes, fixed geometrical objects with known metrics and fixed angles will be placed onto the labile platform and recorded in the frontal and sagittal plane. Coordinate data of each reflective marker will be filtred at 5&#x000a0;Hz using a bi-directional, second-order, Butterworth digital filter in Matlab<sup>TM</sup> version R2014b (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Finally, COP is recorded using the zebris FDM-S pressure plate (60&#x000a0;Hz) (zebris Medical GmbH, Isny im Allg&#x000e4;u, Germany), which is placed on top of the swaying platform.

Wearing a visual deprivation mask and the laser-pointer helmet, the participants will then be verbally instructed to rotate their head slowly. Using the position of the laser on the prepared screen with the marked angles, the assessor guides the participant to reach the target position. This position is held for 15&#x000a0;seconds and subsequently replicated 5 times. Participants are instructed to push a button fixed to the chair when they feel confident to have reached the original position. This will set a marker at the time point during the recording where the participant felt closest to the initially instructed position and is repeated for every angle. The sequence of angles is randomised prior to the test.</p><p>To assess postural control, the patient will first be asked to stand on the platform to familiarise themselves with the surface&#x02019;s behaviour before the platform will be fixed to its deflected position (3&#x000a0;cm posterior). Then the patient will be instructed to adopt an upright posture with arms folded across the chest. On the cue &#x02018;ready-steady-go&#x02019;, the assessor will release the platform from its deflection. Two familiarisation trials will be performed prior to measurement. The swaying will be recorded in sync with the COP and video for 10&#x000a0;seconds (3&#x000a0;seconds prior to pertubation and 7&#x000a0;seconds after perturbation) and repeated 5 times. All of the device&#x02019;s damping brakes will be released for this test to allow maximal sway and provoke the postural control response.</p><p>The setup was pilot-tested in order to define optimal settings for the recording (e.g. light, camera distance, marker-repositioning).

Applying the results of these studies to a sample size calculation with an alpha value of 5&#x000a0;% and the desired power 80&#x000a0;%, it is expected that 10 patients per arm would suffice to reveal group differences and to detect change.</p><p>Considering these findings and taking into account the explorative approach of this trial, a total number of 40 to 50 participants is planned, including 20 healthy controls for BL-comparison.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Baseline comparability of both groups will be inspected for primary and secondary parameters.

Non-normal distributed data will be analysed with non-parametric methods.</p><p>Intention-to-treat analyses will be performed. If necessary, an additional per protocol analysis will be carried out.

As shown in a recent systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the justification of SMT in pain rehabilitation is highly questionable from an evidence-based perspective. Moreover, there are no recommendations for dose, frequency or intensity of SMT at which training effects could be expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. With no standardised recommendations regarding its implementation, SMT studies present large practical heterogeneity and can barely be compared systematically. Hence, it remains a vastly under-examined intervention for pain rehabilitation. There is still need for clinical parameters that are sensitive enough to capture small changes in movement behaviour that are expected to improve after or are indicative for SMT.</p><p>As the aim of chronic pain treatment should be to make the patient feel better and increase quality of life, from a clinical perspective, the most important outcome is the self-reported pain and functional limitations in daily activities. If these outcomes do not improve, the treatment should be adapted to tackle other modalities of pain development. Moreover, pain may change irrespective of the change of the aspect of physical functioning targeted by the intervention (i.e. sensorimotor control) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. However, to make a clinically informed decision, it is necessary to know whether symptom development is related to the intervention receiving most attention during the therapy.</p><p>One challenge in SMT evaluation lies in the choice of an appropriate parameter to measure change over time or compare different populations. Change could occur at any one level of the complex neural pathway involved in the regulation of peripheral sensory integration. In previous low back pain-related intervention studies, SMT has been assessed using joint repositioning sense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], COP for postural sway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and neurophysiological measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. While JRE only tests one aspect of a single joint involved in the muscle chain of postural control, COP only tests the summation of all joints involved and cannot be dissected to show each segment&#x02019;s contribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. In a reductionist approach, neurophysiological assessments allow investigation of the functions, or dysfunctions, of key elements involved in any given task (e.g. evoked potentials or synaptic activities at neuromuscular junctions and their pathways). Accumulated information of these elements is used to interpret the overlying, more complex system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. However, as pointed out by Latash et al., the &#x02018;function of a complex system cannot be understood through its structure and the properties of its elements&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Following this notion, one of this study&#x02019;s purposes is not to analyse the effect of chronic pain on individual elements, but rather to examine the dynamic strategies adopted by patients with CNLBP to integrate sensory input when controlling COM under perturbed stance conditions.</p><p>The relationship of pain and changes in motor control has been shown in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] and is seen as a protective reaction of the body to limit provocation of the painful area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The proposed dynamic analysis setup with anticipated perturbation will allow investigation of segmental behaviour at any given moment during stance and allow description of each segment&#x02019;s contribution to the control of COM when recovering stability. This is an important aspect to not only understand the variability of postural control observed when comparing CNLBP patients with a pain-free population sample, but also to explain within-group variability of COM parameters. Understanding this aspect may help to better target faulty movement strategies and describe its part in underlying mechanisms of pain development.</p><p>A challenging limitation of the presented study is going to be the interpretation of the magnitude of variability. Being a relatively young field of research within human kinetics, there are not sufficient findings to describe the optimal amount of variability needed to maintain healthy posture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. It is yet to be elicited which degree of variability is necessary to remain adaptive toward external and internal perturbations and at which threshold variability causes deviation from the task&#x02019;s individual goal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Relating joint configurations parallel to the manifold and joint configuration perpetual to the manifold (i.e. UCM-Index) offers a potential evaluation of individual movement quality. As the former causes the COM to return to the point before perturbation while the latter describes the amount of joint configurations causing deflection from initial COM position, a high index would be desirable. Provided the setup proves to be robust enough to record sensitive changes after postural specific SMT and differences across population, a large-scale clinical trial with large sample sizes for both groups could be conducted to identify optimal levels of both components during postural control. This would also allow subgroup-analysis; it is widely accepted that subgroups of patients with CNLBP exist, e.g. with or without movement control impairments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] or with different risk profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. The population included may have a variety of different causes for their pain. Hence, function or postural control will not necessarily improve when pain does and vice versa. However, due to its explorative nature, this trial has a limited sample size which would not allow subgrouping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p><p>A general limitation to therapeutic trials involving exercise is the limited possibilities to blind the patients from knowing the experimental arm. This is particularly problematic in studies where subjective pain measures are evaluated. To reduce the risk of detection bias, all assessors and data analysts will be blinded to the intervention allocation.</p><p>To allow comparability of the conventional PT, a detailed documentation of all exercises and treatment applied during a session will be recorded. However, as the study includes outpatients, it is not controlled regarding what kind of leisurely activities and possible exercises are conducted. In this sense, co-interventions cannot be controlled.</p><p>If proven feasible and effective, the study will provide an objective, quantifiable and sensitive clinical assessments and a standardised procedure for SMT to implement in a large-scale study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is currently recruiting patients and will require 12&#x02013;14 months to complete all follow-up assessments.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AUC</term><def><p>area under curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BL</term><def><p>baseline assessment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>C-JRE</term><def><p>cervical joint repositioning error</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CEA</term><def><p>confidence-ellipse area</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CNLBP</term><def><p>chronic non-specific low back pain</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CNS</term><def><p>central nervous system</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COM</term><def><p>centre of mass</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CONSORT</term><def><p>Consolidated Items of Reporting Trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COP</term><def><p>centre of pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DOF</term><def><p>degrees of freedom</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EC</term><def><p>Ethics Committee</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FU</term><def><p>follow-up assessment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICD</term><def><p><italic>International Classification of Diseases</italic></p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MANOVA</term><def><p>multivariate analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ME</term><def><p>measurement event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ODI</term><def><p>Oswestry Disability Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PPT</term><def><p>proprioceptive postural training</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PT</term><def><p>physiotherapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SEA</term><def><p>standard-ellipse area</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SeMoPoP</term><def><p>SensoriMotor training and Postural control in Pain rehabilitation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SLIT</term><def><p>sub-effective low-intensity training</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SMT</term><def><p>sensorimotor training</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SPIRIT</term><def><p>Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T0</term><def><p>pre-intervention assessment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T1</term><def><p>post-intervention assessment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TIDieR</term><def><p>Template for Intervention Description and Replication</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UCM</term><def><p>uncontrolled manifold</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p>visual analogue scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>MM, EB, BW, and CS developed the research question under MM&#x02019;s lead.
