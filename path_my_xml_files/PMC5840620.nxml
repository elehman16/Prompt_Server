<bold>Background</bold>: Despite high coverage of indoor interventions like insecticide-treated nets, mosquito-borne infections persist, partly because of outdoor-biting, early-biting and insecticide-resistant vectors. Push-pull systems, where mosquitoes are repelled from humans and attracted to nearby lethal targets, may constitute effective complementary interventions.</p><p>
<bold>Methods</bold>: A partially randomized cross-over design was used to test efficacy of push-pull in four experimental huts and four local houses, in an area with high pyrethroid resistance in Tanzania. The push-pull system consisted of 1.1% or 2.2% w/v transfluthrin repellent dispensers and an outdoor lure-and-kill device (odour-baited mosquito landing box). Matching controls were set up without push-pull. Adult male volunteers collected mosquitoes attempting to bite them outdoors, but collections were also done indoors using exit traps in experimental huts and by volunteers in the local houses. The collections were done hourly (1830hrs-0730hrs) and mosquito catches compared between push-pull and controls.
<italic>An. gambiae</italic> s.l. and
<italic>An. funestus</italic> s.l. were assessed by PCR to identify sibling species, and ELISA to detect
<italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> and blood meal sources.</p><p>
<bold>Results</bold>: Push-pull in experimental huts reduced outdoor-biting for
<italic>An. arabiensis</italic> and
<italic>Mansonia </italic>species by 30% and 41.5% respectively. However, the reductions were marginal and insignificant for
<italic>An. funestus</italic> (12.2%; p&#x0003e;0.05) and
<italic>Culex</italic> (5%; p&#x0003e;0.05). Highest protection against all species occurred before 2200hrs. There was no significant difference in number of mosquitoes inside exit traps in huts with or without push-pull. In local households, push-pull significantly reduced indoor and outdoor-biting of
<italic>An. arabiensis</italic> by 48% and 25% respectively, but had no effect on other species.</p><p>
<bold>Conclusion</bold>: This push-pull system offered modest protection against outdoor-biting
<italic>An. arabiensis</italic>, without increasing indoor mosquito densities. Additional experimentation is required to assess how transfluthrin-based products affect mosquito blood-feeding and mortality in push-pull contexts. This approach, if optimised, could potentially complement existing malaria interventions even in areas with high pyrethroid resistance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>push-pull system</kwd><kwd>early-biting and outdoor-biting mosquitoes</kwd><kwd>malaria protection</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440"><funding-source>Wellcome Trust</funding-source><award-id>102350</award-id><award-id>106356</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust [106356], Masters Fellowship in Public Health with the Association of Physicians of Great Britain and Ireland to ASM, and [102350], Intermediate Research Fellowship awarded to FOO.</funding-statement><funding-statement><italic>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</italic></funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Preventing human exposure to infectious mosquitoes is a crucial approach towards controlling the spread of mosquito-borne infections in Africa. Between 2000 and 2015, insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) reduced malaria prevalence by 68% and 10%, respectively, among 2&#x02013;10 year-olds in Africa
<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. In Tanzania, there was a national decline of malaria prevalence from 10% in 2008 to 9.5% in 2012, mostly due to widespread use of ITNs and IRS, but also improved treatments and diagnosis of the disease. However, there appears that there has been a minor resurgence in malaria, according to a current national prevalence report, stated at 14.8%
<sup><xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. It is expected that ongoing efforts, including the most recent LLIN universal coverage campaign completed in 2016, will improve the situation.</p><p>Despite the improved malaria vector control investments in recent years, endemic countries still face various challenges. Examples include the increasing outdoor-biting and early-biting mosquito behaviours, which limit efficacy of ITNs and IRS, both of which primarily target indoor-biting mosquitoes
<sup><xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Another challenge is the widespread insecticide resistance in major vector populations
<sup><xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. To address early-biting, outdoor-biting and insecticide-resistant mosquitoes, there is a need for simple and low-cost approaches applicable even in rural and remote areas. Fortunately, there have been many recent advances and several promising new products have been developed that aim to reduce outdoor-biting, which could be optimized
<sup><xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. These include area-wide mosquito repellents, also called spatial repellents, such as transfluthrin-treated materials
<sup><xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, and odour-baited mosquito-control devices, such as mosquito landing box (MLB), which have been demonstrated to reduce vector densities and survival
<sup><xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Related interventions that may also mitigate insecticide resistance include traps with electrocuting grids
<sup><xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, mosquito-killing fungi, such as
<italic>Metarhizium anisopliae</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, and combination of insecticides with different modes of action
<sup><xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Personal protection with repellents also prevents outdoor-bites but are affected by poor compliance among users
<sup><xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. In some circumstances, repellents do prevent outdoor bites but may divert mosquitoes from protected to unprotected individuals
<sup><xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.</p><p>Push-pull systems could be another solution against early-biting, outdoor-biting and resistant vectors, by repelling host-seeking mosquitoes from humans and luring them towards killing stations, using species-specific lures. Such approaches have been used effectively in integrated pest management in agriculture, where behaviour-modifying stimuli are deployed to manipulate and reduce pest populations
<sup><xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Similar systems were demonstrated to reduce malaria vector biting by 95% under controlled semi-field conditions in Western Kenya
<sup><xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>.</p><p>We conducted a small-scale field experiment to assess the efficacy of a simple push-pull strategy, consisting of evaporated transfluthrin and odour-baited lure-and-kill stations, all set in peri-domestic spaces, against early-biting, outdoor-biting pyrethroid-resistant malaria mosquitoes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study area</title><p>The study was conducted in Lupiro village, in the plains of the Kilombero valley, approximately 30km from Ifakara town, in south-eastern Tanzania (

The system consisted of an effective spatial repellent (transfluthrin), and an odour-baited lure-and-kill device (mosquito landing box (MLB)), fitted with low-cost electrocuting grids
<sup><xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. The transfluthrin was dispersed from ten polyester strips measuring 1 &#x000d7; 25cm, which were cut out of untreated polyester net (Safi net, A to Z Textile Mills Ltd, Arusha, Tanzania), as recently described
<sup><xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. These strips were then soaked in 1.1% of transfluthrin stock solution diluted in ethanol for 30 minutes and then suspended in the odour-dispensing section of the modified MLB

Two repellent active emanators (push) were set 5m away from the pull device outside the treatment huts. One volunteer sat between push and pull subunits, and performed human landing catches (HLC)
<sup><xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. This volunteer was close to where people would normally be sitting in the evening, which was within 5m of the hut. A second person was located indoors under an untreated bed net to act as bait. The pull device (i.e. the MLB) was placed 10m away from the hut, but approximately 8m from push subunits (repellent dispensers) and a volunteer sitting in the peri-domestic space conducting HLC. Mosquitoes were also collected in the exit traps in the huts. Control huts also had volunteers but no push-pull units (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). All mosquito collections were done between 1800 and 0700 hours, for 30 minutes each hour. The volunteer pairs were rotated nightly between the control and treatment huts to minimize any bias due to difference in individual attractiveness. The experiment was conducted over 16 nights, working 4 nights/week, then the intervention and control huts were interchanged, and the test repeated for another 16 nights.</p><p>The main outcome measure in this experiment was number of mosquitoes of different species attempting to bite humans outdoors, and number collected indoors in the exit traps. We also assessed differences of indoor catches between treatment and control huts to estimate diversion due to the push-pull subunits outdoors.</p></sec><sec><title>Field-testing the efficacy of push-pull in local households</title><p>This activity was similar to first one, but was conducted in actual households in the study village. Four houses, at least 100m apart were selected and the experiment done for 16 nights, working 4 nights per week. Two of the houses were allocated as treatment (with push-pull subunits) and the other two were controls (without push-pull subunits). The four houses had two occupants, four open eave spaces, two screened windows, and corrugated iron roof. The mosquito sampling rooms had one window, approximately 1m
<sup>2</sup>, with walls. There were two male volunteers assigned per house: one was conducting HLC inside and the other outside for 30minutes each hour. The volunteer pairs were rotated between treatment and control houses.</p><p>The following changes were introduced based on lessons from the first experiment: 1) amount of transfluthrin was doubled to 2.3% w/v (180mg transfluthrin dissolved into 8ml 70% ethanol) to increase repellence strength; 2) distance between the odour-baited MLB and human was increased to 10m to reduce the possibility of the MLB increasing mosquitoes close to human volunteer; and 3) CO
<sub>2</sub> from yeast-sugar fermentation was replaced with industrial CO
<sub>2</sub> at 230ml/min, thereby ensuring consistent flow throughout the night.

Mosquito catches were modelled as a function of fixed factors: 1) volunteer positions (inside or outside) and treatment (with or without push-pull), combined as a single variable; 2) location; and 3) volunteer pairs. Sampling night and experimental rounds were included as random variables to account for natural heterogeneity in the data. Mosquito hourly catches (only females) were pooled by species for each nightly catches. Four interactions were created: Interaction-1 (control*outdoor), Interaction-2 (control*indoor), Interaction-3 (push-pull*indoor) and Interaction-4 (push-pull*outdoor). Interaction-1 was used as reference for measuring mosquito bite prevention between controls outdoor against push-pull outdoor, while interaction-2 was used as reference for measuring mosquito diversion from outdoors where push-pull subunits were towards indoors in the treatment sites compared to controls.</p><p>Mosquito hourly data were summarized into cumulative catches caught at specified night periods, early night (1900&#x02013;2200 hours), midnight period (2300&#x02013;0400 hours) and early morning (0500&#x02013;0700 hours). The hourly data were also pooled to obtain nightly average mosquito densities for each location and treatment. Laboratory mosquito data were counted, and summarized using descriptive statistics by calculating proportions and percentage of mosquito species identified, proportions with different host blood meal and sporozoite ELISA detection rates.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Volunteers participating in the study were adequately informed of the study objectives, potential benefits and potential risks, after which written informed consent was obtained.

Neither the placement of the push-pull subunits, the distances between these units nor the distances from the individual experimental houses had been previously tested. Instead, we selected a configuration most representative of expected use cases.</p><p>Overall, this study demonstrated that the push-pull system, in the configuration tested here, reduced host-seeking mosquito landings on volunteers sitting outdoors, without increasing any biting risk indoors. Most of the protection was observed against
<italic>An. arabiensis</italic>, and there was a very minimal effect against
<italic>An. funestus,</italic> which recently has been shown to be the most dominant malaria vector in the study area, despite occurring in relatively low numbers
<sup><xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. The selection of candidate attractants and repellents was based on evidence from previous studies on efficacy of various candidates. For example, an earlier study in Tanzania demonstrated that transfluthrin can prevent &#x0003e; 80% of mosquito bites over 20 metres (medium range) by actively emanating a repellent from an odour-dispenser section of the existing odour-baited mosquito landing box
<sup><xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. By combining this active repellent dispenser with affordable lure-and-kill technologies
<sup><xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, we intended to create a simple push-pull system offering peri-domestic protection to complement existing strategies, such as LLINs. Though the efficacy was only modest, it is an important outcome, given the study area was characterised by widespread pyrethroid resistance
<sup><xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Indeed, stimuli-diversionary approaches, such as tested here, could potentially slow the spread of insecticide resistance, since they have two components that concurrently target vectors differently.</p><p>The efficacy of push-pull system was greater against
<italic>An. arabiensis</italic> compared to
<italic>An. funestus</italic> landings. A similar observation had been seen in previous studies when either push or pull subunits was tested separately against these mosquito species
<sup><xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Paliga
<italic>et al.</italic> has also recently demonstrated marginal effects of transfluthrin on
<italic>An. funestus</italic> in a study where
<italic>An. arabiensis</italic> were significantly repelled
<sup><xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. This suggests that this mosquito species may be unresponsive to the repellent effects of transfluthrin at the doses used in these studies. Though we did not investigate potential causes of these differential effects on the two species, we hypothesise that it may have been due to differences in levels of insecticide resistance in these species, and differences in feeding and resting behaviours exhibited by these two mosquito species made them respond differently to the push subunits. For example,
<italic>An. funestus</italic> are highly anthropophilic and endophilic vectors
<sup><xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. Together with their resistance to pyrethroids (which potentially confers cross-resistance to transfluthrin), this could make the mosquitoes still bite humans despite airborne transfluthrin. This was not the case for
<italic>An. arabiensis,</italic> which exhibit a wide range of behavioural responses, both biting and resting, making them avoid treated areas and chose different hosts when humans are protected
<sup><xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. Both feeding and resting behaviours might be the reason, which also made these mosquitoes respond differently with our push-pull system. It is well known that less anthropophilic mosquitoes are repelled at lower doses of repellents than highly anthropophilic vectors
<sup><xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>.</p><p>In previous semi-field tests, the MLB fitted with low-cost electrocuting grids situated at medium range from a human volunteer successfully reduced outdoor densities of host-seeking
<italic>An. arabiensis</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. The modest biting protection offered by our push-pull system against primary malaria vectors is very crucial, especially in rural villages where people spend early night period outdoor and indoor conducting various activities. These times coincide with most domestic activities, such as cooking, washing dishes, and storytelling outdoors
<sup><xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. The system also reduced indoor densities and outdoor nuisance bites of
<italic>Culex</italic> and
<italic>Mansonia</italic> mosquitoes; hence there could be potential against arbovirus vectors or nuisance mosquitoes. Prevention of nuisance bites is also essential because it increases compliance with an intervention if users perceive a benefit
<sup><xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>.</p><p>When data were analysed to depict nightly patterns, there was a slight reduction of bites from different mosquito species caught in each night periods, early night, midnight and early morning. There were a high number of mosquitoes caught in early night hours (1900 to 2200 hours) when humans are often active either indoors or outdoors. The protective efficacy of the system during early night outdoors was better seen against malaria vectors than for non-malaria mosquitoes. This protection is important because the system offered protection to people before they sleep under the bed net, thus covering mosquito-bite protection gap against early-biting, outdoor-biting species. From a personal protection point of view, it is this time of night when the complementary value of the push-pull system is most relevant. Early-biting and outdoor-biting mosquitoes, which remain a major challenge to malaria control
<sup><xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, can be controlled by using many additional interventions including push-pull system to target these subpopulations.</p><p>During this small-scale field evaluation of the efficacy of the push-pull system in local household settings, mosquito hourly data were summarized into nightly catches as in the previous huts experiments. The push-pull system in local households showed modest but lower protection against outdoor mosquito landings compared to that obtained during the experimental huts evaluations. This might be due to various reasons: first, the system was affected by the presence and movements of household members outdoors during early hours of night, which may have influenced mosquito densities; secondly, the number of mosquitoes caught during households experiment were lower than the ones collected in experimental huts settings, which limited the statistical power to discriminate effects of push-pull. However, the system significantly reduced mosquito landing and created a diversion effect against
<italic>An. arabiensis</italic> mosquitoes, but not against
<italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes.</p><p>The lower-than-anticipated protective efficacy of push-pull system seen during both experimental huts and local household settings might also have been due other aspects. While we are unable to clearly identify the main reason, future optimization of the push-pull configurations and the sub-units may identify the critical points for improvement. Nonetheless we hypothesise that the lower efficacy may have been associated with the pull sub-unit (the odour-baited MLB) attracting and not killing large numbers of diverted mosquitoes, perhaps due to lower mosquito population density present in the village during the study period, than in the previous study
<sup><xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. In addition, presence of consistent CO
<sub>2</sub> release from the MLB may have increased numbers of mosquitoes in the area, and as a result reduced observable effect of the push-pull. Further experiments will be required to determine whether the use of additional CO
<sub>2</sub> sources in push-pull systems have negative effects on overall perfomance.</p><p>A recent push-pull field study has indicated that there was no additional protection offered by a pull subunit, which was an odour baited device, implying that efficacy of push-pull system is primarily depended on push subunits
<sup><xref rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. This might have been due to long-range attractants that were used in the MLB, bringing large numbers of mosquitoes close to the households, which were not killed by the device. This indicates that overall communal level protections against mosquito-bites will be seen if the device will be used for the long period of time among many households
<sup><xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. Achieving such gains will require that the number and orientation of push and pull subunits are optimized to increase the efficacy of the system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Even with a non-optimised push-pull system set in a peri-domestic area, there was modest protection against early-biting and outdoor-biting
<italic>Anopheles arabiensis</italic>, without any increase in indoor mosquito densities. This approach concurrently used two different interventions (lure-and-kill stations and spatial repellents). Low protective efficacy offered by the system against different mosquitoes species suggest a need to do further optimization of the system. Optimal orientation of the subunits, configuration of distance and number of push and pull subunits and dose response studies of the repellent efficacy in a high throughput system such as semi-field system, are some of the characteristics that could be varied to improve efficacy push-pull for malaria prevention. Though we observed no increase in indoor biting risk as a result of push-pull, additional measurements are also needed to be assured that the system is able to offer communal level protection without diverting mosquitoes to non-users both outdoors and indoors. Besides, the variations in protective efficacy of the system between different mosquito species emphasize the need to understand species-specific behavioural responses to spatial repellents and attractants to optimize push-pull systems. Additional experimentation is required to assess how transfluthrin-based products would affect feeding inhibition and mortality of mosquitoes in such push-pull systems. Overall, this approach, if optimised could potentially complement existing malaria interventions even in areas with high pyrethroid resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Data availability</title><p>Data set used to generate these findings are available at Ifakara Health Institute data repository: doi,

This paper is one of very few attempts to evaluate such a system on vectors of medical importance. The set up for such work is generally noisier than similar approaches for agricultural pests, yet the group has returned with positive&#x000a0;results. Congratulations!</p><p>
<bold>Major comment</bold>:</p><p> It is important to make clear whom is being protected from mosquito bites in the outdoor environment. By definition this is the protected resource that is being made unattractive or unsuitable to the mosquitoes. The pull and the push sub-units can then be oriented appropriately to evaluate the protective effect of the push-pull system on the outdoor target. In this way we can reach a firmer conclusion on the protective efficacy of push-pull on averting mosquito bites from&#x000a0;(unprotected) humans present outdoors. A&#x000a0;closer scrutiny of the current set up seems to evaluate the effect of push-pull on protecting indoor sleepers only. The&#x000a0;manuscript needs to be revised accordingly if my assessment is correct. I suggest that the authors consult Cook et al. (2007)

The number of repetitions, the rotating of mosquito collectors and of treatments, the biostatistical rigor, and the fielding of the system in a real-word setting, were all particular strengths of the study. Well done!</p><p> One general comment:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>I think the experimental setup is quite novel in that both the push and pull components are located in the peri-domestic space &#x02013; a deeper discussion of this novelty, and how results might be compared to other systems that have been reported where the SR is deployed indoors, would be useful. Also, how do these results compare to other push-pull evaluations done with other endo/exophilic vector species from other parts of the world?</p></list-item></list> &#x000a0;</p><p> Some specific comments include:
