We aimed to study the clinical influence of focused ultrasound of the pleural cavities and inferior vena cava (IVC) performed by specialised nurses to assess volume status in HF patients at an outpatient clinic.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>HF outpatients were prospectively included and underwent laboratory testing, history recording and clinical examination by two nurses with and without an ultrasound examination of the pleural cavities and IVC using a pocket-size imaging device, in random order. Each nurse worked in a team with a cardiologist. The influence of the different diagnostic tests on diuretic dosing was assessed descriptively and in linear regression analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Sixty-two patients were included and 119 examinations were performed. Mean&#x000b1;SD age was 74&#x000b1;12&#x02005;years, EF was 34&#x000b1;14%, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) value was 3761&#x000b1;3072&#x02005;ng/L. Dosing of diuretics differed between the teams in 31 out of 119 consultations. Weight change and volume status assessed clinically with and without ultrasound predicted dose adjustment of diuretics at follow-up (p&#x0003c;0.05). Change of oedema, NT-proBNP, creatinine, and symptoms did not (p&#x02265;0.10).

<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Hyper- and hypovolaemia may lead to decompensated HF and organ failure caused by inadequate perfusion.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Traditionally, the cornerstone of the patient&#x02019;s volume status assessment in the outpatient HF clinic is the evaluation of symptoms, monitoring of weight and peripheral oedema, and blood tests including creatinine and natriuretic peptides, but these are neither sensitive nor specific with respect to detecting volume status.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;10</xref> Ultrasound (US) is a sensitive and specific tool to estimate volume status, by assessment of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and the pleural cavities, and may have a crucial influence.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;14</xref> The development of high quality, low cost pocket-size imaging devices (PSID) has promoted diagnostic US by non-experts.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;17</xref> It is not known if the PSIDs could be used as a tool for monitoring volume status and guiding treatment in HF patients. We have recently shown that specialised nurses in an HF clinic can perform point of care US for quantification of pleural effusion and the dimension and inspiratory collapsibility of the IVC, with a high agreement with cardiologists using high-end equipment.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Specialised nurses have a growing role in diagnostics and follow-up of outpatient HF patients,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and adding point of care US diagnostics to the nurses&#x02019; consultations may improve care. Thus, we aimed to study the clinical influence of focused US of the pleural cavities and IVC performed by specialised nurses, to assess volume status in patients with HF in a nurse-led outpatient clinic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study population and design</title><p>Patients allocated to the outpatient HF clinic at the non-university Levanger Hospital, Norway, 15 April to 21 June 2013 were eligible for inclusion.

Each of the two nurses were blinded to the information from the other nurse. For each visit the nurse worked in a team with a cardiologist (one of four) in a random order. After the patients had been examined by one of the nurses at each study visit, they were examined by the second nurse, either with or without US opposite to the first nurse.

During each patient visit, one of the nurses carried out point of care US of the pleural cavities and IVC to assess volume status as an adjunct to the clinical examination, and the other nurse completed the medical history recording and the clinical examination without point of care US. The nurses discussed their findings with respect to adjusting therapy with a cardiologist in a random way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="HEARTJNL2015307798F1">figure 1</xref>).

At follow-up visits, both teams had access to previous US findings.</p><p>Blood samples were drawn from the participants at baseline and follow-up. The blood samples were analysed at the hospital's IEC 17025 accredited laboratory for assessment of haemoglobin, sodium, potassium, international normalised ratio (INR), uric acid, creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>History recording and clinical examination to assess volume status</title><p>The history recording included assessment of the patients&#x02019; symptoms according to New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification by both nurses.

The clinical examination by the two specialised nurses was performed in a random order in separate rooms.</p><p>The clinical examination included: ECG, measurement of blood pressure and heart rate, weight control, and assessment of peripheral oedema. Weight change since hospital discharge or a previous visit in the HF clinic was classified as weight loss or weight gain if it was reduced or increased by &#x0003e;1.5&#x02005;kg and as no change in between. Peripheral oedema was graded as no oedema, ankle oedema, leg oedema or oedema above the knee. No cardiac auscultation or further clinical assessment was performed by the nurses.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Point of care US examinations by the nurses to assess volume status</title><p>The US examination was performed using the Vscan system (GE Ultrasound, Horten, Norway). With the patient in the supine position the dimensions of the IVC were measured distally to the inlet of the hepatic vein in the sagittal plane. The complete respiratory cycle was recorded, including sniff. Trailing-to-leading edge (ie, the inner diameter) was used. The collapsibility index of the IVC (IVC<sub>CI</sub>) was calculated as the difference between end-expiratory and end-inspiratory dimension divided by the end-expiratory dimension.

Data are presented as r (95% CI) with the 95% CI computed using bootstrapping. Predictors of diuretic therapy were tested in uni- and multivariate linear regression analyses with dose adjustments (reduced (&#x02212;1), unchanged (0) or increased (+1) intensity) used as dependent variables and the different predictors of clinical interest to test were included as covariates. In sensitivity analyses using logistic regression models, predictors for increased or decreased diuretic dosing were tested. In addition, the clinical influence of EF and whether the patient was seen by a cardiologist was tested. A two-sided p value &#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

In regression analyses, the estimated volume status based on US predicted dose adjustments of diuretics significantly better than any other tool used to assess patients&#x02019; volume status and guide therapy.</p><p>Patients with HF are encumbered with substantial morbidity and this was also the case in this study population. Pleural effusion is closely related to congestion and decompensation among HF patients and may be difficult to detect both by clinical examination and chest X-ray.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, pleural effusion is easily assessable by US and at first visit pleural effusion was present in 42% of the patients. Detection of newly developed pleural effusion in HF patients may indicate that the patients need intensified treatment. As shown by the basic characteristics the study population is quite similar to populations in other HF clinics, and it is reasonable to believe that our frequent finding of pleural effusion may be present in most HF populations.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>The present study shows poor to moderate correlation between the nurses regarding medical history and physical signs. Although the clinical assessment of peripheral oedema and classification of NYHA class are commonly used in the HF clinic, neither of them has been proven to be sufficiently objective, reliable or sensitive.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Symptoms and signs of fluid retention may be minimal and unspecific, and even attenuated by a low level of daily activity.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In addition, comorbidity and venous insufficiency may be misleading.</p><p>However, in the present study neither weight change, oedema, blood tests nor NYHA class appear optimal when it comes to monitoring of volume status. Monitoring the data may perform better than discrete values. However, the routine use of US may improve the assessment of volume status. The agreement between the teams (nurse and cardiologist) regarding volume status was numerically somewhat better compared to the agreement between the nurses, respectively.</p><p>In a recent study, we showed the high correlations of quantitative measurements of pleural effusion and the dimension of IVC between specialised nurses and cardiologists.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> This result is in line with findings of other groups with more or less inexperienced users after dedicated training.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>

<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>The robustness observed by the pocket-sized imaging of the pleural cavities and the IVC may be related to the fact that these measurements are not too difficult to obtain with high accuracy.

<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>To our knowledge, no other study has shown the clinical influence of routinely including focused US of the pleural cavities and the IVC, performed by specialised nurses, to assess volume status and guide treatment in an outpatient HF clinic. However, whether the implementation of focused US imaging of the pleural cavities and the IVC to assess volume status for guidance of therapy will exert an influence on mortality and morbidity remains to be shown. In this study, given the high morbidity of the HF patients, only three patients (5%) were hospitalised during the study period (mean 38&#x02005;days). This appears to be a low number compared to published data where readmission rates at 30&#x02013;60&#x02005;days were 10&#x02013;50%.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>

<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Pleural effusion is frequently present in asymptomatic worsening of HF, with minimal appearance of other HF-related signs.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Implementing the described US examination may have an important influence on therapeutic decision making and potentially also the patient's outcome. Natriuretic peptides have a high specificity for diagnosing HF, provide important prognostic information, and are able to guide therapy in HF patients. However, their performance may be inferior to US examinations for individual monitoring for follow-up of HF patients.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Natriuretic peptide guided therapy may be most useful to optimise the doses of &#x003b2;-blockers and ACEIs.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p><p>The high prevalence of pleural effusion among HF patients, the high feasibility and accuracy of US examination by nurses, and the high availability and low cost of the PSID may result in a high level of clinical gain by implementing focused US for the assessment of volume status in HF patients. Restricting such diagnostic examinations only to physicians may limit the clinical gain.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study was a single centre study. The major limitations are the lack of a gold standard for assessing volume status and the lack of clinical endpoints. The US findings of significant pleural effusion or a very narrow IVC with a very high CI may significantly alter decisions regarding diuretic dosing and this may have influenced the result. Further studies investigating the influence of this methodology on endpoints such as readmission rates and mortality are warranted.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion and implications</title><p>Focused US examinations of the pleural cavities and IVC among HF patients in an outpatient clinic performed by nurses significantly predicted dose adjustments of diuretics compared to standard care. Acknowledging the lack of a gold standard for assessing volume status, we conclude that implementing point of care US appears attractive for optimising the management of HF patients beyond standard clinical care, but further studies are needed to determine whether point of care US improves clinical outcomes.
