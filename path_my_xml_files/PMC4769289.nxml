It is normally treated with high dose steroids, but its recurrent nature leads to prolonged steroid usage and associated side effects. There is little evidence on the efficacy of alternative treatments for ENL, especially for patients who have become steroid resistant or have steroid side effects. These two pilot studies compare the efficacy and side effect profile of ciclosporin plus prednisolone against prednisolone alone in the treatment of patients with either new ENL or chronic and recurrent ENL.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and Results</title><p>Thirteen patients with new ENL and twenty patients with chronic ENL were recruited into two double-blinded randomised controlled trials. Patients were randomised to receive ciclosporin and prednisolone or prednisolone treatment only. Patients with acute ENL had a delay of 16 weeks in the occurrence of ENL flare-up episode, with less severe flare-ups and decreased requirements for additional prednisolone. Patients with chronic ENL on ciclosporin had the first episode of ENL flare-up 4 weeks earlier than those on prednisolone, as well as more severe ENL flare-ups requiring 2.5 times more additional prednisolone. Adverse events attributable to prednisolone were more common that those attributable to ciclosporin.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This is the first clinical trial on ENL management set in the African context, and also the first trial in leprosy to use patients&#x02019; assessment of outcomes. Patients on ciclosporin showed promising results in the management of acute ENL in this small pilot study. But ciclosporin, did not appear to have a significant steroid&#x02013;sparing effects in patients with chronic ENL, which may have been due to the prolonged use of steroids in these patients in combination with a too rapid decrease of steroids in patients given ciclosporin. Further research is needed to determine whether the promising results of ciclosporin in acute ENL can be reproduced on a larger scale.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Leprosy is caused by a mycobacterium, and is curable with multi-drug therapy, a combination of antibiotics taken for 6 or 12 months. However, some leprosy patients develop an inflammatory condition known as erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), or Type 2 reaction. ENL affects multiple organs and causes systemic illness as well as nerve damage that leads to disability and deformity. ENL is often chronic and patients have multiple flare-ups requiring prolonged steroid treatment. Patients are at risk of developing adverse events related to long term steroids. There are no effective, non-teratogenic alternative treatments for patients who no longer respond to steroids or have contra-indications to steroids. We conducted two studies to see if ciclosporin, an immunosuppressant used in many inflammatory conditions, could safely be used either as an alternative or in conjunction with prednisolone to treat ENL. Patients with acute ENL showed promising results with ciclosporin treatment, with a 16 week median delay in recurrence of ENL. It did not however appear to have a significant steroid&#x02013;sparing effects in patients with chronic ENL. This suggests that further ENL studies should look at carefully tailored regimens of medication in order to assess the effect of ciclosporin or other immunosuppressant drugs.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a grant from Hospital and Homes of St Giles (ITCRBY24).

Clinical features include skin lesions and neuropathy manifesting as loss of sensation, weakness or nerve pain. Delayed diagnosis or treatment may result in deformities and disability. In 2012, 232 857 new cases globally were reported by the WHO [<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The infection is curable with a combination of antibiotics known as multi-drug therapy (MDT) taken for either 6 or 12 months, but the immunological reactions continue to cause morbidity after the end of treatment.</p><p>Patients with Type 2 reactions in leprosy develop tender, sub-cutaneous nodules, called erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), which usually affects multiple organs causing uveitis, neuritis, arthritis, dactylitis, lymphadenitis and orchitis. Systemic illness is frequently associated with symptoms like fever and malaise [<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Severe ENL can be life-threatening. The recurrent inflammation of eyes and testes can lead to blindness and sterility.</p><p>In field studies, the rate of ENL in LL patients ranged between 11.1% and 26%, and in BL patients between 2.7% and 5.1%, with higher proportions found in hospital based studies [<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although patients may present with ENL, it often occurs during MDT or after completion of MDT.</p><p>Three patterns of ENL were identified in a cohort of 82 Indian patients: single acute episodes, recurrent acute episodes and chronic ENL [<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Acute episodes were defined as single episodes responding to steroid treatment and accounted for only 6% of ENL cases, acute multiple ENL (32%) comprised of recurrent episodes with periods off treatment, and chronic when patients needed steroid treatment for more than six months (62%). In Ethiopia, almost one third of patients developed a chronic condition lasting more than two years [<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] whereas a hospital based retrospective study in Ethiopia showed that 50% of patients with ENL had chronic ENL [<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Episodes of active ENL have been reported to last from 14 days [<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] to 26.1 weeks [<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. And episodes occurring over seven or more years have been reported [<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>ENL is a result of a combination of cellular activation and humoral immunological response to <italic>M</italic>.<italic>leprae</italic>, characterised by the deposition of extra-vascular immune complexes leading to neutrophil infiltration and activation of complement in many organs [<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It is associated with high levels of circulating tumour necrosis factor-&#x003b1; [<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], interleukins IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-8, IL-12 [<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and IFN&#x003b3; [<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], causing systemic toxicity. Circulating immune complexes are formed and deposited throughout the body. This mechanism may account for the eruption of nodules in the skin at sites apparently previously unaffected and for the occurrence of nephritis, arthralgia and neuritis [<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Immuno-suppression is required to control the symptoms and signs of ENL. In Ethiopia, patients with severe ENL are started on 60 to 80mg of oral prednisolone daily. The effectiveness is variable, and some patients with chronic or recurrent ENL may need to take prednisolone for several years [<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These prolonged, high doses of steroids are associated with steroid adverse effects [<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and increased mortality of patients with ENL [<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. There is some evidence that clofazimine in MDT may have a protective effect against ENL [<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The protective effect of clofazimine in preventing ENL is lost after 1 year when MB MDT is stopped. High dose clofazimine is used in the treatment of ENL in certain settings, although trials to show benefit are lacking. Studies are underway in the Philippines [<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Thalidomide, not available in Ethiopia, has a dramatic effect in controlling ENL and preventing recurrences, although its use is limited by teratogenicity and possible neurotoxicity [<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Thalidomide is known to be ineffective in neuritis or iritis. There is therefore a need to assess other potentially useful drugs in the management of ENL.</p><p>Ciclosporin is a potent immuno-suppressant used in the treatment for psoriasis, Behcet&#x02019;s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and in solid organ transplantation. Ciclosporin inhibits the development of cell mediated immunity, the production of T cell dependent antibodies and the production and release of lymphokines such as IL-2, which are all a feature of ENL [<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In-vitro experiments on serum from 25 patients with ENL supported the role of Cyclosprine A (ciclosporin) in restoring the activity of &#x0201c;T suppressor cells&#x0201d; and inhibited IL-2 production [<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A case series of three patients with uncontrolled ENL on steroids and thalidomide responded well to ciclosporin 10mg/kg/day for a period of 8 months [<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Their clinical response was reported as being good with decreased need for steroids and decreased recurrence of ENL. As ciclosporin has a slow onset of action and requires about two to four weeks to build up to a therapeutic level [<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], prednisolone is usually started at the same time and gradually decreased.</p><p>In view of the above results, and the need for a non-teratogenic alternative for the management of ENL, ciclosporin was compared to prednisolone only treatment in patients with either acute or chronic ENL. Two pilot studies for phase III clinical trials were designed with the aim to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ciclosporin. Detailed clinical outcomes were selected for these two double-blind randomized trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>Two separate double-blind controlled trials, with similar methods were conducted randomizing patients with either new acute ENL or chronic ENL to treatment with either ciclosporin or prednisolone.</p><sec id="sec007"><title>Case definitions</title><p>Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) was diagnosed when a patient with leprosy had crops of tender subcutaneous skin lesions.

An episode of ENL was defined as the occurrence of ENL requiring the institution or change of treatment (such as an increase in dosage or frequency of treatment or the addition of or switching to another drug). Secondary outcomes were: mean time to ENL recurrence after initial control; severity of ENL at recurrence; amount of additional prednisolone required by patients; frequency of adverse events for patients in each treatment arm; and the difference in score in Quality of Life assessment between start and end for patients in each treatment arm.</p><p>Severity of ENL was rated in by two physicians&#x02019; opinion on the severity, with the options of grading the ENL episode as none, mild, moderate or severe. Additional prednisone prescribed for flare up of ENL (defined as the appearance of 6 or more new ENL nodules) and for deterioration of nerve function (sustained for at least 2 weeks). The dose of additional prednisolone was determined by the examining physician depending on the severity of the symptoms.</p><p>Adverse events were enquired about at each visit using a standardized form with anticipated adverse events attributable to prednisolone and ciclosporin. Any other adverse events reported by the participant or identified by the physicians were also recorded. Major adverse events were defined as any event leading to admission or prolonged admission, study un-blinding or death. Amongst these were included psychosis, severe infection including tuberculosis, peptic ulcer, glaucoma, cataract, diabetes mellitus major, severe hypertension and haematological abnormalities. Minor adverse events were defined as moon face, acne, hirsutism, gum hyperplasia, fungal infections, gastric pain requiring antacids or any other minor adverse event not requiring admission to hospital or un-blinding. Two study physicians (blinded to each other&#x02019;s decision) reviewed each adverse event and decided whether it was linked to prednisolone or ciclosporin. Adverse events were also graded by severity, using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] grading system.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p>Eligible individuals were recruited consecutively and randomly assigned in 1:1 ratio (block size of two and four), with a computer-generated randomisation list, to one of the two treatment arms.

The allocation procedure was done by the pharmacist who had no clinic contact and was the only individual aware of the treatment allocation. All study participants, physicians, nurses, ward staff, laboratory staff and the physiotherapists were blinded to the allocation.

None of the studies assessed the effect of the intervention on quality of life in participants.</p><p>In these ENL studies we tried to implement a strict methodology selecting outcome measures that are relevant to the patient&#x02019;s well-being and take into account the natural history of ENL.</p><p>Of the 33 patients recruited to the two ENL pilot studies, 13 had new ENL and had not previously received prednisolone, whilst 20 patients had recurrent or chronic ENL that had deteriorated whilst on prednisolone. The latter group had on average been on prednisolone for 24 months prior to recruitment, at which time the mean dose of prednisolone was 20mg/day. ENL trials have not so far reported on the ENL type in participants. In an Indian cohort, acute single episode ENL accounted for only 8% of cases, whereas chronic ENL accounted for 62.5% of [<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In Ethiopia, hospital data shows that 71% of patients admitted with ENL had chronic ENL [<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and in field studies, one third of ENL patients developed a chronic condition lasting more than two years [<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is important to try and separate out participants with chronic ENL which is more difficult to treat compared to those with a single episode of acute ENL.</p><p>Our study randomisation technique was effective as there was no significant difference in age, sex and Ridley-Jopling classification between the patients in both study arms, for the two studies.</p><p>At recruitment, 29 out of 33 patients, were graded as having severe ENL by the specialist with ulcerated ENL nodules occurring in 25% of our cases. There was no significant difference in the frequency of extra-cutaneous manifestations of ENL. Bone pain and neuritis were the most common, followed by peripheral oedema. Testicular tenderness was present in half of the male patients. Fever, a symptoms often reported in association with ENL was present in only 42% of our participants.</p><p>The patients with new ENL randomized to the ciclosporin arm, showed promising results. There was a clear delay of 16 weeks (median 12 vs. 28) in onset of the first ENL recurrence episode; recurrence episodes were fewer and less severe requiring less additional prednisolone to control ENL. The results from this small pilot study suggest that ciclosporin is effective in the management of ENL in individuals experiencing their first episode of ENL.</p><p>The natural history of ENL may affect responses in the patients with new ENL. It is difficult to say which of these patients are going to have a single acute episode only or develop chronic/ recurrent ENL. It may be that the patients with new ENL (both in the ciclosporin and prednisolone arms) who had numerous flare-ups following the first episode would develop chronic/recurrent ENL. The ability to differentiate between patients who develop the different types of ENL might guide future studies better.</p><p>The 20 patients with chronic or recurrent ENL showed less benefit from ciclosporin. In comparison to patients in the prednisolone arm, the patients in the ciclosporin arm of this study had the first episode of ENL flare-up on average 8 weeks earlier (median 4 vs 12), with a higher number (23 vs. 20) and higher severity of ENL flare-up episodes necessitating more additional prednisolone to control ENL.</p><p>In the design of the study, the drug regimen for the ciclosporin study arm, assumed that four weeks of initial prednisolone would adequately cover the slow onset of action of ciclosporin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0004149.t001">Table 1</xref>). A number of problems can be identified in retrospect with this regimen. The onset of action of ciclosporin is reported to be between four to eight weeks in most dermatological conditions with maximum response seen around 8 to 16 weeks [<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], so potentially stopping the adjunctive prednisolone at week 4 was too early.</p><p>The rate of decrease of prednisolone may also have been too rapid in this group. Clinical experience with ENL patients shows that patients often flare-up as soon as prednisolone is decreased to a certain level or stopped [<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus patients, in whom chronic ENL would usually be controlled on at least 20mg of prednisolone, started flaring up when the dose dropped under 20mg. There are no published trials on the rate of decrease in prednisolone for ENL treatment.</p><p>Another factor to consider is that patients in the prednisolone arm started at much higher doses of prednisolone (60mg) which was decreased slowly potentially adding a protective effect from ENL recurrence for a longer amount of time (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0004149.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>In the ciclosporin arm of the chronic ENL study, of the nine patients who had an ENL recurrence, 67% had it at week 4 or before compared to the eight patients in the prednisolone arm where 14% only had a recurrence in that period. This suggests that as soon as prednisolone was stopped, there was a high risk of ENL flare-up either because the immunosuppressive action of ciclosporin was still insufficient or because prednisolone was decreased too rapidly. Once an ENL flare-up occurs in a patient, total prednisolone is increased to 40 or 60mg depending on the severity, and then gradually decreased by 5mg a week. Delaying the onset of ENL flare-up decreases the total amount of additional prednisolone needed. This could explain why in the patients receiving ciclosporin, patients with chronic ENL needed almost twice as much additional prednisolone than those with new ENL. A study comparing thalidomide and prednisolone in the management of ENL found that 77% of patients had an ENL flare up within 6 to 8 weeks when the prednisolone was stopped and 23% had a recurrence when the prednisolone dose was decreased[<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>The patients with chronic or recurrent ENL had been on prednisolone for long periods of time before recruitment (in this group, an average of 2 years). A proportion of individuals with inflammatory conditions such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and inflammatory bowel disease show corticosteroid resistance or insensitivity [<xref rid="pntd.0004149.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Drug tolerance is when a subject's response to a specific drug and drug concentration is progressively reduced, requiring an increase in concentration to achieve the desired effect. Between the rebound effects of prednisolone and a possible build-up of tolerance, it may be very difficult to stop prednisolone in patients with chronic ENL. It is not known how common the phenomena of corticosteroid resistance or tolerance, are in patients with leprosy reactions.</p><p>Patients in the ciclosporin arm needed more prednisolone for NFI and neuritis than those in the prednisolone arm. There were some baseline differences between the two groups, with patients on the ciclosporin arm exhibiting more NFI at recruitment. The small numbers of patients, make it difficult to comment on the difference between prednisolone and ciclosporin in their efficacy to treat NFI.</p><p>Minor and major adverse events directly attributable to prednisolone were much more frequent than those attributable to ciclosporin. Serious adverse events were more common in patients with chronic ENL in whom long term steroid treatment had made them frailer.</p><p>This is the first time that the SF-36 quality of life questionnaire has been used in a leprosy clinical trial to assess patients&#x02019; estimation on outcomes. Our Amharic translation was validated before using it in the ciclosporin trials. All the comparisons were done on group mean quality of life scores and not on individual patient scores. There was no statistically significant difference in changes in all scores between patients on the ciclosporin arm and those on the prednisolone arm. The small sample size makes interpretation of results difficult. In general, both physical and mental scores improved in both study arms in both acute and chronic ENL patients. Interpretation of results was made difficult by the small sample sizes. It is interesting to note that patients with chronic ENL had lower scores in the summary scores both at start and end of treatment compared to those with acute ENL, reflecting how chronic ENL, or its long term treatment, affects quality of life of patients.</p><sec id="sec025"><title>Conclusions</title><p>ENL is a complicated phenomenon and we are unable to predict which patients will develop ENL, how severely and how long they will require treatment. ENL is often chronic and recurrent in nature. Although most available immunosuppressant medications may work similarly for controlling the acute symptoms of ENL, prevention of recurrences is far more difficult.</p><p>Ciclosporin showed promising results in the management of acute ENL in this small pilot study. It did not appear to have a significant steroid&#x02013;sparing effects in patients with chronic ENL which may have been due to the prolonged use of steroids in these patients in combination with a too rapid decrease of steroids in patients given ciclosporin.</p><p>Further research is needed to determine whether the promising results of ciclosporin in acute ENL can be reproduced on a larger scale. Future studies on ENL should have a more tailored prednisolone regimen for patients with chronic or recurrent ENL who are steroid dependant. An alternative regimen of prednisolone is needed, possibly individualized at 1mg/kg then gradually decreasing more slowly over a period of at least 8 weeks allowing for ciclosporin to take over the immunosuppressive action.</p><p>A valuable feature of these studies is that they demonstrate the importance of separating patients with the first ENL episode from those with chronic ENL. In future studies, patients with acute ENL, may benefit from a faster reduction of prednisolone, whereas patients with chronic ENL would require a slower reduction of prednisolone and a more sustained immune-suppression. An internationally agreed on definition of ENL is essential in order to design adequately powered, high quality multi-centred trials.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec026"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0004149.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0004149.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank the participants who gave up their time to participate in this study and the staff at ALERT Hospital for all their hard work.
