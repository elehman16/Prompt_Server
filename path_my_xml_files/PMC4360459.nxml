In our randomized, prospective, double-blinded, open level, parallel group study, we have established the effect of caudal epidural block on maintenance requirement of intravenous (IV) propofol in targeted bispectral (BIS) monitored patients.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Context:</title><p>Neuraxial anesthesia exhibits sedative properties that may reduce the requirement for general anesthesia. TIVA with propofol has been administered as an established method of maintaining general anesthesia in children. Caudal analgesia being a type of neuraxial block, also seems to reduce the requirement of sedative hypnotics in pediatric patients. Numerous studies show that for patients, administered with caudal epidural block, they require reduced intra-operative volatile inhalation anesthetics. In the present study, we have established the anesthetic sparing effect of Caudal Epidural Analgesia in children undergoing infra-umbilical surgical procedure and calculated the efficacy of propofol-infusion in maintaining adequate depth of anesthesia.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Aims:</title><p>(1) To study and compare the dose requirements of propofol using caudal epidural analgesia. (2) To calculate the efficacy of propofol as maintenance anesthetic agent in both groups and to compare hemodynamic stability of patients in both the techniques.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Settings and Design:</title><p>In our study, after administering general anesthesia to pediatric patients, we have administered caudal analgesia and IV analgesia to monitor the requirement of intra-operative propofol infusion using BIS monitor with a target value of 40-60 in both groups.</p></sec><sec id="st5"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>82 patients (aged between 3 and 6 years) have been selected undergoing infra-umbilical surgery and randomly allocated into two groups containing 41 patients in each group.

Sample size estimation was done after a thorough review of the literature. It was assumed that to detect a mean difference of propofol requirement of 50 mg with a study power of 80% and a probability of type I error as 5%, a total of 82 patients would be required for the study. The within group standard deviation was assumed to be 80 mg. Hence, a total of 82 patients was chosen for the study and allocated uniformly in 2 groups of 41 patients.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Exclusion criteria's taken into account</title><p>(i) Pediatric patients &#x0003c;3 years and more than 6 years, (ii) hemodynamically unstable patients, (iii) contraindication to caudal epidural block such as sacral anomaly, bleeding diathesis, (iv) patients with neuromuscular disease, history of epileptic disorder and lipid storage disorder, (v) any known allergy to the drugs used in our study or to the bispectral (BIS) probes.</p><p>After selecting the patients were divided into two groups caudal (group B) and control (group A) (<italic>n</italic> = 41) of age between 3 and 6 years posted for infra umbilical surgery lasting more than 1 h.</p><p>Patients were pre-medicated 1 h before surgery with 0.5 mg/kg oral midazolam syrup to ensure a smooth parental separation. Intravenous (IV) access was established with the appropriate size IV cannula after prior application of 50% EMLA cream over the venipuncture site. The patient was then taken inside OT, and ASA standard monitors were applied and BIS probes was applied over the forehead. After that patients were pre-oxygenated with 100% oxygen with a scented face mask of appropriate size.</p><p>Patients were pre-medicated with 0.01 mg/kg IV glycolpyrrolate and 2 mcg/kg injection fentanyl. IV propofol was given as a bolus at a pre-calculated value of 1.6-2 mg/Kg body weight or till loss of verbal contact in both the groups. Here, the BIS value and the amount of propofol given were recorded. Then 0.5 mg/Kg atracurium was given to both the groups IV as a loading dose, followed by 0.1 mg/Kg, as and when required. Patient was ventilated for 3 min and intubation was done using an adequately sized ET tube. BIS monitor was kept attached, and values were recorded throughout.</p><p>After proper positioning of the patient, caudal epidural block was given with 0.2% ropivacaine 1 ml/kg to the caudal group and nothing was administered to the control group. To overcome observer bias and undergo double blinding, we appointed a second observer, who was not present in the operation theater till the time and was called after positioning of the patients, so that he was not aware of which patient got caudal block and which patient did not.</p><p>In this period, when the BIS value went over 40, as monitored by a second observer who started propofol infusion at the rate of 10 mg/Kg/h to both groups targeting to maintain the intra-operative BIS value in the range of 40-60. Hence, patient was maintained by 50% oxygen, 50% nitrous oxide along with propofol infusion. Rescue analgesic in the form of fentanyl was given at the rate of 0.5 mcg/Kg after 1 h of surgery to the control group. If the intra-operative BIS value remained to be 60 persistently, bolus of propofol at 0.5 mg/kg was given, and if it was persistently below 30, propofol infusion was switched off and time was recorded till infusion was switched back on.</p><p>Five minute before arousal propofol infusion was switched off, and the amount of drug administered was recorded in both groups. Then the patient was reversed with 50 mg/Kg neostigmine and 10 mcg/Kg glycopyrrolate. The time to arousal and extubation was recorded.</p><p>Perioperative monitoring included standard ASA monitoring along with BIS (Aspect Medical Systems, US).</p><p>All raw data collected from case report forms were entered into a Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet and analyzed using available statistical software viz.

First, pain is considered to play the most important role in the arousal from anaesthesia,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] caudal analgesia blocks the pain from the surgical site and decreases the general anesthetic demand. Second, neuraxial block reduces the anesthetic requirement by suppressing the movement in response to a noxious stimulus below the level of sensory block. The afferentiation theory proposes that tonic sensory and muscle-spindle activity modulate cerebral activity and maintain a state of wakefulness and decreased afferent input to the brain could lessen the excitatory descending modulation of the spinal cord motor neurons and suppress motor functions.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Third, rostral spread of the local anesthetic in CSF directly affects the brain.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>In our study, there has been a significant reduction in IV propofol consumption at the end of surgery in the caudal group (Group B, 7.83 &#x000b1; 0.63) in comparison to the control group (Group A, 11.33 &#x000b1; 0.17) with a <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05. It also has been observed that time duration for requirement of rescue analgesic in the postoperative period was much more in Group B (6.5 &#x000b1; 0.17) than Group A (2.1 &#x000b1; 0.88).</p><p>There are some limitations of our study. First of all, we have allowed 20 min interval following administration of caudal blockade for ropivacaine to take its effect. It is possible that any sedative effect of caudal analgesia may not be seen in this time. There are no published data describing the onset of caudal analgesia, however, clinical experience indicates that the majority of caudal blocks are effective within this time. Second, we are not been able to assess the height of caudal blockade as the patient is under the drapes.</p><p>To overcome this limitation to a certain extent, we have administered a pre-calculated dose of ropivacaine, and we have chosen infra-umbilical surgeries mainly the lower ones restricted to perineum. Further, when using the BIS as a measure of arousal, it must be emphasized that BIS is an empiric derivative. Therefore, it should be considered as an ordinal and not in interval scale. The difference between BIS of 70 and 60 is not the same as the difference between 60 and 50. EEG pattern of children is different from that of the adults and BIS monitoring is standardized based on the algorithm developed for adults is definitely a limitation of accuracy of BIS in children; however, the literature[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] shows successful usage of BIS monitoring in children over 2 years age. It may be necessary to develop a standardized algorithm for BIS index in children to get more accurate results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>It can be concluded from the present study that caudal epidural blockade reduces the consumption of IV propofol during maintenance phase of targeted BIS monitored patients aged between 3 and 6 years posted for infra-umbilical surgeries lasting for more than 1 h. For monitoring the adequate depth of anesthesia, we have used BIS with a set target value of 40-60.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold>
