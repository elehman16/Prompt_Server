observation on upper extremity function in patients with stroke. [Subjects and Methods]
Twelve subjects were randomly to either the experimental group or control group. The
experimental group underwent occupational therapy and a purposeful action observation
program. The control group underwent occupational therapy and placebo treatment in which
the subjects performed a purposeful action observation program without actually observing
the purposeful actions. The Wolf Motor Function Test was used to measure upper extremity
function before and after the intervention in both groups. [Results] Both the experimental
and control groups demonstrated improved upper extremity function after the intervention,
but there was no significant difference between groups. Compared with before the
intervention, the experimental group showed significantly improved upper extremity
function after the intervention. [Conclusion] Based on these results, a purposeful action
observation program can improve upper extremity function in patients with stroke. In
future research, more subjects should be included for evaluation of different
treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Purposeful action observation</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Upper extremity function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In 2013, stroke was the second most frequent cause of death after coronary artery disease,
accounting for 6.4 million deaths in Korea<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Neurologic complications including cognitive, motor, speech,
dysphagia, dysesthesia, perceptual, and affective disorders may occur after stroke. Motor
disorders occur in nearly 80% of stroke survivors and more than half of stroke patients
experience pain and some limitation of the upper and/or lower extremities of the affected
side due to hemiplegia<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Upper limb
difficulties often predominate, especially affecting function and skill in movement of the
hands, limiting motor independence in activities of daily life<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recently, various treatments, prognoses, and mechanisms of upper
limb function restoration have been identified in various fields. One of these treatment
methods is action observation training.</p><p>Action observation training has a theoretical basis in the mirror neuron system (MNS)<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, which is the process of observing the
actions of other people or models shown in a video. Observing the action affects the same
nervous structure as that affected when performing the same action<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The mirror neuron system has been reported to be activated
more at the moment of observing a purposeful action versus a simple action, and to be
effective if the program uses assignments that are related to events in daily life<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Several previous studies have reported effect of action observation in upper extremity
function. For example, one study found that finger abduction increased by observing
abduction action using the index and middle fingers of the right hand<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study reported that dynamic balance and walking
ability increased by observing the actions of gait training<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, we applied a purposeful action observation program in patients with stroke
and evaluated its effect on upper extremity function. Based on the results of this study we
will be suggested use of a purposeful action observation program as a remediating strategy
for occupational therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twelve subjects diagnosed with hemiparsis due to stroke participated in this study. A
nonequivalent pretest-posttest control group design was used. The purposeful action
observation (experimental) and control groups were assigned in a randomized fashion. The
experimental group underwent occupational therapy and a purposeful action observation
program. The control group underwent occupational therapy and placebo treatment in which the
subjects performed the purposeful action observation program without actually observing the
purposeful actions. All the subjects agreed to participate in this study and provided
written informed consent in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki.</p><p>The mediation period of the purposeful action observation program was based on the study by
Feys et al<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The purposeful action
observation program included activities for feeding, grasping a can, combing hair, drinking
water using from a cup, stamping, turning a page, mopping, folding towels, and opening a
bottle cap using scissors. The program was applied for 30 minutes per session, 5 sessions
per week, for 6 weeks. The program was assessed in terms of assignment composition,
selection of difficulty level, and method. The validity of the program also was assessed.
Other previous studies were considered during the formulation of assignments for purposeful
action observation. The Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) was used for measurement of upper
extremity function before and after the intervention in both groups. The WMFT is useful for
characterizing the motor status of patients with chronic stroke or traumatic brain injury,
in terms of severity of upper extremity motor deficit. The inter-test and inter-rater
reliability, and internal consistency and stability of the test are high, ranging from 0.88
to 0.98, with most of the values being near 0.95<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Data analyses were performed using SPSS version 18.0 software (SPSS, Inc. Chicago, IL,
USA). The Mann-Whitney U test was used to evaluate differences between groups. The Wilcoxon
signed-rank test was used to compare pre-post within experimental group. The level of
statistical significance was set at 0.05 for all analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Comparison of upper extremity function between groups is shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of upper extremity function before and after the intervention between

used as a mediating method in the field of rehabilitation. Action observation training is
one particular method of action imitation<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Action observation training is based on the theory of the mirror
neuron system, which holds that the same neurologic changes occur when observing, but not
performing, an action as when actually performing the action<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The level of difficulty assignment was considered during the selection of purposeful action
observation assignments, and patients were motivated by means of selecting their own
patient-oriented assignments<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Two
assignments were selected per session and repeated over 1 week; this method is the same as
that used by Feys et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, which suggested
performing the program for 30 minutes per session, 5 sessions per week, for 6 weeks,
depending on the rehabilitation mediation period of the stroke patients. If the patient
could not perform a difficult assignment, 2 assignments were performed repeatedly during the
6 weeks; as such, the possibility of lack of motivation and concentration on the assignment
existed.</p><p>The strengths of this study include assessment of the program&#x02019;s validity by professionals,
the action observation program assignments being related to activities of daily life by
taking previous studies into consideration, and patient motivation, because they were free
to choose their own assignments. This study had some limitations, however, as follows:
First, generalizing the results may be problematic because the number of subjects was small.
Second, this study does not provide information regarding maintenance of upper extremity
function after completion of the program.</p><p>Future studies should assess purposeful action observation programs using a greater number
of subjects to enable generalization of the results. In addition, follow-up studies are
needed to determine the degree to which the improved kinematic patterns are maintained after
completion of program. Future studies also should examine not only upper extremity function
but also the efficiency, angle, and reactivity of such motion.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="eref">National Statistical Office:
