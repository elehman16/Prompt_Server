Individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) according to the WHO criteria classified as prediabetic patients. It is characterized by both &#x003b2;-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Epidemiological studies estimated that approximately 1 in 7 adults in the North America, Europe and Asia are prediabetic.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] According to the International Diabetes Federation, the prevalence of prediabetes is increasing and it is estimated that it would be projected to more than 470 million by 2030.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>The above mentioned epidemiological feature emphasizes on the importance of targeted diabetes prevention programs. Several studies indicated the potential benefits of lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy in preventing T2DM among prediabetic patients. Moreover, others suggest that proper management of prediabetic population also could reduce the risk of CVD and its related morbidity and mortality.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Lifestyle modification considers the cornerstone of diabetes prevention and its beneficial effect on improving insulin sensitivity and &#x003b2;-cell function and consequently diabetes prevention has been confirmed in several studies.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Though several pharmacological interventions confirm the effectiveness of some agents in reducing the incidence of T2DM in prediabetics but some studies have not approved the use of pharmacotherapy in this field.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Recent studies reported that centrally acting antidiabetic agents such as bromocriptine could reduce plasma glucose, free fatty acid (FFA) and triglycerides levels through their novel mechanism of action. It is suggested that bromocriptines have modulatory effect on central glucose and energy metabolism pathways.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Bromocriptine is a sympatholytic D2-dopamine agonist. Its pharmacological activity is due to activation and inhibition of CNS D2 and D1 receptors, respectively. It has also inhibitory and partial agonist effect on 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors, respectively.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Though, the effectiveness of bromocriptine on glycemic control of type 2 diabetic patients have reported in many clinical trials and its use among patients with T2DM have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but its mechanism of action have not identified yet.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Considering the pathogenesis of T2DM, it is suggested that bromocriptine could have similar effect on prediabetic patients and consequently in preventing T2DM. The utility of bromocriptine in this high risk population have not been studied.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of bromocriptine on glycemic and metabolic control of prediabetic patients.

They showed that bromocriptine improved glycemic control in obese type-2 diabetic patients.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Ramteke <italic>et al</italic>., in India, have evaluated both monotherapy and combination therapy of bromocriptine with metformin in three groups of patients with T2DM for 12 weeks and they observed that all the studied treatment strategies were effective and safe for achieving optimal glycemic control.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>Via <italic>et al</italic>., in the USA, have reviewed different studies regarding the effectiveness of bromocriptine in glycemic control of T2DM and they concluded that its efficacy is more significant if it can be used early in the course of the disease and preferably with other antidiabetic agents.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Considering the fact that proper management of prediabetic patients as the target group which are at higher risk for developing T2DM is crucial for prevention of T2DM and the superiority of bromocriptine than other antidiabetic agents this study was designed among this group of patients in Isfahan.</p><p>The results of current study indicated that bromocriptine was not effective for reducing FPG, HbA1c and other glycemic factors, but area under the cure of glucose during OGTT [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. However, the decrease in the area under the cure of glucose is just marginally significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.045). It is recommended to do a study with bigger sample size and with higher dosage of bromocriptine to show a probably more effect on glycemic factors in prediabetic patients.</p><p>In literature review, there was not any similar study in this regard. At our best knowledge, this is the first study, which has been conducted to investigate the effect of bromocriptine in prediabetic patients.</p><p>Although many studies have confirmed the effectiveness of monotherapy of bromocriptine on glycemic control on T2DM, but it seems that its conjunction with lifestyle modification including diet, exercise and other anti diabetic agents would be more useful as mentioned in previous studies.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>Another explanation is based on the pathophysiology of prediabetes. Our study populations are the patients with IFG and or IGT which are classified as prediabetics. However, the response of patients with IFG and IGT to bromocriptine was not similar to overt diabetes.</p><p>IFG and IGT are associated, predominantly, with hepatic insulin and muscle insulin resistance, respectively. Those with IFG and IGT have both muscle and hepatic insulin resistance. The risk of diabetes development is higher in patients with both IFG and IGT.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] On the other hand, DeFronzo <italic>et al</italic>. have reported that bromocriptine could not increase insulin sensitivity or augment its secretion in peripheral tissue, that is, in muscles. Moreover, they indicated that it could not enhance insulin action in the physiologic range of hyperinsulinemia.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>Though above mentioned mechanisms of bromocriptine needs further clarification, it seems that in prediabetic patients the severity of hyperinsulinemia is not much higher than the physiologic range.</p><p>We analyzed the data of our patients with IFG or IGT or those with IFG and IGT, separately (data were not shown). However, the findings were not conclusive. Probably, the sample size was small.</p><p>The period of our study was 12 weeks; it seems that longer duration of trial would provide us more concise results. The durations of trial in many studies which have reported the favorable effect of bromocriptine on glycemic control were longer.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>There are controversies regarding the effectiveness of bromocriptine on cardiovascular risk factors and its effectiveness in this field have not confirmed, yet.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>Garber and colleagues in Houston have reported that bromocriptine effect on CVD risk factors is more favorable in T2DM with history of CVD disease or those with significant CVD risk factors.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Gaziano <italic>et al</italic>. conducted two studies regarding the safety and efficacy of bromocriptine on major adverse cardiovascular events among patients with T2DM.
