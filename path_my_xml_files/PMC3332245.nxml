The authors will use interaction terms in regression models to determine if there is a differential impact of the intervention in those with and without pre-existing chronic kidney disease.

Peri-operative AKI is independently associated with increased short- and long-term mortality, a greater length of hospital stay and higher economic costs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref></p><p>CABG surgery is usually performed with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (&#x02018;on-pump&#x02019;). This requires cannulation of the heart and aorta, cross clamping of the ascending aorta and cardioplegic arrest. In this setting, AKI is multifactorial: the bypass circuit changes blood concentration and pulsatility and introduces a blood/circuit interface, which stimulates a generalised inflammatory response including increased catecholamine and free haemoglobin levels.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> Furthermore, aorta cannulation and cross clamping may lead to platelet or atheromatous embolic phenomena.</p><p>CABG surgery performed on a beating heart without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (&#x02018;off-pump&#x02019;) was developed to avoid post-operative complications from the pump. A systematic review published in 2010 evaluated AKI across 22 randomised trials comparing off-pump with on-pump surgery (total 4819 patients).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> Off-pump CABG resulted in a 40% RR reduction in AKI (variably defined in the primary trials). The results did not demonstrate statistical heterogeneity. However, as concluded by the review authors, &#x02018;different definitions of AKI used in the individual trials and methodological concerns preclude definitive conclusions about the treatment effect&#x02019;.</p><p>A limitation of most AKI prevention trials is a failure to consider any sustained effect of the intervention on longer term kidney function. It is possible that off-pump compared with on-pump surgery better preserves 1-year kidney function, but to our knowledge, this has not been previously evaluated. This effect may be mediated through the AKI itself (ie, avoiding AKI preserves kidney function at 1&#x02005;year<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>) or may be mediated through other pathways (ie, off-pump bypass improves cardiac function which preserves 1-year kidney function). Understanding the degree to which avoiding AKI preserves longer term kidney function has broader implications for the acceptability of side effects and costs of interventions which prevent AKI. Finally, patients with pre-operative chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk of AKI and are a subgroup where preservation of renal function is of key interest.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref></p><sec><title>CABG Off- or On-Pump Revascularisation Study</title><p>We are conducting the CABG Off- or On-Pump Revascularisation Study (acronym CORONARY). The methods of this large, international randomised controlled trial are described elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> In brief, after obtaining written informed consent, adult patients undergoing isolated CABG surgery (with a median sternotomy) are allocated to have the procedure done with or without a bypass pump. Allocation is done by a voice-activated telephone randomisation service. This trial is funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. With respect to the study schedule, the last of 4752 patients from 79 sites in 19 countries were randomised in November 2011. The primary 30-day composite outcome is total mortality, stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction or receipt of dialysis for severe AKI. The 30-day results will be analysed and reported in March 2012. One-year outcome data will continue to be collected throughout 2012 and will be reported in 2013.</p><p>In addition to the primary outcome, CORONARY is uniquely positioned to answer important kidney-specific questions. In the year 2009, we were competitively awarded another grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to collect additional renal information within CORONARY to address these questions. Ethics approval was obtained for additional renal data collection in centres that agreed to study participation (&#x0003e;90% of participating centres). This collection began for patients enrolled after 1 January 2010. Remaining 1-year renal outcome data will be collected throughout 2012. Results will be reported in 2013.</p><p>The kidney questions detailed in the grant are presented below and are followed by pre-specified analytic plans.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary questions</title><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>1.

Of note, many factors including haemodilution add &#x02018;noise&#x02019; to post-operative serum creatinine measurements. When the value is markedly elevated, we are confident that the reason is due to AKI. It is conceivable that an intervention effect will be observed for categorised AKI but not per cent change in creatinine.

International recruitment across 19 countries will provide generalisable estimates of the treatment effect. In this report, we have judiciously pre-specified the main questions and analytic protocol that will be used to test relevant kidney hypotheses in CORONARY. We have done so to minimise the chance of spurious post-hoc assertions of effect, so that the kidney results from this large international trial are robust and believable.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supporting Statement</title></caption><media xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001080-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d34e755" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d34e266" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001080.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>To cite:</bold> Garg AX, Devereaux PJ, Yusuf S, <italic>et al</italic>.
