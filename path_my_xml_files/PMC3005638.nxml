The mean age of the subjects were 12.2&#x000b1;4.3 years, (4.8&#x02212;20.8 years). Patients had a mean duration of diabetes of 4.8&#x000b1;3.5 years and a mean HbA1c of 8.7&#x000b1;1.9%.</p><p><bold>Study Protocol</bold></p><p>In this open label, randomized study, 28 patients (14 females, 14 males) that have been treated with an intensified insulin regimen (neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH)+Regular insulin (R)/or NPH+Lispro/ aspart) for at least one year were randomized to insulin glargine (Lantus Aventis Pharma) injection at breakfast&#x02212;time (06:00&#x02212;09:00) (6 females, 6 males), or at bedtime (21:00&#x02212;24:00) (8 females, 8 males), each plus meal&#x02212;time rapid&#x02212;acting insulin analogue (16 bedtime insulin, 12 breakfast insulin) after a 2 weeks screening phase where patients continued their usual insulin regimen and were encouraged to strive for optimal glycemic control. Total daily basal insulin glargine dose was calculated as 45% of the total dose. Basal insulin was titrated by the patient based on home self monitored glucose measurements (SMBG) according to the predefined premeal blood glucose of 80&#x02212;120 mg/dL. Short acting insulin anologue was titrated individually as necessary, aiming to reach a postprandial glucose of no more than 140 mg/dL.</p><p>CGMS was performed at the end of the 12th week of insulin glargine treatment. At that time the patients came in for an outpatient visit for sensor insertion and they were instructed to keep detailed logs during this period and record events, insulin dosage and exercise and were trained how to use CGMS. CGMS sensor replacement was done by a certified diabetes nurse. Calibration of the sensor was accomplished by the protocol established as outlined in the Minimed CGMS manual. At the completion of the CGMS period the system was returned and the data were downloaded and converted into glucose levels using Minimed Solution software version 3.0. Logbooks were also analyzed to determine finger stick blood glucose levels.</p><p>Weight and height were measured by standard methods and body mass index (BMI) was calculated accordingly (kg/m2) and expressed as standard deviation score (SDS) according to Cole et al.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>)</p><p><bold>Data Analyses</bold></p><p>Glucose data from each day were analyzed at four different time periods: between 9:00 and 21:00 (t1), between 21:00 and 24:00 (t2), between 24:00 and 04:00 (t3), 04:00 and 09:00 (t4). </p><p>Glycemic excursions were defined as hypoglycemia &#x0003c;60 mg/dL and hyperglycemia as any sensor value &#x0003e;180 mg/dL.</p><p>The SMBG values were entered into the CGMS monitor to obtain correlation coefficients between the SMBG and the CGMS values. We analyzed the data if 288 sensor values per 24 h were available. Average glucose concentration per 24 h, average glucose concentration during the time periods given above, as well as number of excursions, time and area under the glucose curve (AUC) above 180 mg/dL and below 60 mg/dL were calculated from the CGMS data. Additionally, average glucose concentration per 24 hour was calculated from the results of the standardized self monitoring of blood glucose performed by the patients. The following cutoff criteria for optimal accuracy were adhered to: the correlation coefficient between the sensor and the meter readings was above the cutoff point of 0.79 and a mean absolute difference (MAD) of sensor and meter readings was below 28%.</p><p>Glycated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) was measured by high performance liquid chromatography at onset and at 12<sup>th</sup> week of the study.</p><p>SPSS (version 11.0) statistical software was used for analyses. All values are presented as mean&#x000b1;SD. Nonparametric tests were used for comparison between the mean values. P values of less than 0.05 were considered significant.</p><p>All patients and families were informed about the study and consents were obtained.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Baseline characteristics of the patients were similar in the two groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 1</xref>).

This data shows that there was no significant difference in the frequency or duration of hypo/hyperglycemia during the day and night irrespective of the timing of glargine injection. Breakfast glargine protected only from hypoglycemia occurring in between 24:00 and 04:00. Breakfast group was hyperglycemic during the day and hyperglycemia started in the morning at 04:00.</p><p>Minor reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub> after 12 weeks of treatment were noted in both of the groups as shown by Hamann et al(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>) in type 1 diabetics aged 18&#x02212;68 years at the end of 24 weeks. Karaguzel et al(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>) had shown significant reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> at the end of six months of therapy with insulin glargine only in the breakfast group. In poorly controlled children and adolescents insulin glargine at lunch time at the end of six months of therapy showed a statistically significant drop in HbA<sub>1c</sub>.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>) In twenty&#x02212;six adolescents who have received 4 months of bedtime insulin glargine with pre&#x02212;meal insulin lispro and 4 months of bedtime NPH with pre&#x02212;meal regular insulin fasting glucose levels were lower on the glargine regimen, but the hemoglobin A1c level was not statistically different (8.7 vs. 9.1%).(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>)</p><p>Studies have shown lower rate of nocturnal hypoglycemic events in patients with type 1 diabetes on basal bolus regimen involving insulin glargine as the basal substitution given at bedtime compared with NPH insulin.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>)</p><p>Hypoglycemic events/patient/day between the two groups were not different. A slightly higher rate of hypoglycemic events was found in the bedtime group during the daytime. Although it has been stated that the time action profile of glargine can decrease the risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia and should be given preferentially at bedtime(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>) there was a difference in the incidence of nocturnal hypoglycemia in time interval t3 between the bedtime and breakfast group (2.4 events.patient<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.night<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> vs. 0). Hamann et al(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>) reported that the incidences of total symptomatic and severe hypoglycemia did not differ between dinner, bedtime and breakfast glargine insulin groups however nocturnal hypoglycemia occurred in significantly fewer patients in the breakfast group compared with the dinner and bedtime groups. In the study of Karag&#x000fc;zel et al(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>) the administration of once daily insulin glargine at breakfast or bedtime was associated with a decreased risk of all type of hypoglycemic events. An insignificant increase of nocturnal hypoglycemia during the time interval t1 in the breakfast group could be due to incorrect adjustments of premeal insulin during dinner since this time interval corresponds to post meal.</p><p>The results of this study demonstrate that insulin glargine in combination with insulin lispro/aspart is equally effective on glycemic control whether it is injected once daily before breakfast or at bedtime in type 1 diabetic adolescents and children. There is no significant difference in the frequency or duration of hypo&#x02212; and hyperglycemia during the day and night irrespective of the timing of glargine injection except pre breakfast levels are significantly better in the bedtime group and hypoglycemia occurs in between midnight and 04:00 in the bedtime group.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
