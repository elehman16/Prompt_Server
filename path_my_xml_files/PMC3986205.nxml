<italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> resistant to current first-line anti-tuberculosis agents is a serious and growing global health threat, causing at least 444,000 new tuberculosis (TB) cases and 150,000 deaths annually <xref rid="pone.0094462-World1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Treatments for drug-resistant (DR) TB are inferior to those for drug-sensitive disease, with lower cure rates, reduced safety and tolerability, and prolonged treatment requirements. Oxazolidinone antimicrobials are increasingly viewed as candidates for inclusion in new regimens for DR-TB, as they have a distinct mechanism of action (binding to the 23S ribosome, thereby blocking microbial protein synthesis) without cross-resistance to existing TB drugs. However, in the case of linezolid, the only currently licensed oxazolidinone, serious hematologic and neurologic toxicities arise during long term use due to inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis that often require dose reduction or discontinuation <xref rid="pone.0094462-McKee1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094462-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Thus, for the promise of oxazolidinones for TB to be realized, new drugs in this class with superior efficacy and reduced toxicity must be developed.</p><p>Sutezolid (PNU-100480) is a thiomorpholinyl analog of linezolid with preliminary evidence for superior efficacy against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. In the mouse model, sutezolid shortens standard treatment by 1 month, whereas linezolid does not <xref rid="pone.0094462-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>; in the whole blood culture model, the maximal bactericidal activity of sutezolid (&#x02212;0.42 log/day) is more than twice that of linezolid (&#x02212;0.16 log/day, P&#x0003c;0.001) <xref rid="pone.0094462-Wallis1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Time-dependent killing has been reported in whole blood and hollow fibers <xref rid="pone.0094462-Wallis1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094462-Louie1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Bactericidal activity against intracellular mycobacteria is mainly due to the parent (PNU-100480), whereas a sulfoxide metabolite (PNU-101603) contributes significantly to activity against extracellular mycobacteria <xref rid="pone.0094462-Louie1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Phase 1 studies revealed no abnormal hematologic or biochemical findings, nor instances of peripheral or ophthalmic neuropathy, in healthy volunteers administered sutezolid 600 mg twice daily for 28 days <xref rid="pone.0094462-Wallis1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, potentially indicating a safety profile superior to similarly dosed linezolid.</p><p>In the present study, sutezolid was administered at doses of 600 mg twice daily or 1200 mg once daily for 14 days to patients with newly diagnosed drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis, to assess its safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and early bactericidal activity (EBA) in sputum. The main objective of the study was to determine if sutezolid treatment resulted in significant reduction in log sputum CFU counts with 5%&#x02013;95% confidence intervals that excluded zero. The study also examined bactericidal activity in <italic>ex vivo</italic> whole blood cultures infected with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (whole blood bactericidal activity or WBA), as well as resistance prevention in sputum (measured as changes in MICs during the treatment period).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Protocol</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094462.s002">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094462.s003">Protocol S1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Subjects</title><p>All subjects provided written informed consent according to ICH guidelines. Subjects consisted of men and women aged 18&#x02013;65 years, with chest radiographs consistent with pulmonary tuberculosis, positive sputum acid-fast smears, culture or molecular confirmation of drug-susceptible <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, random blood glucose &#x0003c;150 mg/dL, hemoglobin &#x0003e;8 g/dL, serum creatinine &#x0003c;2 mg/dL, AST &#x0003c;3x ULN, total bilirubin &#x0003c;1.3 mg/dL. Serologic testing was not performed for hepatitis B or C, nor were these exclusion criteria. Subjects were either HIV-1 uninfected, or HIV-1 infected with CD4 T cell counts &#x0003e;350/mm<sup>3</sup> and not currently receiving anti-retroviral therapy. Patients receiving monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, or adrenergic agonists such as pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine within the preceding 7 days were excluded (due to potential concerns regarding MAO-A inhibition), as were patients who had received drugs with anti-tuberculosis activity within the preceding 6 months, had a positive test for urinary isoniazid metabolite at the time of screening, or who had significant hemoptysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Treatments</title><p>After providing written informed consent, subjects were randomly assigned in blocks of 7&#x02013;9 to sutezolid 600 mg BID (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;25) or 1200 mg QD (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;25), or to a positive control of weight adjusted fixed dose combination tablets (Rifafour&#x000a9; e275; Sanofi-Aventis, Midrand, South Africa) consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (HRZE, N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;9). The purpose of this group was to ascertain comparability of laboratory methods to other EBA trials. Sutezolid was administered as 200 mg tablets. All treatments were administered on an inpatient basis. Neither subjects nor investigators were blinded to assigned treatment. Laboratory staff performing the sputum and whole blood assays was unaware of treatment allocation. After discharge all subjects were referred for a full course of standard antituberculosis treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Evaluations</title><p>Symptoms and physical exam were monitored daily. Electrocardiograms were obtained at baseline, day 1, and day 14. Routine blood and urine safety tests were monitored on days 1, 14, and 42. Pooled sputum samples were collected for 16 hrs on days &#x02212;1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14, beginning in the afternoon of the specified study day and continuing through the next morning. Days &#x02212;1 and 0 were considered baseline days for statistical calculations. Treatment began in the morning of day 1, after collection of the day 0 sputum sample was completed. Sputum specimens were stored on ice at the bedside during collection and transported to the central laboratory (Department of Biomedical Sciences, Stellenbosch University, Tygerberg, South Africa) at 4&#x000b0;C the next morning. Pooled specimens were homogenized by stirring for 30 minutes, then digested with an equal volume of Sputasol (Oxoid, Cambridge UK) at a final dithiothreitol concentration of 10%. An aliquot was removed and a series of 10-fold dilutions prepared in saline with Tween 80 for log CFU determination on 7H11 agar with Selectatab (polymyxin B, ticarcillin, amphotericin B, trimethoprim, MAST, Bootle, Merseyside, UK) added. Log CFU determinations were performed on specimens collected on days &#x02212;1, 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, and 14. A second aliquot was decontaminated with 1% NaOH-N-acetyl-L-cysteine, diluted with PBS and centrifuged at 4&#x000b0;C and 3000 g for 15 minutes. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended in 1.5 ml PBS. 500 &#x000b5;l of this was used to inoculate a Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT, Becton Dickinson, Sparks, USA) supplemented with OADC (oleic acid, albumin, dextrose, catalase) and PANTA (polymyxin B, amphotericin B, nalidixic acid, trimethoprim, azlocillin). MGITs were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C in a BACTEC MGIT 960 instrument until flagged positive or for a maximum of 42 days in case no growth was detected. Time to positivity (TTP) in MGIT cultures was recorded for all specimens. Contamination was excluded by placing one drop of positive liquid culture on a blood agar plate (NHLS, Cape Town, South Africa) and by incubating for 48 hours at 37&#x000b0;C without visible growth. Contaminated cultures were excluded from analysis.</p><p>Blood was collected for WBA on prior to treatment on day 1. Blood was collected for PK and WBA 8 and 12 hrs post dose on day 13, and at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6 hrs post dose on day 14. Plasma was separated immediately after collection and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C for PK determinations. Total plasma concentrations of PNU-100480 and PNU-101603 were determined using a validated LC-MS/MS method by Advion BioServices (Ithaca, NY, USA), as previously described <xref rid="pone.0094462-Wallis2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Blood for WBA was stored at room temperature with slow constant rotation until a full set of samples for a subject had been collected, at which time they were transported to the laboratory. WBA against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv was determined as previously described <xref rid="pone.0094462-Wallis2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Briefly, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv was grown in MGIT and frozen in aliquots at &#x02212;80C. A titration experiment determined the relationship between inoculum size and TTP, and identified the volume positive in 5.5 days. Whole blood cultures consisted of heparinized blood, an equal volume of RPMI 1640 tissue culture medium (Highveld Biological, Lyndhurst, South Africa), and mycobacteria from the specified volume of mycobacterial stock. After 72 hrs, cells were sedimented, the liquid phase removed, and blood cells disrupted by hypotonic lysis. Bacilli were recovered and inoculated into MGIT and incubated until flagged as positive. Log change in viability was calculated as log(<italic>final</italic>) &#x02013; log(<italic>initial</italic>), where <italic>final</italic> and <italic>initial</italic> are the volumes corresponding to TTP of the completed cultures and its inoculum control, respectively, based on the titration curve. Results were expressed as log change per day of whole blood culture. Cumulative WBA over 24 hrs was calculated as the AUC<sub>0-24</sub>, and expressed as &#x00394;log/d&#x02022;d, or simply as log change.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing</title><p>MICs of sutezolid and its major metabolite were determined using MGIT. Sterile stock solutions of sutezolid and PNU-101603 10 mg/ml were prepared in DMSO. Testing was performed using a series of 2-fold reductions in drug concentrations from 4.0 to 0.062 &#x000b5;g/ml. Growth in drug-containing tubes was compared to that of a positive growth control in which the inoculum was diluted 1&#x02236;100 in saline. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of drug without growth (GU&#x0003c;100) at the time when growth was detected in the positive control.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Safety reporting</title><p>Specific guidance was provided to investigators for the identification of serious adverse events (SAEs), which were defined as those resulting in death, being life-threatening, requiring or prolonging hospitalization, resulting in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or resulting in congenital anomaly. Guidance was provided for classification of abnormal test results as adverse events and as well as criteria for laboratory abnormalities of potential clinical concern. Potential cases of drug-induced liver injury were defined by Hy's criteria <xref rid="pone.0094462-Temple1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. AE severity was clinically assessed as mild, moderate, or severe according to the extent to which it interfered with the subject's usual function (none, partially, or significantly). The accuracy of all entered study data was verified by independent study monitors.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistics</title><p>The sample size for the sutezolid arms was selected to have 80% power to detect a change from baseline in sputum log<sub>10</sub> CFU/mL from baseline to day 2 of &#x02212;0.18 (equal to that observed for linezolid 600 mg QD), using a one-sided test at the 0.05 significance level, and assuming between subject variability (SD) of 0.35 <xref rid="pone.0094462-Dietze1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094462-Rustomjee1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Sputum log<sub>10</sub> CFU/ml was analyzed by mixed effects model repeated measures analysis (MMRM), using fixed effects for treatment, baseline values, study day as a categorical variable, and study day by treatment interaction, and a random effect for subject with unstructured within subject covariances (unstructured to allow for its full estimation from present data). Rates of change from baseline to day 2, from day 2 to 14, and from baseline to day 14 were examined. Additional analyses of sputum log<sub>10</sub> CFU/ml were conducted using ANCOVA of change from beginning to end of each period, using ANCOVA of changes based on regression slope, and using mixed effects model repeated measures analysis with day as a regression variable. 90% confidence limits (5%&#x02013;95%) were calculated to be consistent with a one-sided test at the 0.05 significance level. Changes in MGIT TTP were analyzed similarly. Cumulative WBA was analyzed by an ANCOVA with fixed effects for treatment and baseline, and a random effect for subject. MIC results were analyzed post-treatment vs. pre-treatment post hoc, separately for parent/metabolite and BID/QD schedules due to different characteristics and data distributions, by generalized linear mixed model repeated measures analysis (GLMMRM), using multinomial cumulative logit link with proportional odds. GLMMRM is potentially a more sensitive test in the case of missing data. A nonparametric sign test was also performed post hoc on MIC results as a sensitivity analysis, as a more conservative method. Two-sided testing was used on these post hoc analyses. There was no multiplicity adjustment for tests in different datasets.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Ethical review</title><p>This study received ethical approval from the University of Cape Town Faculty of Health Sciences Human Research Ethics Committee, Cape Town, South Africa, and from Pharma-Ethics, Lyttelton Manor, South Africa.

A listing of all treatment-emergent adverse events of all potential causes can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094462.s001">table S1</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first study of sutezolid in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. The main findings were that doses of 600 mg BID and 1200 mg QD given for 14 days were generally safe, well tolerated, and resulted in readily detectable bactericidal activity in both sputum and blood. Its effects in sputum were sustained throughout the full period of treatment. These findings support further development of sutezolid as a component of new tuberculosis regimens.</p><p>Prior studies have separately examined the mycobactericidal activity of linezolid in sputum and blood. One study in a total of 19 TB patients found linezolid 600 mg BID and 600 mg QD produced effects approaching statistical significance of &#x02212;0.26 and &#x02212;0.18 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/ml/day, respectively, during the first 2 days of treatment, but not subsequently <xref rid="pone.0094462-Dietze1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In contrast, the present study found no significant effect on sputum CFU counts during the first 2 days of treatment, but did find a significant, sustained effect subsequently. Effects during early TB treatment are thought to represent activity against extracellular, metabolically active bacilli in cavities. This bacillary subpopulation is critical for TB transmission and for the emergence of resistance, but it appears not to be involved in persistence and relapse. The sustained activity of sutezolid observed in the present trial may indicate enhanced ability to sterilize tissues and thereby shorten the required duration of treatment, as has been shown in the mouse model <xref rid="pone.0094462-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, there is no evidence at present to indicate a relationship between EBA during the first 2 weeks of TB treatment and the total duration required for relapse-free cure <xref rid="pone.0094462-Wallis3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>This trial is the first in which intracellular bactericidal activity in blood of TB patients has been assessed in parallel with that in sputum. Sutezolid and its main metabolite appear to act against distinct mycobacterial subpopulations. <italic>In vitro</italic>, extracellular killing is mainly due to the metabolite, whereas killing of intracellular mycobacteria, such as in the whole blood model, is mainly due to the parent <xref rid="pone.0094462-Louie2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094462-Converse1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Sutezolid shows superior activity <italic>vs</italic>. linezolid in the whole blood model <xref rid="pone.0094462-Wallis1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In one study, whole blood bactericidal activity during TB treatment correlated with 2 month sputum culture status <xref rid="pone.0094462-Wallis4" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, which in turn is a predictor of relapse <xref rid="pone.0094462-Wallis5" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Longer trials will be required to better assess the sterilizing activity of sutezolid and to determine the required duration of new sutezolid-containing regimens. Future trials may also consider studying each patient using his or her own isolate in whole blood culture to enhance its predictive value <xref rid="pone.0094462-Wallis4" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>The mycobactericidal activity of sutezolid in the whole blood and hollow fiber models is mainly dependent on time rather than concentration <xref rid="pone.0094462-Wallis1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094462-Louie2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Given this observation, the relatively short plasma half-lives of both the parent and metabolite (approximately 4 hrs) ordinarily would favor divided rather than single daily dosing. In the present study, divided dosing tended to show superior bactericidal activity in blood, although this at best was only at the threshold of statistical significance. This trial was neither intended nor powered to detect a difference between single and divided daily dosing. Longer clinical trials will be required to determine the potential clinical impact of single <italic>vs</italic>. divided daily dosing when sutezolid is combined with other TB drugs in novel regimens.</p><p>Prevention of resistance is an essential characteristic of TB drugs. Experience with linezolid indicates this characteristic may be distinct from EBA, as linezolid lacks sustained EBA <xref rid="pone.0094462-Dietze1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, yet shows remarkable ability to prevent acquired resistance even when added as a single new drug to a failing regimen <xref rid="pone.0094462-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. No conclusion can be drawn regarding the MIC findings in this trial due to the post-hoc nature of the analysis and the relatively small magnitude of observed increases. However, EBA trials are intended to closely study a small number of subjects during a short period of treatment so as to inform the design of future trials. Studies of sutezolid in the hollow fiber model have reported similarly reduced bactericidal activity and earlier emergence of resistance with simulated once daily dosing <xref rid="pone.0094462-Louie1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Pre- and post-treatment MIC testing should be considered to assess resistance prevention in future EBA trials.</p><p>Peak concentrations of sutezolid and its main metabolite in TB patients in this study equaled those observed in previous studies in healthy volunteers, whereas total exposure to the parent was reduced by one-quarter. This decreased exposure appears to be the cause of the reduced bactericidal activity in whole blood cultures at later time points in patients as compared to those previously reported in healthy volunteers <xref rid="pone.0094462-Wallis1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Macrophage production of oxygen radicals is increased in TB as part of the antimycobacterial host response. Non-enzymatic oxidation may contribute to sutezolid metabolism. Further studies are warranted to determine whether the rate of metabolic clearance of sutezolid slows as inflammation resolves during TB treatment, as this may restore intracellular bactericidal activity to levels observed in volunteers.</p><p>Mild to moderate increases in hepatic alanine aminotransferase were observed in 14% of sutezolid-treated subjects in this study. In contrast, ALT levels had remained within the normal range in all subjects during phase 1 studies of sutezolid in healthy volunteers. Early, mild, transient, asymptomatic increases in liver enzymes are common in patients treated with anti-TB drugs <xref rid="pone.0094462-Singanayagam1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. There is increasing evidence that these represent heightened susceptibility to oxidative liver injury due to depletion of glutathione, which ordinarily protects against such damage. Intracellular stores of glutathione are depleted, and the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione diminished, following experimental <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection of guinea pigs <xref rid="pone.0094462-Palanisamy1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Glutathione levels are low in TB patients, with the lowest levels occurring in those patients who go on to experience TB drug-induced liver injury <xref rid="pone.0094462-Chowdhury1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094462-Vijayamalini1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Cysteine availability is the limiting step in glutathione synthesis. A small prospective randomized trial reported that TB drug-induced liver injury could be prevented by supplementation with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) <xref rid="pone.0094462-Baniasadi1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. A study of NAC may be considered to reduce overall risk in future trials of new TB drugs, including sutezolid.</p><p>In summary, this first trial of the oxazolidinone sutezolid in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis found the drug to be generally safe, well tolerated, and with readily detectable bactericidal activity in sputum and blood. Further studies of this promising compound are warranted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0094462.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
