Parents or guardians of all enrolled infants gave their written, informed consent for participation in the study, which was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. A total of 200 full-term jaundiced neonates with ABO incompatibility, Rh incompatibility, or both were divided randomly using the odd and equal numbers of the admission sequence into two groups: the phenobarbital plus phototherapy treated group (<italic>n</italic> = 100), and the phototherapy-alone group (<italic>n</italic> = 100). Infants in the phenobarbital plus phototherapy group received an oral dose of 2.5 mg/kg phenobarbital every 12 hours for 3 days (this was dispensed in linctus simplex in a concentration of 1 mg/mL) in addition to phototherapy, while the neonates in the phototherapy-only group received phototherapy with the same amount of the linctus simplex but without phenobarbital. Crossover was not allowed between groups.</p><p>The sample size was calculated based on 95% confidence interval, absolute accuracy of 0.1, and sensitivity of 80%.</p><p>All enrolled infants met the following criteria: full term, less than 8 days of life, birth weight between 2.5 and 4.0 kg, ABO or Rh incompatibility or both, total serum bilirubin &#x02264;20 mg/dL, direct bilirubin &#x0003c;1.5 mg/dL, PCV &#x02265; 35%, on breast milk, negative C-reactive protein (CRP) on admission, no dysmorphic features or congenital abnormalities, no signs or symptoms of neonatal sepsis requiring the administration of antibiotics, and no other medical conditions.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included the following: parents&#x02019; wish to stop the study or if the baby was discharged against medical advice; the newborn infant showing increase in the liver enzymes, apnea, or respiratory arrest; hypotension, feeding intolerance, hypoactivity, or irritability; or positive blood culture after 48 hours of admission.</p><p>The primary outcomes of the study were to evaluate the effect of phenobarbital on total serum bilirubin of newborns with IHD and its impact on the blood exchange transfusion rate. Two methods were used to test the effectiveness of phenobarbital: (1) the total serum bilirubin in both groups, and (2) the number of infants needed blood exchange transfusion in each group.</p><p>The effects of subtypes of IHD, sex, and positive direct Coombs test (DCT) on the response to the treatment and the effect of treatment on rebound hyperbilirubinemia were studied as secondary outcomes.</p><p>Total serum bilirubin, direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and PCV were measured at the beginning and at 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 hours after the initiation of treatment, and 24 hours after the treatment was stopped.</p><p>The decision to start phototherapy and phenobarbital was made on the basis of the age of the baby in hours and serum total bilirubin (STB) levels, as per the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for phototherapy.</p><p>Phototherapy was stopped when the STB level fell to 2 mg/dL or below the level at which phototherapy would be indicated for that age. Significant bilirubin rebound (SBR) was defined as post-phototherapy bilirubin level needing reinstitution of phototherapy.</p><p>Conventional standard-irradiance-level Fluorolite phototherapy units (A Drager and Siemens Company) were used for all included infants.</p><p>The phenobarbital dose was double-checked by a neonatologist and a registered nurse before it was given to the babies. All blood samples were drawn by a registered nurse and sent to the local laboratory at Prince Hashem Military Hospital and Queen Alia Military Hospital. All enrolled infants were attended to and examined on a daily basis by the neonatologist.</p><p>Blood exchange transfusion was done based on the total serum bilirubin, as per American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for blood exchange in hospitalized infants.</p><p>The newborn with IHD was the unit of analysis in this study. A descriptive statistical study was carried out on the measured variables. Some data collected in this prospective study were parametric and others nonparametric. The <italic>t</italic>-test, odds ratio (OR), and two-sided 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used when dealing with proportions. CI calculations were used to analyze the results.

Here we would like to mention that Wong et al.<xref rid="b21-cmped-9-2015-067" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, while comparing the relative roles of phototherapy and phenobarbitone in the treatment of non-hemolytic neonatal jaundice, also did not consider it ethical to have controls.</p><p>Those newborns who required antibiotics were excluded in our study, as it is a well known fact that some antibiotics can displace bilirubin from bonding to albumin, causing increases in the TSB, and thus can affect the results of the study.</p><p>Wong et al, based on on the findings of Waltman et al.<xref rid="b29-cmped-9-2015-067" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, explained the decrease in TSB in the phenobarbital groups in different studies by administering phenobarbitone in an elixir of linctus simplex that contained 36% ethanol, which is as an enzyme inducer as phenobarbital. In our study, both groups were given the same amount of linctus simplex to exclude its effect on the results as previously done by Levin et al.<xref rid="b22-cmped-9-2015-067" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Our study showed that the use of phenobarbital in combination with phototherapy compared to phototherapy alone in established hyperbilirubinemia of IHD of the newborn caused a rapid decrease in the total serum bilirubin, which was associated statistically and clinically with a significant decrease in blood exchange transfusion rate. However, two important studies by Wong et al.<xref rid="b21-cmped-9-2015-067" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and Nazer et al.<xref rid="b30-cmped-9-2015-067" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, which compared the effect of combination therapy with the effect of montherapy on TSB, contradict our findings. This difference could be explained by the fact that both earlier studies were conducted on small numbers of patients with non-hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia. Moreover, Nazer et al studied the effect of both types of therapy in patients with congenital enzyme deficiency (Crigler&#x02013;Najjar syndrome type I), where one would not expect to observe any effect from the combination of the enzyme inducer (phenobarbitone) and phototherapy. Another factor that could have affected the results of Wong&#x02019;s et al&#x02019;s study was that they underestimated sepsis and they had two deaths due to neonatal septicemia, whereas in our study patients with positive CRP and/or with any sign of sepsis requiring the use of antibiotics were excluded, as sepsis is a well-known cause of exaggerated hyperbilirubinemia. The possibility of variable dose, absorption, or vomiting of oral medication cannot also be excluded.</p><p>In general, data from our study indicate that sex has no effect on the rate of exchange transfusion, comparing both groups. It also shows that newborn infants with ABO incompatibility, in general, are subject to more exchange transfusion, while those with the ABO+Rh incompatibility undergo less exchange transfusions.</p><p>The impact of DCT on the rate of exchange transfusion has not been discussed in any similar study before, but in our study and, in general, in both negative and positive DCT newborn infants with hemolytic disease of the newborn the rate of exchange transfusion is higher in those who are treated with phototherapy alone, and the risk of patients with positive DCT to undergo exchange transfusion is very high in comparison to those with negative DCT. But at the same time, there is no significant difference between phototherapy-only versus phenobarbital and phototherapy on the need for exchange transfusion in patients with positive DCT.</p><p>Another finding that was not mentioned earlier but noted in our study is that the newborns treated with phenobarbital in combination with phototherapy developed significantly less rebound of bilirubin than those who were treated with phototherapy alone.</p><p>Our study, unlike Wong et al&#x02019;s, showed the effect of not only phenobarbital and phototherapy on the mean total serum bilirubin but also other liver enzymes (ALP, ALT, and AST).</p><p>Finally, this study showed that phenobarbital is a safe drug at least in the same amount and duration that was used in this study, as data from our study showed that only three newborn infants from the phenobarbital and phototherapy group were excluded due to possible side effects of phenobarbital (hypotension and feeding intolerance).</p><p>The single limitation of the study is that it was not designed to evaluate any long-term side effects of phenobarbital.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In limited-resource settings, phenobarbital in combination with phototherapy may help newborn infants with IHD, as it results in a faster decline in total serum bilirubin, and thus may decrease the need for blood exchange transfusion than phototherapy alone. Further studies are needed to evaluate any adverse effects and neurodevelopmental outcome of this therapeutic strategy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Dr. Shakkoury Ghassan, Professor of Pediatrics, Jordanian Ministry of Health, for help in conducting the statistical analysis and editing this paper.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="fn1-cmped-9-2015-067"><p><bold>ACADEMIC EDITOR:</bold> Praveen Kumar, Editor in Chief</p></fn><fn id="fn2-cmped-9-2015-067"><p><bold>PEER REVIEW:</bold> Two peer reviewers contributed to the peer review report.
