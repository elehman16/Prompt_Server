As invasive treatment for PDPH has known complications, pharmacologic management may be preferable. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of combining administration of intravenous aminophylline and dexamethasone on PDPH in patients who underwent lower extremity surgery in comparison with using either drug alone and also comparing them with placebo.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>One hundred and forty patients, aged 20-65 years, scheduled for lower extremity surgery in Alzahra University Hospital under spinal anesthesia were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients were divided into four groups of 35 each and received aminophylline 1.5 mg/kg i.v. (group A), dexamethasone 0.1 mg/kg (group D), aminophylline 1.5 mg/kg plus dexamethasone 0.1 mg/kg i.v.

Therefore, we designed this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effects of combining administration of intravenous aminophylline with intravenous dexamethasone on PDPH in patients who underwent lower extremity surgery in comparison with using either drug alone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>One hundred and forty American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I-II patients, aged 20-65 years, scheduled for lower extremity surgery under spinal anesthesia gave written informed consent to participate in this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, which was approved by our institute ethics committee. The patients with history of migraine or other type of headache, previous intolerance to the aminophylline or dexamethasone administration, or who had received any analgesic within 24 h before surgery were not included in this study. The patients with any unpredictable condition in surgery or any complication such as severe hypotension [whenever systolic blood pressure (SBP) was reduced more than 25% of baseline] or with more intraoperative vasopressor drug requirement were excluded.</p><p>No premedication was given to the patients. Before surgery, the patients were informed about using visual analog scale (VAS), ranging from 0 (none) to 10 (worst possible pain), for evaluation of their headache. By using a computer-generated random number table, patients were randomly allocated to one of four groups (<italic>n</italic> = 35 for each group) as follows: group A received aminophylline 1.5 mg/kg i.v.; group D received dexamethasone 0.1 mg/kg i.v.; group AD received aminophylline 1.5 mg/kg i.v. plus dexamethasone 0.1 mg/kg i.v.; and group P received saline (placebo) i.v. 15 min before the end of the surgery. A nurse anesthetist prepared identical syringes containing either normal saline or the study medications for each subject. All medications were 5 ml in volume and were given i.v. 15 min before the end of the surgery. The patients and the investigator who collected all data were blinded to the group randomization.</p><p>After the patients arrived to the operating room, noninvasive arterial blood pressure [systolic arterial pressure (SAP), diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP)], heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and Pulse Oximeter Oxygen Saturation (SpO2) level were monitored.</p><p>Prior to spinal anesthesia, all patients received 20 ml/kg Ringer's lactate as preloading fluid.</p><p>Spinal anesthesia was performed with 3 ml of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% (15 mg) at L3-L4 interspace with a 23-gauge Quincke spinal needle after local infiltration of 3 ml of 2% xylocaine.</p><p>[Several factors have been shown to be important contributors to the risk for PDPH, including needle size and type. Small-bore (high-gauge) needles have been shown to reduce the risk of PDPH[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Smaller needle sizes increase the failure rate of the lumbar puncture because they are more difficult to use.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] So, for avoiding of multi puncture, we used 23-gauge needle]. Positive aspiration of clear CSF before and after the injection confirmed correct needle placement. All patients received IV infusion of midazolam 0.05 mg/kg for light sedation during spinal anesthesia.</p><p>Demographic data of patients (age, gender, weight), ASA physical status, types of operation, duration of surgery (the time from beginning of surgery till the closure of the last suture), duration of anesthesia (the time from spinal anesthesia till two segment regression of sense), and post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) stay time (the time from arrival of patients to the PACU till discharge from it) were recorded.</p><p>The incidences of PDPH, complete response, and the severity of PDPH were evaluated at 6-48 h after arrival to the ward in the four groups. If patients had intolerable headache, acetaminophen 15 mg i.v. was administered.</p><p>If the headache did not respond to the routine measures, invasive procedures such as epidural blood patch or epidural saline injection may be used,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] but fortunately, none of our patients needed these invasive procedures.</p><p>If patients had no PDPH throughout the 48 h, it was considered as a complete response.</p><p>By using VAS score, PDPH was evaluated at 6-48 h after arrival to the ward. Acetaminophen 15 mg/kg i.v. was administered if the patients had VAS score of &#x0003e;5 cm and the total dose of rescue analgesic was recorded.</p><p>The sample size was estimated based on a power calculation, which showed that 35 patients per group was necessary to achieve 80% power with &#x003b1; = 0.05. Data are presented as mean (SD), numbers, or median.</p><p>Differences among groups&#x02019; mean were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and <italic>post-hoc</italic> comparisons at various points in time were made by using Bonferroni's type I error rate correction for multiple tests of significance. Repeated measure analysis of variance was used for analysis of continuous variables. Categorical variables were analyzed by Pearson chi-square test, and by Fisher's exact test when the anticipated number was &#x0003c;5. Mann &#x02014; Whitney U-test was used as appropriate. The difference in median sedation level among the four groups was analyzed by the Kruskal &#x02014; Wallis test. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was set as statistically significant.

Risk factors of PDPH are age, female sex, pregnancy, history of headache or previous PDPH, type of operative procedure, technique of spinal anesthesia, and several attempts for dural puncture.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>In our study, all these factors were matched well among the four groups.

It is possible that when we use two anti-cephalgics with different mechanisms of action, only their anti-cephalgic effects are increased.</p><p>Methylxanthines, such as caffeine and theophylline, have been shown to resolve the symptoms of PDPH. The exact mechanism of action of caffeine in PDPH is unknown. PDPH is believed to be caused by adenosine-induced cerebral vasodilatation, and caffeine may act by antagonizing adenosine, thus leading to cerebral vasoconstriction.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Theophylline is thought to have the same mechanism of action as caffeine (i.e. antagonizing adenosine, thereby causing cerebral vasoconstriction) and is used in combination with aminophylline for the treatment of PDPH; it is more commonly available as compared with caffeine.</p><p>The adverse effects that were observed in our study were not serious, and there was no significant difference among the four groups. A limitation of our study was the difficulty of using VAS and also the validity of that.</p><p>There are still many questions regarding the use of small dose of aminophylline in combination with dexamethasone for PDPH prophylaxis that must be answered. For example, the proper dose of this combination has not been investigated. Also, the optimum timing of administration of combined use of two drugs has not been clearly explained.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our study showed that intravenous administration of 1.5 mg/kg aminophylline plus 0.1 mg/kg dexamethasone significantly reduced PDPH better than using either drug alone in patients who underwent lower extremity surgery under spinal anesthesia. It is necessary to perform additional studies to determine the timing and safety of using combination therapy with different dosing schedules before final conclusion can be elicited.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We would like to express our gratitude to all those who made it possible to complete this research.
