The vast majority of these subjects require long-term oral anticoagulation for prevention of thromboembolism with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) or nonvitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOAC) such as apixaban, a direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Apixaban has been shown to be superior to VKA regarding thromboembolic events and bleeding complications in patients with AF.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup></p><p>Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and a P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor inhibitor such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor has become a mainstay of the treatment in patients for secondary prevention after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to lower the risk of stent thrombosis.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Ticagrelor, a reversible P2Y<sub>12</sub> antagonist, has demonstrated a superior risk/benefit profile compared to clopidogrel and is also considered to reduce the incidence of coronary stent thrombosis.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup></p><p>AF patients who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) require additional antiplatelet therapy. However, an optimal antithrombotic strategy for AF patients with PCI is not established. Retrospective data have shown that a triple therapy with DAPT + VKA is associated with an increased bleeding risk, but withholding oral anticoagulation increases thromboembolic events.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> Thus, recommendations from different guidelines are controversial. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) suggests antithrombotic triple therapy for at least 1 month after PCI,<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> whereas the American College of Cardiology Foundation/ American Heart Association (ACC/ AHA) is more reserved in recommending a regimen with VKA + ASA + clopidogrel.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> At present, the use of newer P2Y<sub>12</sub> antagonists as part of triple therapy combinations lacks clinical evidence.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> The WOEST trial has shown that AF patients that underwent PCI and received a dual therapy (VKA + clopidogrel) without ASA may benefit from a less intense pharmacological treatment, which resulted in a lower bleeding risk accompanied by similar rates of thrombotic events compared to a triple therapy.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Whether these positive effects can also be extrapolated to combinations of other anticoagulants is unknown.</p><p>Different experimental models such as the shed blood technique or the perfusion chamber method have been employed to investigate the (combined) effects of anticoagulants on biomarkers of platelet activation, thrombin generation, and thrombus size under physiologic conditions.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> The shed blood technique allows us to assess the hemostatic system activation in humans in vivo. This model utilizes standardized skin microvasculature incisions with collection of the emerging blood for assessment of platelet activation and thrombin formation.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup></p><p>The perfusion chamber model, as originally described by Badimon,<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> is an ex vivo model of thrombosis that enables us to study clot formation at low and high shear rates simulating flow conditions of the venous system and in stenosed arteries, respectively. Previous studies have shown that the size of a thrombus formed on a thrombogenic surface is directly correlated with D-dimer concentrations of the plasmin-digested clot.<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> Measurement of P-selectin has been evaluated as a biomarker to indicate the platelet content of the thrombus formed in the perfusion chamber.<sup>[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup></p><p>This trial aimed to investigate the effect of orally administered ticagrelor and apixaban with or without ASA in healthy volunteers on in vivo hemostatic system inhibition in shed blood and on thrombus formation in an ex vivo perfusion chamber model at high and low shear rate.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><p>Approval for the trial was provided by the Ethics Committee of the Medical University of Vienna, Austria (EK 1984/2013), and the national competent authority.

Subjects received ticagrelor (Brilique<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Astra Zeneca AB, S&#x000f6;dert&#x000e4;lje, Sweden) and apixaban (Eliquis<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Bristol-Myers Squibb/ Pfizer, Uxbridge, United Kingdom) without (study A; n = 20) or with ASA (Thrombo ASS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Lannacher Heilmittel GmbH, Lannach, Austria) (study B; n = 20) for 4 days to allow steady-state conditions on the fifth study day. A sequential study design was implemented as the Ethics Committee was concerned with safety aspects and required a detailed adverse event (AE) interim report before commencement of the triple therapy cohort (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Subjects were consecutively allocated to the study cohorts according to their screening number.</p><p>On study day 1, subjects received a loading dose of 180&#x0200a;mg ticagrelor in combination with apixaban 2.5&#x0200a;mg twice daily (bid) and a 300&#x0200a;mg loading dose ASA (only study B). From day 2 until day 4 ticagrelor 90&#x0200a;mg bid, apixaban 2.5&#x0200a;mg bid without (A) or with 100&#x0200a;mg ASA (B) was administered. On day 5 subjects received the medicines under investigation once (ASA only in study B) to assess steady-state trough (pre-dose) and expected peak conditions at 3&#x0200a;h postdosing. An end-of-study (EOS) visit was scheduled earliest 4 days after study drug discontinuation. The dose for apixaban was chosen according to the recommendations of the ESC guidelines<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> suggesting a lower dose intensity of NOAC in triple therapy combinations.

Two incisions, 5&#x0200a;mm long and 1&#x0200a;mm deep, were placed on the lateral aspect of the forearm parallel to the antecubital crease by using disposable standard bleeding time devices (Surgicutt<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; ITC, Edison, NJ). In order to avoid activation of platelets and coagulation factors due to skin contact, shed blood was collected directly from the edge of the skin at 15&#x0200a;seconds intervals over a period of 4 minutes using plastic pipette tips (Greiner Bio One International AG, Kremsm&#x000fc;nster, Austria). Four&#x0200a;minutes of sampling was chosen because it has been demonstrated that shed blood markers reach plateau levels within this period.<sup>[<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</sup> The blood from each incision site was transferred immediately into 2 separate ice-cooled plastic tubes containing 100&#x0200a;&#x003bc;L stop solution (3.8% sodiumcitrate, 0.5% indomethacin dissolved with ethanol, 10% aprotinin [400&#x0200a;&#x003bc;M, 10000&#x0200a;KIU/mL]; all from Sigma Aldrich, MO) to prevent further thrombin generation or platelet activation in the tubes.

For each experiment (low or high shear rate), 2 serially placed chambers with a longitudinal cylindrical hole to mimic rheological conditions for venous blood flow with an estimated shear rate of 212 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> or for moderately stenotic arterial flow (1690&#x0200a;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) were heated up to 37 &#x000b0;C. Each chamber contained a piece of a de-endothelialized pig aorta tunica media as the thrombogenic surface. Before the blood perfusions, the chambers were flushed with 0.9% sodium chloride to ensure that there were neither leaks nor air bubbles in the system. Subsequently, blood was drawn directly from the study participants from a cubital vein through an 18G cannula with a peristaltic pump (Masterflex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>&#x0200a;L/S&#x02122;, Cole-Parmer Instrument Company, IL) placed distal from the chambers.

Inhibition of &#x003b2;-TG release was similar after an acute dose during both dual and triple antithrombotic therapy but more pronounced at steady-state trough and peak conditions with the more intense combination treatment (ticagrelor + apixaban + ASA). Duration of antithrombotic therapy had no additional impact on TAT formation. In the ex vivo perfusion chamber, no effect on thrombus size (D-dimer) and its platelet content (P-selectin) could be detected.</p><p>We studied the impact of combined antithrombotic therapy by 2 different experimental approaches that have been used previously to determine pharmacodynamic effects of antithrombotic agents at the site of plug formation: in vivo, using the shed blood technique<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> and ex vivo, applying a perfusion chamber model.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</sup> Shed blood allows for assessment of hemostatic system activation in the microcirculation by local skin injury following tissue factor-induced blood coagulation.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> This approach has been shown to be more sensitive to distinguish pharmacodynamic differences than in vitro activation of venous blood.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> In contrast, the ex vivo perfusion chamber enables assessment of clots formed under physiologic flow conditions mimicking venous and arterial vessels by measurement of markers of thrombin generation and platelet disposition of the plasmin-digested thrombus.<sup>[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup></p><p>Our shed blood data suggest a similar efficiency of an acute ticagrelor loading dose + apixaban with or without ASA on platelet inhibition, whereas at steady-state conditions a triple therapy induces a stronger attenuation of &#x003b2;-TG release as compared with dual therapy. We have shown previously that ticagrelor and NOAC contribute additively and concentration dependent to platelet inhibition<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> indicating that ticagrelor loading combined with apixaban might have concealed the acute impact of ASA. This might be due to the potent effect of these novel antithrombotic medicines on inhibition of &#x003b2;-TG release resulting in similar changes between dual and triple anticoagulation. However, the magnitude of ticagrelor or apixaban on shed blood pharmacodynamics may differ at assessed time points due to different pharmacokinetics of the medicines under study.<sup>[<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]</sup></p><p>Changes in shed blood &#x003b2;-TG release at steady state with an apixaban dose of 2.5&#x0200a;mg bid in triple therapy combination are consistent with other antithrombotic triple therapy regimens of ticagrelor + ASA + (N)OAC at approved doses for AF in a comparable study cohort.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> Thus, it cannot be ruled out that administration of a higher apixaban dose may abrogate differences between triple and dual therapy at steady-state conditions due to a more potent apixaban-induced attenuation of &#x003b2;-TG. Although apixaban has not been tested so far using the shed blood technique, the apixaban dosing scheme in this study may also explain the inconsistency with previous data regarding the greater &#x003b2;-TG inhibition during an acute situation at 3&#x0200a;hours after therapy initiation with high doses of other NOAC such as dabigatran or rivaroxaban.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> However, similar apixaban concentrations between study cohorts in this trial suggest that the differences in &#x003b2;-TG at steady state are not affected by NOAC. As variations in ticagrelor plasma concentrations have been previously shown to be of little if any influence on shed blood markers in healthy male subjects during combined antithrombotic therapy,<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> we did not assess ticagrelor pharmacokinetics in this study. In conclusion, the differences in shed blood &#x003b2;-TG observed at steady state may be attributed to the additive effect of ASA in study cohort B.</p><p>As expected, TAT formation, that has been shown to be unaffected by platelet inhibitors in our previous trial, was similar across study cohorts at all assessed time points. The concentration-dependent inhibitory effect of apixaban on TAT formation is in agreement with other NOAC that showed a greater inhibition at higher doses.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> The discrepancy between venous pharmacodynamics, that were within (PT) or slightly above the normal range (aPTT), after NOAC administration and the sustained inhibition in shed blood thrombin generation may be explained by apixaban&#x02019;&#x02032;s mechanism of action and the different activation states of the coagulation system. Subendothelial in vivo tissue factor exposure results in an immediate activation of the clotting system at the site of plug formation with rapid and amplified thrombin generation.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> It is likely that apixaban, that targets free and prothrombinase complex bound FXa, more effectively attenuates pharmacodynamic markers at activated coagulation conditions (shed blood) than in a resting state (venous blood) where the amplification mechanism is less developed, smaller amounts of thrombin are generated, and apixaban's potential of direct FXa inhibition is not fully exploited accordingly.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]</sup> This is consistent with previous observations suggesting that traditional clotting assays may not be adequately sensitive for evaluation of the pharmacodynamic effects of apixaban.<sup>[<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]</sup></p><p>Similar to TAT formation, effects on shed blood volume data were not different between triple or dual antithrombotic therapy. This might indicate a comparable bleeding potential independent from ASA administration and would be in agreement with available data from a prospective trial in a population at risk.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> However, shed blood volume is subject to substantial between-subject variability and the study was not powered to detect group differences in this secondary outcome parameter. Furthermore, it is likely that conditions of plasmatic coagulation and platelet activation in the skin microvasculature differ from that seen in stenosed arteries due to higher shear rates in the arterial vascular bed. Thus, it remains unclear whether the observed similar effects on bleeding volumes across study cohorts represent a comparable safety profile of the treatment regimens under study as shed blood markers can only act as surrogates. Consequently, clinical evidence from trials evaluating these novel antithrombotic medicines in the subset of AF + ACS patients is required to confirm our findings.</p><p>In contrast to the shed blood model, we could not detect any treatment effect on thrombus size or thrombus platelet content in the ex vivo perfusion chamber at both low and high shear rates after administration of a dual or a triple therapy. This is at variance with other antithrombotic drugs such as enoxaparin, rivaroxaban, or clopidogrel<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</sup> and may have resulted from the high variability across study cohorts in the assessed outcome parameters and the low dose of apixaban administered. It cannot be ruled out that using a deendothelized pig aorta with irregularities at different degrees on the surfaces of the manually prepared strips have influenced clot formation during blood perfusion.</p><p>We conducted this trial in a healthy population rather than cardiac patients requiring antithrombotic triple therapy due to ethical concerns in discontinuing a pre-existing anticoagulation. Thus, it cannot be excluded that results in patients might differ due to impaired hepatic or renal function and the inter- and intra-subject variability in patients with AF and ACS is probably larger than in this healthy cohort under study.</p><p>Our results suggest that in an acute situation a loading dose of ticagrelor in combination with low-dose apixaban may be sufficient for rapid and sustained inhibition of both platelet and coagulation activation in patients. The shed blood model may provide insight into effective combinations of antithrombotic therapies to prevent thromboembolic events.</p><sec><label>4.1</label><title>Limitations</title><p>The trial was conducted in healthy volunteers. Thus, it remains unclear if our results can be extrapolated to a population at risk with concomitant medication and comorbidities that may affect the metabolism of the study drugs and their pharmacodynamic response. Additionally, short-term administration of a triple or a dual therapy did not induce major bleedings and the shed blood volume response was similar. We cannot conclude that these drug combinations have similar safety profiles as they have not been assessed during long-term treatment and it has not yet been confirmed that shed blood volume as a surrogate of bleeding correlates with clinical bleeds.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>A triple or dual therapy of ticagrelor and apixaban with or without ASA effectively inhibits platelet activation and thrombin generation at the site of plug formation in healthy subjects. Greater platelet inhibition was detected at steady-state conditions after administration of triple therapy. It remains unclear whether or not these differences affect the risk for clinical bleeds and further trials are required to confirm the finding of shed blood volume.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: &#x003b2;-TG = &#x003b2;-thromboglobulin, ACC/ AHA = American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association, ACS = acute coronary syndrome, AE = adverse event, AF = atrial fibrillation, ANOVA = analysis of variance, aPTT = activated partial thromboplastin time, ASA = acetylsalicylic acid, BMI = body mass index, DAPT = dual antiplatelet therapy, EOS = end-of-study, ESC = European Society of Cardiology, FXa = factor Xa, ICH = International Conference on Harmonisation, NOAC = nonvitamin K oral anticoagulants, PCI = percutaneous coronary intervention, PT = prothrombin time, SD = standard deviation, TAT = thrombin&#x02013;antithrombin complex, VKA = vitamin K antagonists.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Authorship: SW&#x02014;drafting of the manuscript, statistical analysis and interpretation of data; BL&#x02014;statistical analysis and interpretation of data; SB, MR, and SK&#x02014;acquisition of data and analysis of data; PAK and MW&#x02014;study concept and design, statistical analysis and interpretation of data, critical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual content.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>Funding: this study was conducted with financial support from AstraZeneca (ISSBRIL0370), which had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>January</surname><given-names>CT</given-names></name><name><surname>Wann</surname><given-names>LS</given-names></name><name><surname>Alpert</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
