The instrument was designed to provide an objective measure to assist researchers and oversight committees in balancing the need to (1) protect the right of individuals to decide for themselves whether to participate and (2) protect the collective rights of vulnerable individuals for ethical and regulatory imperatives. The assessment was not designed to address other important components of capacity such as appreciation of the significance of the decision, reasoning, or expression of choice. These elements were components of the investigator's judgment of capacity that were separate from our capacity assessment.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Objectives</title><p>The objectives of this study were to (1) assess the associations between capacity to consent as determined by site investigators and an objective measure of a participant's understanding of the study, demographics, and cognitive and functioning assessments at the time of consent; and (2) examine the relationship between capacity to consent as determined by the site investigator and a participant's perceived understanding of the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Study design</title><p>This informed consent study was incorporated in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Cooperative Studies Program placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of alpha-tocopherol, memantine, and the combination vs. placebo on clinical progression in patients with AD (CSP#546). Details regarding the CSP#546 design and study results have been published <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Briefly, mild-to-moderate AD patients were randomized to receive one of the four treatments. The mean (SD) follow-up time was 2.3 (1.2) years with treatment duration ranging from 6 to 48&#x000a0;months. The study was approved by the IRB at each of the 14 participating VA medical centers.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Patients</title><p>Veterans with possible or probable AD of mild-to-moderate severity (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] total score between 12 and 26 inclusive) were recruited from 14 VA medical centers between August 2007 and March 2012 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

This study-specific tool was developed to provide a simple, consistent, and objective measure of both understanding and perceived understanding to assist investigators in their assessment of capacity.<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Informed Consent Questionnaire.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0010">Fig.&#x000a0;1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p><p>During the informed consent process, study coordinators and/or site investigators described the CSP#546 study, its purpose and procedures, and the risks and benefits of participation. Patients and caregivers were given an opportunity to read and take home the informed consent document and ask questions. Before completing the consent process, patients were asked to complete the ICQ without assistance from their caregivers. Questionnaire responses were reviewed with the patient, and all items answered incorrectly were clarified. After the discussion, the ICQ was readministered. If the participant was able to adequately understand the study on the first or second administration and/or the investigator believed that the participant had adequate decisional capacity and was making a voluntary decision, the participant was judged to have capacity to consent. If it was determined that the participant lacked capacity, the investigator requested assent from the patient and proxy consent from a surrogate. While the ICQ was used by investigators as a tool to help determine capacity, the final decision was ultimately based on the primary site investigator's clinical judgment. The decision about capacity was also carried out according to (1) local VA policy, which typically requires consultation with an independent clinician if it is determined that an individual may not have capacity, and (2) state laws, which vary and typically only address court-appointed legally authorized representatives and surrogate decision makers.</p><p>If a participant with adequate decisional capacity at enrollment appeared to have lost capacity during follow-up, or his/her cognitive function declined to a severe level (defined as MMSE &#x0003c;15), the site investigator repeated the informed consent process and sought surrogate consent if needed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><label>2.5</label><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome measures were (1) the clinical investigator's determination of a patient's capacity to consent and (2) the ICQ measurement of a patients' knowledge and understanding of the information in the consent form as well as his/her subjective beliefs about understanding. The first 14 questions of the ICQ tested understanding of the important elements of the study including potential benefits and risks. To be judged to have capacity as measured by the ICQ, the participant had to answer 70% of questions 1 to 10 and 100% of questions 11 to 14 correctly on the first or second administration. With input from the human rights committee at the coordinating center, the questions and the scoring algorithm were developed by the study's planning committee based solely on face validity. The ICQ and its scoring were also reviewed and approved by the IRBs at each participating site.</p><p>The ICQ included the assessment of participants' perceived understanding, that is, participants' beliefs about their understanding, and whether they felt the benefits and risks were adequately explained. Perceived understanding was assessed with ICQ items 15 to 17 derived from the validated ICQ-4 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The score for each of these questions ranged from 0 to 3 (total score range: 0&#x02013;9).</p><p>The primary outcome measure of the CSP#546 study was the AD Cooperative Study/Activities of Daily Living (ADCS/ADL) inventory to assess functional abilities <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

Sensitivity analyses examining different criteria for determining a &#x0201c;passing&#x0201d; ICQ score on the level of agreement were also conducted. The associations between capacity, demographics, ICQ perceived understanding scores, and the AD cognitive and functioning measures were analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. All tests of significance were conducted at the 5% level without correction for multiplicity.

We found that the strength of the agreement between the ICQ score and the clinical investigator's determination of capacity was &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; (&#x003ba; 0.60) <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. A stronger agreement was expected because all investigators reviewed the ICQ as part of their determination of capacity. When examining differences between investigators' and the ICQs' determinations of capacity, we found significant differences in perceived understanding scores, which may indicate that investigators gave less weight to participants' perceptions about their understanding when determining capacity. Nevertheless, the ICQ was widely accepted and many investigators reported that it was very helpful, particularly in patients with milder impairments. Several of the IRBs involved in the study expressed their support for using the ICQ noting the need for more objective measures to assess capacity.</p><p>Significant associations were found between the investigators' determination of capacity and perceived understanding, educational level, race, and AD assessments. The association between race and capacity remained significant after controlling for severity level, education, and ICQ scores. It is unclear whether there was any racial bias in the assessment of capacity or whether race was a proxy for another important unmeasured variable related to capacity or the need for surrogate consent, such as socioeconomic status, social support, or social networks <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. It is also possible that racial differences in capacity were related to racial differences in literacy, quality of education, comorbidities, or specific aspects of AD progression that are not fully controlled for by the study's cognitive or functional assessments <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>Cognitive impairment measured by the MMSE and the ADAS-cog were both significantly related to capacity in univariate and multivariate analysis. This finding is similar to a study that found that the level of cognitive functioning measured by the MMSE was the best predictor of decisional capacity <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. There is also some evidence that clinicians' assessment of capacity in AD is partially related to particular aspects of a patients' cognitive function such as conceptualization and memory functioning <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In our study, although the MMSE was significantly related to capacity, it did not fully differentiate participants' capacity to consent. Of the participants with moderate AD (MMSE 12&#x02013;19), 52% were determined to still have capacity, whereas 15% of those with mild AD (MMSE 20&#x02013;26) were determined to lack capacity. This is similar to other studies that have shown that individuals with cognitive impairment may still have sufficient capacity to give informed consent <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In a study of 176 individuals with mild-to-moderate dementia in the United Kingdom, 24% were unable to give informed consent according to the country's legal criteria and the MMSE was not a significant predictor of capacity in multivariate analyses <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. It is unknown whether the use of the ICQ in this study was causally related to the somewhat unusual findings of 52% of moderate cases being assessed as having capacity or if cognitive measures are insufficient by themselves to determine AD patients' capacity and that more individualized considerations of capacity are warranted <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>The time caregivers spend aiding AD patients with their&#x000a0;day-to-day activities was also significantly related to capacity&#x000a0;in multivariate-adjusted analyses. The ADCS/ADL functional assessment, however, was only significantly associated with capacity in the unadjusted analysis, indicating the measure did not independently add to the prediction in&#x000a0;the adjusted analyses. Caregiver time, a proxy measure of the independence&#x000a0;of the patient, may better capture the relationship between a patient's functioning level and his/her capacity&#x000a0;to consent. The severity of psychological and behavioral problems&#x000a0;was not significantly related to capacity in any of the analyses.</p><p>The ICQ was developed to test understanding of the CSP#546 study, specifically, and research participants' rights in general. The &#x0201c;passing grade&#x0201d; of 70% correct for questions 1 to 10 and 100% correct for 11 to 14 was based on the planning committee's and IRBs' assessments of what constituted a reasonable level of comprehension of the study and the necessity to fully understand information related to a participant's rights and the risks of participation. The sensitivity analyses on the cut point for an ICQ passing grade showed that lowering the requirement slightly increased the level of agreement between the ICQ and the investigators. We did not require a passing ICQ score because there is often a need to include a subjective assessment of capacity to take into account the unique circumstances and social support of individuals as well as their cognitive, communication, and insight abilities <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>We allowed two attempts to &#x0201c;pass&#x0201d; the ICQ to provide an opportunity to correct any misunderstandings and to more fully protect participants' autonomy. We believed that a third assessment or a repeated teach-to-goal strategy would have been inefficient and potentially frustrating for AD patients. In a study in nondemented patients who repeated the consent process and comprehension test until full understanding was achieved, only 28% of patients answered all comprehension questions correctly on the first administration <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. This increased to 80% on the second administration, suggesting that a second administration is beneficial and that the majority of individuals achieve understanding by the second test.</p><p>In addition to measuring actual understanding of the consent document, the ICQ included an assessment of participants' perceived understanding. Perceived understanding was significantly related to capacity in adjusted and unadjusted analyses. There was also a significant correlation between perceived and actual understanding on the ICQ, indicating that participants' perception of their understanding was related to their ability to correctly answer questions about the study; however, the correlation was not strong with only 33% to 36% of the overall variance in the number of correct answers explained by perceived understanding. This correlation was particularly weak in the group with capacity where only 6% to 8% of the variance was explained. A similar finding was seen in a non&#x02013;cognitively impaired population where no significant relationship was found between knowledge and perceptions of being well-informed <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. One factor that may contribute to this discordance in understanding is a possible disagreement between researchers and patients on what is the most important information to convey and understand <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Another possible factor is that AD patients often have diminished insight into their cognitive deficits; however, it is not known how impaired insight relates to performance on cognitive measures or measures of capacity <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Nevertheless, diminished insight is likely to impact a measure of perceived understanding and may make the measure less valuable in AD patients. Ideally, measures of actual and perceived understanding would not differ, but when they do, it is not clear which construct is more important or whether a participant should be entered into a study when they do differ. More research is needed on what should be done in these situations and whether assessing both perceived and actual understanding should be considered to fully respect a participant's autonomy while also protecting vulnerable individuals.</p><p>While there are some published instruments for assessing the informed consent process or understanding of consent documents, none are widely used in research <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. The MacArthur Competency Assessment Tool for Clinical Research (MacCAT-CR), however, has the most empirical data supporting its use in the clinical setting <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Results from a recent clinical trial of mild-to-moderate AD suggest that the use of the MacCAT-CR understanding subscale can help guide judgments about patient's capacity to consent in AD research <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. In another study in mild-to-moderate AD, however, the authors concluded that standardized assessment tools may not be that helpful <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. One reason for the lack of a widely accepted instrument is that research questions, study procedures, and other details of disclosure can vary widely among studies, and most published measures were either tailored to a specific trial or were for more general use. We felt that developing an instrument that measured patient's specific understanding of the CSP#546 study would better assist investigators in their determination of capacity and could be used to identify specific areas that were not understood so that education in those areas could be reinforced. Ideally, to better understand the ICQ's utility, a general measure such as the MacCAT-CR could also have been used in the study, and the investigator's assessment of capacity could have been done independently of the ICQ. However, due to practicality and the need for efficiency, a decision was made to use one simple questionnaire only to aid investigators in capacity assessment.</p><p>A limitation of this study was a nearly all-male population that may reduce generalizability to women. In addition, the ICQ and its cutoff score were based solely on face validity. Finally, although there were guidelines and training for administering the ICQ, a script was not provided for its administration or for introduction of the informed consent itself,&#x000a0;which may have led to increased variability in the ICQ scores and in the determination of capacity to consent.</p><sec id="sec4.1"><label>4.1</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study of informed consent capacity in an AD clinical trial, we found that the strength of agreement between the ICQ score and the clinical investigator's determination of capacity was &#x0201c;good.&#x0201d; We also found that there were significant associations between clinical assessment of capacity and cognitive impairment, caregiver time, race, and perceived understanding; however, these did not fully differentiate participants' capacity to consent.
