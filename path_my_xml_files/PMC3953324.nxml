While the majority of asthma management education for parents occurs in the clinical setting, increasingly, multifaceted environmental interventions to decrease asthma-like symptoms are delivered by community health workers <xref rid="pone.0090982-Postma1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Previous studies identified positive outcomes associated with community health worker-delivered interventions, including decreased asthma-like symptoms <xref rid="pone.0090982-Postma1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>In the Netherlands, growth, development and health of all children (0&#x02013;19 years) is monitored in a nationwide program with regular visits at set ages by well-child care physicians and nurses <xref rid="pone.0090982-Burgmeijer1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The nationwide program is offered free of charge by the government and participation is voluntary (attendance rate ca. 90%) <xref rid="pone.0090982-Ministry1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The well-child care setting creates an opportunity for tailored prevention and promotion of healthy child development. During well-child visits, among other topics that are relevant at the developmental stage of the child, the well-child professionals (medical doctors and nurses) should pay attention to the presence of asthma-like symptoms. However, until now, no systematic assessment of the presence of asthma-like symptoms in early childhood by well-child professionals has been applied at well-child centres in the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, the nationwide well-child care program advises to interview parents regarding environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure to preschool children <xref rid="pone.0090982-Ministry1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, information leaflets with regard to ETS exposure are not yet given routinely to parents of children aged 1 to 4 years who are exposed to ETS.</p><p>This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of systematic assessment of asthma-like symptoms and ETS exposure between age 1 and 4 years by well-child professionals. We hypothesised that systematic assessment of asthma-like symptoms and ETS exposure to parents of preschool children (and subsequent counselling such as providing information leaflets or arranging a referral when needed) reduces the prevalence of physician-diagnosed asthma ever and wheezing frequency, and improves fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO, a biomarker of airway inflammation), airway resistance (Rint) and HRQOL measurements at age 6 years. In addition to the study protocol <xref rid="pone.0090982-HafkampdeGroen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, we evaluated whether this approach resulted in a reduction of ETS exposure at home (&#x02018;ETS exposure at home ever&#x02019; measured at child age 6 years).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study is embedded in the Generation R Study, a prospective population-based cohort <xref rid="pone.0090982-Jaddoe1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, in collaboration with the regional well-child care organisation Centre for Youth and Family in Rotterdam. The Generation R Study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines proposed in the Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the Erasmus Medical Centre. All parents who participated in the Generation R Study provided written informed consent for the use of data regarding their child for research aimed at identifying factors influencing the health of young children. In this study, to evaluate the brief assessment form regarding asthma-like symptoms and ETS exposure applied by well-child professionals, we used data that were collected in the Generation R Study.

This study started in June 2005 and follow-up at age 6 years was completed in January 2012. In total, 7775 children (born between April 2002 and January 2006) entered the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090982-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Sixteen well-child centres that participated in the data collection of the Generation R Study were randomized into 8 well-child centres that applied the brief assessment form regarding asthma-like symptoms and ETS exposure at each regularly scheduled visit to the well-child centre between age 1 and 4 years, and 8 centres that applied usual care. First, the well-child centres were ranked (by researcher ADM) based on the socioeconomic status of their neighbourhood. Well-child centres in each subsequent couple in this list were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8) or the control group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8).

Details of this form were published previously <xref rid="pone.0090982-HafkampdeGroen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In summary, with regard to asthma-like symptoms the brief form included items on wheezing, and shortness of breath or dyspnea. Furthermore, the form included an item that assessed whether the child had been exposed to ETS during the past year (no, yes-sometimes, yes-on a regular basis, yes-often or daily, unknown).</p><p>When parents reported that their child had at least 3 episodes of any asthma-like symptoms during the past 12 months and at least 1 episode of asthma-like symptoms in the past 4 weeks, the well-child professionals could provide them with a leaflet with information about asthma. If the child had been free of asthma-like symptoms during the past 4 weeks, the well-child professionals could advise a visit to the general practitioner should the child&#x02019;s asthma-like symptoms return. When parents reported that their child had at least 3 episodes of asthma-like symptoms during the past 12 months, of which at least 1 in the past 4 weeks, and the child had not yet been treated by the general practitioner or paediatrician in the past 4 weeks, the well-child professionals could refer to the asthma nurse and/or general practitioner. If the child had already been treated by the general practitioner or paediatrician in the past 4 weeks, the well-child professionals could refer to the asthma nurse.</p><p>If the child had been exposed to ETS (sometimes, on a regular basis, often or daily), the well-child professional could discuss health risks of ETS exposure to preschool children (health risks), and discuss whether parents could be motivated and prepared to stop ETS exposure to their child (house rules) and provide them with an information leaflet about preventing their child from exposure to ETS. The well-child professionals from the intervention centres were informed during a two-hour session about the intervention.</p><p>The control centres applied current routine practice, addressing the presence of general health symptoms during the regular well-child visits and ETS exposure (at least at age 18 months) <xref rid="pone.0090982-Ministry1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, no specific, systematic assessment of the presence of asthma-like symptoms and ETS exposure by the use of a brief form was performed by the well-child professionals in the control group.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Primary and Secondary Outcomes</title><p>Data from parents were collected in the Generation R Study by postal questionnaires at enrolment, and at the first, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> year of life.

Although not according to the study protocol, several children participating in the control group also visited the intervention centres and assessment of asthma-like symptoms and ETS exposure by a brief form was applied to a part of the parents of these children. Contamination of intervention and control condition may possibly also have occurred by moving to another neighbourhood in the city and visiting another well-child centre. Because this contamination may have reduced the differences in results between intervention and control group, we amended the study protocol <xref rid="pone.0090982-HafkampdeGroen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and in addition to the intention-to-treat analyses we performed a per-protocol analysis. In the per-protocol analysis we included children who were allocated to the intervention group and also received the allocated intervention (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2718).

Regression analyses were performed in the original data and after the multiple imputation procedure. Since we found similar effect estimates (with and without multiple imputation) the final results in our paper are presented as effect estimates with its 95% Confidence Intervals (95%CI) with adjustment for randomisation stratum, derived from the original (unimputed) data. Multilevel regression analyses were applied to allow for dependency between the individual measurements within the 16 randomised well-child centres. (the GENLINMIXED procedure in SPSS and PROC GLIMMIX procedure in SAS) <xref rid="pone.0090982-Twisk2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090982-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. We considered two levels: the cluster level (well-child center) and the individual(child) level. In the final model, we used the default covariance structure in the multilevel regression analysis in SPSS. The difference between intervention and control group on the categorical outcomes &#x02018;physician-diagnosed asthma ever (yes/no)&#x02019; and &#x02018;ETS exposure at home (yes/no)&#x02019; were studied using the &#x02018;binomial&#x02019; distribution and link&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;logit. The difference between intervention and control group on the categorical outcome &#x02018;Wheezing frequency (never, 1&#x02013;3 times/year, &#x0003e;3 times/year)&#x02019; was studied using the &#x02018;multinomial&#x02019; distribution and link&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;logit. The differences between intervention and control group on the health-related quality of life scales were studied using the &#x02018;poisson&#x02019; distribution and link&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;log. The differences between intervention and control group on the outcomes FeNO and Rint were studied using the &#x02018;normal&#x02019; distribution and link&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;identity. FeNO was normalized by <sup>e</sup>log transformation.</p><p>Potential effect modification of socio-demographic characteristics and baseline values of the outcomes on the association between the research condition (intervention or care as usual group) and the outcomes was explored. First, we fit a multinomial regression model with randomisation stratum and baseline values of the outcome. Second, we added socio-demographic characteristics (child&#x02019;s gender and maternal ethnic background and educational level) and baseline values of the outcomes as an interaction separately <xref rid="pone.0090982-HafkampdeGroen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090982-Assmann1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090982-Pocock1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.

In half of the children participating in the intervention group, the brief assessment form was applied at age 14 months (online repository <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090982.s001">Table S1</xref>). In total, the brief assessment form was never applied to 25% of the children participating in the intervention group. To 12% of the children participating in the intervention group, the brief assessment form was applied at each regularly scheduled visit up to year 4 (online repository <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090982.s002">Table S2</xref>).</p><p>Of the children in the intervention group who had &#x02265;3 episodes of asthma-like symptoms in the past year, based on the data of the assessment forms, 53% (162/308) was already treated by general practitioner or paediatrician. Of the children with &#x02265;3 episodes of asthma-like symptoms in the past year and asthma-like symptoms during the past month, 86% (119/139) was already treated by general practitioner or paediatrician.</p><p>Using the assessment forms, well-child professionals in the intervention group reported a decreasing prevalence of ETS exposure to children participating in the intervention group with increasing child&#x02019;s age: 19% (276/1447) at the age of 14 months, 16% (266/1627) at age 24 months, 17% (301/1767) at age 36 months and 13% (225/1760) at age 45 months. At age 14 months, 89% (245/276) of the children with ETS exposure received the information leaflet regarding the prevention of ETS exposure. However, after the first year, the information leaflet regarding prevention of ETS exposure was less often provided to the parents of children who were exposed to ETS: 61% (163/266) at age 24 months, 64% (192/301) at age 36 months and 53% (119/225) at age 45 months.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Systematic assessment of asthma-like symptoms and ETS exposure by professionals at well-child centres, followed by counselling (when indicated - including referral to asthma nurse/general practitioner and providing parents with information leaflets on avoiding ETS exposure) did not lead to a lower prevalence of physician-diagnosed asthma ever, reduction in parent-reported wheezing symptoms and did not improve FeNO, Rint or parent-reported HRQOL at age 6 years. A decreased risk on ETS exposure at home in the intervention group was found at age 2 and 3 years, but at age 6 years no difference between intervention and control group was found. Process evaluation results showed that most children with wheezing were already treated by their general practitioner or by a paediatrician. Further, half of the parents of children with ETS exposure participating in the intervention group did not receive the information leaflets on ETS exposure at the intervention centres at age 45 months.</p><p>This is a community health worker-delivered intervention study using physician-diagnosed asthma ever, wheezing frequency, FeNO, Rint, HRQOL and (in addition) ETS exposure at home ever at age 6 years as outcomes. In contrast to the positive outcomes associated with community health worker-delivered interventions (including decreased asthma-like symptoms) reported by Postma et al <xref rid="pone.0090982-Postma1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, our study did not show a lower prevalence of asthma or wheezing after follow-up until age 6 years. Maybe more intensive counselling or interventions based on social cognitive theory, are required to achieve an effect on the asthma related outcomes. By using FeNO and Rint as outcomes we could evaluate the effect of the intervention on airway inflammation and lung function at age 6 years <xref rid="pone.0090982-Beydon1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090982-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, but no effect could be demonstrated. No differences in parent-reported HRQOL were found between intervention and control group, which possibly can be explained by the fact that the intervention did not reduce wheezing.</p><p>In addition to the review by Priest et al <xref rid="pone.0090982-Priest1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, showing that intensive and repeated counselling interventions seem to be promising to reduce ETS exposure, we found a transient effect of brief counselling aimed to avoid ETS exposure in children at preschool age. To increase efficiency of well-child visits, low intensive and brief assessments and health promotion interventions are preferred. However, process evaluation results showed that half of the parents of children with ETS exposure did not receive the information leaflet regarding prevention of ETS exposure at age 45 months. Apparently, for unknown reason, once prevention of ETS exposure was applied at the first year of life, professionals at well-child care did not tend to repeat the intervention later on while repeated feedback seems to be most effective to reduce the proportion of parents quitting smoking <xref rid="pone.0090982-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090982-Wilson2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p><p>The strengths of this study include the integration in current practice with a brief assessment form regarding asthma-like symptoms and ETS exposure, the large number of parents participating, the longitudinal design (with follow-up until child age 6 years) and large number of FeNO and Rint measurements. Limitations include shortcomings in the application of the brief assessment forms and counselling. Possible reasons are falling attendance of parents to the well-child centre; lack of time or priority is given to other health questions during the well-child visit or professionals who are not familiar with the intervention, that is still not routine practice. In this study, the professionals were provided with a two-hour specific training on how to apply and use the brief assessment form regarding asthma-like symptoms and ETS exposure. This level of instruction may not be optimal as we did not organize refreshment sessions nor provided feedback on performance or assessed its effect <xref rid="pone.0090982-Emmons1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.</p><p>The study faced some difficulties. In contrast to what was described in our study protocol <xref rid="pone.0090982-HafkampdeGroen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, data on inhaled steroids prescribed by a physician was not available at age 6 years. Asthma at age 6 years was defined as physician-diagnosed asthma ever, obtained by a parent reported questionnaire. In the future, at child&#x02019;s age 10 years, data on inhaled steroids will be available and we recommend repeating the analyses at age 10 years.</p><p>In addition to the proposed outcomes, we evaluated whether the intervention had reduced ETS exposure at home. Children participating in the control group also visited the intervention well-child centres and systematic assessment and (when indicated) counselling of asthma-like symptoms and ETS exposure was applied to the parents of these children. Contamination of intervention and control condition may possibly have occurred by moving to another neighbourhood in the city and visiting another well-child centre. Because this contamination may have reduced the differences in results between intervention and control group, we amended the study protocol and in addition to the intention-to-treat analysis we performed a per-protocol analysis.</p><p>The following limitations would be a possible explanation for the negative study results: the study included a relatively low-intensity counselling intervention. However, the systematic assessment of the presence of asthma-like symptoms in early childhood by well-child professionals was prioritized and was considered feasible and essential in the Dutch youth healthcare system <xref rid="pone.0090982-Dijkstra1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Another explanation for the negative study results is that there may have been a lack of intervention by the well-child care professional, and also by the parents/children (to only 12% of the children participating in the intervention group, the brief assessment form was applied at each regularly scheduled visit up to year 4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090982.s002">Table S2</xref>)). Finally, since we used parent reports regarding the presence of asthma symptoms, HRQOL and ETS exposure at home, we may have lost precision.</p><p>We consider selection bias unlikely because a multiple imputed analysis including all eligible children did not change the results. Information bias should be considered for different measurements. Although the validity of assessing ETS exposure by questionnaires in epidemiological studies has been shown, misclassification may occur due to underreporting <xref rid="pone.0090982-Patrick1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. However, the use of biomarkers of tobacco smoke exposure in urine, saliva or blood, or nicotine in indoor air seems not superior to self-report <xref rid="pone.0090982-Patrick1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0090982-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. We have to take into account the impact of parental symptom perception and, possibly, misclassification in their reports on asthma diagnosis and symptoms. Parental reports of wheezing are widely accepted in epidemiological studies and reliably reflects the incidence of wheezing in preschool children <xref rid="pone.0090982-Jenkins1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. However, some misclassification cannot be excluded <xref rid="pone.0090982-Cane1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>.</p><p>The decreased risk on &#x02018;ETS exposure at home ever&#x02019; in the intervention group remained statistically significant even after correction for multiple testing.</p><p>This study raises questions about whether it is feasible to prevent the development of asthma by using systematic assessment and counselling of asthma-like symptoms and ETS exposure by using brief forms at well-child centres. We recommend further studies to evaluate whether professionals at well-child centres can contribute to optimal asthma management in other ways, and efforts are needed to optimize the protocols that can be implemented in this setting.</p><p>We also recommend further studies to improve the current intervention to optimise asthma management at well-child care. Based on previous results, it is recommended that professionals at well-child centres encourage breastfeeding and advise parents of children at high-risk of developing asthma to avoid ETS and indoor allergens exposure to their children to reduce the prevalence of asthma <xref rid="pone.0090982-ChanYeung1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090982-Becker1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. To optimise asthma management and realise uniformity of practice at well-child care, future opportunities are the development of an assessment to estimate the risk of developing asthma at school age <xref rid="pone.0090982-HafkampdeGroen2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Further, we stress the importance to ban smoking in public places and residential settings to reduce children&#x02019;s exposure to tobacco smoke.</p><p>Our study was embedded within the Dutch system of preventive health care provided by well-child centres in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. This may have consequences for the generalisability of our results in other areas and countries and therefore evaluation of our study in other, varied populations is recommended.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>A systematic assessment of asthma-like symptoms and ETS exposure by using brief assessment forms at well-child centres was not effective in reducing the prevalence of physician-diagnosed asthma ever and wheezing, and did not improve FeNO, Rint or HRQOL at age 6 years.
