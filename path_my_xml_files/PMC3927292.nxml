Ideal postoperative analgesia should provide continuous pain relief, in an alert patient who can be mobilized early.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Alternatives to standard pain management include, epidural administration of narcotics as a single dose at the time of the surgery,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] or via an epidural catheter postoperatively.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Epidural catheters are difficult to manage and maintain after spine surgery. In addition, there is always a concern of infection, restricting its widespread application.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Narcotics administered directly over the duramater (dura) before closure have been used safely in a number of studies,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] but has limited application due to short duration of action (3-24 hours).[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>To prolong the effect of epidural morphine, studies have been conducted by applying gelfoam soaked in opiods.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] However, direct epidural instillation of morphine has not been compared with morphine soaked gelfoam. Thus conclusions cannot be drawn whether soaking morphine in gelfoam prolongs the analgesic effect of morphine or not. In this context, the present study was designed to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of gel foam soaked in preservative free morphine placed in epidural space and to compare it with direct application of morphine in patients undergoing laminectomy surgery under general anesthesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The study was conducted in a prospective, randomized, double-blinded manner on patients suffering from lumbar canal stenosis posted for lumbar laminectomy in a tertiary care hospital. Ethical clearance was obtained from the institutional research and ethical committee. A total of 150 patients of either sex between the age group of 25-50 years operated between July 2011 to December 2012 belonging to American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade I or II were included.</p><p>Patients undergoing cervical or thoracic level laminectomies, spine-fixation surgery, those with herniated sequestered disc, previous history of spine surgery, patients having significant medical diseases, neuromuscular disease or psychological disease, history of substance abuse or inability to comprehend visual analog scale (VAS) were excluded from the study. Patients, who had accidental dural tear while undergoing laminectomy, were excluded from the study.</p><p>All patients were pre-medicated with tab 0.05 mg/kg lorazepam and tab ranitidine 150 mg orally, the night before surgery. In the pre-operative holding area, inj midazolam 2 mg, inj metoclopramide 10 mg and inj glycopyrolate 0.2 mg were administered intravenously (IV) half-an-hour prior to induction of anesthesia. After shifting to operation theatre, standard monitoring (i.e., electrocardiogram with two derivations, pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>), non-invasive arterial pressure measurement, End tidal CO<sub>2</sub>(EtCO<sub>2</sub>), body temperature) were employed and baseline parameters recorded. This monitoring was continued till reversal and extubation.</p><p>Anesthesia was induced with 2 &#x003bc;g/kg fentanyl, 2 mg/kg propofol, and 0.5 mg/kg atracurium IV followed by endotracheal intubation. Anesthesia was maintained with 60% N<sub>2</sub>O in O<sub>2</sub>, infusion propofol, and fentanyl 0.5-1 &#x003bc;g/kg per hour, as needed, to maintain mean arterial pressure between 65 and 85 mmHg. Neuromuscular relaxation was maintained with intermittent atracurium bolus (0.15 mg/kg every 15-20 minutes). Ventilation was adjusted to maintain EtCO<sub>2</sub> between 30 and 35 mm Hg.</p><p>Patients were divided into two groups (group I and group II) of 75 each by computer-generated randomization. Preservative free morphine was diluted by the scrub nurse preparing a concentration of 1 mg/ml. At the end of the operation, before final closure, in group I, a 5 &#x000d7; 1-cm piece of absorbable gelatin sponge soaked in 5 mg of diluted morphine was placed in the epidural space, whereas in group II a saline-soaked gelfoam was placed in the epidural space and 5 ml of 1 mg/ml morphine was instilled over the intact epidural space by the Neurosurgeon.</p><p>All patients were given inj diclofenac 75 mg infusion over 30 min and inj ondansetron 100 mcg/kg IV half-an-hour before reversal. After surgery was over, patients were turned supine. Neuromuscular blockade was reversed with inj Neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and inj glycopyrrolate 0.02 mg/kg IV, after return of spontaneous respiration, trachea extubated and patients shifted to post anesthesia care unit (PACU) where continuous monitoring was carried out.</p><p>In PACU, all patients were administered supplemental oxygen for first 2 hours. After this time, oxygen was administered, if patient had saturation below 92%. Pulse rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, VAS, and sedation score were recorded hourly for the first 6 hours, after that at 2 hourly intervals till 12 hours and at 4 hourly intervals till 48 hours by the staff nurse / resident anesthesiologist, who was unaware of the group allocation.</p><p>Subjective pain was measured by VAS on a scale of 0 to 10 with 0 representing no pain and 10 worst imaginable pain.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] All patients were acquainted with VAS pre-operatively. Patients were administered supplemental analgesic with inj morphine 5 mg IV if they complained of pain or VAS &#x02265; 3, which could be repeated after 20 minutes if patient still complained of pain. Opioids other than inj morphine and all other analgesic or anti-inflammatory agents were prohibited for the first 48 hours after study dose. After 48 hours, alternate opioid therapies were permitted at the investigator's discretion. Naloxone was permitted for treatment of opioid-related adverse events.</p><p>The duration of pain relief was defined as the time from the end of the operation until the patient requested supplementation of analgesic. Time of first demand of analgesic and total analgesic consumption in the initial 24 and 48 hours were recorded.</p><p>Level of sedation was assessed by 5-point ordinal scale,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] where,0 means alert patient, 1 stands for patient who is drowsy, 2 is for frequently drowsy and disoriented, 3 is very drowsy and disoriented and 4 is Stuporose and difficult to arouse.</p><p>Patients were encouraged to ambulate 6 hours after surgery if they felt comfortable. Time of ambulation was counted from the time at which patients were shifted to the PACU until the time patients could be ambulated and it was recorded in all cases. Patients were discharged from PACU to ward at any time after 8 hours if modified Aldrete's score was &#x02265;9,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] patient had voided and started accepting orally. At our institute, patients are usually kept in PACU for 4 hours. However, for the purpose of study, the time of discharge from PACU was kept 2 hours later than time of ambulation so that most patients could be ambulated in the PACU itself before shifting to ward to rule out pressure symptoms and respiratory depression. Ambulation, though was not mandatory before discharge from PACU. Time of discharge was noted and pulse oximetry monitoring continued in ward for 48 hours.</p><p>Patients were also observed for postoperative complications or adverse effects such as respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, bradycardia, pressure symptoms and need for supplemental oxygen.</p><p>For the purpose of study, bradycardia was defined as heart rate less than 50 beats per minute. Respiratory depression was defined as respiratory rate less than 10 per minute, need of oxygen supplementation was recorded if patients had oxygen saturation of less than 93%, urinary retention was labeled as absence of spontaneous voiding more than 7 hours after removal of bladder catheter.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Severity of pruritis was graded as:[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>0. Absent.</p><p>1. Mild &#x02014; restricted to one area not troubling the patient and reported only on prompting the patient.</p><p>2. Moderate &#x02014; affecting a large area, not disturbing the patient and not requiring treatment.</p><p>3. Severe &#x02014; generalized, often disturbing the patient and requiring treatment.</p><p>Pressure symptoms were recorded by observing for aggravation of preoperative symptoms and neurologic signs such as pain, including radicular pain, paresthesia, hyperesthesia, bowel and bladder dysfunction (after removal of the urinary catheter) and muscular weakness. These were observed for 48 hours postoperatively, at the time of discharge and again when the patients reported for follow-up after 2 weeks. At hospital discharge, all patients were told to report whenever they noticed any deterioration in their neurologic symptoms.</p><p>All patients were also observed for nausea and vomiting. In the nausea category, patients who had only nausea were included and those who had vomiting with or without nausea were included in the vomiting category. Nausea or vomiting was treated with inj ondandetron 100 &#x003bc;g/kg.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The previous multicenter study found that total 48-hour postoperative rescue supplemental opioid consumption (in IV morphine milligram-equivalents) was 25 &#x000b1; 21 mg in the extended release epidural morphine (EREM) 10 mg group compared to 47 &#x000b1; 34 mg in the conventional epidural 5 mg morphine group.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Based on these findings, a hypothesis was generated that for a dose of 5 mg in both groups of gelfoam soaked in morphine and direct epidural instillation, a sample size of 70 patients was needed to detect 10% difference with 90% power and &#x003b1; of 0.05.</p><p>Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic, outcome, and adverse events data.

However, pain relief after a single epidural injection of morphine may last less than 24 hours.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] To overcome this, various investigators have attempted to prolong the duration of analgesic action by morphine-adon L compound,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Oxiplex/SP gel-morphine,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Vaseline-Sterile-Oil-Morphine.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Many of these techniques lack wider applicability. Liposomal based EREM has been recently introduced and successfully used extending the duration of analgesic action of morphine.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] However, this preparation is costly and not universally available.</p><p>The routine use of surgical gelfoam in the epidural space at the completion of surgery prompted the use of gelfoam as an extended release drug delivery system in this study. Earlier studies have tried application of gelfoam soaked in buprenorphine[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and morphine[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] in epidural space, but since direct epidural application of morphine was not compared with gelfoam soaked in morphine, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn whether or not the duration of action of opioid is prolonged due to its application via a gelfoam.</p><p>The dose of epidural morphine used in our study corresponds to the doses used in earlier studies. Gibson Kevin used single dose of 4 mg in lumbar spine surgery.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Tzu zeng chen used 3 mg epidural morphine in lumbar laminectomy surgery.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Carvalho <italic>et al</italic>., used 5 mg epidural morphine in obstetric patients.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Gambling used 5 mg morphine in epidural space for lower abdominal surgeries.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>We observed that the mean VAS score in the group I remained less as compared to group II at most time intervals studied. This implies that patients in group I had less pain as compared to group II. In group II, total analgesic consumption was almost greater than 3.5 times and supplemental analgesia was required almost 20 hours earlier as compared to group I. The mean duration of action of a single dose epidural instillation of morphine was 10.25 hours in group II and it prolonged to 30.25 hours in group I. The duration of action of single dose epidural morphine in our study corresponds to that of Yadanapudi <italic>et al</italic>., who also reported that the effect of single dose of epidural morphine lasted 10.1 hours.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] However, Carvalho reported single dose of epidural morphine to provide analgesia for 3 hours.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] This difference could be due to the fact that the study was performed in post-cesarean patients, and pregnant state is known to alter pain perception.</p><p>Our results are similar to those of Mishra <italic>et al</italic>., who reported decreased pain scores and reduced analgesic consumption when buprenorphine-soaked gelfoam was applied.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Gibson <italic>et al</italic>., reported that 60% of patients did not require supplemental analgesia on the day of surgery when gelfoam soaked in morphine was placed in the epidural space.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] However, in that study, dose of morphine injected in the gelfoam was not standardized and methylprednisolone was also injected in the gelfoam. Epidural steroids reduce inflammation at nerve roots thereby decreasing the pain.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>Patients in the group I had lower sedation scores conceivably because patients in group II had higher consumption of IV morphine. Similarly patients in group I could be ambulated earlier and discharged from the PACU. The explanation for earlier discharge from PACU was that most patients in group I were pain-free and alert. This is important because earlier ambulation lifts the morale of the patient, relieves the surgeon's anxiety and also reduces the chances of postoperative complications. There was no significant difference in time to hospital discharge between the two groups, hence the benefit provided by gelfoam-soaked morphine does not translate into earlier hospital discharge rate.</p><p>MAP and heart rate were lower in the group I compared to the group II pointing towards a better pain control in group I. One patient in each group had heart rate below 50/min, however, in both the cases the baseline heart rate of patient was low and this bradycardia did not cause any symptoms or required any treatment.</p><p>The incidence of other adverse effects in our study was small with 29% patients reporting pruritis, however, this pruritis was mild to moderate and rarely disturbing to the patient or required any treatment. Nausea and vomiting were more in group II as compared to group I though the difference was statistically not significant. This could be due to greater consumption of supplemental analgesia in group II. It is of significance that none of the patients in either of groups had any pressure symptom. This is extremely important because compression of nerve roots can cause motor or sensory deficits in the area of distribution. At our institution, it is a routine practice to place gelfoam at the end of spine surgery so the absence of any neurological deficits was reassuring.</p><p>Epidural morphine acts on receptors in the dorsal horn instead of spinal nerve roots thus causing pain relief without sympathetic or motor blockade. This is of relevance after spine surgery, in which motor blockade as seen after epidural local anesthetic can interfere with the postoperative neurologic assessment and delay mobilization.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Early mobilization, minimizes complications due to pain and immobility.</p><p>Hydrophilic drugs like morphine administered via the epidural route can cause delayed respiratory depression.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] However, we did not observe any case of respiratory depression. The possible explanation could be that dose of morphine used by us was small. Thus cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) concentration of morphine remains less and thus there was little cranial ascent.</p><p>The rational for choosing gelfoam as an extended delivery device was that gelfoam has the capability to absorb fluid several times its weight. Free opiates placed at the time of the surgery are diluted by blood and tissue fluids, are lost into the disc space, and are absorbed systemically, thus limiting its duration of action.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Morphine soaked in gelfoam thus remains in epidural space for greater time. It is possible that morphine is slowly released from gelfoam so its dilution by blood and tissue fluids is reduced accounting for its longer duration of action.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Some authors have tried using even smaller doses of epidural morphine in an attempt to reduce the incidence and severity of adverse effects. Wu <italic>et al</italic>., used 1 mg doses of morphine using a microfibrillary paste, however, using such smaller doses also reduces duration of analgesic effect.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Future studies are needed to arrive at the most effective dose of morphine for its application in gelfoam. One limitation of our study was that we did not have long term follow-up of patients to evaluate for chronic pain and the for any pressure symptoms due to epidural gelfoam.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>To conclude, epidural administration of morphine using gelfoam as a vehicle for sustained release of morphine is a safe and effective
