The primary efficacy analysis utilized an unstratified log-rank test (with treatment as a fixed effect) for time to relapse in the ITT population. As a confirmatory analysis, the hazard ratio of time to relapse and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) values were calculated for lurasidone versus placebo groups using a Cox proportional hazards model.</p><p>Based on assumed relapse event rates (at the week 28 endpoint) of 30% with lurasidone and 50% with placebo, it was determined that 98 relapse events would be required to detect this drug-placebo difference with 90% power using a log-rank test, assuming two interim analyses and the final analysis (using the Haybittle&#x02013;Peto method) and an overall two-sided alpha level of 0.05. Thus, the study was to be terminated after a total of 98 relapse events had occurred. Two pre-specified unblinded interim analyses were performed during the double-blind phase by an external, independent data safety monitoring board after approximately 50% and 75% of the planned total number of relapse events had taken place (49 and 74 events, respectively). Due to the interim analyses, the nominal <italic>p</italic> value for statistical significance was adjusted for the primary efficacy analysis to ensure an overall type I error rate of 0.05. Based on information fractions of 50%, 75%, and 100% for the interim and final analyses, the <italic>p</italic> value for statistical significance was established at 0.0119 for the two interim analyses, 0.042 for the final analysis of the primary endpoint (log-rank test of time to relapse), and 0.05 for all secondary endpoints.</p><p>Time to all-cause discontinuation during the double-blind phase was analyzed in the same manner as time to relapse. Other secondary efficacy measures assessed during the double-blind phase were evaluated utilizing mixed-model repeated-measures (MMRM) analysis that included treatment, visit (as a categorical variable), pooled center, double-blind baseline score, and a treatment-by visit interaction term. An unstructured covariance matrix was used for within-patient correlation. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with the last observation carried forward (LOCF) was also utilized to evaluate secondary efficacy outcomes.

were reported in 8.7% of patients during the open-label phase, and consisted primarily of schizophrenia (3.0%) or psychotic disorder (1.6%). In the double-blind phase, serious adverse events were more common in the placebo group (7.8%) compared with the lurasidone group (4.2%), with schizophrenia (2.8% for placebo and 0.7% for lurasidone) and psychotic disorder (1.4% in each group) as the most common. Almost half of enrolled patients (46.2%) had a history of previous suicidal ideation or behavior (based on the C-SSRS). During the study, suicidal ideation emerged in 6.3% of patients during the open-label phase and in 1.4% of patients randomized to lurasidone, compared with 3.5% of patients randomized to placebo in the double-blind phase; there were no suicide attempts. One death (sudden cardiac death) occurred during the open-label phase of the study; this death was judged by the investigator to be unrelated to study medication.</p><p>Minimal changes in weight, lipids, glucose, and prolactin were observed. In patients treated with lurasidone in both the open-label and double-blind phases, mean weight change was -0.6 kg (LOCF); weight gain &#x02a7e;7% and weight loss &#x02a7e;7% were experienced by a similar proportion of patients (17.4% and 16.7%, respectively); and median change in metabolic parameters was -1.0 mg/dL for total cholesterol, -1.0 mg/dL for triglycerides, and 0.0 mg/dL for glucose (LOCF). Change in movement disorder signs or symptoms (as measured by SAS, BAS, and AIMS scores) were generally absent to mild in patients treated with lurasidone.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="section19-0269881115620460"><title>Discussion</title><p>The efficacy of lurasidone for the maintenance treatment of patients with schizophrenia was demonstrated in this multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study. Forty-two percent of patients who entered the study completed the open-label stabilization phase, demonstrating that maintenance of stability with lurasidone was feasible over a three-month period. In the double-blind phase, treatment with lurasidone (40&#x02013;80 mg/d) significantly delayed time to relapse and reduced the risk of relapse by 33.7% compared with placebo. The results of this study are consistent with findings of a previous 12-month, double-blind study, which showed that long-term treatment with lurasidone (40&#x02013;160 mg/d) was associated with a relatively low probability of relapse, and demonstrated the non-inferiority of lurasidone relative to quetiapine XR (200&#x02013;800 mg/d) for relapse prevention in patients with schizophrenia (<xref rid="bibr25-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Loebel et al., 2013b</xref>). The results of the current study, taken together with the findings of the above-noted study (<xref rid="bibr25-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Loebel et al., 2013b</xref>), support the use of lurasidone as maintenance treatment for patients with schizophrenia across the dose range of 40&#x02013;160 mg/d.</p><p>A key strength of the current study is that clinical stability, defined using rigorous criteria, was demonstrated for at least 12 weeks during the open-label stabilization phase. This extended stabilization period increased the likelihood that subsequent emergence of symptoms represented recurrence of illness and not merely symptom fluctuation in patients who were not clinically stabilized. The requirement of a minimum of 12 weeks of clinical stability prior to randomization was consistent with regulatory agency guidance regarding the design of relapse-prevention studies in schizophrenia (<xref rid="bibr10-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr12-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Department Health and Human Services et al., 2005</xref>) and was similar to other maintenance treatment studies that included a stabilization period (<xref rid="bibr4-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Beasley Jr et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bibr17-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Kane et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr21-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Kramer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bibr30-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Peuskens et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The magnitude of effect observed with lurasidone in the present study (relapse rate at the double-blind week 28 endpoint of 42.2% for lurasidone and 51.2% for placebo based on Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis (NNT=12), and 29.9% for lurasidone and 41.1% for placebo based on observed cases (NNT=9)) was somewhat smaller than findings reported in a recent meta-analysis of placebo-controlled studies of antipsychotic agents for relapse prevention in patients with schizophrenia, which found observed relapse rates at 7&#x02013;12 months of 27% for active medication and 64% for placebo (NNT=3) (<xref rid="bibr23-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Leucht et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>There is substantial variation in relapse criteria among published studies of maintenance treatment in schizophrenia (<xref rid="bibr2-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Arato et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bibr4-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Beasley Jr et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bibr11-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Csernansky et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bibr17-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Kane et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr21-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Kramer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bibr30-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Peuskens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bibr31-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Pigott et al., 2003</xref>), which makes cross-study comparison among antipsychotic agents difficult to interpret. This study utilized a number of relapse criteria; meeting any one criterion constituted a protocol-defined relapse. The rate of psychiatric hospitalization in this study, which may be considered an indicator of more severe relapse, was relatively low and favored lurasidone over placebo. The inclusion of non-hospitalization relapse criteria in this study could have introduced variability into the primary outcome assessment, potentially obscuring differences between lurasidone and placebo.</p><p>In contrast to most previous studies of maintenance treatment for schizophrenia (<xref rid="bibr2-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Arato et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bibr4-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Beasley Jr et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bibr11-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Csernansky et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bibr17-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Kane et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr30-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Peuskens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bibr31-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Pigott et al., 2003</xref>), this study enrolled acutely ill patients (rather than clinically stable patients) and required them to achieve and maintain clinical stability (as defined by stringent criteria) before entering the randomized withdrawal (i.e. relapse prevention) phase. We note that the 28-week double-blind phase was shorter than in some studies of other antipsychotic agents (<xref rid="bibr2-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Arato et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bibr11-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Csernansky et al., 2002</xref>). This may have limited the number of relapses that occurred, particularly in the placebo group, compared with other studies.</p><p>Detection of differences between investigational agents and placebo in clinical trials of patients with schizophrenia has become increasingly problematic as treatment effect sizes have declined over time (<xref rid="bibr1-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Agid et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr19-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Kemp et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr20-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Khin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr33-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Rutherford et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with these long-term trends, relapse rates in this study were lower in the placebo group and higher in the lurasidone group compared with results of the <xref rid="bibr23-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Leucht et al. (2012)</xref> meta-analysis. Consistent with prior analyses of regional differences in schizophrenia trials (<xref rid="bibr5-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr20-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Khin et al., 2012</xref>), time to relapse in this study strongly favored lurasidone compared to placebo for participants outside the United States; however, a significant treatment effect was not observed for participants in the United States. The reasons for this disparity in relapse rates by region are not known but warrant further investigation. However, we note that subgroup analyses (including those based on geographic region) are subject to a number of methodological concerns, including diminished sample size, reduced power, and increased variability, which increase the risk of spurious findings (<xref rid="bibr5-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>A meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials of 15 anti-psychotic agents in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia found relatively small differences between medications in terms of efficacy, but substantial differences in side effects (<xref rid="bibr22-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Leucht et al., 2013</xref>). The results of the present study are consistent with this meta-analysis and with previous studies (<xref rid="bibr6-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Citrome, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bibr7-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) in which lurasidone was effective in the treatment of schizophrenia and was associated with a favorable safety profile. One limitation of this study was the restricted lurasidone dose range. Only lower doses (40&#x02013;80 mg/d) of lurasidone were used, which may have reduced the ability of lurasidone to prevent relapse for some patients in this study. The lurasidone dose range selected for this study was based on the initial FDA-approved dose range of 40&#x02013;80 mg/d (<xref rid="bibr36-0269881115620460" ref-type="bibr">Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc., 2010</xref>). More than 70% of patients in both the open-label and double-blind phases of the present study received lurasidone dosed at 80 mg/d, indicating that a higher daily dose may have been needed to achieve and maintain clinical stability for some patients. The currently approved dose range for lurasidone in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia is 40&#x02013;160 mg/d.</p><p>Additional study limitations, beyond the restricted dose range for lurasidone, include the lack of serum drug concentration measurement and limited information regarding medication adherence. Although medication adherence rates appear to be high based on pill counts, the extent of adherence to study medication based on serum concentration, which may be a more sensitive measure of adherence, is unknown.</p><p>In conclusion, this multicenter, placebo-controlled, ran-domized withdrawal study demonstrated the efficacy and safety of lurasidone for the maintenance treatment of patients with schizophrenia. Maintenance of efficacy was established by 12 weeks of clinical stability (rigorously defined) during open-label treatment with lurasidone. Patients who were randomized to continued treatment with lurasidone in the double-blind phase demonstrated significantly delayed time to relapse and reduced frequency of relapse compared with patients randomized to placebo. The safety profile of lurasidone in the present long-term study was consistent with prior studies, with minimal changes in weight, lipid parameters, and measures of glycemic control.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Nancy Holland, PhD, Synchrony Medical Communications, LLC, provided medical writing and editorial assistance for this manuscript under the direction of the authors.
