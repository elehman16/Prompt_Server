<bold>Background.</bold> Daily and globally, millions of adult hospitalized patients are exposed to maintenance i.v. fluid solutions supported by limited scientific evidence. In particular, it remains unclear whether fluid tonicity contributes to the recently established detrimental effects of fluid, sodium, and chloride overload.</p><p>
<bold>Methods.</bold> This crossover study consisted of two 48&#x02009;h study periods, during which 12 fasting healthy adults were treated with a frequently prescribed solution (NaCl 0.9% in glucose 5% supplemented by 40&#x02009;mmol litre<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of potassium chloride) and a premixed hypotonic fluid (NaCl 0.32% in glucose 5% containing 26&#x02009;mmol litre<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of potassium) at a daily rate of 25&#x02009;ml kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of body weight. The primary end point was cumulative urine volume; fluid balance was thus calculated. We also explored the physiological mechanisms behind our findings and assessed electrolyte concentrations.</p><p>
<bold>Results.</bold> After 48&#x02009;h, 595&#x02009;ml (95% CI: 454&#x02013;735) less urine was voided with isotonic fluids than hypotonic fluids (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001), or 803&#x02009;ml (95% CI: 692&#x02013;915) after excluding an outlier with &#x02018;exaggerated natriuresis of hypertension&#x02019;. The isotonic treatment was characterized by a significant decrease in aldosterone (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). Sodium concentrations were higher in the isotonic arm (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001), but all measurements remained within the normal range. Potassium concentrations did not differ between the two solutions (<italic>P</italic>=0.45). Chloride concentrations were higher with the isotonic treatment (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001), even causing hyperchloraemia.</p><p>
<bold>Conclusions.</bold> Even at maintenance rate, isotonic solutions caused lower urine output, characterized by decreased aldosterone concentrations indicating (unintentional) volume expansion, than hypotonic solutions and were associated with hyperchloraemia. Despite their lower sodium and potassium content, hypotonic fluids were not associated with hyponatraemia or hypokalaemia.</p><p>

</p><p>Maintenance i.v. fluid solutions are prescribed to cover the daily need for water and electrolytes in patients who are unable to ingest food or fluids. Ideally, they also contain dextrose or glucose to prevent starvation ketosis while awaiting full (par)enteral nutrition. Although maintenance fluids are used daily in hospitals worldwide, the scientific evidence guiding clinical practice is strikingly limited. Current guidelines are based on older dietary reference values, which by their very nature concern only oral intake.<xref rid="aex118-B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1&#x02013;3</sup></xref> Our understanding of the human organism&#x02019;s response to the tonicity of correctly dosed i.v. maintenance fluids remains an educated guess based on older physiological experiments.<xref rid="aex118-B4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Previous studies showed that a large volume of isotonic fluid administered rapidly is excreted more slowly than an equal amount of a hypotonic solution.<xref rid="aex118-B5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5&#x02013;7</sup></xref> However, it remains unclear whether the tonicity of maintenance fluids could be a separate contributor to fluid overload and altered electrolyte concentrations. The scarce data on prescription practices demonstrate the frequent use of isotonic solutions, ignoring available guidelines.<xref rid="aex118-B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref></p><p>Important paediatric research emphasized the protective effect of isotonic maintenance solutions against hyponatraemia-induced morbidity compared with hypotonic solutions prescribed using the classical Holliday and Segar formula.<xref rid="aex118-B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9&#x02013;12</sup></xref> Yet this use of isotonic fluids remains contested, even among paediatricians, some of whom have called for improved awareness of inappropriate (and appropriate, i.e. hypovolaemia-induced) secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) instead of redundantly salt loading a large number of children.<xref rid="aex118-B13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref><xref rid="aex118-B14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Furthermore, the design of the abovementioned trials, all of which focused on the occurrence of hyponatraemia, provided no insights into the deleterious potential of salt-rich solutions. Even more controversially, some authors recently suggested extrapolating the routine use of isotonic maintenance fluids to the adult setting.<xref rid="aex118-B15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Not only are the symptoms of potential hyponatraemia less dramatic in this population but also the detrimental effects of fluid and salt overload are well known in the care of surgical and critically ill adult patients.<xref rid="aex118-B16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16&#x02013;19</sup></xref></p><p>We designed this study to test the hypothesis that isotonic fluids, even at maintenance rate, lead to lower urine output than their hypotonic counterparts. As a secondary end point, we explored possible physiological explanations by studying key players in volume regulation and osmoregulation. Furthermore, we aimed to investigate the impact of maintenance fluids on the serum concentration of various electrolytes, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, and phosphate. In many hospitals, it is routine practice to add hypertonic potassium chloride to maintenance fluids manually, although this is regarded as a high-risk medication.<xref rid="aex118-B20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Premixed solutions have a better safety profile, but most commercially available solutions contain potassium in lower-than-recommended doses. Strong ion difference, a marker of fluid-induced metabolic acidosis, was also assessed.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a single-blind crossover study in 12 healthy volunteers at the Antwerp University Hospital, Belgium. In order to be eligible for the study, participants had to be between 18 and 70&#x02009;yr of age, with a BMI of between 17 and 45&#x02009;kg m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of &#x0003e;60&#x02009;(ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (1.73&#x000a0;m)<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>.<xref rid="aex118-B21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Exclusion criteria were acute medical illness in the 3&#x02009;weeks before any of the study periods, the use of medication interfering with urine output, pregnancy, medical history of cardiac failure, malnourishment, diabetes mellitus, urological disease preventing complete emptying of the bladder, or any medical or non-medical issue preventing complaint-free fasting for 48&#x02009;h. The study was approved by the hospital&#x02019;s Institutional Review Board (reference number 16/15/175) and the relevant national authority, the Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products, Belgium (EudraCT 2016-001846-24). Participants were recruited through advertising in the investigators&#x02019; institution. After selection, they received an information brochure and signed an informed consent form. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02822898).</p><p>The study consisted of two study periods of 48&#x02009;h, one for each maintenance solution. In order to ensure a balance in treatment sequence, subjects were matched by sex and BMI, after which each matched pair was allocated to the two treatment sequences as a block. To avoid any carryover effects, the two periods were separated by a 2&#x02009;week washout period. The study was conducted in July and August 2016 in an air-conditioned facility to ensure a stable room temperature (&#x0223c;20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C). Subjects were admitted at 08.00&#x02009;h after a normal night&#x02019;s rest, having refrained from caffeinated drinks for at least 16&#x02009;h and from any oral intake for at least 8&#x02009;h before admission. Having asked the subjects to empty their bladders, we began infusion of the study fluid using an electronic infusion pump with an auditory alarm to detect obstruction. We blinded subjects to the treatment by concealing the fluids with opaque covers. To correct for insensible losses during the night, subjects were given identical breakfasts shortly after admission, during which they drank a fluid volume five times their infusion rate (see below). From then on, they refrained from any oral intake for the rest of the study period. The infusion ran until the first urination after 48&#x02009;h of fluid administration. Each study period was permanently medically supervised by a trained intensivist.</p><p>The study fluids were administered at 25&#x02009;ml kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of body weight per day. When a subject&#x02019;s BMI was between 25 and 30&#x02009;kg m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, we used the ideal body weight calculated using the formula of Devine.<xref rid="aex118-B22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> If the BMI was &#x0003e;30&#x02009;kg m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, the adjusted body weight was calculated by increasing the ideal body weight by 25% of the difference between the actual and ideal body weights. The isotonic solution was NaCl 0.9% in glucose 5% with an added 40&#x02009;mmol of potassium chloride 7.45% (osmolarity 614 mOsm litre<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; tonicity 373 mOsm litre<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), so that a fluid volume of 25&#x02009;ml kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> per day would represent a daily potassium dose of 1&#x02009;mmol kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of body weight. Notably, the addition of potassium chloride essentially renders this solution hypertonic, although potassium has a negligible effect on tonicity after administration. As for the hypotonic solution, we used a commercially available premixed solution (Glucion 5%<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, IL, USA) containing sodium (54&#x02009;mmol litre<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), potassium (26&#x02009;mmol litre<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), chloride (55&#x02009;mmol litre<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), phosphate (6.2&#x02009;mmol litre<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), magnesium (2.6&#x02009;mmol litre<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), and lactate (25&#x02009;mmol litre<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; osmolarity 447 mOsm litre<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; tonicity 169 mOsm litre<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>).</p><p>The primary end point was cumulative urine volume over the course of 48&#x02009;h; fluid balance was thus calculated. Subjects emptied their bladders as the need arose, day or night. The exact urinary volume was determined by dividing its weight by its point-of-care-assessed density. Secondary end points were markers of volume regulation (the mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone, urinary sodium, and serum albumin concentration) and osmoregulation (serum and urine osmolality, serum ADH, and thirst), and the serum concentration of clinically important electrolytes: sodium, potassium (especially as the hypotonic fluid contained a lower-than-guideline-recommended dose), chloride, phosphate, and calcium. Strong ion difference was also assessed.<xref rid="aex118-B23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Clinical parameters were collected mainly for safety reasons and body weight as a back-up primary end point. In summary, the following variables were assessed. Each urine void was sampled for measurement of urinary osmolality, sodium, potassium, and chloride. At baseline (<italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>) and every 12&#x02009;h (<italic>t</italic><sub>12</sub>, <italic>t</italic><sub>24</sub>, <italic>t</italic><sub>36</sub>, and <italic>t</italic><sub>48</sub>), we assessed body weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and a thirst score on a scale from 0 to 5. At <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>t</italic><sub>24</sub>, and <italic>t</italic><sub>48</sub>, blood was obtained for serum sodium, potassium, chloride, osmolality, magnesium, calcium, phosphate, albumin, ADH, and aldosterone, with additional assessments of sodium, chloride, and potassium at <italic>t</italic><sub>12</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>36</sub>. Strong ion difference was calculated as: Strong ion difference&#x02009;=&#x02009;[Na<sup>+</sup>]+[K<sup>+</sup>]+[Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup>]+[Mg<sup>++</sup>]&#x02212;[Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>].<xref rid="aex118-B23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> The technicalities and normal ranges of the laboratory analyses are reported in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary material</xref> (Table S1). The subjects&#x02019; usual dietary salt intake was approximated by assessing urinary sodium output by means of a 24&#x02009;h urine collection 3&#x02013;4&#x02009;weeks after completion of the study.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 14 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). Based on the literature, we assumed mean urinary outputs of 1250&#x02009;ml for hypotonic solutions and 1050&#x02009;ml for isotonic solutions during the trial period, both with an <sc>sd</sc> of 200&#x02009;ml and an intrapatient correlation of 0.5.<xref rid="aex118-B6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Using simulation (10&#x02009;000 trials), we estimated that a sample size of 10 would give the study a power of 80% to detect a 200&#x02009;ml difference in urine output between infusions with a two-sided &#x003b1; set at 5%. We included two extra subjects to compensate for unexpected dropouts. An <sc>anova</sc> of the area under the urinary output curve showed no sequence or period effects, so these were excluded from any further analysis. Absence of a carryover effect was assumed. Next, a random effects model was fitted for the primary end point, cumulative urine volume over the course of 48&#x02009;h, with treatment, time, and their interaction as fixed effects and time as a random slope for each subject. Adjustment for body weight type (actual, ideal, adjusted) was evaluated using likelihood ratio tests and omitted in the absence of model improvement. The same procedure was followed for fluid balance and the more generalizable fluid balance per kilogram of actual body weight. Effect size was evaluated at <italic>t</italic><sub>48</sub>. The difference in laboratory and clinical values (e.g. thirst score) between the two solutions was assessed with a random intercept model using treatment as fixed effect, the baseline value as a covariate, and all subsequent values as outcome. We fitted per-treatment mixed models using time (categorical) as a fixed effect and subject as a random effect to assess the difference in serum values since <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub> within each treatment arm. Dunnett-adjusted <italic>P</italic>-values were used to correct for multiple testing. Statistical significance was set at a <italic>P</italic>-value of &#x0003c;0.05 (two-sided) for all tests. The results are reported with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The subjects&#x02019; characteristics and details of their fluid therapy are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="aex118-T1">Table 1</xref>.

In the isotonic treatment arm, the cumulative urine output at <italic>t</italic><sub>48</sub> (3060&#x02009;ml; 95% CI: 2474&#x02013;3647) was significantly lower than in the hypotonic treatment arm (3655&#x02009;ml; 95% CI: 3069&#x02013;4242; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001); we observed a mean difference of 595&#x02009;ml (95% CI: 454&#x02013;735). This finding was reflected in the fluid balance, which was estimated to be 590&#x02009;ml (95% CI: 450&#x02013;729) or 8.9&#x02009;ml kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of actual body weight (95% CI: 7.2&#x02013;10.5) higher at <italic>t</italic><sub>48</sub> with isotonic treatment (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).

Surprisingly, given their widespread use, this appears to be the first study to assess the effect of the tonicity of commonly prescribed maintenance solutions. This important characteristic of i.v. fluids is determined by the number of solutes to which cell membranes are impermeable. Despite contributing to the <italic>in vitro</italic> osmolality of a fluid, glucose crosses cell membranes rapidly after i.v. administration. As a result, only dissolved electrolytes contribute to the tonicity of a solution and exert an osmotic pressure gradient. Previous studies demonstrating the clinical impact of salt-poor perioperative maintenance therapy invariably involved the restriction of fluid volume, thereby precluding conclusions about the specific role of fluid tonicity.<xref rid="aex118-B16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref><xref rid="aex118-B17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Although guidelines recommend a hypotonic maintenance strategy, the scarce observational data demonstrate that this advice is frequently ignored.<xref rid="aex118-B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> We compared a premixed hypotonic fluid with a solution containing NaCl 0.9% in glucose 5% to which 40&#x02009;mmol of potassium chloride was added manually to supply the subjects with the recommended amount potassium of 1&#x02009;mmol kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of body weight per day.<xref rid="aex118-B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Although conveniently termed isotonic, it should be acknowledged that this widespread practice essentially renders this solution hypertonic.</p><p>Our study not only showed that urine output was significantly lower after 2 days of isotonic <italic>vs</italic> hypotonic maintenance therapy, but also that the observed effect was remarkably substantial; isotonic retention exceeded 10&#x02009;ml kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of body weight. Previous evidence of the morbidity associated with a weight gain of 3&#x02009;kg during a typical perioperative period underscores the importance of this finding.<xref rid="aex118-B16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> The stable fluid balance we observed in the absence of increased aldosterone suggests that both the fluid volume and its sodium content are appropriate during hypotonic treatment. As we followed our subjects for only 2 days, however, it is unclear at what point a new steady state (characterized by renewed correspondence between intake and renal sodium excretion) would be reached. Based on previous dietary experiments, we can assume that fluid retention would persist for 3&#x02013;5 days.<xref rid="aex118-B4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Even then, the contracted fluid gain would be maintained until several days after the cessation of the increased sodium administration.<xref rid="aex118-B4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p><p>We explored several markers of volume regulation and osmoregulation, the two main adaptive physiological mechanisms that are potentially responsible for the observed findings. Osmoregulation did not appear to play a major role because serum osmolality, serum ADH, and thirst were not influenced by the type of the infusion fluid. On the contrary, the observed fluid retention with isotonic treatment could be explained by the reduction in aldosterone concentration, which acts as a marker of expanded effective circulating volume.<xref rid="aex118-B4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> This was further illustrated by the enhanced urinary sodium excretion and hinted at by the lower albumin concentrations in this treatment arm. We firmly believe that volume expansion is not the purpose of a routine maintenance prescription. Although it is usually the result of ADH secretion, the increase in urine osmolality can also be explained by isotonic plasma expansion without exceeding the osmoreceptor threshold. It is the consequence of compensatory water reabsorption at the level of the collecting tubule of the nephron after the reduced reabsorption of glomerular filtrate in the proximal tubule.<xref rid="aex118-B27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Likewise, decreased proximal tubular reabsorption is the most plausible explanation for the lower serum calcium concentrations during isotonic treatment.<xref rid="aex118-B4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p><p>Despite the large difference in the sodium content of the two solutions, no abnormal sodium concentrations were encountered, and no significant variation from baseline value was observed. Of course, the incidence of inappropriate or appropriate ADH secretion is virtually non-existent in healthy subjects, and our finding does not contradict recent findings on paediatric maintenance prescription.<xref rid="aex118-B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><xref rid="aex118-B10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> However, as these studies considered the incidence of hyponatraemia in isolation, their conclusions might overlook the potentially important detrimental effects of salt-rich solutions. Our data indicate that these solutions could expose patients to unintended plasma expansion and fluid retention, even at maintenance rate; the consequences of this fact require further examination. Current guidelines recommend the administration of 1&#x02009;mmol of potassium per kilogram of body weight, but the 26&#x02009;mmol litre<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> content in the hypotonic solution was sufficient to keep serum potassium concentrations unchanged from baseline and well within the normal range. The two episodes of hyperkalaemia recorded in a total of 120 measurements are likely to have been coincidental, especially as they were encountered in both treatment arms.</p><p>Chloride was the only electrolyte affected substantially by the isotonic solution, even frequently causing hyperchloraemia and a decreased strong ion difference, an established cause of metabolic acidosis.<xref rid="aex118-B28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> It is common practice to add potassium manually in the form of concentrated potassium chloride to infusion fluids. In our study, this resulted in the administration of a remarkable 323&#x02009;(77) mmol of chloride per day with the isotonic treatment [<italic>v</italic><italic>s</italic> 95&#x02009;(20) mmol using the hypotonic fluid]. The potential importance of these findings is illustrated by a recent study demonstrating the association between a chloride-rich fluid strategy and a higher incidence of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients.<xref rid="aex118-B29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Recently, a large chloride load was also shown to be associated with an unfavourable impact on various renal parameters in healthy volunteers.<xref rid="aex118-B30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref><xref rid="aex118-B31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> It is plausible that the ill-considered prescription of maintenance solutions is responsible for a substantial portion of iatrogenic chloride load, perhaps more so than resuscitation fluids, which are better researched but used for shorter periods.</p><p>Our study had certain limitations. First, to be able to measure the effect size as precisely as possible, we designed the study as a crossover experiment including only healthy volunteers rather than patients. Although we attempted to counteract this issue by selecting broad inclusion criteria, mimicking real life as closely as possible, the applicability of our findings to certain patients is unclear. In particular, the management of maintenance fluids in patients who are already fluid expanded or have renal failure requires exploration. The role of essential hypertension also remains unclear, as exaggerated natriuresis was clearly present in one of our subjects who had not previously been diagnosed with hypertension.<xref rid="aex118-B25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> The extent and incidence of this phenomenon is unknown. Nonetheless, we believe our findings could easily be extrapolated to the majority of hospitalized patients in view of the 48&#x02009;h fasting setting that resembles the clinical use of maintenance therapy. Finally, it is difficult to assess the definitive clinical impact of our findings, because the exact mechanisms behind the deleterious effect of fluid and salt overload require elucidation in many patient populations, including the critically ill. Only a set of well-designed clinical trials, performed in different subgroups, will be able to clarify this issue.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>At the guideline-recommended dose, isotonic <italic>v</italic><italic>s</italic> hypotonic maintenance solutions caused the retention of a potentially clinically relevant amount of fluid, characterized by decreased serum aldosterone concentrations that indicate volume expansion, which is not the intent of maintenance fluid therapy. In the absence of appropriate or inappropriate secretion of ADH, the hypotonic solution did not cause sodium abnormalities and, despite its lower potassium content of 26&#x02009;mmol litre<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, serum potassium concentrations remained well within normal limits. The use of NaCl 0.9% supplemented by hypertonic potassium chloride caused a substantial chloride load and hyperchloraemia. In view of the widespread use of maintenance fluids, trials with carefully chosen end points are needed to address their safety in different clinical settings.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>Study design: N.V.R., T.V.d.W., T.D.W., A.V.C., K.D., W.V., P.J., M.M.</p><p>Drafting the protocol: N.V.R., T.V.d.W., PJ.</p><p>Advice on the statistical analysis: E.R., T.V.d.W.</p><p>Advice on the physiological explanation behind the findings: T.D.W., A.V.C., W.V.</p><p>First draft of the manuscript.
