Placement of the device is by standard laparoscopic surgical techniques without anatomic alterations of the gastrointestinal tract. Development of vagal blocking was based on prior observations that vagotomy could improve obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], including hypothalamic damage obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and is thought to help patients control feelings of hunger. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated clinically meaningful weight loss with vBloc therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and improvement in obesity-related comorbid conditions such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Vagal blockade using the vBloc Maestro System is the first new obesity treatment device to receive FDA approval in 14&#x000a0;years.</p><p>Weight loss and safety results from the ReCharge randomized controlled trial, which evaluated vBloc therapy using a rechargeable device, have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Using a mixed-effects analysis of the intent-to-treat population, an estimated mean percentage excess weight loss (%EWL) of 26&#x000a0;% (10&#x000a0;% TWL) for vBloc and 17&#x000a0;% for sham (6&#x000a0;% TWL) (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) at 12&#x000a0;months was demonstrated.</p><p>Patients with moderate obesity, BMI 35&#x02013;40&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, particularly those with obesity-related comorbid conditions, is a cohort of interest since health care assessment groups have noted lack of clinical evidence in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The ReCharge Trial enrolled an appreciable number of participants with moderate obesity, and this report summarizes safety and efficacy data from the trial through 12&#x000a0;months in this patient group to confirm that the moderate BMI group had similar efficacy and safety results to the overall cohort and address the lack of clinical evidence in this population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>The ReCharge Trial study design and methods have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The majority of participants were enrolled at eight sites in the USA, with two additional sites in Australia. Participants were eligible for enrollment if their BMI was 40&#x02013;45 or 35&#x02013;40&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> with one or more of the following obesity-related comorbidities: type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, sleep apnea syndrome, or obesity-induced cardiomyopathy. This report includes only those participants with BMI 35&#x02013;40&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Design</title><p>ReCharge is a randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled trial comparing vBloc to a custom-designed sham device. Randomization occurred at implant in a 2:1 ratio to vBloc and sham in permuted block sizes of 3 or 6 stratified by clinical site and type 2 diabetes mellitus status.</p><p>Participants and all follow-up personnel, including the sponsor, were blinded until 12-month visits were completed for all trial participants. The interaction of the surgeon with study participants was limited after randomization until the study was unblinded due to the difference in implantation techniques for the two study arms. The study was not unblinded until all participants finished their 12-month visit and data were verified.</p><p>The safety of the study was monitored by an independent data and safety monitoring board, and all serious adverse events (SAEs) were independently adjudicated for relatedness by an independent clinical events committee (CEC). The ethical standards for subject treatment set forth in the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 were followed. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. The study received institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee (EC) approval from Bellberry Limited EC, Scottsdale Clinical Research Institute Scottsdale Healthcare, Tufts Medical Center IRB, Oregon Health &#x00026; Science University IRB, Mayo Clinic Rochester IRB, Stanford University Medical Center IRB, University of Minnesota IRB, Scripps IRB, and Western IRB. The study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov with the identifier NCT01327976.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Intervention</title><p>The Maestro Rechargeable System consists of two implanted components: (1) leads that are placed around the anterior and posterior vagal trunks near the esophagogastric junction using standard laparoscopic surgery and (2) a rechargeable neuroregulator placed subcutaneously on the thoracic wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The neuroregulator requires in-home transcutaneous charging approximately two times weekly using a transmit coil placed over the neuroregulator.</p><p>The sham arm neuroregulator was custom-designed by the sponsor to dissipate electrical charge at a rate identical to the active device. In the sham device, charge was dissipated into resistors within the sham neuroregulator rather than delivering charge to the vagus. No electrodes were implanted and the abdominal cavity was not entered. Skin incisions, placed where trocars would typically be placed, were made to simulate the laparoscopic procedure and support blinding the participant and the follow-up personnel.</p><p>The neuroregulator was programmed in both vBloc and sham groups to deliver at least 12&#x000a0;h of therapy per day. Of note, frequent charging of the devices was required in both groups despite no therapy delivery in the sham group. This was a feature designed to protect study blinding. The protocol prespecified weekly therapy current amplitude level increases over the first month to 6&#x000a0;mA. If needed, the amplitude could be adjusted on an alternate schedule by the follow-up team if the participant experienced any discomfort related to the therapy. All participants were asked to check their battery level daily and to recharge their battery when necessary.</p><p>Follow-up visits occurred weekly in the first month, bi-weekly through month 3, and monthly thereafter. Monthly visits were conducted within a 2-week window. All patients participated in a weight management program that typically consisted of a 15-min educational discussion at each visit on healthy food choices, exercise, and behavioral modification by a trained dietitian or a research assistant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study Objectives</title><p>The primary 12-month efficacy and safety endpoints of the entire study population have been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and overall study outcomes will continue to be assessed for 5&#x000a0;years. The prespecified coprimary efficacy endpoints were as follows: (1) to compare the mean %EWL of the vBloc and sham groups (in the entire sample, at a superiority margin of 10&#x000a0;%) and (2) to assess whether the percentage of participants in the vBloc group with at least 20&#x000a0;% EWL exceeded 55&#x000a0;% and whether the percentage with at least 25&#x000a0;% EWL exceeded 45&#x000a0;%. The primary safety endpoint was to determine whether the rate of serious adverse events (SAEs) related to the device, implant/revision procedure, or therapy in the vBloc group was less than 15&#x000a0;%.</p><p>This report focuses on efficacy and safety, through 12&#x000a0;months, in the moderately obese subgroup with BMI of 35 to 40&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. We also present the mean comparison using percentage total weight loss (%TWL) and various commonly cited %TWL thresholds.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Mixed-effects regression models were used to conduct analyses on the weight loss data in this moderate BMI cohort using the intention-to-treat (ITT) population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Models were fit with an unstructured covariance matrix and treating time (study visits) as a categorical variable with time-specific contrasts. Data are assumed to be missing at random under these models. Weight loss results are also reported as a complete case analysis.</p><p>Weight loss results are not reported using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method, the primary imputation method for the 12-month results for the entire ITT population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], due to the limitations in statistical properties of LOCF imputation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

The three withdrawals in the sham group occurred after implant and were due to breast cancer in one case and subject decision in two cases.

Most related events were temporary side effects of the procedure or therapy which resolved with no intervention or with a change in therapy algorithm.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Adverse events related to device, procedure, or therapy through 12&#x000a0;months</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Adverse event</th><th colspan="3">vBloc <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;53</th><th colspan="3">Sham <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;31</th></tr><tr><th>No. (%) of patients</th><th>No. of events</th><th>% events<break/>Mild/moderate<break/>Severity</th><th>No. (%) of patients</th><th>No. of events</th><th>% events<break/>Mild/moderate<break/>Severity</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Pain, neuroregulator site</td><td>15 (28)</td><td>17</td><td>100</td><td>17 (55)</td><td>17</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>12 (23)</td><td>16</td><td>100</td><td>3 (10)</td><td>3</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Heartburn/dyspepsia</td><td>13 (25)</td><td>13</td><td>100</td><td>1 (3)</td><td>1</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Pain, other</td><td>7 (13)</td><td>9</td><td>100</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>0</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Pain, abdominal</td><td>5 (9)</td><td>7</td><td>100</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>0</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Incision pain</td><td>5 (9)</td><td>6</td><td>100</td><td>4 (13)</td><td>4</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Nausea</td><td>3 (6)</td><td>6</td><td>100</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>0</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Eructation/belching</td><td>5 (9)</td><td>5</td><td>100</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>0</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Dysphagia</td><td>4 (8)</td><td>4</td><td>100</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>0</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chest pain</td><td>3 (6)</td><td>3</td><td>100</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>0</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Constipation</td><td>3 (6)</td><td>3</td><td>100</td><td>3 (10)</td><td>3</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Cramps, abdominal</td><td>3 (6)</td><td>3</td><td>100</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>0</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Dizziness</td><td>3 (6)</td><td>3</td><td>100</td><td>0 (0)</td><td>0</td><td/></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Only adverse events attributed by the investigator to the device, procedure, or therapy that occurred in at least 5&#x000a0;% of vBloc group participants are displayed</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>No primary safety endpoint-related SAEs occurred in the moderately obese vBloc participants through 12&#x000a0;months. Three SAEs (5.7&#x000a0;%) were adjudicated as related to general intra-abdominal surgery in the vBloc arm. Two events were mild or moderate events of nausea due to anesthesia and one event was discovery of a cirrhotic liver at implant, so the participant was not implanted.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the subset of participants with a BMI from 35 to 40&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and at least one obesity-related comorbid condition in the ReCharge Trial, weight loss with vBloc therapy was shown to be superior to a rigorous sham control. The vBloc group demonstrated an average weight loss of 33&#x000a0;% EWL or 11&#x000a0;% TWL, with half of participants achieving at least 30&#x000a0;% EWL and one in four patients achieving at least 50&#x000a0;% EWL. In addition, vBloc therapy had a low rate of associated risks. No primary safety endpoint-related events occurred, and all nonserious AEs were mild to moderate in severity. Most AEs spontaneously resolved or were addressed with modification of the therapy algorithm.</p><p>With the combination of clinically meaningful weight loss and favorable safety profile in the moderately obese population, vBloc is a reasonable next step after diet and exercise have failed, or for patients not willing to undergo, or not appropriate candidates for, more aggressive surgical interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. There is currently a treatment gap between those patients who can be successful with diet and exercise and those willing to undergo surgery, so additional efficacious and safe treatment options for obesity and comorbidities are needed. While longer-term efficacy data need to be further studied, the 1-year weight loss reported provides support that vagal blockade may be considered an effective alternative to conventional weight loss surgery particularly in this moderate obesity patient group.</p><p>Weight loss in the sham group was greater than expected, which has been discussed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Briefly, it was hypothesized that the sham response was due to the robust placebo effect of sham surgery along with daily monitoring and recharging of the sham device. In keeping with our dietary intervention studies, the sham effect was not found to persist in the entire cohort of the ReCharge Trial through 18&#x000a0;months as the sham group regained 40&#x000a0;% of the weight lost at 12&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The analysis in this report has limitations. First, this is an analysis of a subgroup of the entire randomized sample and has limitations inherent to subpopulations. On the other hand, this is offset somewhat by the fact that this subgroup analysis was prespecified, the analysis was conducted using the ITT population, and there were little missing data. Second, analysis of a subgroup diminishes the statistical power to identify significant differences between the treatment groups; however, statistical superiority in mean weight loss was achieved and most weight loss thresholds were met despite this reduced power. Third, results for this subgroup are presented at 12&#x000a0;months, so the durability of weight loss in this subset of participants requires additional follow-up. Results of the entire ReCharge cohort through 18&#x000a0;months have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and show that the weight loss among vBloc participants were largely sustained, whereas the sham group regained nearly half of the weight they had lost through 12&#x000a0;months despite remaining blinded through most of the period between 12 and 18&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Individuals with moderate obesity have been considered well-suited candidates for vBloc therapy given that the minimally invasive procedure does not require permanent changes to gastrointestinal anatomy, is reversible, and appears to have a more favorable safety profile to traditional weight loss surgery. In this moderately obese population, the ReCharge Trial demonstrated superior weight loss in the vBloc therapy group than the sham group among participants with moderate obesity. Therapy with vBloc is safe and well tolerated. Additional long-term data and continued follow-up of the ReCharge study are needed to further characterize the safety and effectiveness profile of vBloc therapy in subjects with moderate obesity.</p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="conflict-interest"><title>Compliance with Ethical Standards</title><p>All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.</p><p>Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p>EnteroMedics Inc., the funder/sponsor, was involved in the design and conduct of the study, site selection, and database management.
