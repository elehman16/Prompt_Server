The lack of anxiety or disease-like anxiety will endanger people and cause them to confront many problems. Balanced and constructive anxiety will make people struggle for their lives and make their lives more effective and stable.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>The Katon (2008) study showed that the outbreak of depression in diabetic patients is 61/3%, and 40/6% suffer from acute or severe depression, although most of the chronic diseases are accompanied with the increase in depression outbreak. But, in diabetic patients, this problem is three times as much.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The results of the research of Simono <italic>et al</italic>. (2007) showed that depressed diabetic patients referred to physician's more than diabetic patients without depression, and have used outpatients&#x02019; health care, and their therapeutic cost is 4/5 times as much as now.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The rate of anxiety and depression in diabetic patients was more than the normal population, and it was two-times as much as normal persons. In these patients, depression will affect considerably on diabetes prognosis, and some studies showed that the inability to diagnose and treat depression will make patients&#x02019; diabetes prognosis serious.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Some researchers found a weak to average relationship between depression and inappropriate control of blood-glucose in diabetic patients, but some of the other studies have not shown this relationship.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Also, some studies showed that depression is accompanied with an increase in death rate in diabetic patients.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Anxiety will increase the depression rate and cause patients to think about suicide, although it will result in concentration reduction and disorders in decision making skills.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Diabetic patients need an effective and suitable treatment among the different methods accompanied by pharmaceutical treatment; teaching problem solving and decision making have special importance.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Problem solving and decision making skills include a set of abilities that will increase compatibility and positive and efficient behaviour; therefore, the patient can accept his/her social role responsibilities without hurting others or him/herself and confront efficiently with daily problems.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Some researches were performed in this area by Malouff and Thorsteinsson about the effect of problem solving treatment on reducing the severity of some diseases. Considering the outbreak of depression and anxiety in diabetic patients, finding a way for treating them will became important. In this research, the researcher wanted to measure the effect of problem solving skill on depression and anxiety.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This research is a quasi-experimental (case-control) study. In this research, a control and a subject group were used and put randomly in groups. The research statistical population are all diabetic patients with type 2 diabetes, with ages between 20 and 60 years who were under control and treatment in Qaemshahr in 2010-2011. The total number of diabetic patients in two state hospitals of Qaemshahr, Razi and ValieAsr was 2801 patients.</p><p>The population of this study was the patients who were referred to the hospital, and they were divided into two groups as a subject group (<italic>n</italic> = 15) and a control group (<italic>n</italic> = 15). For data collection, the researcher held one explaining session as a trainer of the problem solving skill of the subject group, and he explained the primary recommendation, objectives and the rules and he held eight sessions for teaching problem solving skill and making groups&#x02019; member familiar with three kinds of contradictions (feelings&#x02013;inter values and inter needs). In the first session, group members were introduced and primary definitions were provided; in the second session, key concepts for solving problems were stated and basic stages in problem solving and the first and second skill for solving problem were reviewed; in the third session, the obstacles of problem solving recognition (six obstacles) were studied and third (exploration of solutions) and forth skills of problem solving (solutions&#x02019; trial) were studied; in the fifth session, the last skill of problem solving (resources evaluation) was stated; in the sixth session, the skills&#x02019; application in psychology were studied; in the seventh session, important points were stated; and in the last session, previous problems were reviewed.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Data collection tools</title><p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Beck depression inventory (21 items): This scale was compiled for the first time by Neron Back, Ward, Mendelsohn, Mack and Oraph (1961) and was reviewed several times. Now, it is used with 21 items with a special symptom of depression. The subject patient will select one of these items that show his/her severity of depression symptom. Each item will have the scores of 0 to 3; in this way, the total score of the questionnaire will be from 0 to 63. This type of questionnaire can be used in the statistical population of older than 13 year olds. The validity of this research is the reliability coefficient of this test that was obtained from the re-test of a group of 20 psychology students, which was 0/76.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Zank anxiety test S.A.S. (20 items): This scale has 20 questions with four items and was provided based on bodily and sentimental symptoms. Diagnosis criteria were used for making this scale that was compatible with the most prevalent features of anxiety disorders. Diagnosis criteria S.A.S. have five sentimental symptoms and 15 bodily symptoms. This questionnaire was normalized in Iran and a Vakily obtained its reliability in 2007 that was 0/87 and AsgharMoghadam, Saed, DibajNia and Zangene have its reliability equal to 0/89. Also, Kalkhoran, Bahrami, Farrokhi, Zaraati and Tarrahomi have reached to reliability 0/84 and Fifel obtained its reliability equal to 0/49 and Nimier has obtained it in a research to be 0/91. In this research, reliability coefficient was obtained by re-test of a group of 20 students of psychology that was 0/82.</p></list-item></list>

Therefore, we could not use the <italic>t</italic> test for two independent groups and so we used the Uman Whitney test. Tables and diagrams showed that the difference between the ranges of depression and anxiety of two subject and control groups is significant because the <italic>P</italic> value in the depression test was 0/000 and in the anxiety test was 0/001, that is smaller than &#x003b1; = 0/05 [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. Therefore, the average difference of before and after the study in the subject group in hypothesis one equals to 12, which is higher than the average difference of the control group before and after of 0/06, and in hypothesis 2 equals to 6/93 higher than the average difference of before and after in the control group, which was 0/60 [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. We can judge with the 95% confidence that teaching problem solving and decision making skill is effective in tendency to depression in diabetic patients with type 2 diabetes, which means that teaching problem solving skills will decrease the diabetic patients&#x02019; tendencies to depression.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>The variance equality of depression and anxiety rate of subject and control group</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ABR-4-112-g003"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>The comparison of the effect of teaching problem solving and division making skills on tendency to depression and anxiety of subjects</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ABR-4-112-g004"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The results of the first research showed that teaching problem solving and decision making skill will result in reducing tendency to depression in diabetic patient's type 2. These results are compatible with the results of the researches performed by Malouffand Thorsteinsson (2007). They showed in a research that problem solving therapy is effective in reducing the symptoms of depression.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Also, Nezu and Pery used patients with depression and tested them in two groups of control and subject groups. The subject group took part in the therapeutic sessions of problem solving and the control group were held in a waiting list for treatment. The results showed that more than 85% of the subjects in the subject group showed meaningful reduction in depression symptoms at the end of therapeutic sessions, although this rate was 9% in the control group.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The second hypothesis of teaching problem solving and decision making skill resulted in a reduction of tendency to anxiety in diabetic patients type 2. This result is compatible with the results of Davis and Lysaker, who studied the efficiency of the cognitive-behavioral techniques in improving meta cognitive beliefs and cognitive and behavioral techniques in developing metacognitive skills in patients with anxiety.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Ligro <italic>et al</italic>. (2003) showed the effect of cognitive-behavioral treatment on anxiety. In this research, 10 adolescents with anxiety were treated by cognitive-behavioral treatment and, finally, seven persons were cured completely.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In a research, Dowrick (2000) compared the effect of problem solving treatment with the effect of group psychology training among patients with depression. The results showed that although using both types of treatments of problem solving and group psychology training are effective in reducing depression, the effect of problem solving is more than the effect of group psychology teaching.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Also, McNaughton <italic>et al</italic>. executed a research on the effect of therapeutic-cognitive behavior on 35 young girls with social anxiety. After treatment, they observed considerable developments in the subject group that were higher than the control group, such that their social anxiety reduced by 50% firmly.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>The present research showed that by accurate study of problem solving skills, the factors of depression and anxiety in diabetic patients with type 2 diabetes can be controlled effectively, and it should be mentioned that this is in the interaction between the individual and the environment, in which the environment's need and possibilities accessible by individuals are incompatible and there is no solution for removing this imbalance. Problem solving skill necessitates using old knowledge and principles in a new combination. Equipping with the ability and skill of problem solving in difficulties that humans confront has an important effect on human tranquility. In teaching problem solving and decision making skill, people learn to define the problem accurately and make a decision. This ability causes more feeling of being valuable and reduces failure due to the lack of power of problem solving and making daily decision, and is effective in the rate of individuals&#x02019; psychological welfare.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> Authors
