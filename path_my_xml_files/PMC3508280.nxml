As this reflects the so-called <italic>testing effect</italic>, which is supposed to be enhanced by feedback, we investigated whether feedback following an interim assessment would have an effect on the score of the course exam, and whether the effect is influenced by the gender of the student. During a General Pathology bachelor course all 386 (bio) medical students took an interim assessment on the topics <italic>cell damage</italic> (first week) and <italic>tumour pathology</italic> (fourth week). The intervention consisted of immediate detailed oral feedback on the content of the questions of the interim assessment by the tutor, including the rationale of the correct and incorrect answers. It concerned a prospective randomized study using a cross-over design. Outcome measures were: (1) the difference in the normalized scores (1&#x02013;10) of the course examination multiple choice questions related to the two topics, (2) effect of gender, and (3) gender-specific scores on formal examination. The effect of feedback was estimated as half the difference in the outcome between the two conditions. Mixed-model analysis was used whereby the SGW group was taken as the study target. The scores of the questions on <italic>cell damage</italic> amounted to 7.70 (SD 1.59) in the group without and 7.78 (SD 1.39) in the group with feedback, and 6.73 (SD 1.51) and 6.77 (SD 1.60), respectively, for those on <italic>tumour pathology</italic>.

No additional effect of immediate explicit feedback following an interim assessment during an SGW session in an ongoing bachelor course could be demonstrated in this prospective randomized controlled study.

A relevant instrument to challenge students and teachers is assessment, as it not only drives learning but it may also help learning, the so-called &#x02018;testing effect&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Recent work by Karpicke and Roediger has demonstrated that increased learning by testing takes place by retrieval practice, not by repeated learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Underlying mechanisms include (a) focusing students on the relevant topics, (b) increasing students&#x02019; motivation, and (c) training students&#x02019; capacity to answer questions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Increased learning by testing has not only been demonstrated in a laboratory environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], but also in a more realistic setting, i.e. an ongoing course in a regular academic curriculum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In a previous study using a prospective controlled design, we demonstrated that an interim assessment during an ongoing bachelor course for (bio) medical students resulted in a higher score in the course examination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As this study was performed during a small group work (SGW) session without explicit feedback from the interim assessment, and feedback is supposed to enhance learning by testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], we decided to embark on a follow-up study including feedback as an intervention. Since there are some indications that females are more susceptible to feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], we felt it worthwhile to also study the effect of gender.</p><p>Based on a literature review, feedback can be defined as &#x02018;Specific information about the comparison between a trainee&#x02019;s observed performance as a standard, given with the intent to improve the trainee&#x02019;s performance&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The purpose of feedback is to reduce discrepancies between the current understanding or performance and the desired goal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It is believed that feedback provides the route by which assessment becomes a tool for teaching and learning, and it is central to the concept of formative assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Although the power of feedback is extensively emphasized in the literature, there are only a few studies that have systematically investigated the power of feedback within the classroom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. According to a systematic review performed by Veloski et al. feedback is most effective when provided by an authoritative, credible source. These authors recommend that the effects of feedback should be studied separately from those of other concurrent interventions, such as implementation of practice guidelines or educational programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This implies that studies on the effects of feedback in (medical) education should adhere to a well-defined description of the feedback given, and be executed with an unequivocal experimental design.</p><p>Based on these considerations we wanted to determine whether: (1) explicit feedback following an interim assessment during SGW has an effect on the formal examination score, and (2) the effect of feedback is influenced by gender. This was done by means of a prospective randomized study using a cross-over design.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants and setting</title><p>The study was conducted with students at the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, the Netherlands, consisting of 299 medical and 87 biomedical science students, who were all taking a second-year bachelor course in General Pathology. The female-to-male ratio of students was 3:1. A learner outcome-oriented curriculum is provided in which each course consists of four weeks including four topics (1. Principles of diagnosis and cell damage, 2. Inflammation and repair, 3. Circulatory disorders, 4. Tumour pathology). Each topic had a consistent sequence of educational activities (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). All 386 students took an interim assessment consisting of seven multiple-choice questions (derived from a validated bank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]) in the first (cell damage) and in the fourth (tumour pathology) week. In arm A, students received feedback on the interim assessment on cell damage; in arm B students received feedback on the interim assessment on tumour pathology (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Theme structure.

This was provided orally by the tutors, who are experts in the field of general pathology. This explicit feedback was given using a standardized format, whereby all the answer options and their rationale were elucidated by the tutor. Feedback was provided according to the recommendations of Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It took place at the end of the SGW session and lasted 10&#x000a0;min. In the non-feedback groups the usual discussions on cell damage or tumour pathology lasted until the end of the SGW session. Students in the control arm who asked about feedback were referred to the subsequent interactive lecture.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Randomization</title><p>Participants from the SGW groups were randomized into two arms of equal numbers. Allocation of intervention occurred on the level of the SGW groups. A minimization procedure according to Pocock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and Borm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] was used to obtain an optimal balance on the factors gender, study discipline and tutor, since these may influence learning behaviour and learning efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Procedure</title><p>Students were informed about the interim assessment at the beginning of the SGW session. Tutors explained to the students immediately before the interim assessment that it was an investigation to inform the faculty on the learning outcome of students during the SGW. Participation in the interim assessment was on a voluntary basis, and students could stop taking the assessment at any time. They were assured that the result of the interim assessment would not be taken into account for determining the score of the formal course examination.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>As the study was conducted before the recently installed ethical advisory procedure of the Netherlands Association for Medical Education, information about the treatment of the students is provided. This concerns the possible risks for the students, the equitability of the selection, the guarantee of privacy and confidentiality, the procedure on informed consent, and the possible safeguards to protect vulnerable populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In our opinion, participation in the interim assessments bore no possible risk to students. The assignment of the students to the intervention and control arm was at random. For the study, the examination scores were linked to the student number and the identity of the students was not disclosed. The students were adequately informed on the purpose of the interim assessment and consent was obtained. When developing the current study, the ethical principles of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki were taken into account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The outcome measures were: (1) The difference in normalized score of the course examination multiple-choice questions on cell damage (15 questions) and tumour pathology (15 questions). These outcome measures were presented on a scale from 1 to a maximum of 10 points; (2) The effect of gender on these differences using a subgroup analysis; and (3) The scores on the formal examination for males and females separately. As the interim assessment is intended as an educational tool, not as a predictive instrument, the results of the interim assessment were not an outcome measure of the current study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Linear mixed models were used in order to account for the dependence caused by clustering of the students into SGW groups; an SGW group dependent random intercept was estimated to correct for differences between SGW groups that would cause correlated residuals without this procedure. A restricted maximum likelihood estimation procedure was used and since both the number of SGW groups and the number of students within an SGW group was substantial, we used a Satterthwaite correction for the degrees of freedom. Analysis was performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. After the primary analysis, a subgroup analysis was performed according to gender.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Participation rate</title><p>Participation rate was 100&#x000a0;%; a total of 368 students undertook the interim assessments.

In this previous study we demonstrated that an interim assessment provided during an SGW session in an ongoing (bio) medical curriculum resulted in a higher score in the formal course exam. However, in our current prospective randomized controlled study no additional effect of immediate explicit feedback following an interim assessment in the context of an SGW session on the result of the formal course exam could be demonstrated. Females scored 0.43 points higher on the formal examination in comparison with their male colleagues. This is in line with our experience from previous years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Our current study indicates that this difference in performance cannot be explained by a different gender response to feedback. Gender aspects will be discussed later.</p><p>Why were we not able to demonstrate a positive effect of feedback in the current study? To answer this question the findings will be discussed with emphasis on the educational interpretation of feedback and the methodology of the studies involved. Possible explanations could be the type and quality of feedback given, the learning environment (context) in which feedback took place, and the presence of a ceiling effect in learning. These aspects will now be discussed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>The educational interpretation of feedback</title><p>Feedback is a process of high complexity involving different factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Its aim is to reduce discrepancies between the current understanding or performance by the student and the desired goal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Also, the responses to feedback are influenced by many factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Even if feedback is appropriate and accurate, the intended message may not be recognised or understood, because the learner is not yet receptive to the message. Self-evaluation and self-regulation skills determine how feedback is received, interpreted and used by the individual student [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Regarding the type of feedback, Hattie and Timperley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] propose a model of feedback to enhance learning in which they discern the task level, the process level, the self-regulation level, and the self level. The feedback given in our current study was mainly on the task level, i.e. how well the interim assessment was performed, and less on the other levels. This means that the feedback provided consisted of several components of good feedback practice as propagated by Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]: It delivered high-quality information to students about their learning, encouraged teacher and peer dialogue around learning, and provided opportunities to close the gap between current and desired performance.</p><p>Regarding the quality of feedback, Wood defines helpful feedback as specific, non-judgemental, behavioural, and descriptive, and provided within a supportive educational environment close to the time of the learning experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Based on these recommendations on feedback in a (bio) medical educational setting and those by Veloski et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] we consider our explicit and content-driven feedback provided by an authoritative person as specific, descriptive, and non-judgemental. It was focused on cognitive aspects and therefore not primarily behavioural. Furthermore, feedback took place at the end of the SGW session that we consider to be a supportive educational environment, as we will now discuss.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Implicit versus explicit feedback</title><p>The learning environment in our study, i.e. the SGW session, may indeed matter, as we now elucidate. SGW is the example per excellence of active and meaningful learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The power of this learning environment is determined by tutorial group functioning, the problems/tasks to be solved and tutors&#x02019; competencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The active and self-directed learner is supposed to dynamically interact with mental constructs, continuously amending and reconstructing them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Hereby, the learner either actively seeks feedback or detects feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], which can be interpreted as implicit feedback, as it is generated by the active leaner and not provided explicitly by an external agent. Implicit feedback can also be acquired during the subsequent joint self-study, and the interactive lecture during which students can ask questions to expert tutors on remaining unsolved problems. This would mean that in the context of an optimal learning environment as the SGW session, implicit feedback is dominant in the learning process, and explicit feedback following an interim assessment has no added value in this context. Another implication is that an interim assessment in the setting of an SGW work session results in a positive effect on the formal course exam even without providing explicit feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This discloses the interim assessment as an efficient learning instrument during an SGW, as it challenges students, fits well within the context of the learning environment, and is not time consuming.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Comparison with the literature</title><p>To the best of our knowledge, no other prospective randomized study in which the effect of feedback following an interim assessment in the context of an SGW session has not published so far. Possible explanations for this may be that such studies are discouraged because they are strongly context dependent as suggested earlier by Van der Vleuten and Schuwirth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and the occurrence of publication bias because of negative results. This could be due to the fact that feedback is not necessarily a reinforcer, as it can be misunderstood, modified, or rejected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Few studies could be found in which the results of feedback were restricted to a subgroup of students or did not meet the a priori expectations. Murdoch-Eaton et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] reported on maturational differences in undergraduate medical students&#x02019; perception about feedback. Van Mook et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] were disappointed by the outcome of feedback given in the context of web-assisted assessment of professional behaviour in problem-based learning.</p><p>Regarding the effect of gender on feedback, Sinclair et al. found that female students were more susceptible to feedback than their male peers. This was related to the fact that females were keener to seek out formative feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It is plausible that this particular behaviour may be explained by the stronger intrinsic motivation of female medical students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and their higher degree of mental maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This suggests that male (bio) medical students need more and/or other challenges to motivate them for learning, which should be studied further, because of their lower performance as was also demonstrated in our current study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Use of randomized controlled trials in medical education</title><p>Educational research grounded in qualitative paradigms greatly enriches our understanding. However, quantitative methods such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are still relevant in medical education research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This relates to the fact that they are numerous and yield important, insightful results. Before embarking on an RCT it is essential to first define the research question and conceptual framework, and then identify the most appropriate methods. For further information the reader is referred to the authoritative chapter by Norman and Eva [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. According to Cook, RCTs will continue to play an important role in advancing our understanding in what works in medical education, for whom, and under what circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Well-planned RCTs can test theories and explore the features and mechanisms that define effective instruction. On the other hand, one should be aware of the fact that RCTs are not appropriate for all significant and worthwhile research questions and they are susceptible, just as any other design, to the common flaws of confounding and inadequate sample size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Strengths and limitations of the current study</title><p>The study design, a prospective randomized controlled trial with minimization for gender, discipline and tutor, can be considered to be robust, since selection bias, information bias and confounding bias are highly unlikely. In addition, the cross-over design chosen prevents differences in learning environment between different groups of students.</p><p>The cross-over design in the current study has intrinsic limitations. The control arm during the second intervention may be biased by the fact that they received feedback during the first intervention; therefore, these students might be more actively searching for feedback at other instances during the course. This includes seeking feedback from their peers in the intervention arm, which may be considered to be &#x02018;contamination&#x02019;, which could lead to dilution of the effect of feedback. In addition, the time interval between the intervention and the formal course examination differed considerably, i.e. 3&#x000a0;weeks for the first intervention and 3&#x000a0;days for the second intervention. However, we did not find any difference in the effect of feedback between the first and fourth week. We did demonstrate a difference in score between the topic cell damage (first week, 7.7) and tumour pathology (fourth week, 6.7). This is in line with our experience in previous years, and it may be related to the degree of complexity of tumour pathology.</p><p>A further limitation of the current study is the strong context dependence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], which hampers generalization of our findings. This relates to the context of feedback given during SGW and to the particular setting of our curriculum. Notwithstanding the matter of the generalization of our specific results, the current study has stimulated further thinking on the methodology and educational interpretation of feedback.</p><p>Using the current design we were not able to test the effect of the interim assessment itself. Based on the positive learning effect of an interim assessment in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] we considered it unethical to withhold an interim assessment from the students. Therefore, all students in both conditions undertook an interim assessment. As the circumstances in the previous study were identical with exception of feedback, it is highly likely that the so-called testing effect took place.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>No additional effect of immediate feedback following an interim assessment during an SGW session in an ongoing bachelor course could be demonstrated in this prospective randomized controlled study. Gender analysis revealed a higher performance of female students in the formal examination, which could not be explained by the effect of feedback.
