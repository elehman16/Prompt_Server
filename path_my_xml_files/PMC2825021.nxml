Inclusion criteria included newly diagnosed patients of scabies, of either gender, above 12 years of age, willing to participate, and give written informed consent. For inclusion, the patients had to satisfy at least three out of the five criteria viz. history of contact with a scabies patient, complaint of nocturnal itching, history of involvement of family members, presence of classical burrows on clinical examination, and presence of typical scabetic lesions like papules, nodules, or vesicles.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included pregnant or lactating women; women of child bearing age or planning for conception in near future; participants with abnormal liver and kidney functions, known thyroid disease, cardiac disorders, nervous system disorders, and psychiatric illnesses; and participants with history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or chronic infectious diseases.

Participants with any other associated skin disease, which could alter the picture of scabies; known/suspected immunocompromised individuals, having scabies with atypical presentations like crusted scabies or scabies incognito; participants who had taken any antiscabetic treatment in the preceding week; and noncompliant participants were excluded.

The demographic data of the participants like age, gender, occupation, education, and marital status were collected in the case record form (CRF) by the principle investigator (PI). At each visit the participant was examined by two doctors, a dermatologist and the PI. The 103 enrolled participants were allocated to three groups according to random allocation number generated through computer and provided with any one of the chosen three therapeutic interventions. Participants were advised not to use or mix any other treatment, including antipruritic or antihistaminic medicines. All participants were issued 25% benzyl benzoate (BB) lotion for topical application for the family members and close contacts, as per the standard treatment guidelines to check the reinfestation of the trial participants.

We formulated various regimens after permutations and combinations to gain 100% cure rate for the treatment of scabies patients in the tertiary care institution level. We formulated the regimens considering the cure rates of all the three medicines of this trial, which we got at the end of one- and two-week treatment. The hypothetical regimens were:</p><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>B<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub></p></list-item><list-item><p>B<sub>1</sub>I<sub>2</sub></p></list-item><list-item><p>I<sub>2</sub></p></list-item><list-item><p>P<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub></p></list-item><list-item><p>P<sub>1</sub>I<sub>2</sub></p></list-item><list-item><p>B<sub>1</sub>P<sub>1</sub>I<sub>2</sub></p></list-item></list></p><p>where subscript denotes the number of weeks for which the treatment is given. The alphabets denote the medicine given for that duration, for example, B<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub> means benzyl benzoate treatment given for two weeks and then uncured patients treated with ivermectin treatment for next two weeks.</p><p>Among all the regimens, ivermectin had the shortest duration of two weeks. All the regimens have two-week treatment with ivermectin at the end because in this trial we found ivermectin having 100% cure rate at the end of two weeks. None of the other two medicines offered such a cure rate.</p><p>Markov population model of decision analysis shows that B<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub> is the cheapest regimen, while I<sub>2</sub> gives the fastest results in half the duration with double the cost of B<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub>. The third one which falls in between is, B<sub>1</sub>I<sub>2</sub>, also a cost-effective regimen giving 100% cure in three weeks.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Cure rates</title><p>The 100% cure rate was obtained with oral ivermectin at the end of two weeks.

In addition, the study was done in infants; hence, we cannot compare our data with it.

Topical treatment may be poorly tolerated. Oral ivermectin is convenient, but the optimal dosing regimen remains uncertain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref>] A fact sheet for patients that is available from the Center for Drug Control, USA, recommends the use of 5% permethrin as standard therapy with crotamiton or oral ivermectin as alternatives.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref>]</p><p>Ivermectin is the future drug of choice for scabies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref>] In France ivermectin is licensed for human scabies since 2001.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT24">24</xref>] The treatment is easy, quick, safe, and well tolerated with maximal patient compliance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT24">24</xref>] Our findings show that BB required the least INR to treat one case of scabies, ivermectin was the most cost effective single medicine by virtue of its 100% efficacy, and permethrin gave the fastest symptomatic relief.</p><p>After these confounding findings, we tried various permutations and combinations of regimes to obtain optimum desirable results, which added to the novelty of this research. Safetywise, we found the three medicines equal as no ADR was reported with any of these. Thus, only the cost effectiveness played the decisive role in selection. On Markov tree for decision analysis,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref>] we found BB as the preferred medicine. Our finding of B<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub> as the most economical regimen recommends that one should start with BB treatment for scabies afflicted for first two weeks and then shift the uncured patients to oral ivermectin therapy for next two weeks.</p><p>In another study where oral ivermectin was comapred to topical 10% BB, it was found that absolute results favored the use of ivermectin, but the difference was not statistically significant.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT20">20</xref>] A recent trial proved that ivermectin significantly decreased post-treatment reinfestation as compared to permethrin, but the cause remained obscure.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT25">25</xref>] On the basis of such results many researchers, regulatory bodies, and WHO recommend ivermectin use for mass treatment of scabies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT26">26</xref>] Ivermectin cannot be the best drug in every hospital setting; in spite of showing promise in its efficacy and safety, as the local resistance pattern (which we did not find) and the affordability of patient population varies, and other cheaper alternatives still have an important role in marginalized economies. We agree that addition of ivermectin to the clinician's armamentarium should be welcomed for the treatment of scabies, as it is the most cost effective, safe medicine which gives relief in the shortest possible time.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT22">22</xref>]</p><p>Currently, permethrin is commonly recommended as the drug of choice. But in our study it did not get that coveted position. If we evaluate the best symptomatic treatment which can give moderate cure rate, permethrin is the answer. It is also equally safe. However, we did not find it in our recommendation because of the usual practice of giving additional antipruritic along with antiscabetics right at the very first visit for symptomatic benefit to all patients. Additionally, the result of highest cure rate with permethrin, which we found at the end of one week, did not sustain after two weeks.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-16"><title>Limitations</title><p>We admit that our study was biased due to nonblinding. Blinding was not possible because the formulations were different, that is, lotion, cream, and tablet. This study does have the inherent limitations in Markov population tree of decision analysis, like nonconsideration of lateral transfer of disease, reinfestation, and loss to the trial for meeting of any of the unusual endpoint.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-5" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In Government hospital like ours, we recommend that each patient of scabies should be first advised BB topically for two weeks. Nonresponders should then be advised oral ivermectin once a week for two weeks. In case of affording patients ivermectin once a week for two weeks currently offers quick, better, and safe results, restricting further morbidity and secondary transmission. The novel research design of clinical trial with economic analysis is easy and accurate method for doing a pragmatic trial, which can be replicated in other diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are indebted to the staff of Department of Skin and VD, headed by Dr. R.P Singh, Dr. Rathi, Dr. Riaz, Dr. Shyamal, Dr. Kirti, and Dr. Piyush.
