Patients with lower neutrophil counts following acute coronary syndromes tend to have a greater coronary flow reserve, which is a strong predictor of long-term cardiovascular health. But so far, no data are available regarding the impact of neutrophil inhibition on cardiovascular clinical or surrogate endpoints. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effects of AZD5069, a cysteine-X-cysteine chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) inhibitor, on coronary flow reserve and coronary structure and function in patients with coronary artery disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p id="Par2">Ninety subjects with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention will be included in this investigator-driven, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase IIa, single-centre study. Participants will be randomised to receive either AZD5069 (40&#x000a0;mg) administered orally twice daily or placebo for 24&#x000a0;weeks. Change in coronary flow reserve as determined by <sup>13</sup>N-ammonia positron emission tomography-computed tomography will be the primary outcome. Change in the inflammatory component of coronary plaque structure and the backward expansion wave, an invasive coronary physiological measure of diastolic function, will be assessed as secondary outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Cardiovascular surrogate parameters, such as coronary flow reserve, may provide insights into the potential mechanisms of the cardiovascular effects of CXCR2 inhibitors. Currently, ongoing trials do not specifically focus on neutrophil function as a target of intervention, and we therefore believe that our study will contribute to a better understanding of the role of neutrophil-mediated inflammation in coronary artery disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">EudraCT, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2016-000775-24/GB">2016-000775-24</ext-link>.

Being an inflammatory disease, atherosclerosis involves recruitment of leucocytes (predominantly neutrophils and monocytes) to sites of vascular injury. Typically, this is triggered by the accumulation of oxidised low-density lipoprotein (LDL) within the intima, which stimulates endothelial cells to express an atherosclerotic phenotype and leads to the adherence of leucocytes on their surface. These inflammatory cells transmigrate into the intima, where monocytes proliferate and differentiate into macrophages which take up oxidised LDL, forming foam cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">Atherosclerotic plaques exhibit two major phenotypes: (1) stable plaques, characterised by a thick fibrous cap separating a relatively small lipid core from the lumen, which are associated with a low risk of thrombotic complications; and (2) unstable plaques, characterised by a large lipid core covered by a thin fibrous cap prone to rupture and thrombus formation and associated with a higher risk of thrombotic complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Leucocytes&#x02014;in particular neutrophils and monocytes&#x02014;are involved both in atherogenesis and in plaque destabilisation, the latter especially so for neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Specifically, neutrophils are over-represented in the vasculature of patients with unstable atherosclerotic plaque [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and are associated with histologic features of plaque vulnerability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In addition to these established structural changes, a high-fat meal has been shown to elicit a mild neutrophilia along with endothelial dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In recent studies, colchicine, a known neutrophil chemotaxis inhibitor, has been shown to reduce vascular events in patients with coronary heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">The control of migration of neutrophils into coronary plaque is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve cysteine-X-cysteine chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This G protein-coupled receptor binds interleukin-8 (IL-8) with high affinity together with chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligands 1, 2, 3 and 5 (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3 and CXCL5, respectively). CXCR2 is expressed at a high level in neutrophils and plays a crucial role in mediating neutrophil migration, such that its inhibition greatly decreases neutrophil recruitment to sites of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In previous studies, AZD5069, a specific CXCR2 antagonist, was found to be potent in inhibiting calcium flux, chemotaxis and CD11b expression on human neutrophils in vitro in response to the CXCR2 ligands IL-8 and growth related oncogene-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In a rodent lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge model of pulmonary inflammation, AZD5069 reduced LPS-induced neutrophilia in a dose-dependent manner in both bronchial fluid and serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">Because neutrophil recruitment into atherosclerotic plaques plays a crucial role in plaque destabilisation and vascular inflammation, it is possible that CXCR2 inhibition will give rise to improved coronary endothelial function, which will be reflected in an improvement in total coronary flow reserve (CFR). CFR is an integrated measure of coronary artery status encompassing both macro- and microvascular function, and it has prognostic value over and above other markers of cardiovascular risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Therefore, improvement in CFR with CXCR2 inhibition would be expected to translate into prognostic benefits clinically in long-term follow-up.</p><p id="Par45">In addition to the effects on coronary flow dynamics, decreased neutrophil recruitment may also translate into a reduction in the high-risk morphologic features of coronary plaque (visualised by virtual histology intravascular ultrasound [VH-IVUS] as a diminution in size of the necrotic core of lesions). Additionally, there is evidence that neutrophil infiltration is involved in the pathophysiology of restenosis following coronary angioplasty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">Therefore, in the CXCR2 Inhibition &#x02013; a novel approach to treating CoronAry heart DiseAse (CICADA) study, we aim to perform a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to investigate the effect of the CXCR2 inhibitor AZD5069 on CFR and coronary plaque morphology. This will help to improve understanding of the cardiovascular effects of CXCR2 inhibition in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p id="Par47">This is a prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase IIa, single-centre study to evaluate the effect of the CXCR2 antagonist AZD5069 40&#x000a0;mg twice daily on cardiovascular surrogate measures in patients with CAD undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Screening blood tests for disorders which may exclude patients from the study will be drawn as indicated (e.g., serum hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, and HIV testing if prompted by history). Additionally, an aliquot of blood will be taken for measurement of circulating monocyte-platelet aggregates (MPAs, a highly sensitive and reproducible index of degree of platelet activation) by flow cytometry. In the case of women of childbearing potential, pregnancy will be excluded by performing a pregnancy test on a spot urine. Once eligibility has been confirmed, <sup>13</sup>N-ammonia PET-CT cardiac scans will be obtained at rest and during adenosine-induced hyperaemia to measure CFR.

At weeks 1, 12 and 24, patients will attend prior to their morning dose, and additional blood samples will be taken for the purpose of measuring plasma drug levels. At weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24, spot urine samples will be obtained from women of childbearing potential in order to exclude pregnancy; if they have a positive test result at any point, they will be immediately withdrawn from the study.
