Even though this high-prevalence comorbidity is associated with poorer posttreatment outcomes and greater utilization of costly treatment services, existing treatment trials often exclude patients with comorbid depressive and alcohol use disorders. Past research suggests that symptoms such as craving and anhedonia might be associated with alterations within the reward circuit, while emotion regulation deficits are related to disruptions within the default mode network. The aim of this clinical neuroimaging study is to transfer previous research about the reward circuit and default mode network underlying alcohol use disorder and depression to achieve a better understanding of neural signatures characterizing their comorbidity. In addition, the neurobiological results will be used to test whether two psychotherapeutic intervention programs, mindfulness-based training and behavioral activation training, are able to positively influence the identified pathomechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>By means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 60 comorbid alcohol dependent and depressed patients are compared to 30 patients with depression only, 30 patients with alcohol use disorder only and 30 healthy control participants. Comorbid patients are randomized to either receive a behavioral activation or mindfulness based training and asked to participate in a second fMRI session and 3&#x000a0;month follow-up assessment. Thereby, we plan to explore whether these brief group psychotherapeutic intervention programs are able to positively influence the identified neurobiological pathomechanisms. The primary outcomes are reward and default mode network activity and connectivity evoked by paradigms measuring different facets of reward and emotion processing. Secondary outcome measures include craving and depression scores, as well as relapse rates. Predictors include participants&#x02019; characteristics, personality traits and indicators of mental health.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The objective of the project is to identify common and/or distinct neural signatures underlying the comorbidity of alcohol dependence and depression. If the neurobiological understanding of alcohol addiction and depression is improved, this could potentially serve as a key predictor of treatment response to specific types of behavioral or mindfulness therapies hypothesized to alter reward and resting state systems.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>German Clinical Trial Register <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://drks-neu.uniklinik-freiburg.de/drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&#x00026;TRIAL_ID=DRKS00010249">DRKS00010249</ext-link>.

Despite the tremendous implications for prevention, treatment, and disease progression, the mechanisms underlying this comorbidity are not well understood. So far, studies with neuroimaging technologies, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), paired with behavioral measurement paradigms, have identified the brain&#x02019;s reward system, as well as resting state networks like the default mode network (DMN) to play critical roles in the understanding of both alcohol dependence and depression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Target neurobiological mechanisms of alcohol dependence and depression: Reward System</title><p>Increasing evidence in humans and animals suggest that depression and alcohol dependence are associated with major disruptions within the reward circuit, which normally serves to guide our attention towards and consumption of natural rewards.</p><p>In major depression, several studies consistently report that activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), as part of the ventral striatum (VS), is reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] reflecting a loss of reward function that drives symptoms such as anhedonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Moreover, a recent study showed that depressive symptoms correlated with dysfunction in reward anticipation regardless of diagnostic entity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, specifically frontostriatal regions during reward processing have been suggested as an important psychophysiological marker of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In line with this, depressed individuals showed reduced frontostriatal activity during reward anticipation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>In alcohol dependence, there is considerable evidence that the VS is activated by alcohol- associated cues and is thereby highly responsible for the incentive salience or &#x0201c;wanting&#x0201d; of goal objects such as alcohol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, whether the activation of the mesolimbic reward system results in alcohol consumption depends on the ability of higher-order structures to regulate incentive reward processing. Prevailing theories of addiction point to the involvement of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) not only through its engagement in executive functions, essential for goal-directed behavior (e.g. coding action-outcome conjunctions, salience attribution or self-control), but also through its monitoring of the mesolimbic reward system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Past research suggested that aberrant incentive salience to rewards is not solely restricted to alcohol-associated cues, but also to non-dug rewards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These studies showed that alcohol dependent patients show reduced activation of the VS during the anticipation of monetary gain. On the contrary, recent results from our own group provided evidence that alcohol dependence is characterized by an imbalance between increased ventral striatal activation and weakened prefrontal control, as characterized by decreased frontostriatal connectivity during the anticipation of monetary reward [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. These inconsistent findings might suggest the presence of different subgroups of alcohol dependent patients showing distinct forms of VS reward-regulating dysfunctions. Hence, it is hypothesized that alcohol dependent patients show diverse risk profiles characterizing distinct neural subgroups, which might be associated with comorbidities like depression.</p><p>In summary, in depression as well as in alcohol dependence, activity of the VS, as a pivotal node of the reward system, as well as frontostriatal connectivity have been shown to be altered during reward processing, emphasizing the essential importance of the reward system for both disorders.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Target neurobiological mechanisms of alcohol dependence and depression: Default mode network</title><p>Recent efforts to understand the pathophysiology of major depression have focused on resting-state brain networks. There has been increased emphasis lately on conceptualizing depression as a disorder of functional brain connectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] focusing on network interactions among cortical and subcortical regions. Among other identified neural networks, the default mode network (DMN) has received the most attention in the context of the clinical neuroscience of depression and has also sparked research interest in other psychiatric conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The DMN is active and synchronized when the brain is &#x0201c;at rest&#x0201d; (i.e. not engaged in externally imposed goal-directed activity) and is compromised of the posterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex and the angular gyri. The DMN has repeatedly been associated with rumination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], a recurrent, self-reflective and uncontrollable focus on depressed mood, which is thought to play a central aspect of the phenomenology of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and has also been found to be predictive for relapse and drinking status in alcohol dependent patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In a study from our own group, we could show that increased DMN connectivity in remitted depressed patients is associated with sadder mood, more rumination in daily life, as well as higher rumination and depression scores after six months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>A rather recent line of neuroimaging research has focused on resting state network properties in alcohol dependence. However, results are rather inconsistent, reporting either increased DMN connectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] which was found to be related to relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], mixed results of increased and reduced within DMN connectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] or reduced connectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] which was found to be correlated with poorer inhibitory control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. These heterogeneous results might implicate the existence of different subgroups or pathological states that modulates resting state connectivity in alcohol dependence. One modulating factor might be depression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Neurobiological informed treatment interventions for comorbidity: Psychotherapy</title><p>The ultimate goal of a better understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings is to develop preventive and more effective treatment strategies. Compared to antidepressant or anticraving medication, less research has examined functional neural responses after psychotherapy. Available data suggest that psychotherapy predicts metabolic changes in reward, cingulate and frontal cortices in alcohol dependence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge, only a few studies evaluated the effects of a specific psychotherapeutic intervention like the brief Behavioral Activation Treatment (BAT) for depression on brain activation. Dichter and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] report functional changes in reward associated structures including the dorsal striatum during reward anticipation after a BAT intervention but did not include a depressed control group. Looking on the DMN connectivity, Crowther and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] found that the response to BAT in depressed patients was predicted by pretreatment connectivity of the right insula with the right middle temporal gyrus and the left intraparietal sulcus. Another psychotherapeutic intervention with potential effects on resting state networks is mindfulness based therapy (MBT). MBT is a meditation practice that is recently receiving growing attention for its potential clinical applications in the context of alcohol dependence and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Neuroimaging studies showed that long-term meditators showed increased activation of prefrontal areas during meditation as compared with a rest condition or with matched control subjects na&#x000ef;ve to meditation practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p>In summary, dysfunctions in the reward circuit, as well as DMN have been identified as key domains underlying alcohol dependence and depression. We assume that these mechanisms also characterize the neurobiological underpinning of their comorbidity. Thereby, the identification of neural risk factors associated with their co-occurrence might help in understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to their onset and course. The overall goal of improving our understanding of neurobiological mechanisms is to improve treatment. If the neurobiological understanding of alcohol dependence and depression is improved, this could potentially serve as a key predictor of treatment response to specific types of behavioral (BAT) or mindfulness (e.g. MBT) therapies shown to alter reward and resting state systems.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Aim</title><p>The primary aim of this project is to identify neurobiological mechanisms underlying the psychopathology of comorbid alcohol dependence and depression. Subsequently, we plan to explore whether a brief psychotherapeutic intervention program is able to positively influence these pathomechanisms and if we can identify neurobiological signatures at baseline that predict the response to the particular intervention.

The group therapy protocols in both arms are manualized and supervised by an experienced psychotherapist to ensure protocol adherence. Patients who missed more than one session or experienced a severe relapse during the intervention period will be excluded from the protocol.

During the outcome phase, the participants see the reward of the latest trial (&#x0201c;2&#x020ac;&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;0&#x02033; or &#x0201c;Fast response!&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Too slow&#x0201d;) as well as their cumulative total gain at that point in time. In order to ensure that all participants are able to win some money and have comparable winnings, the threshold for a fast response is adaptively tailored for each trial to the individual response times of the subject. The inter-trial interval was randomly varied between 6 and 9&#x000a0;s. Each condition is presented 10 times in a pseudo-randomized trial order with no more than two equal conditions in succession. The total run length is 9&#x000a0;min. The monetary reward anticipation task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] has been shown to reliably and robustly activate the ventral striatum including the nucleus accumbens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Erotic incentive delay task</title><p>In order to measure different categories of reward processing, a variant of our own monetary reward task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] comprising erotic stimuli will be performed. Similar to the description above, participants have to respond to a cued probe to receive either erotic stimuli or matched social control stimuli. Again during the anticipation phase, distinct cues preceding the target inform the participants whether a rewarding erotic image will be shown or not. In previous studies it has been shown that striatal reward-associated brain activations can be reliably observed when erotic pictures are presented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Resting state/mood induction paradigm</title><p>The so called mood induction paradigm has been successfully implemented in different studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Here, we will use a modified version of the paradigm in order to directly test intervention associated activation and connectivity patterns. The paradigm consists of five blocks, each of which lasts 4.5&#x000a0;min: a resting state block, a sad mood induction block, one alcohol cue-reactivity block, one mindfulness-based block and one behavioral activation block. The mindfulness-based block and the behavioral activation block are counterbalanced.</p><p>During the resting state phase, participants are told to keep their eyes open and background pink noise is presented. During the sad mood induction phase, key words to remind participants of personal negative life events and background sad music (excerpt from Albinoni/Giazotto, Adagio in g-minor) are presented. Participants are asked to concentrate on the negative life events and empathize with the situation. During the alcohol cue-reactivity phase, participants are presented images of either beer or wine (depending on the participants preference) while they receive corresponding audio induction statements instructing them to imagine alcohol-associated situations. In the mindfulness- based phase, again, participants are presented images of beer or wine while this time they listen to mindfulness-based audio instructions. Correspondingly, in the behavioral activation training phase, participants are played audio instructions associated with imagining activities while viewing alcohol-associated pictures. In each phase, 9 alcohol-associated cues are presented for 15&#x000a0;s, while simultaneously 9 audio statements are played. After each picture a fixation cross is presented for also 15&#x000a0;s. After each block, participants are instructed to rate their mood by means of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), as well as their craving and self-control to abstain. For the T2 assessment, a different set of alcohol-associated pictures is presented.</p><p>As mentioned above, the mindfulness-based block and the behavioral activation block are counterbalanced. Thus, a second randomization list will ensure that at T1 the order of the experimental blocks will be equally distributed above all participants. Comorbid patients will receive the reverse order of their T1 assessment at the T2 fMRI scanning.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Anatomical image</title><p>In order to assess the individual brain morphology of each participant, high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical images (MPRAGE) will be collected.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>In this study, neural activation and connectivity in the reward system and default mode network are the primary outcome measures.

In order to reduce systematic motion-related artifacts known to be especially prevalent in patient-control studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], we use the ART toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nitrc.org/projects/artifact_detect">http://www.nitrc.org/projects/artifact_detect</ext-link>) to detect outlier volumes. The ART software identifies outliers if the normalized z-score of the global mean intensity of a volume exceed a specified threshold and/or if extensive composite movement from a preceding image occurs. Preprocessing will be conducted with the standard procedure analysis including slice time correction, realignment, co-registration, normalizing, smoothing.

The planned project is set-up to transfer previous research about the reward circuit and default mode network underlying alcohol dependence and depression to achieve a better understanding of neural signatures characterizing their comorbidity. By means of diverse experimental paradigms allowing a comprehensive characterization of reward and default mode network activity and connectivity, we are planning to assess distinct and common mechanisms underlying comorbid alcohol and depressed patients. In addition, the neurobiological results will be used to test whether a brief psychotherapeutic intervention program is able to positively influence the identified pathomechanisms. By gaining a better understanding of diverse phenotypes and their underlying neurobiological signatures, it might be possible to improve clinical outcomes by offering specific types of psychotherapy. Furthermore, we should find support for our hypotheses that established behavioral and mindfulness based intervention programs specifically alter pathological neurobiological functions. By this, we will be able to identify neurobiological markers of therapy efficiency. The prediction of psychotherapeutic success based on neurobiological signatures will help to guide the selection of specific therapeutic options. Ultimately, by means of identifying and validating the use of objective, biological indicators associated with core mechanisms of mental disorders, advances in personalized medicine may be achieved.</p><p>One limitation of the study might concern the lack of a proper control group for the investigation of the treatment effects (for example waiting control group). However, this study was not designed to evaluate treatment effects per se but rather to investigate the neurobiological correlates of established psychotherapeutic interventions. With this, we are specifically interested if the targeted interventions positively alter the pathophysiology of comorbid patients and whether this is restricted to patients with a specific neurobiological signature. A second challenge affects the recruitment of comorbid depressed and alcohol dependent patients. Not only for the fMRI measurement, but also for the feasibility of the group therapy patients abstinence is a prerequisite. In order to motivate comorbid patients to participate in the group therapy and to stay abstinent, we want to guarantee a fast study enrolment, as well as ensure a short latency between study enrolment and begin of group therapy. For that reason, we decided for a group randomization of 6 participants per block. With this, we might risk recruitment-dependent biases. However, due to many different recruitment strategies and sources, we hope to reduce this potential bias to a minimum.</p><p>To reach the project results is one of the key issues and core challenges to contribute to a better neurobiological understanding and treatment of comorbid depression and alcohol dependence. The project will help to improve knowledge on pathophysiology, identify targets for treatment development, detect subgroups for treatment selection, and facilitate the use of neurobiology findings in the understanding of comorbid alcohol dependence and depression.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AUD</term><def><p>Alcohol Use Disorder</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BAT</term><def><p>Behavioral Activation Training</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Co</term><def><p>Comorbid patients</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DMN</term><def><p>Default mode network</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>fMRI</term><def><p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HC</term><def><p>Healthy controls</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MBT</term><def><p>Minfulness based training</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MD</term><def><p>Major depression</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NAc</term><def><p>Nucleus Accumbens</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PFC</term><def><p>Prefrontal Cortex</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VS</term><def><p>Ventral Striatum</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We acknowledge financial support by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and Ruprecht-Karls-Universit&#x000e4;t Heidelberg within the funding programme Open Access Publishing.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>The study is funded by the German Research Foundation (grant number: Kl 576/16&#x02013;1, awarded to PK).
