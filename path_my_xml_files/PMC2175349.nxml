Advantages of photoligation over enzymatic ligation are that the former is very efficient, enzyme-free, independent of the buffer condition and effective in ligation in an extremely tight space where no enzymes can gain access. Due to these advantages, the template-directed photoligation can be variously applied not only to molecular biology research but also to DNA nanotechnology.</p><p>DNA tiles used in DNA nanotechnology are molecular tiles made of DNA. They have &#x02018;sticky ends&#x02019; on their edges. The sticky ends preferentially match the edges of other DNA tiles according to the Watson&#x02013;Crick base-pairing rule. In this manner, the arrays of DNA tiles keep growing throughout the crystallization process. One of the popular DNA tiles is a double-crossover (DX) tile that consists of two side-by-side double-stranded helices linked at two crossover junctions. The DX tiles have the ability to create two-dimensional (2D) periodic DNA arrays by self-assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>DNA self-assembly through specific base-pairing provides a method of DNA nanotechnology to construct nanostructures, as well as a method of DNA computation to solve complex problems. DNA has thus been recognized as a useful building material in the field of nanotechnology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9">7&#x02013;9</xref>). Recently, great progress has been made in DNA self-assembly such as periodic DNA arrays with nanometer-scale precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12 B13 B14">10&#x02013;14</xref>), patterned structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17 B18">15&#x02013;18</xref>), polyhedrons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21">19&#x02013;21</xref>), nano-mechanical devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22 B23 B24 B25 B26 B27 B28">22&#x02013;28</xref>) and computing systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29 B30 B31">29&#x02013;31</xref>). Applications of template-directed DNA photoligation to these self-assembled DNA nanostructures will considerably expand the potential of DNA nanotechnology, because the DNA structures are given new properties such as heat tolerance, rigidity and branched-strand structure by photoligation. Heat-resistant DNA structures can be used as components for constructing more complex structures/systems that are required for practical application in electronic engineering, material science, medicine and biology. In particular, the heat-resistant 2D DNA array has great potential for use as a scaffold in the construction of nano-devices made through stepwise binding of various molecules or nano-electronic components, because the stepwise binding requires repeated temperature rising and falling. Here, we describe heat-resistant 2D DNA arrays self-assembled from double-crossover AB-staggered (DXAB) tiles that were covalently connected by template-directed photoligation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Design of DXAB tile</title><p>The DXAB tile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>a) used in the construction of 2D DNA arrays by self-assembly consists of two parts, namely A and B, derived from the well-known DX tiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Part A and part B are held together by strand-ab, and their junction point has a certain degree of flexibility due to the nick. The complementary sticky-end pairs labeled as <italic>n</italic> and <italic>n</italic>&#x02032; (<italic>n</italic> = 1, 2, 3) can bind to each other, and the DXAB tiles can form the 2D arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>b). The sequences of sticky ends were designed to carry out the photoligation reactions. Both 5&#x02032;-ends of one double-helix of part A have UV-sensitive 5-carboxyvinyl-2&#x02032;-deoxyuridine (<sup>CV</sup>U) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), which can bind to the thymine or cytosine base at the neighboring 3&#x02032;-end by 366-nm UV-ray exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>c).

The gels were run at 20 mA on a BIO CRAFT BE-130 gel electrophoresis apparatus (Ever Seiko, Co., Japan) placed in a refrigerator controlled at 4&#x000b0;C. The temperature in a gel, which was affected by the balance between Joule heating caused by an electrophoresis current and heat dissipation into the surroundings, gave a condition that the hydrogen bonds between the sticky ends of unligated DXAB tiles were broken while the DNA tiles in themselves did not melt into their component strands.

The sticky ends of two types of DAE tiles, named A and B, were modified for photoligation. Each 5&#x02032;-end of four sticky ends of the A tile has <sup>CV</sup>U, and each 3&#x02032;-end of four sticky ends of the B tile has thymine or cytosine base (see Supplementary Data). These tiles were successfully self-assembled and formed into 2D DNA arrays. After UV exposure, however, the DNA arrays changed their shapes and no periodic structures were observed by AFM imaging. One of the reasons for the failure of the DAE tiles to form photoligated 2D DNA arrays may be excess conformational strains around photoligation sites. The DXAB tile was thus designed to effectively relieve the conformational strains by decreasing the number of photoligation sites. In the DXAB tile, the A and B DAE tiles were held together through a DNA strand to reduce the number of photoligation sites.</p><p>The self-assembly of the DXAB tiles were examined by gel electrophoresis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> shows a 5% polyacrylamide non-denaturing gel electrophoresis for three samples: non-UV-exposed self-assembled DXAB arrays with phosphorylation at the 5&#x02032;-ends of strand-a1, a4, b1, b3 and b4 (Lane L1), non-UV-exposed self-assembled DXAB arrays without phosphorylation (Lane L2) and UV-exposed self-assembled DXAB arrays with phosphorylation (Lane L3). The gel was run under a condition that the hydrogen bonds between the sticky ends of unligated DXAB tiles were broken while the DNA tiles in themselves did not melt into their component strands. The temperature in a gel meeting this condition was achieved by adjusting the balance between Joule heating caused by an electrophoresis current and heat dissipation into the surroundings at a lower temperature. In Lanes L1 and L2, the DXAB arrays were falling apart into individual tile, so that the single bands corresponding to the unligated DXAB tile appeared. The mobility of the bands was equal to that of the sticky-ends-free DXAB tile. In Lane L3, no band corresponding to the unligated DXAB tile appeared. No band corresponding to the dimer or trimer of the unligated DXAB tile appeared either. Instead, there was a band that did not migrate into the gel and accumulated in the well. This band may be the photoligated DNA arrays with the enlargement in molecular weight by UV exposure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>a also indicates the comparison of the DXAB tile with and without phosphorylation of the 5&#x02032;-ends of strand-a1, a4, b1, b3 and b4. The single prominent band corresponding to the unligated DXAB tile with phosphorylation (Lane L1) was slightly sharper than the one without phosphorylation (Lane L2).

The samples corresponding to those analyzed in Lanes L1 and L3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> were deposited for adsorption on atomically flat mica surfaces and then imaged in 1&#x000d7;TAE/Mg<sup>2+</sup> buffer. The DXAB arrays before photoligation had the periodic structure grown to a micro-scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>a). The average distance of the longitudinal AB period (the long axis period) was about 30 nm, which is in good agreement with the designed parameters. The average distance of the short axis period measured from section profiles was about 6 nm. The difference in elevation of the periodic corrugation was about 0.8 nm, which is shorter than the diameter of a hydrated DNA duplex (2 nm). This is because the tip cannot touch the mica surface through the narrow interspaces between DNA duplexes. No significant conformation changes occurred after UV-ray exposure in buffer solutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>c). The photoligated arrays show almost the same periodic structure with the long and short axis periods of about 30 and 6 nm, respectively. The self-assembled DXAB tiles using strand-a1, a4, b1, b3 and b4 without phosphorylation were also examined by atomic force microscopy.

Heating the DNA arrays in buffer solutions may cause stacking of the arrays, so that they were observed as brighter (thicker) areas in AFM images. However, the UV-exposed arrays were not broken after heating at 40&#x000b0;C and 45&#x000b0;C, and well-ordered periodic structure images were obtained. The long and short axis periods were about 30 and 6 nm, respectively, indicating that almost the same periodic structure as that of the arrays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>c was formed. After heating at 50&#x000b0;C the arrays were broken completely. The periodic arrays were not observed, and the section profile showed disordered structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>f).</p><p>The effect of photoligation on the heat tolerance of 2D DNA arrays was also examined by heating the DXAB arrays in adsorbed states on mica surfaces under buffer droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). This heat treatment will be closer to a heating method for practical use to bind or remove other molecules or particles. The heat treatment on the surface can also prevent the further stacking of the arrays due to adsorption to the mica surfaces. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>a&#x02013;c shows AFM images of non-UV-exposed samples after heating on the mica surface under buffer droplets at 40, 50, and 65&#x000b0;C for 5 min and cooling at room temperature for 3 min. After heating at 40&#x000b0;C, the non-UV-exposed arrays barely maintained their forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>a). They began to fall apart to about &#x0223c;100 nm scale pieces after heating at 50&#x000b0;C. The section profiles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>b show corrugations without clear periodicity. After heating at 65&#x000b0;C, the arrays were broken up completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>c). The most noticeable results we obtained are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>d&#x02013;f, indicating AFM images of UV-exposed samples after heating on mica surface under buffer droplets at 60, 65, and 70&#x000b0;C for 5 min and cooling at room temperature for 3 min. After heating at 60&#x000b0;C, the arrays were not broken; instead, the lattice appears to have been rearranged in a more orderly fashion than the one before heat treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>d). After heating at 65&#x000b0;C, the arrays maintained their forms, but they were not more ordered structures than the one in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>d.

After UV exposure, however, the arrays changed their shapes. This is probably because the arrays cannot relieve the conformational strains caused by photoligation. To apply photoligation to various types of DNA tiles, we may have to design DNA strand sequences that can relieve the conformational strains for each case by lowering the density of photoligation sites as well as by nicking appropriate sites. Further study is also required to determine the relation between photoligation and conformational changes in DNA arrays for widespread use.</p><p>In the present study, it remains unclear why the DXAB tiles using strand-a1, a4, b1, b3 and b4 without phosphorylation formed no 2D DNA arrays, while the DXAB tiles with phosphorylation formed 2D DNA arrays. The presence of the 5&#x02032;-phosphorylation increased the melting temperature of duplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Therefore, phosphorylation may enhance the formation of DXAB tiles with crucial structures to their self-assembly at an array-forming temperature. Phosphorylation may also cause slight conformational changes that make DXAB tiles flat enough to self-assemble into DNA arrays as large as a micro-meter scale. The fact that the single band corresponding to the unligated DXAB tile with phosphorylation was slightly sharper than the one without phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) may indicate a slight conformational difference between the tiles with and without phosphorylation.</p><p>Template-directed photoligation has already been shown to be useful for a tool for molecular biology research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4">1&#x02013;4</xref>). The present study demonstrates that the template-directed photoligation has also a huge potential for use in DNA nanotechnology. A combination of photoligation and programmable self-assembly can realize addressable heat-resistant 2D DNA arrays, which would be available as rewritable memories or scaffolding with the ability to address DNA data-strands, nano-electronic components and other molecules on a nanometer scale through repeating thermal changes. 3D complex structures can also be constructed by stepwise assembly of heat-resistant DNA components. Branched DNA strands created by photoligation will facilitate the construction of substantially small DNA tiles and more complex 3D DNA nanostructures that would be successfully used in the fields of biotechnology and nanotechnology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>We have demonstrated the availability of photoligation reactions on DNA nanostructures. The self-assembly of DXAB tiles including <sup>CV</sup>Us generates 2D periodic arrays, and after photoligation the arrays maintained their forms without breakup or remarkable conformation changes. The heat resistance of the arrays was improved by photoligation. A heat treatment assay on the mica surface showed that heat resistance improved at least 20&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p>
