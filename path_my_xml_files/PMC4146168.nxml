Patients&#x02019; symptoms were evaluated using a psychometric questionnaire, the Symptom Checklist-90, before intervention and after 2, 4, 6 and 10 weeks of treatment. The individual factor scores and the total score from the Symptom Checklist-90 reduced in all three groups as treatment progressed. In the acupuncture and electroacupuncture groups, the total score and the factor scores for obsessive-compulsive symptoms, depression, and anxiety were significantly lower than those in the drug group. There was no significant difference in the factor scores or total scores between the acupuncture and electroacupuncture groups. Some factor scores in the electroacupuncture group, such as somatization, depression, hostility, and phobic anxiety, were increased at 10 weeks compared with the respective score immediately after the course of electroacupuncture at 6 weeks. Our findings indicate that administration of Seroxat alone or in combination with acupuncture/electroacupuncture can produce a significant effect in patients with primary unipolar depression. Furthermore, acupuncture/electroacupuncture has a rapid onset of therapeutic effect and produces a noticeable improvement in obsessive-compulsive, depressive and anxiety symptoms.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>nerve regeneration</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>acupuncture and moxibustion</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>electroacupuncture</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Seroxat</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>primary unipolar depression</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Symptom Checklist-90</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>anxiety</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>NSFC grant</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>neural regeneration</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acupuncture is more effective than oral antidepressants in improving depressive symptoms[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Yeung et al.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] further confirmed the validity of acupuncture therapy, once or twice per week, in patients with poor outcomes after antidepressant medications. Meanwhile, acupuncture therapy produces fewer side effects than tricyclic antidepressants[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The systemic reviews and meta-analysis by Zhang et al.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] provide strong evidence for the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in the treatment of depression.</p><p>Despite the continued development of antidepressants and alternative/synergistic therapies, major depressive disorder has not been comprehensively recognized and treatment outcome is often insufficient[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. An epidemiological study addressing depression showed that poor recognition and treatment are largely linked to the lack of an accurate assessment tool and to patients&#x02019; economic situation[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Previous studies from our research group found that treatment efficacy in depression is mainly evaluated according to changes (rate of reduction) in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] are often applied to assess treatment efficacy. We adopted a different index, the Symptom Checklist-90, in an effort to provide consistent assessment criteria for primary depression.</p><p>The Symptom Checklist-90 is a relatively brief self-report psychometric instrument (questionnaire) for the evaluation of a broad range of psychological problems and symptoms of psychopathology. It is also used to measure the progress and outcome of psychiatric and psychological treatment, or for research purposes. This scale has a large capacity, lists abundant symptoms, and accurately reflects subjects&#x02019; subjective symptoms. It is designed to assess individual psychological feelings, emotion, thinking, behavior, living habits, interpersonal relationships, diet and sleep, and other symptoms[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although the Symptom Checklist-90 is well known, it is not the most widely used evaluation index.</p><p>In the present randomized controlled study, we compared the clinical efficacy of acupuncture/electroacupuncture combined with an antidepressant drug, with that of an antidepressant drug alone, using the Symptom Checklist-90.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Quantitative analysis of participants</title><p>One hundred and five patients with primary unipolar depression were randomly allocated to three groups: drug group (Seroxat), acupuncture group (Seroxat + acupuncture) and electroacupuncture group (Seroxat + acupuncture + electroacupuncture).

For example, anxiety (panic disorder, phobias, and generalized anxiety) is present in 40% of depressed patients[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and personality disorders in 33% (compulsive 16%, paranoid 10% and schizoid personality disorder 7%)[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Depression is also closely related to physical illness; severe and chronic physical illnesses often lead to depressive disorders, and some medications can cause symptoms of depression[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Furthermore, comorbid conditions may reduce the clinical efficacy of antidepressants[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore the above diseases should be taken into consideration when screening drugs and using an assessment scale.</p><p>The existing treatment options for major depressive disorder include medication, psychotherapy and social therapy. Medication is most commonly used and includes tricyclic antidepressants, tetracyclic antidepressants and new antidepressants such as selective serotonin and/or norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. In many countries, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the preferred antidepressant drug[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] because they are generally well tolerated, have a low discontinuation rate[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and are simple to administer, which reduces the risk of inadequate doses in depressed patients. We adopted the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine (Seroxat) as the basic medicationin the present study because it has a strong effect on severe depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic, generalized anxiety, social phobia and post-traumatic stress disorder; it also exhibits strong sedative effects[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>However, adverse effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors should be noted. With short-term treatment, gastrointestinal symptoms are commonly seen, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; in addition, restlessness, agitation, sleep disturbances, dizziness and headaches are also observed. Over the long term, patients may develop sexual dysfunction, such as loss of libido and anorgasmia[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, there remains a need for an alternative therapeutic strategy in the treatment of depression. The use of complementary or synergic therapy is increasing in Western medicine, but clinical studies investigating its effectiveness in anxiety and depression are lacking[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Acupuncture has been widely used in the clinical treatment of depressive disorders[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The pathogenesis of depression derives from the brain, but also involves the liver, heart, spleen, stomach and other organs. Acupuncture therapy aims to nourish the brain, replenish vitality, disperse liver stagnation, and smooth emotions[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

First, <italic>Du</italic> meridian[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] is responsible for regulating consciousness disease and organ lesions. <italic>Baihui</italic>[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] belongs to <italic>Du</italic> meridian and regulates mentality. <italic>Yintang</italic>[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] is responsible for nourishing the brain, replenishing vitality, and adjusting emotional disorder. <italic>Baihui</italic> and <italic>Yintang</italic> are collectively referred to as <italic>Baiyin</italic> point, which has been confirmed to be effective in the treatment of depression[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Second, hepatobiliary meridian can adjust brain function[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. <italic>Dazhui</italic> (DU14)[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] also belongs to Du meridian and can be applied in the treatment of encephalopathy. Third, the heart dominates blood circulation; acupuncture at the heart reorganizes the triple energizer, calms the nerves, and benefits the diaphragm. <italic>Neiguan</italic> (PC6)[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] is the collateral point in pericardium meridian; acupuncture at <italic>Neiguan</italic> can regulate vital energy and anchor the mind. Sanyinjiao (SP6)[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] is the intersection point of <italic>Zutaiyin</italic>, <italic>Zujueyin</italic> and <italic>Zushaoyin</italic>, which is responsible for nourishing <italic>Yin</italic>, invigorating the spleen, reinforcing the liver, tonifying the kidney, and harmonizing the blood. <italic>Sanyinjiao</italic> is an important point in the treatment of primary insomnia. Finally, <italic>Zusanli</italic> (ST36)[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], <italic>Shenmen</italic> (HT7)[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], <italic>Shuaigu</italic> (GB8)[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and <italic>Zhigou</italic> (SJ6)[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] are suggested for the treatment of anorexia, poor sleep, headaches or constipation. Therefore, the prescription acupoints of acupuncture/electroacupuncture treatment in the present study are <italic>Baihui</italic>, <italic>Yintang</italic>, <italic>Fengfu</italic>, <italic>Fengchi</italic> (bilateral), <italic>Dazhui</italic>, <italic>Neiguan</italic> (bilateral), and <italic>Sanyinjiao</italic> (bilateral); <italic>Zusanli</italic> is added for poor appetite or fatigue, <italic>Shenmen</italic> for poor sleep, <italic>Shuaigu</italic> for headache, and <italic>Zhigou</italic> for constipation.</p><p>Symptom Checklist-90 assessment results from the present study showed the following: (1) Both acupuncture/electroacupuncture and Seroxat have good therapeutic effects on primary unipolar depression. Symptom Checklist-90 total scores and factor scores were significantly decreased after treatment, indicating that the symptoms of depression were significantly improved. (2) Acupuncture/electroacupuncture combined with Seroxat had a rapid onset of therapeutic effect. Symptom Checklist-90 total scores after 2 weeks of acupuncture/electroacupuncture combined with Seroxat therapy were significantly lower than after Seroxat alone. (3) Acupuncture/electroacupuncture combined with Seroxat therapy significantly improved obsessive-compulsive symptoms and anxiety in patients with primary unipolar depression. Obsessive-compulsive and depressive symptoms were significantly improved after 2 weeks of acupuncture/electroacupuncture combined with Seroxat therapy, in comparison with Seroxat alone; the improvement of depression symptoms was observed at 2, 4 and 6 weeks after acupuncture and at 4 and 6 weeks after electroacupuncture. (4) Acupuncture plus Seroxat is equally effective as electroacupuncture plus Seroxat in the treatment of primary unipolar depression. (5) After discontinuation of acupuncture/electroacupuncture, some symptoms worsened in patients with primary unipolar depression. After 6 weeks of treatment, patients in three groups were given oral Seroxat alone for 4 weeks. The results at follow-up showed that Symptom Checklist-90 scores of somatization, depression, hostility and phobic anxiety in the electroacupuncture group, and phobic anxiety score in the drug group, were slightly increased compared with those at 6 weeks, but the difference was not statistically significant. (6) Acupuncture/electroacupuncture plus Seroxat is a safe treatment for primary unipolar depression, with few adverse effects.</p><p>The biological mechanisms underlying depression have been studied in the fields of genetics, neurobiology, endocrinology, electrophysiology and imaging[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], but remain incompletely elucidated. A number of studies confirm that structural changes of some brain areas (hippocampus, amygdala, cortex)[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and an imbalance of neurotransmitters (serotonin and noradrenaline)[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] are closely linked with the pathogenesis of depression. Effective antidepressant treatment also underlines the contribution of these brain areas and neurotransmitters to the disorder. For example, Vaidya et al.[<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] found that antidepressants enhance sprouting of axons and dendrites; Malberg et al.[<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] showed that some antidepressants promote the development of hippocampal neurons; Sairanen et al.[<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] highlighted that long-term antidepressants constructed a new neural network; and Brunello et al.[<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and Nutt et al.[<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] showed that classical antidepressants block serotonin or norepinephrine reuptake to varying degrees. Acupuncture/electroacupuncture regulates monoamine neurotransmitters in the prefrontal cortex, increasing serotonin and norepinephrine levels and regulating the balance of serotonin and its main metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid[<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Other actions include reducing damage to hippocampal neurons, upregulating hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor and cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element binding protein[<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], and decreasing serum concentrations of corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone[<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], thus producing antidepressant effects.</p><p>In summary, both oral administration of Seroxat alone and the combined therapy of acupuncture/electroacupuncture plus Seroxat are effective treatments of primary unipolar depression. However, compared with either treatment alone, combined therapy significantly improves overall symptoms, and especially obsessive-compulsive, depressive, and anxiety symptoms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-4"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Design</title><p>A randomized controlled clinical trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Time and setting</title><p>Experiments were performed from December 2008 to October 2010 at the Department of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, School of Chinese Traditional Medicine, Southern Medical University; Naturopathy Center, Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Southern Medical University; Department of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, Overseas Chinese Hospital; and the Department of Psychological and Behavioral Medicine, 999 Brain Hospital, China.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Subjects</title><p>Patients with primary unipolar depression were recruited by psychiatric physicians, and diagnoses were confirmed by attending physicians.</p><sec id="sec3-9"><title>Diagnostic criteria</title><p>Primary unipolar depression was diagnosed by the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10<sup>th</sup> Revision (ICD-10) for Mental and Behavioral Disorders, issued by the World Health Organization[<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], as follows:</p><p>
