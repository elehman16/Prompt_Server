The ability of individuals to understand and assess such claims can affect their decisions and health outcomes. Many people in both low- and high-income countries have inadequate aptitude to assess information about the effects of treatments. As part of the Informed Healthcare Choices project, we have prepared a series of podcast episodes to help improve people&#x02019;s ability to assess claims made about treatment effects. We will evaluate the effect of the Informed Healthcare Choices podcast on people&#x02019;s ability to assess claims made about the benefits and harms of treatments. Our study population will be parents of primary school children in schools with limited educational and financial resources in Uganda.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This will be a two-arm, parallel-group, individual-randomised trial. We will randomly allocate consenting participants who meet the inclusion criteria for the trial to either listen to nine episodes of the Informed Healthcare Choices podcast (intervention) or to listen to nine typical public service announcements about health issues (control). Each podcast includes a story about a treatment claim, a message about one key concept that we believe is important for people to be able to understand to assess treatment claims, an explanation of how that concept applies to the claim, and a second example illustrating the concept.</p><p>We designed the Claim Evaluation Tools to measure people&#x02019;s ability to apply key concepts related to assessing claims made about the effects of treatments and making informed health care choices. The Claim Evaluation Tools that we will use include multiple-choice questions addressing each of the nine concepts covered by the podcast. Using the Claim Evaluation Tools, we will measure two primary outcomes: (1) the proportion that &#x02018;pass&#x02019;, based on an absolute standard and (2) the average score.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>As far as we are aware this is the first randomised trial to assess the use of mass media to promote understanding of the key concepts needed to judge claims made about the effects of treatments.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Pan African Clinical Trials Registry, PACTR201606001676150.

Such ability is often limited in both low- and high-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Studies have revealed limited ability among patients, their caregivers and the public to assess the benefits and safety of treatments, and poor understanding of informed consent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], random allocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and drug approval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Some studies have found surprisingly low levels of knowledge of evidence-based medicine principles among health workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>A poor understanding of health care evidence, and inadequate ability to recognise claims made about the effects of health care, can increase or diminish the willingness of individuals to seek care or participate in research. It may raise expectations (sometimes falsely), may dash hopes, or may provoke alarm (sometimes unnecessarily). It can result in low uptake of effective interventions, and inappropriate utilisation of health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It can also create communication barriers between health workers and patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and increase the costs of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Despite these problems, there is only a handful of open-access tools to educate people to appraise information about the benefits and safety of treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], or tools that simplify the interpretation of research information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. To fill this gap, we have developed the Informed Healthcare Choices (IHC) resources which we are currently evaluating.</p><p>Improving access to reliable health information in the mass media &#x02013; such as the Internet, radio, TV and print media &#x02013; has the potential to affect individual health behaviours, health care utilisation, health care practices, and health policy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, there are substantial barriers that prevent journalists from improving the scientific quality of their reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and evaluations of health stories in the media have consistently found major shortcomings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Therefore, users, listeners, viewers, and readers must be able to appraise the trustworthiness of claims in the mass media about the effects of treatments.</p><p>We have identified 32 key concepts that are relevant to evidence-informed decision-making that people need to understand and apply to assess the trustworthiness of claims made about treatment effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. These concepts are grouped into six domains:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Recognising the need for fair comparisons of treatments</p></list-item><list-item><p>Judging whether a comparison of treatments is a fair comparison</p></list-item><list-item><p>Understanding the role of chance</p></list-item><list-item><p>Considering all the relevant fair comparisons</p></list-item><list-item><p>Understanding the results of fair comparisons of treatments</p></list-item><list-item><p>Judging whether fair comparisons of treatments are relevant</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>We have developed an educational podcast (a series of audio messages) to teach people how to apply nine of the 32 concepts in judging claims made about the effects of treatments. We settled for the nine concepts after a series of user-tests in which we identified some concepts as being more relevant than others for our target audience and easier than others for people to understand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. If resources allow, we plan to develop messages for other concepts, taking account of the lessons learned from this trial. The purpose of this randomised trial is, therefore, to evaluate the effects of this podcast on listeners&#x02019; abilities to assess claims made about the effectiveness and safety of treatments. We refer to this podcast as the Informed Healthcare Choices (IHC) podcast.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Primary objective</title><p>To evaluate the effects of the IHC podcast on the ability of parents of primary school children to assess claims made about the effects of treatments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Secondary objectives</title><p>

At these meetings we will provide parents with information about the podcast trial and seek their consent to participate.</p><p>Because parents who attend meetings might be different than those who do not, we will also make an effort to reach parents who will not have attended the meetings through phone calls, where possible.</p><p>Parents who accept to participate will be asked to sign a Consent Form (Additional files <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>) before randomisation to begin their participation in the study.</p><p>We will provide information about the trial to participants in a brochure designed as part of a package inviting parents to participate.

Each episode includes a short story with an example of a treatment claim, a simple explanation of a concept used to assess that claim, another example of a claim illustrating the same concept, and its corresponding explanation. In each story there is a question about the trustworthiness of a claim, which is resolved by applying the relevant key concept. All episodes have a conclusion with a take-home message emphasising the concept of evidence-informed, health decision-making. The examples used in the podcast are for claims made about treatments for health conditions, which are of interest to the target audience, such as malaria, diarrhoea, and HIV/AIDS. We have also included claims made about some common practices, such as contraception, which are of interest to our audience.</p><p>The topics and claims were identified from scanning recent mass media reports and interviewing parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. There are eight main episodes in the series covering the nine core concepts (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Each episode lasts about 5&#x000a0;min. One of the episodes (episode 1) covers two closely related key concepts (1.1 and 5.1 in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Two additional episodes introduce the podcast and summarise the key messages from the first eight episodes, respectively. The podcast also has a song (the&#x000a0;IHC theme song), sections of which play at the beginning, in the background and at the end of the episodes. The lyrics of the song were designed to reinforce the messages of the podcast and focus on being careful about claims, and the important questions to ask when we hear claims made about treatment effects. The final structure, content, presentation of the content in each episode, and the series as a whole was informed by an iterative user-centred process of development and user-testing described in another paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This process involved consultation with various stakeholders, including parents in our target audience, on the appropriate content to be included, and the presentation of this content in each episode, and in the podcast as a whole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The numbering in the first column in the table below relates to numbering of the key concepts in their respective domains, as presented by Austvoll-Dahlgren et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>The nine concepts<sup>a</sup> included in the IHC&#x000a0;podcast</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Concepts</th><th>Explanations</th><th>Implications</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.1 Treatments may be harmful</td><td>People often exaggerate the benefits of treatments and ignore or downplay potential harms. However, few effective treatments are 100% safe</td><td>Always consider the possibility that a treatment may have harmful effects</td></tr><tr><td>1.2 Personal experiences or anecdotes (stories) are an unreliable basis for assessing the effects of most treatments</td><td>People often believe that improvements in a health problem (e.g. recovery from a disease) were due to having received a treatment. Similarly, they might believe that an undesirable health outcome was due to having received a treatment. However, the fact that an individual got better after receiving a treatment does not mean that the treatment caused the improvement, or that others receiving the same treatment will also improve. The improvement (or undesirable health outcome) might have occurred even without treatment</td><td>Claims made about the effects of a treatment may be misleading if they are based on stories about how a treatment helped individual people, or if those stories attribute improvements to treatments that have not been assessed in systematic reviews of fair comparisons</td></tr><tr><td>1.3 A treatment outcome may be associated with a treatment, but not caused by the treatment</td><td>The fact that a treatment outcome (i.e. a potential benefit or harm) is associated with a treatment does not mean that the treatment caused the outcome. For example, people who seek and receive a treatment may be healthier and have better living conditions than those who do not seek and receive the treatment. Therefore, people receiving the treatment might appear to benefit from the treatment, but the difference in outcomes could be because of their being healthier and having better living conditions, rather than because of the treatment</td><td>Unless other reasons for an association between an outcome and a treatment have been ruled out by a fair comparison, do not assume that the outcome was caused by the treatment</td></tr><tr><td>1.4 Widely used treatments or treatments that have been used for a long time are not necessarily beneficial or safe</td><td>Treatments that have not been properly evaluated but are widely used or have been used for a long time are often assumed to work. Sometimes, however, they may be unsafe or of doubtful benefit</td><td>Do not assume that treatments are beneficial or safe simply because they are widely used or have been used for a long time, unless this has been shown in systematic reviews of fair comparisons of treatments</td></tr><tr><td>1.6 Opinions of experts or authorities do not alone provide a reliable basis for deciding on the benefits and harms of treatments</td><td>Physicians, researchers, patient organisations, and other authorities often disagree about the effects of treatments. This may be because their opinions are not always based on systematic reviews of fair comparisons of treatments</td><td>Do not rely on the opinions of experts or other authorities about the effects of treatments, unless they clearly base their opinions on the findings of systematic reviews of fair comparisons of treatments</td></tr><tr><td>2.1 Evaluating the effects of treatments requires appropriate comparisons</td><td>If a treatment is not compared to something else, it is not possible to know what would happen without the treatment, so it is difficult to attribute outcomes to the treatment</td><td>Always ask what the comparisons are when considering claims made about the effects of treatments. Claims that are not based on appropriate comparisons are not reliable</td></tr><tr><td>2.2 Apart from the treatments being compared, the comparison groups need to be similar (i.e. &#x02018;like needs to be compared with like&#x02019;)</td><td>If people in the treatment comparison groups differ in ways other than the treatments being compared, the apparent effects of the treatments might reflect those differences rather than actual treatment effects. Differences in the characteristics of the people in the comparison groups might result in estimates of treatment effects that appear either larger or smaller than they actually are. A method, such as allocating people to different treatments by assigning them random numbers (the equivalent of flipping a coin), is the best way to ensure that the groups being compared are similar in terms of both measured and unmeasured characteristics</td><td>Be cautious about relying on the results of nonrandomised treatment comparisons (for example, if the people being compared chose which treatment they received). Be particularly cautious when you cannot be confident that the characteristics of the comparison groups were similar. If people were not randomly allocated to treatment comparison groups, ask if there were important differences between the groups that might have resulted in the estimates of treatment effects appearing either larger or smaller than they actually are</td></tr><tr><td>4.1 The results of single comparisons of treatments can be misleading</td><td>A single comparison of treatments rarely provides conclusive evidence and results are often available from other comparisons of the same treatments. These other comparisons may have different results or may help to provide more reliable and precise estimates of the effects of treatments</td><td>The results of single comparisons of treatments can be misleading</td></tr><tr><td>5.1 Treatments usually have beneficial and harmful effects</td><td>Because treatments can have harmful effects as well as beneficial effects, decisions should be informed by the balance between the benefits and harms of treatments. Costs also need to be considered</td><td>Always consider the trade-offs between the potential benefits of treatments and the potential harms and costs of treatments</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>

</p><p>Participants in the control group will receive typical public service announcements about conditions of interest to our target audience, including malaria, HIV/AIDS, and diarrhoea, that have been included in the podcast. These audio messages are already being aired or have in the recent past been aired on radio. They are freely available and will be sourced from radio stations and media houses involved in disseminating information from the Ministry of Health.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Delivery of the interventions</title><p>The interventions will be delivered over a period of 7 to 10&#x000a0;weeks to participants in the communities where they live or work. At least 20 research assistants will help in the field recruitment, administration of the intervention, follow-up of participants in the community, and administration of the outcome assessment tool. Each research assistant will be allocated about 25 participants to follow up through the duration of the study. The research assistants will visit all their allocated participants every week, delivering the interventions on portable media players to an average of four participants per day. In this study setting this approach is currently the most practical and most reliable way of delivering the interventions for this trial.</p><p>One-time brief interventions have not been shown to improve knowledge of evidence-based medicine principles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] among health workers. So, as part of our intervention, at every visit we will play a recap of the previous episodes before playing the new episodes. Each participant will receive at least one supervised listening session of every episode, delivered by the research assistants over 7 to 10&#x000a0;weeks. In addition to the messages delivered by the research assistants, we will provide participants with the complete podcast on MP3 players, so that they can replay the episodes at their convenience. For the intervention group we will start with simpler concepts and gradually introduce more difficult concepts as the podcast series progresses, as summarised in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref> below. For the control group we will introduce episodes with health conditions that are similar to those being delivered in the intervention group at a defined period of time.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Outcome assessment</title><p>We will use a modified version of the Claim Evaluation Tools as the outcome measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The Claim Evaluation Tools consist of multiple-choice questions that assess an individual&#x02019;s ability to apply 32 concepts that people need to be able to understand and apply to assess the validity of treatment claims and to make informed health care choices. In addition, it includes questions that assess intended behaviours, self-efficacy, attitudes, and satisfaction. Development of the Claim Evaluation Tools has been based on extensive qualitative and quantitative feedback from methodological experts, health professionals, teachers, and members of the public. We have conducted psychometric testing and Rasch analysis with a diverse sample of 1000 people, including P.5 children exposed to pilot versions of the IHC primary school resources, children who were not exposed, adults with little or no exposure to the concepts, and adults who are familiar with the concepts. The evaluation tool was found to have high reliability (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha 0.81), and to be unidimensional (there was no evidence of subdimensions measuring different traits). Furthermore, there was weak or no dependence between items (no items were redundant). Results from the pilot revealed that parents in the intervention group performed slightly better compared with those in the control group. Many of the participants in the pilot preferred Luganda to English and had difficulty reading the questions in English.</p><p>After removing some questions, we modified the remaining questions that did not perform well according to the Rasch analysis, and revised and simplified the text where needed. The items were also translated into Luganda and adapted for audio administration. In the second psychometric testing, the Claim Evaluation Tools were administrated to a similar sample as described in the first psychometric test, but approximately half of the sample received the items as a written questionnaire in English and the other half received the Luganda audio versions. The results of this test suggested that the items administered in English performed very well according to the Rasch model, and with high reliability. Furthermore, the items were also less difficult than what was found in the first psychometric testing before the revisions. The results also suggested that the Luganda versions of items had evidence of under-discrimination and differential item functioning in seven out of 29 items. These items were revised to improve fit to the Rasch model.</p><p>Based on these two psychometric tests, a selection of 18 multiple-choice items addressing the nine concepts that the IHC podcast covers will be used (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Each key concept is evaluated by two items. We chose items with high reliability (fit to the Rasch model) and those with an appropriate difficulty level.</p><p>Parents in both arms of the trial will complete the questionnaires after they have listened to the podcast or public service announcements. Research assistants will deliver the questionnaires, ensuring that the parents have adequate time to answer the questions and ensure that the questionnaires have been completed fully.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Absolute standard (for passing scores)</title><p>We will use an absolute (criterion referenced) standard to set a passing score for the version of the Claim Evaluation Tools that we will use, i.e. based on how much the parents know and are able to apply. Parents will be counted as &#x02018;passing&#x02019; or &#x02018;failing&#x02019; depending on whether they meet a specified criterion. We used a combination of Nedelsky&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and Angoff&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] methods to determine the criterion, which is a cut-off for a passing score, as described in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>. In addition, we determined a second cut-off for a score that indicates mastery of the nine concepts, using the same methods, as described in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>. The criterion for passing is a minimum of 11 out of 18 questions answered correctly. The criterion for mastery is a minimum of 15 out of 18 questions answered correctly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Primary outcomes</title><p>

For participants who prefer listening to the Luganda version of the podcast but are unable to read Luganda we will use an interviewer-administered, standardised Luganda audio version of the evaluation tool. A research assistant will enter their responses to the audio evaluation tool on a paper questionnaire. To reduce any wrong entries and missing values the research assistants will check the questionnaires for completeness and for unclear responses immediately after completion. We will use Epidata version 3 software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] to enter all data from the paper questionnaires and convert them into an electronic dataset. To reduce errors during data entry we will double-enter all the data. All data entrants will be trained on the meaning of variables and how they should be entered into the database. Questions that remain unanswered will be scored as &#x02018;wrong&#x02019;. The lead investigator will double-check the entries.</p><p>All copies of Consent Forms will be kept separate from the completed questionnaires and baseline characteristics of the participants. Both signed Informed Consent Forms and completed questionnaires will be kept under lock and key. All electronic data will be password-protected and kept on a separate hard disc, which will be backed up every week to prevent data loss.

The smallest difference between the intervention and control groups that we want to be able to detect in the proportion of respondents with a passing score is 10 percentage points. Assuming that 10% of the control group will achieve a passing score (a conservative estimate, based on data from the pilot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], power of 0.90, a two-sided <italic>P</italic> value of 0.05, we estimate that 397 participants will be needed to be able to detect an improvement of 10% in the intervention group.

A basic understanding of these concepts is envisaged to improve critical assessment of things that people say about what effects treatments might have if, or when, we use them.</p><p>In this context the factors, which may facilitate or hinder people&#x02019;s understanding of information on assessing claims made about treatment effects, are largely unknown. Therefore, we plan to conduct a process evaluation to explore these and any other issues that might explain why the intervention worked or did not work as expected. We shall use this information to improve the design and administration of future interventions of this nature.</p><p>It is expected that recruitment of parents will be slow and follow-up may be difficult. From earlier pilots done in this context, very few parents attended parents&#x02019; meetings at schools and those who did arrived very late. The majority of our study participants are very likely to be women since mothers tend to be the ones who commonly attend parents&#x02019; meetings. It is not known how representative these will be of our intended study population. In our process evaluation we shall explore reasons why, if this turns out to be the case, and reasons for choosing not to participate among those who decline to consent.</p><sec id="Sec33"><title>Trial status</title><p>This study is currently recruiting participants.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec34"><title>Additional files</title><p>
