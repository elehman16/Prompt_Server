Other techniques that employ anchor placement require the drilling of an anchor toward the joint space, carrying with them a potential risk of plunging into the joint space if a drill stop is not used. This anchorless technique avoids drilling directly toward the ulnohumeral joint space, passing instead more tangential through the bone. Our analysis showed that using the current technique, we avoided joint space penetration in all cases. Another advantage of our technique is that it is less expensive in that it does not require costly suture anchors. This anchorless repair utilizes instrumentation that is readily available to the surgical team.</p><p>The transosseous bicruciate technique was described by van Riet et al<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2325967117708308" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> more than a decade ago, published at a time when there was little literature on triceps repair techniques. Although the technique is similar to ours in that it relies on bone tunnels exclusively, our addition of 2 additional tunnels&#x02014;a row placed more superficially (dorsal) and another row more deeply (volar)&#x02014;with double-crossing nonabsorbable suture provides more coverage of the triceps footprint. Furthermore, the traditional transosseous bicruciate technique did not fare well compared with suture anchor techniques in biomechanical cadaver studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2325967117708308" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Finally, our repair also theoretically decreases the likelihood of the long-term elbow irritation seen in other bone-tunnel repairs,<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2325967117708308" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> as we bury the knots under local muscle bellies.</p><p>One limitation of this study is that only 1 transducer was used to measure gapping across the repair site. It is therefore possible that either the lateral or medial aspect of the repair experienced more gapping than the other. This could be explored further in future studies. Another limitation of this study was that it compared only 1 alternative to the anchorless technique. Clark et al<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2325967117708308" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> demonstrated support for the superiority of the Paci knotless technique (used for comparison in our study) when matched against the transosseous bicruciate technique described by van Riet et al<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2325967117708308" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> with regard to cyclic displacement and load to failure. Although this comparison was not directly evaluated in the current study, deduction would infer that the anchorless technique is likely superior to the bicruciate transeosseus repair given that the difference in strength seen with the anchorless technique and the knotless technique was found to be insignificant in this study. Future experiments with more comparison groups would be helpful in determining how the anchorless double-row repair fares against techniques such as the suture anchor repair described in Bava et al<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2325967117708308" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> or the anatomic repair technique described in Yeh et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2325967117708308" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Despite a direct comparison, the load-to-failure values observed with the anchorless repair group in this study were comparable to the anatomic repair in the study performed by Yeh et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2325967117708308" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>
</p><p>A weakness of this study is that a less experienced surgeon performed the Paci repair in all specimens, which may have compromised the repair strength. However, displacement after cyclic loading and load to failure were comparable to the values obtained by Clark et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2325967117708308" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Footprint coverage was not measured in this study. Although the actual footprint coverage was not calculated, our drill holes were positioned in the same locations as those described by Paci et al,<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2325967117708308" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> so we would expect similar footprint coverage. This was observed to be the case during testing. Finally, this is a cadaver-based biomechanical study, and it is difficult to extrapolate the clinical significance. The effect of postoperative rehabilitation on the repair is a point of emphasis for future studies.</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the anchorless double-row triceps repair has comparable biomechanical properties to a previously described double-row triceps tendon repair. Consequently, this repair can be considered an acceptable alternative to a knotless anchor repair for triceps tendon ruptures. The cost savings of avoiding suture anchors, in addition to the equivalent biomechanical properties, may make it a preferable alternative to other described techniques.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors acknowledge Greg Gould for his assistance with the biomechanical portion of this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="fn1-2325967117708308"><p>One or more of the authors has declared the following potential conflict of interest or source of funding: This project was funded by the Wright State University Medical Student Research grant ($2500 award).
