However, effective management remains a challenge [<xref rid="pone.0125034.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125034.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Recently, there has been interest in the potential use of neurotrophic factors and anti-neurotrophic factors as an approach to pain modification. BG00010 (neublastin, artemin, enovin; Biogen Idec Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA) is a member of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family of ligands [<xref rid="pone.0125034.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In cell cultures, BG00010 has been found to activate downstream signaling through the rearranged-during-transfection (RET) receptor tyrosine kinase by binding to the GFR&#x003b1;3 co-receptor [<xref rid="pone.0125034.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], which is principally expressed within small-diameter dorsal root ganglion cells, with increased expression following axonal damage [<xref rid="pone.0125034.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In terms of function, BG00010 has been found to promote the survival of sensory neurons from the dorsal root ganglion, as well as other sensory, sympathetic, and central neurons [<xref rid="pone.0125034.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Subsequent studies have indicated that BG00010 may have a protective role in whole animals: it has been found to prevent histochemical changes to dorsal root ganglion cells, maintain C-fiber function, and restore sensory neuronal function following nerve injury in adult rats [<xref rid="pone.0125034.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125034.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>BG00010 has demonstrated efficacy in preclinical models of neuropathic pain. A 113-amino acid form of rat BG00010 derived from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> provided sustained improvements in neuropathic pain produced by ligation of the L5 (sciatic) and L6 spinal nerves in rats, without producing sensory or motor abnormalities [<xref rid="pone.0125034.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In a similar rat model produced by chronic constriction of the L5 nerve, time- and dose-dependent alleviation of neuropathic pain was achieved following intravenous (i.v.) administration of a human recombinant version of BG00010, derived from transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells [<xref rid="pone.0125034.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125034.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The mechanism of action remains unclear, but it is thought that BG00010 may selectively normalize the pathophysiological mechanisms that mediate pain, without impacting on sensory or motor functioning.</p><p>Here we report the first-in-human administration of BG00010 in subjects with unilateral sciatica in a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, Phase 1 dose-escalation study. The primary objective of the study was to determine the safety, tolerability, systemic pharmacokinetic behavior, and immunogenicity of single injections of BG00010 via i.v. (0.3&#x02013;800 &#x003bc;g/kg) or subcutaneous (s.c.; 50 &#x003bc;g/kg) administrations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as <xref rid="pone.0125034.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Checklist</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0125034.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Protocol</xref>.</p><sec id="sec008"><title>Study Design</title><p>This was a single-center, blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized Phase 1 sequential-cohort, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of BG00010 after i.v. or s.c. administration of a single dose in subjects with sciatica. The study was conducted at the Pain and Anaesthesia Research Clinic, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, Australia, and was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00961766). The study protocol and amendments were reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the hospital. The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the US Code of Federal Regulations, all relevant European Directives, and the International Conference on Harmonisation Guideline on Good Clinical Practice. All subjects gave written informed consent before trial participation.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Subjects</title><p>Eligible subjects were recruited from the community by advertisement. Screening to assess subject eligibility and seek informed consent took place within 21 days prior to the baseline visit. Subjects were aged 18 to 70 years and had a clinical diagnosis of unilateral sciatica with symptoms that had been present for at least 6 weeks before screening and a pain rating of &#x02265;40 mm on the 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) of the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) at screening and baseline. All participants were screened by an accredited pain physician, with the diagnosis made on the basis of a history of pain and a dermatomal distribution in the lower leg. Neuropathic components such as allodynia, paresthesia, sensory loss and areflexia/hyporeflexia in the dermatome and MRI/CT findings of nerve route impingement consistent with the dermatomal distribution of symptoms were regarded as confirmatory but were not required for inclusion into the study. Key exclusion criteria included a history of signs or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy other than symptoms of sciatica, and the presence of an active pain condition with intensity similar to or worse than that of sciatica. Concomitant treatment with analgesics and/or pain-modifying drugs was permitted if doses had been stabilized before the baseline visit. Doses of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants must have been stable for 4 weeks prior to baseline. Gabapentin and pregabalin doses must have been stable for at least 1 week prior to baseline.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Treatment</title><p>It was planned that four subjects would be assigned to each of eleven cohorts: BG00010 i.v. infusion 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, or 800 &#x003bc;g/kg, or BG00010 s.c. 50 &#x003bc;g/kg. The length of the i.v. infusions varied from 3 min at the lower doses to 12 min at the higher doses. The s.c. cohort was added as part of a protocol amendment to explore the feasibility of s.c. administration. If required, four additional subjects could be added to a cohort after data review by the Data Safety Review Committee. Within each i.v. and s.c. cohort, once eligibility had been confirmed by the investigator, subjects were formally enrolled, assigned a subject identification number and randomized 3:1 to receive BG00010 or placebo (saline). The computer-generated master randomization list was prepared before the start of the study and given to an unblinded pharmacist.</p><p>The doses and dosing schedule were based on previous non-clinical toxicology results and the projected efficacious human dose of BG00010; the s.c. dose level was restricted to 50 &#x003bc;g/kg due to formulation limitations. The sample size of this exploratory study was based on previous classical study designs and was not based on any study power considerations.</p><p>Only one subject received treatment on any study day. Subjects entered the inpatient unit within 72 h before administration of treatment (baseline, day -1). Subjects were monitored in the inpatient unit for at least 48 h following treatment (days 0, 1, and 2), and returned to the clinic for follow-up visits on days 3, 5, 7, 21, 28, and 56. The Data Safety Review Committee reviewed unblinded safety and pharmacokinetic data for each i.v. cohort before enrollment of the cohort at the next planned dose level. Enrollment for the s.c. cohort took place after completion of dosing of the i.v. cohorts. The overall duration of participation for each subject was approximately 11 weeks.</p><p>Subjects were blinded to treatment assignment throughout the study. The investigator was blinded to treatment assignment until the Data Safety Review Committee review of unblinded data, which occurred after day 28.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Safety and Pain Assessments</title><p>The primary safety and tolerability endpoints were: number and proportion of subjects with adverse events (AEs; coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version 14); clinical laboratory parameters and vital signs; pain as measured by a Likert numerical pain rating scale (assessed within 7 days of baseline, 30 min before treatment, and after treatment at 15 and 45 min, 1, 4, 6, 9, and 12 h, and days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 21, 28, and 56; day 56 assessments only included for subjects in BG00010 i.v. 100&#x02013;800 &#x003bc;g/kg or BG00010 s.c. 50 &#x003bc;g/kg cohorts); intra-epidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD; determined using two punch biopsies taken from the non-sciatica-affected leg between screening and baseline and at day 28, mean reductions from screening of &#x02265;2 standard deviations [SDs] flagged; not evaluated for subjects treated with BG00010 s.c. 50 &#x003bc;g/kg); and longitudinal assessment of five quantitative sensory test (QST) parameters: vibratory sensation, cool thermal, and heat pain thresholds, and cool thermal and heat pain tolerances (means of duplicate measurements recorded at screening, baseline, day 1, and day 28; mean reductions from baseline of &#x02265;2 SDs flagged; not evaluated for subjects treated with BG00010 s.c. 50 &#x003bc;g/kg).</p><p>A subject was considered to have a protocol-defined worsening of sensory function if two or more of the following events were present: (1) worsening of vibratory sensation from baseline on clinical neurological examination (from normal to reduced, from normal to absent at root, or from reduced to absent at root); (2) change from baseline in average QST of &#x02265;2 SDs for any of the five QST parameters; (3) reduction from baseline in IENFD of &#x02265;2 SDs.</p><p>Subjects also completed the VAS of the SF-MPQ at screening, baseline, days 28 and 56, and the end of study/premature study withdrawal visit (day 56 assessments only included for subjects in BG00010 i.v. 100&#x02013;800 &#x003bc;g/kg or BG00010 s.c. 50 &#x003bc;g/kg cohorts). The type of neuropathic pain assessed could include both back and leg pain. All subjects who were randomized and treated were included in these safety analyses.</p><p>IENFD, QST and SF-MPQ data were analyzed using Statistical Analysis Software, version 9.2.</p><p>In addition, incidences of BG00010-binding and-neutralizing antibodies were summarized for all subjects who were randomized, treated, and had post-dose immunogenicity data.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Assessments</title><p>Blood samples were collected from each subject in the i.v. cohorts at 30 min before treatment, and after treatment at 15 min and 30 min, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 48, 72, and 120 h. The same blood sampling schedule was used in the s.c. cohort, except that no sample was taken at 15 min after treatment.</p><p>Serum concentrations of BG00010 were measured using a chemiluminescent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The lower limit of quantitation for BG00010 was 0.100 ng/ml; serum concentrations below the limit of quantitation were set equal to 0 ng/ml. Pharmacokinetic analysis of BG00010 serum concentration versus time data was performed using the non-compartmental analysis function of WinNonlin Phoenix, version 6.1.</p><p>The following primary pharmacokinetic endpoints for the i.v. cohorts were analyzed: maximum observed serum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), area under the serum concentration&#x02014;time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC<sub>inf</sub>), terminal half-life (t<sub>&#x000bd;</sub>), total body clearance (Cl), and volume of distribution at steady state (V<sub>ss</sub>). For the s.c. cohort, time to C<sub>max</sub> (T<sub>max</sub>) was also assessed, as well as bioavailability. All subjects who were randomized, treated, and had measurable BG00010 serum concentrations from at least one collected sample were included in the pharmacokinetic analyses.</p><p>For pharmacodynamic analyses, blood, serum, and plasma samples were collected for laboratory assessments of substance P, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and norepinephrine at baseline and after treatment at 15 min, 1, 6, 24, and 72 h, and 28 days.

Most AEs were of mild&#x02014;moderate severity and not considered to be related to study treatment. In addition, no BG00010 neutralizing antibodies were detected and there were no clinically significant findings or trends in terms of clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs, IENFD, or QST. The study also provided initial insights into the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of BG00010.</p><p>BG00010 was most commonly associated with AEs of feeling hot, pruritus, headache, pruritus generalized, and rash. Of particular note, temperature perception AEs, pruritus AEs, and rash AEs appeared in variable combinations, timings, and durations, but were not regarded by the investigator as particularly troublesome in any subjects. Based on these preliminary findings, such AEs are not considered a likely barrier to treatment if BG00010 is found to be effective in reducing pain. However, it remains to be confirmed whether these AEs would continue with repeated administration.</p><p>IENFD monitoring and QST are not considered routine in trials of this type, but were specifically included in this study. Any changes identified with these assessments were not associated with functional effects and were not detected following drug washout. Accordingly, in the current study, IENFD monitoring and QST indicated that a single dose of BG00010 was not associated with any trends for negative effects on normal sensory function.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that, following i.v. administration, there is a rapid initial fall in BG00010 serum levels, followed by a slower, extended decline. This may indicate a substantial inter-compartmental distribution of BG00010. It should be noted that BG00010 pharmacokinetic parameters calculated from concentration&#x02014;time data at the lower doses may be confounded by the initial distribution kinetics and may not accurately represent true steady-state values. In particular, at i.v. doses below 200 &#x003bc;g/kg, t<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> increased as a function of dose due to the limited range of concentration&#x02014;time data at the lower dose levels, which tended to underestimate the true t<sub>&#x000bd;</sub>. Consequently, V<sub>ss</sub> could only be accurately determined at the higher dose levels, reaching 94.8 l/kg at a dose of 800 &#x003bc;g/kg. The relatively high V<sub>ss</sub> at doses of 200&#x02013;800 &#x003bc;g/kg may be due to a high affinity of BG00010 for heparin sulfate moieties in the vasculature.</p><p>The Cl of BG00010 following i.v. administration was high, ranging from 0.8 to 1.8 l/h/kg. While Cl and V<sub>ss</sub> appeared to be independent of body weight, and there were no clear differences in pharmacokinetic outcomes between male and female subjects, a detailed statistical analysis of covariates was not feasible given the small population size. BG00010 s.c. administration resulted in relatively rapid absorption but low BG00010 serum concentrations when compared with i.v. administration of the same dose.</p><p>Although some improvements in self-reported ratings of pain and changes in pharmacodynamic outcomes were observed in this single-dose study, there was no overall trend for benefit with BG00010. However, it is important to note that the study was not designed to evaluate efficacy as a primary outcome and that sensitivity in detecting the effects of BG00010 on pain may have been dampened by the administration of single doses only, the continuation of concomitant analgesic therapy, and the relatively small sample size at each dose level. Another artifact of the small sample sizes is the variation in baseline demographics and clinical characteristics between treatment groups; any subsequent pivotal efficacy studies would require much larger group sizes, and could employ techniques such as minimization, to address this issue.</p><p>This randomized Phase 1 study was the first-in-human study of BG00010, a first-in-class drug in development for the treatment of pain. It is of particular note that the study was performed in a population with sciatica rather than in healthy volunteers. Although the latter have the advantage of a lack of confounding effects from co-medication, they clearly cannot report any change in spontaneous pain, and the use of experimental pain models in such populations has been of limited utility [<xref rid="pone.0125034.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This study evaluated subjects with unilateral sciatica, as it is both relatively common and has some mechanistic similarity to the key preclinical studies of BG00010 in rodents with constriction of the sciatic nerve [<xref rid="pone.0125034.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125034.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125034.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125034.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It is important to note that sciatica is not a purely neuropathic disease and, despite typical radicular symptoms, patients do not necessarily demonstrate nerve root compression, indicating that the condition is probably of mixed neuropathic and nociceptive/inflammatory origin [<xref rid="pone.0125034.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, given that this was principally a safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic study, such heterogeneity of pathology was not considered to be a significant detractor.</p><p>In conclusion, when considered in conjunction with the findings of preclinical efficacy studies [<xref rid="pone.0125034.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125034.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profiles of BG00010 characterized in this study support the continued clinical development of this agent for the treatment of neuropathic pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0125034.s001"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0125034.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0125034.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Redacted study protocol.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0125034.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the staff of the Pain and Anaesthesia Research Clinic, University of Adelaide, Australia, for conducting the clinical phase of this study; John Pollard, MD, PhD, of the University of Sydney, Australia, and Justin McArthur, MBBS, MPH, FAAN, of Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, USA, for their roles as external independent members of the Data Safety Review Committee; Bernard Ravina, MD, and Douglas Kerr, MD, PhD, of Biogen Idec Inc., for their roles as Study Medical Directors; Leslie Williams, MD, of Biogen Idec Inc. for her role as Safety Medical Director; James Woodworth, PhD, of Biogen Idec Inc., for his role as study pharmacokineticist; Kimberly Umans, PhD, of Biogen Idec Inc., for her role as a study biostatistician; and Moore Arnold, PhD, of Biogen Idec Inc., and Kasia Sereda, formerly of Biogen Idec Inc., for their oversight of the study.
