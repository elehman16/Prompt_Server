Worldwide, <italic>Ctenocephalides felis</italic> is the most common flea species parasitizing dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], but in Greece <italic>C. canis</italic> was more prevalent among dogs admitted to a University Teaching Hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In addition, when dogs living in Greece on sheep and/or dairy goat farms were examined, the most common flea species found were <italic>C. canis</italic> and <italic>Pulex irritans</italic>, followed by <italic>C. felis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].

The dogs included in the study should not present any abnormalities on physical examination (including skin lesions indicative of flea allergic dermatitis, like hypotrichosis-alopecia, excoriations, hyperpigmentation and lichenification in the posterior part of their body), they lived on the same premises with at least one more dog eligible for the study, had been infested by at least 10 fleas at the beginning of the trial (day 0) and they should not have been treated with ectoparasiticides, including pyrethroid-impregnated collars, for a minimum time period that was determined based on each product label. Dogs younger than 12&#x000a0;weeks of age, with a body weight of less than 1.5&#x000a0;kg, with known hypersensitivity to permethrin, fipronil or any of the excipients of Effitix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, as well as pregnant or lactating females were excluded.</p><p>The dogs were randomly allocated into two groups (group A and group B). To this aim, all eligible dogs living on the same premises were considered as a block and per block randomization was done using a random number generator software, freely available on the internet (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.random.org/">http://www.random.org/</ext-link>). Group A dogs (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;15) were treated with the spot-on solution containing 54.5% permethrin and 6.1% fipronil (Effitix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), at the label dose (minimum dose: 60&#x000a0;mg/kg body weight permethrin plus 6.7&#x000a0;mg/kg body weight fipronil), every 4&#x000a0;weeks for three administrations (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, a spot-on solution containing 54.5% permethrin and 6.1% fipronil (Effitix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), when administered at the label dose three times at 4&#x000a0;week intervals, was effective for the treatment and prevention of flea infestation in dogs living with sheep. Indeed, at all time points after day 0, the percentage of dogs with zero flea counts (primary outcome measure) was significantly higher in treated compared to control dogs and flea counts (secondary outcome measure) were always higher in the latter. Furthermore, a significant decrease of flea counts on days 14, 28, 56 and 84 compared to day 0 was found in treated dogs, whereas no similar change was found in control dogs. Demonstration of efficacy under the conditions of this field trial may be of particular importance considering the high flea burden, as evidenced by the fact that all 30 screened dogs were eligible for the study (thus they were parasitized by at least 10 fleas) and by the median number of fleas per dog at time 0 (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;28.5). Also, and in accordance with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], the 54.5% permethrin and 6.1% fipronil spot-on solution was safe and no treatment-related side effects were witnessed.</p><p>The geometric mean-based percent efficacy (96.1&#x02013;97.8%) of the 54.5% permethrin and 6.1% fipronil combination was lower compared to the 99.5&#x02013;100% percent efficacy found in a previous laboratory study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This may be explained by the following differences, regarding flea species and sources, environmental conditions and experimental design, between the two studies: (i) in the present study, dogs were naturally infested, mainly by <italic>C. canis</italic> and secondarily by <italic>C. felis</italic>, whereas a laboratory strain of <italic>C. felis</italic> was used in the previous investigation. Therefore, it is possible that the laboratory strain may have been more susceptible to the active ingredients of Effitix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> compared to the field strains of fleas infesting dogs in the present study; (ii) in the previous study, dogs were housed indoors, under controlled environmental conditions and were not exposed to rain, whereas in the present study dogs lived mainly outdoors, under variable environmental conditions and may have repeated exposure to rain. Indeed, raining was recorded in the area during 21 (premise C), 27 (premises A and B) or 43 (premises D, E and F) out of the 84&#x000a0;days of the trial (data from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.meteo.noa.gr/index.html">http://www.meteo.noa.gr/index.html</ext-link>). The lack of influence of 2&#x02013;3 immersions in water during a 30&#x000a0;day period on the efficacy of another spot-on containing 50.48% permethrin and 6.76% fipronil (Frontline Tri-Act<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>/Frontect<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Merial) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] does not negate this possibility due to differences in the excipients and the concentration of active ingredients between the two products and due to the different frequency of hair coat wetting (6.7&#x02013;10% of the 30&#x000a0;days of the previous laboratory study <italic>vs</italic> up to 25&#x02013;51.2% of the 84&#x000a0;days of our field study, assuming that dogs were not sheltered during rain); (iii) in the laboratory study on the efficacy of Effitix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> against <italic>C. felis</italic>, treated and control dogs were kept separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] whereas close contact among them was unavoidable in the present study and it is possible that passive transfer of Effitix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> active ingredients from treated to control dogs may have occurred. However, the absence of a significant reduction in the flea counts of sham-treated dogs is not in favor of this explanation; (iv) in the laboratory study, flea counting was performed 24 or 48&#x000a0;h after experimental infestation, whereas in the present study dogs were constantly exposed to newly emerging fleas. Although the speed of the anti-flea action of Effitix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is not published, data on the 50.48% permethrin and 6.76% fipronil combination spot-on (Frontline Tri-Act<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>/Frontect<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Merial) show a geometric mean-based percent efficacy against <italic>C. canis</italic> at 1&#x02013;6&#x000a0;h post-infestation of 92&#x02013;100% at 14&#x000a0;days and of 55.7&#x02013;99.1% at 28&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and an arithmetic mean-based percent efficacy against <italic>C. felis</italic> at 1&#x02013;12&#x000a0;h post-infestation of 96.2&#x02013;100% at 14&#x000a0;days and of 73.4&#x02013;99.6% at 28&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, it is probable that the fleas we found on group A dogs on days 14, 28, 56 and 84 represented new infestations by fleas from the environment or from group B dogs.</p><p>The arithmetic mean-based efficacy (78.6&#x02013;92.9%) was numerically lower compared to the geometric mean-based efficacy (96.1&#x02013;97.8%) of the 54.5% permethrin and 6.1% fipronil combination throughout this study. The low arithmetic mean-based efficacy occurred mainly due to the relatively high flea counts of two group A dogs (both from premise B) that were parasitized by 9&#x02013;39 and by 2&#x02013;48 fleas, respectively, at all time points after day 0 (data not shown). Numerous factors may explain the low efficacy of Effitix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in these two dogs, including improper application of the product, individual differences in the diffusion of permethrin and fipronil across the skin and in their concentration in the epidermal and/or sebaceous gland lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], higher exposure to rain and increased exposure to newly emerging fleas before flea counting. Nevertheless, these results confirm that the geometric mean-based efficacy is a superior measure of central tendency compared to the arithmetic mean-based efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Approximately one year earlier (from April to July 2014), we had conducted a similarly-designed randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 3&#x000a0;month-duration, to examine the efficacy of spinosad (Comfortis<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Elanco Animal Health) for the treatment and prevention of flea infestation in dogs living with sheep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In that study, the geometric-mean based efficacy of spinosad ranged from 99.4 to 100%, the arithmetic-mean based efficacy ranged from 98.7 to 100% and the percentage of dogs with zero flea counts ranged from 80 to 100%. Besides differences in the efficacy between the two products, there are many other possible explanations for these results: (i) the two studies were conducted on different years and they did not include the same dogs or even the same premises; (ii) the flea species and their relative abundance were different. Although dogs were infested by the same two flea species on day 0, the relative abundance of <italic>C. canis</italic> was numerically lower in the present (88.6%) compared to the previous study. Also, <italic>P. irritans</italic> infestation was not witnessed in the present study whereas it was the predominant flea species on placebo-treated dogs from day 14 until the end (day 84) of the previous study; (iii) in the present study, flea combing was continued until no fleas could be recovered for the last 5&#x000a0;min whereas in the previous study it was continued until no fleas could be recovered for 1&#x000a0;min; (iv) due to its systemic mode of action, the efficacy of spinosad is not expected to be negatively influenced by environmental factors, such as exposure to rain; (v) passive transfer of spinosad from treated to control dogs is not expected to occur; and (vi) in the present study flea combing was performed in the premises whereas in the previous study dogs were separated from the sheep and removed from the heavily-infested area for at least 4&#x000a0;h before flea counting, thus minimizing the chances of newly-acquired flea infestations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>The relative abundance of <italic>C. canis</italic> over <italic>C. felis</italic> was inversed in group A dogs 14&#x000a0;days after the first application of the 54.5% permethrin and 6.1% fipronil spot-on solution and remained significantly lower on day 28 compared to day 0, to increase afterwards to pre-treatment levels. This may imply that Effitix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> can control <italic>C. canis</italic> infestations in a shorter time frame compared to <italic>C. felis</italic> and further studies are needed to prove or reject this hypothesis. Similarly, the relative abundance of <italic>C. canis</italic> over <italic>C. felis</italic>, although not inversed, was significantly lower on day 14 compared to day 0 in spinosad-treated dogs living with sheep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>In our previous investigation, <italic>P. irritans</italic> was the predominant flea species found on sheep at all time points and the predominant flea species found on placebo-treated dogs on days 14, 28, 56 and 84 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Its absence in the present study should be attributed to the widespread use of ectoparasiticides and/or insect repellents on sheep, during winter 2014&#x02013;2015, due to an outbreak bluetongue disease. Although sheep had not been treated for at least 6&#x000a0;months before enrollment (at least according to their owners), previous interventions may have reduced <italic>P. irritians</italic> populations to the degree that none of the sheep presented clinical signs of flea infestation and all of them had zero flea counts per flea counting area at the beginning and throughout the trial. Nevertheless, finding no fleas when combing the ventral trunk of the sheep for 2&#x000a0;min does not necessarily imply that sheep were free of fleas and finding no <italic>P. irritants</italic> on dogs does not preclude the possibility of its presence in low numbers, given that only 5 fleas from each dog were used for species identification.</p><p>Workers in dairy goat and sheep farms in Greece are frequently infested by fleas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. According to the &#x0201c;One Health&#x0201d; concept, an effective therapeutic and/or preventive regimen against flea infestation in farm animals and dogs living in close proximity to them should also control human infestation. In the present study, the prevalence of flea infestation of people in contact with the dogs remained constant (37.5%) throughout the trial which underlines that the control of human infestation probably necessitates treatment of all animal reservoirs and of infested premises. On the other hand, some people reported that the severity of their pruritus and the severity and/or extend of their flea-associated skin lesions were reduced and at the same time a non-significant (probably due to the low statistical power) reduction of pruritus assessed by the visual analogue scale was witnessed. Despite lack of a control group, these observations may imply that effective flea control, even in half of the dogs (and half of the sheep), may contribute to a reduction of flea-induced clinical signs of the people in contact with these dogs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p>When administered every 4&#x000a0;weeks for three times in dogs living with sheep, the efficacy of a 54.5% permethrin and 6.1% fipronil spot-on solution (Effitix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) for the treatment and prevention of infestations by <italic>C. canis</italic> and <italic>C. felis</italic> was&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;78.6% (arithmetic means) or&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;96.1% (geometric means).
