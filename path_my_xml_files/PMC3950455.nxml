The reasons being the non-availability of opioid analgesics, the dread of serious side-effects to opioids like respiratory depression to the mother and the neonate[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] in a poorly staffed labor room, the non-availability of a trained &#x0201c;Anesthesiologist&#x0201d; to manage epidural analgesia and economic constraints.

All women had at least 50% reduction in their pain and none of the newborn had respiratory depression.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted in a tertiary level hospital after approval of the Institutional Review Board and registered with the clinical trials registry of India (CTRI/2008/091/000264, 03-02-2009). All pregnant women who were in active labor, expected to have normal vaginal delivery, were eligible for the study. Women with cardiac disease, gestational hypertension, epilepsy, known psychiatric disorder, multifetal pregnancy, and cephalopelvic disproportion and those who had a previous caesarean section were excluded from the study. The study plan was explained to the parturient and a written consent was obtained from those who volunteered to participate.</p><p>The subjects were randomly assigned to receive either ketamine or 0.9% saline. Subjects in the &#x0201c;ketamine&#x0201d; group were administered ketamine in a loading dose of 0.2 mg/kg over 30 min followed-by an infusion at 0.2 mg/kg/h until the delivery of the baby. The rate of infusion was altered by 1 ml/h (2 mg/ml) to maintain pain relief during uterine contractions. Subjects in the &#x0201c;placebo&#x0201d; group were infused with saline in similar volume. 1 h after starting the infusion, if the relief of pain was inadequate, the obstetrician was allowed to prescribe intramuscular pethidine (meperidine) in a suitable dose for the patient, as per the standard of care.</p><p>Randomization and concealment of allotment &#x02014; a computer-generated randomization list was created prior to commencement of the study and was enclosed in serially numbered, sealed envelopes. When the consented patient entered active labor with regular uterine contractions and requested analgesia, the sealed envelope was opened and the study drug was loaded into a 50 ml syringe by an Anesthesiologist not involved with the study. The concentration of ketamine was 2 mg/ml and the placebo syringe contained normal saline.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Observations</title><p>The observations during the study were made by the primary investigator blinded to the randomization. The pain experienced by the parturient was recorded on a 10 point visual analog scale (VAS). This was recorded before and after the administration of the loading dose of the study drug and then every hour. Any reduction in VAS score was used to compare the two groups. Pain score less than or equal to five was accepted as &#x0201c;effective analgesia.&#x0201d;</p><p>The baseline heart rate, the blood pressure, the pain score, the sedation score and the fetal heart rate were recorded and then at regular intervals during the study period. The anticipated side-effects of ketamine like sedation, occurrence of hallucinations, sleep disturbances, vivid dreams and nystagmus were observed for.</p><p>In all the subjects, the fetus was continuously monitored using the external fetal monitor. The newborn was assessed by the Neonatologist, and the Apgar score at 1, 5, and 10 min were noted. The pH of the umbilical cord blood was measured. The mother and the newborn were observed for 48 h after delivery. All parturients were interviewed a couple of hours after the delivery and asked to comment on their perception of overall pain relief and satisfaction with the entire care. This was recorded on a 10 point scale and graded as good, fair, or poor.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Statistics and sample size calculation</title><p>Based on the pilot study, the sample size was calculated as 35 subjects in each arm, accepting a difference in pain score of 30% with an error of 5% and a &#x003af; error of 20%.

However, pethidine is not available in many of these centers because of &#x0201c;controlled-drug&#x0201d; regulations. Most obstetricians would avoid administration of pethidine to the parturient, once the cervix is fully dilated and effaced, for fear of neonatal depression at delivery. Therefore, most parturient go through 2<sup>nd</sup> stage of labor without any analgesia.</p><p>The primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy, safety and feasibility of using low-dose IV ketamine for labor analgesia. This study was conducted in a tertiary level hospital, where the standard of care again is intramuscular pethidine and epidural analgesia is reserved for those who need it for medical reasons, mainly due to socio-economic and logistic reasons such as availability of an anesthesiologist and monitoring.</p><p>Prior to this clinical trial, a pilot study was conducted on 30 consented parturient. A bolus dose of 0.1 mg/kg of ketamine was administered, followed by an infusion of 0.2 mg/kg/h. It was observed that the onset of effective analgesia was delayed for up to 3 h of starting the infusion of ketamine and the administration of the bolus dose caused most of women to have nystagmus and a sensation of light headedness. Therefore, it was decided to give a larger loading dose of 0.2 mg/kg, so as to achieve analgesia earlier, but slowly over 30 min, so as to minimize the side-effects.</p><p>In the current study, the pain score among the subjects in the &#x0201c;ketamine&#x0201d; group started to show a decreasing trend by 1 h of administration of the loading dose. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref> shows that the administration of ketamine provided analgesia in 60% of the parturients compared with 30% in the placebo group. A decreasing trend in pain score in the &#x0201c;ketamine&#x0201d; group is evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. However, as time progressed, the SDs also widened. This is because the subjects who delivered were excluded from the analysis and it did include the pain scores of those who were in the second stage of labor, when the score was highest.</p><p>Intramuscular pethidine, as rescue analgesic, was administered to four subjects in the &#x0201c;ketamine&#x0201d; group and seven in the &#x0201c;placebo&#x0201d; group. These patients had no pain relief in the first couple of hours after starting the infusion. Intramuscular pethidine is usually administered in early labor and not repeated before 4 h and is avoided if the delivery of the baby is anticipated in the next couple of hours. This could be the reason why rescue analgesia was not administered to many women in the placebo group, despite having significant pain.</p><p>Increasing the dose of ketamine may have provided better pain relief, but studies have shown that the use of a larger dose of ketamine (2 mg/kg) causes emergence phenomena.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Sarkar and Sahu[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] used a dose of 0.2-0.4 mg/kg as a bolus followed-by an infusion of 0.5-1 mg/min. This approximated to 1 mg/kg/h and they reported 14% of their study patients to have hallucinations. Ganla <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] used 0.5 mg/kg bolus, followed-by 0.25 mg/kg every 20-30 min and reported a high incidence of hallucinations (54%) thereby suggesting that emergence phenomena could be related to peak levels of ketamine. In the current study, none of the subjects complained of hallucinations and this could be due to the fact that the loading dose of ketamine was administered as an IV infusion and not as bolus. However, 17 women in the ketamine group complained of transient light headedness and 2 of them had nystagmus following the loading dose. This was similar to the observation after the pilot study where these symptoms were observed transiently after the bolus dose. Nine women in the placebo group also had light headedness following the infusion of the study medication. The incidence of nausea and vomiting were similar between the groups. The study intervention did not affect the neonatal outcome. The Apgar score, cord blood pH and the Neonatologist's assessment were within acceptable normal range.</p><p>Therefore, this study showed that IV, low-dose ketamine provides satisfactory pain relief during labor and delivery without affecting its progress or the neonatal well-being. A loading dose of ketamine is required to hasten the onset of effective analgesia, however, this need to be administered as a slow infusion so as to minimize the more distressing side-effects of ketamine, such as hallucinations and nystagmus. The transient side-effect of light headedness following the loading dose of ketamine was significant, but was tolerated by the parturient.</p><p>Ultimately, the overall perception of the experience of labor and delivery, albeit painful, is biased by the presence of a healthy baby in the mother's arms. However, the difference in patient satisfaction seen between the two groups could possibly be that low-dose ketamine provides analgesia yet does not dissociate the mother from the experience of childbirth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Therefore, ketamine in a loading dose of 0.2 mg/kg delivered over 30 min followed-by an infusion at 0.2 mg/kg/h could provide acceptable analgesia during labor and delivery. Further studies could look at fine tuning the dose especially during the second stage of labor.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shnider</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Levinson</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>RD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Anesthesia for obstetrics</article-title><source>Anesthesia</source><year>1994</year><edition>4th ed</edition><publisher-loc>New York</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Churchill Livingstone</publisher-name><fpage>2031</fpage><lpage>76</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anim-Somuah</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Smyth</surname><given-names>RMD</given-names></name><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Epidural versus non-epidural or no analgesia in labour</article-title><source>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</source><year>2011</year><issue>12</issue><comment>Art No: CD000331 DOI: 10.1002/14651858CD000331.pub3</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>PF</given-names></name><name><surname>Way</surname><given-names>WL</given-names></name><name><surname>Trevor</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Ketamine &#x02013;
