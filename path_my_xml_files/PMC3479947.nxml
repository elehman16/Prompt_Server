However, these results do not reflect weight changes that occurred during placebo-controlled and extension studies that led into the open-label study. In patients receiving &#x02265;3 years of treatment in the open-label study (in addition to 3&#x02013;15 months of prior study treatment), mean decreases from lead-in study baseline were found at 12 and 24 months (&#x02212;1.16 kg and &#x02212;0.76 kg, respectively), with mean changes drifting back to baseline at 30 months (&#x02212;0.19 kg) and the final study visit at 36&#x02013;38 months (+0.11 kg).</p><p>Nausea was the most commonly reported adverse event with milnacipran (studies 1 to 3: placebo, 20.6%; 100 mg/day, 35.5%; 200 mg/day, 40.1%).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ijgm-5-879">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ijgm-5-879">21</xref> In the present analysis, nausea rates were significantly lower in patients who lost weight than in patients who did not lose weight, suggesting that nausea did not contribute to weight loss.</p><p>Because patients who respond to milnacipran may be more likely to continue treatment, analyses were also conducted in treatment responders and nonresponders. In placebo-controlled studies, the proportion of treatment responders (patients with simultaneous improvements in pain and global status) at 3 and 6 months was significantly higher with milnacipran (39% to 46%) than placebo (25% to 28%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ijgm-5-879">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ijgm-5-879">21</xref> In the present analysis, significant mean weight loss was found with milnacipran versus placebo regardless of responder status (3 and 6 months, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). These preliminary results, along with the lack of correlation found between changes in weight and pain in patients receiving &#x02265;3 years of open-label milnacipran treatment, suggest that weight loss with milnacipran was not completely dependent on improvements in pain or other fibromyalgia symptoms. However, weight loss was approximately 45%&#x02013;120% greater in treatment responders than in nonresponders. Additional correlations between weight, pain, and other potentially relevant factors, such as physical functioning, would be needed to characterize further the relationship between milnacipran efficacy and weight change.</p><p>Drug-induced weight gain is just one factor to consider when developing a treatment plan, but it may be an important issue for patients who are concerned about weight.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijgm-5-879">15</xref> Additionally, clinicians should consider a multidisciplinary treatment plan in patients with fibromyalgia who are overweight or obese.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ijgm-5-879">30</xref> A plan that includes medication to manage pain and other disruptive symptoms along with mild-to-moderate aerobic exercise<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ijgm-5-879">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ijgm-5-879">32</xref> and cognitive behavioral therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ijgm-5-879">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-ijgm-5-879">34</xref> may benefit many patients with fibromyalgia. Although the evidence in patients with fibromyalgia is limited, dietary programs may also benefit some patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-ijgm-5-879">35</xref></p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>This was a post hoc analysis and the studies included were not prospectively designed to measure weight change as a primary outcome. The analyses were based on a clinical study population, which primarily included women (about 95%) with moderate or severe baseline pain. Thus, any interpretation regarding gender differences or disease severity would be limited. In addition, no analyses were conducted in patients with comorbidities that may complicate weight problems, such as diabetes or hypertension, nor were any analyses adjusted for familial or environmental factors that could affect weight.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijgm-5-879">12</xref> Moreover, patients with major depressive disorder were excluded from the studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ijgm-5-879">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ijgm-5-879">21</xref> Thus, no conclusions about the effects of milnacipran in these subsets of patients can be drawn. Conclusions regarding the effects of nausea on weight may also be limited given that the analysis did not differentiate between transient and persistent nausea. Although the majority of nausea episodes (&#x0003e;60%) observed in the placebo-controlled studies were resolved within 3 weeks of onset,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ijgm-5-879">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-ijgm-5-879">36</xref> some patients with ongoing nausea may have altered their eating habits which in turn may have affected their weight. Finally, patients with fibromyalgia often require multiple medications and the present analysis did not explore the effects of milnacipran on body weight in patients taking concomitant medications that may contribute to weight changes. Although centrally acting medications used to treat fibromyalgia symptoms were prohibited in the placebo-controlled and extension studies, some drugs associated with weight change were allowed.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The majority (77%) of patients with fibromyalgia in placebo-controlled milnacipran trials were classified as overweight or obese (BMI &#x02265; 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). In light of these potential weight problems, the effects of medication on body weight may need to be considered when managing these patients. Overall, mean weight changes observed in placebo-controlled and extension studies suggested that treatment with milnacipran for &#x02265;12 months was not associated with weight gain. In addition, no mean weight gain was found in patients receiving up to 30 months of milnacipran treatment in a long-term, open-label study, with mean weight drifting to above baseline values in patients receiving &#x02265;3 years of treatment. Analyses of data at 3 and 6 months indicate that the effects of milnacipran on body weight are observed regardless of treatment response, although weight loss may be greater in treatment responders. Patients with weight problems may benefit from a multidisciplinary treatment approach.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Yimin Ma at Forest Research Institute Inc, for conducting some of the statistical analyses.
