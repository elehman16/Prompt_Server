Subjects will be excluded if any of the aforementioned criteria are not met including the following: (1) mental and physical challenges that make it difficult to use the touch-based computer program, (2) unavailability for telephone follow-up and (3) involvement in other clinical trials or protocols related to MetS.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Study groups</title><p>The study participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention (computer-based MetS Program CBMP) or control (Printed Educational Material, PEM) groups. The randomisation will be done at the time the participant comes to the outpatient clinics in these diverse settings. A computer-generated system that will follow 1:1 allocation at each site including urban, rural and slum areas for allocating the individuals either in the intervention or the control group will be utilised. Both the groups will undergo screening, learning and evaluation assessments at the time of the visit. Apart from that, study participants in both the groups need to come for follow-up visits 30, 60 and 90&#x02005;days from the first visit for ongoing education. The outcome assessors and data analysts will be blinded after assignment to interventions as the data analysis sheet will not have the identifier that will indicate which individual was in the intervention or the control group.</p><p>A detailed outline of the intervention is described below.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Patient education and motivation tool</title><p>We will modify and adapt the existing Patient Education and Motivation Tool (PEMT), a touch screen, computer-based interactive health education program. PEMT is designed based on a variety of cognitive-behavioural theories<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> and aimed at delivering health education to prevent and manage MetS among diverse users. PEMT facilitates health information and messages to be adapted depending on the psychosocial elements including attitude, self-efficacy, expectations, personal norms and social influence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15 R16 R17">15&#x02013;17</xref> The multimedia information presented will be in multilingual format (English AND Oriya, an Indian language). PEMT has three key components including:</p><sec id="s2e1"><title>Screening component</title><p>This will include age (years), gender, years of education, income, employment and insurance status. Information on MetS knowledge and attitudes and practice, quality of life and satisfaction to medical care will also be assessed.</p></sec><sec id="s2e2"><title>Learning component</title><p>Using self-report responses of the individuals in the intervention group (CBMP), the decision logic and algorithm will process the information and deliver tailored MetS educational messages. For example, if an individual has a family history of diabetes and no other risk factors, the individual will be provided feedback on the preventive measures that he/she needs to have to maintain himself in a healthy condition. If a study participant indicates that he/she does not perform any physical activity, then the system would recommend to them the exercise suggestions and provide tailored health information about the short-term and long-term benefits of physical activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2e3"><title>Evaluation component</title><p>Change in MetS knowledge, attitudes and practice (KAP), quality of life, adherence to treatment and satisfaction to medical care will be assessed in study participants in both the groups. Appropriate feedback will be given in the form of reinforced educational messages and encouragement and motivational prompts for those using the touch screen computer-based program.</p></sec><sec id="s2e4"><title>PEMT interaction metrics</title><p>Another important aspect of PEMT is that it captures an individual's interactions with this interactive educational support program and generates usage metrics.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> Usage is clearly an important characteristic in assessing the popularity of a computer-mediated health education programme. The logs provide data on what people have done, which gives logs their strength and differentiates them from other data capture methods like interviews and questionnaires. Earlier studies have shown that PEMT has improved asthma, influenza and breast-feeding KAP among different users in diverse settings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Procedures for implementing intervention (CBMP)</title><p>The touch screen computer-based MetS educational support program will be developed by modifying existing PEMT as described earlier. This modification will include several stages.
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><italic>MetS content finalisation, decision rules and PEMT modification design:</italic> We will have in-depth interviews to finalise the content, logic and functionality of the computer-based program. Forty individuals from urban, rural and slum settings will be enrolled, and the feedback acquired from them will help us to identify the topics that the study participants will perceive as useful to manage MetS. Both qualitative and quantitative data will be gathered using a series of open-ended and close-ended questions to identify the educational modules relevant to the user. The educational content developed will then be finalised in two languages including English and Oriya (a local Indian dialect). The educational material will have related audio and images to account for the health literacy levels of the individuals.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>BMP pretesting using heuristic evaluation:</italic> The prototype designed will undergo a series of usability assessments throughout the development process. Heuristic evaluations, which are often referred to as &#x02018;expert reviews&#x02019; or &#x02018;usability audits&#x02019;, are an efficient way of assessing the usability of information technologies and are particularly useful early in the development process when it is least expensive to make changes. Nielsen&#x02019;s heuristics are probably the most used usability heuristics for user interface design. The 10-item assessment is given a rating on a scale of 0&#x02013;4, where 0 means no usability problem at all, 1 means a cosmetic problem, 2 means a minor problem, 3 means a major problem and 4 means a catastrophic problem.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Usability assessments using user testing:</italic> We will identify representative tasks including both critical and high-frequency activities. We will recruit 10 study participants each at the different study sites to interact with the system. The results of the user testing will help incorporate the recommended changes in the design of CBMP. A system usability scale is a 10-item questionnaire with five response options ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Study enrolment and data collection procedures:</italic> Baseline and follow-up data will be collected at months 1, 2, 6, 9 and 12 resulting in five data collection time periods overall. Baseline evaluation will be performed during the first outpatient visit at the hospital sites in urban, rural and slum settings (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012002163TB1">table 1</xref>).

Covariates will be added to the model to adjust for confounders that differ significantly between the two groups at the 0.20 level of significance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012002163TB2">table 2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2012002163TB2" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Analysis plan</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variables assessment</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variable types</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Data analysis</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">In-depth interviews</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Qualitative</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Content analysis using NVivo software</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sociodemographics</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Continuous and categorical</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">T and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Health behaviour</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Continuous and categorical</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">T and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Anthropometry</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Continuous</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">T test</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">MetS KAB</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Continuous</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">General linear mixed model</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Disease assessment</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Continuous</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">General linear mixed model</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Laboratory assessment</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Categorical</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Outcomes</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Quality of life</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Continuous and categorical</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">T &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Satisfaction to medical care</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Categorical</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Healthcare utilisation</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Continuous</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">General linear mixed model</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>MetS KAB, metabolic syndrome knowledge, attitudes and behaviour.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2l3"><title>Project timelines and milestones</title><p>The research plan entails the performance of the tasks in <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012002163TB3">table 3</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2012002163TB3" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Project timeline</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tasks involved</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Timeline</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Research team meet</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Month 1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">In-depth interviews</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Months 1 and 2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">MetS educational content developed</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Month 2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Modify educational content and existing PEMT</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Months 3 and 4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Computer program redesign using heuristic principles</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Months 3 and 4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">User testing</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Month 5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">System deployment</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Month 6</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Subject recruitment</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Months 6&#x02013;9</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Data collection</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Months 6&#x02013;12</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Analysis and results</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Month 6, 9, 12</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dissemination</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Month 6, 9, 12</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>MetS, metabolic syndrome; PEMT, patient education and motivation tool.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>To our knowledge, the study is the first of its kind that aims to develop a technology-mediated multifactorial intervention to prevent and manage MetS in an Indian setting. The proposed research study will help us examine variables that influence the prevalence of MetS among individuals living in urban, rural and slum settings. Further, the feedback received through the in-depth interviews will help to design and develop a user-centred informatics platform that can deliver multimedia-driven health educational modules tailored to meet the needs of the diverse users in varied settings. The proposed study will also help us assess the usefulness of technology to disseminate health education among diverse users. The study will also help us identify challenges in the implementation of technology-mediated health interventions in different Indian settings.</p><p>Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and national and international conference presentations. The study findings associated with every specific aim will be disseminated on time to various stakeholders involving the funding agency, Indian Council of Medical Research, Government of India, Divisions of Non-communicable Diseases and Rural Health, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. Findings of the studies will also be disseminated to the local community health leaders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e201" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-002163.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> AJconceived the idea of the study and was responsible for the design of the study.
