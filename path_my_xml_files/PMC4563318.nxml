computer-based cognitive rehabilitation program (CBCR) on the cognitive function and
visual perception ability of patients with acute stroke. [Subjects] The subjects were 30
patients with acute stroke. [Methods] The subjects were randomly assigned to either the
experimental group (EG) or the control group (CG). The EG subjects received CBCR with the
CoTras program. The CG subjects received conventional cognitive rehabilitation. All
subjects participated in a standard rehabilitation program according to a daily inpatient
treatment schedule. In addition to standard rehabilitation, the subjects received 20
sessions (5 days a week for 4 weeks) of CBCR or conventional cognitive rehabilitation for
30&#x02005;min. To compare the two groups, the Lowenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive
Assessment (LOTCA) and Motor-free Visual Perception Test-3 (MVPT-3) were performed.
[Results] Both groups showed significant improvement in LOTCA and MVPT-3. Furthermore,
there were significant differences in LOTCA and MVPT-3 between the two groups.
[Conclusion] CBCR with CoTras may contribute toward the recovery of cognitive function and
visual perception in patients with acute stroke.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Cognitive function</kwd><kwd>Korean computer-based cognitive rehabilitation program</kwd><kwd>Visual perception</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cognitive dysfunction is a common symptom after a stroke<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cognitive dysfunction is a strong predictor of long-term functional
outcomes such as work performance and independent activities of daily living<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, the evaluation and recovery of
cognitive function after a stroke is critical for the maintenance of independent living<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The literature generally classifies
intervention methods for cognitive rehabilitation into conventional cognitive rehabilitation
and computer-based cognitive rehabilitation (CBCR)<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. CBCR is a technique that can enhance attention, concentration,
implementation skills, and perception-motor skills through various programs<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. CBCR provides standardized and
structuralized training programs and also allows users to adjust the degree of difficulty to
their individual cognitive levels<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
addition, these training programs may shorten the treatment period<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Since the early 1980s, CBCR has been proven to be effective in treating the cognitive
impairments of the elderly and of patients with brain injury, dementia, schizophrenia, and
stroke<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recently developed CBCR
programs have focused on the activities of daily living such as calculating numbers,
remembering names, and shopping activities in addition to conventional approaches focused on
training for attention, concentration, and memory improvement<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, CBCR programs used in Korea are mostly imported from
abroad, and many aspects of these programs do not fit the Korean culture.</p><p>In 2011, Kim developed a Korean CBCR program called CoTras; however, there is still
insufficient evidence for the clinical effectiveness of this program<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, there is an urgent need to verify whether the
efficiency of CoTras is sufficient, by using comprehensive and objective methods.</p><p>Accordingly, in this study, we attempted to investigate the effects of the Korean CBCR
program CoTras on cognitive function and visual perception ability by conducting a
randomized controlled trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were recruited from a local rehabilitation hospital. All subjects gave their
voluntary consent to participate after receiving a detailed explanation of the purpose and
methods of the study. We screened the volunteers by using the following study criteria
derived from a previous CBCR study<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>: (i)
history of no more than one stroke; (ii) stroke with an onset duration of &#x0003c; 3 months;
(iii) a score of &#x02264;23 on the Korean version of Mini-Mental Status Examination (K-MMSE); (iv)
ability to understand instructions; (v) ability to use the controller with the unaffected
upper limb; and (vi) without unilateral hemispatial neglect and hemianopsia. All subjects
provided written informed consent before study inclusion according to the code of ethics of
the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki, version 2004).</p><p>We administered two outcome measures. The first is the Lowenstein Occupational Therapy
Cognitive Assessment (LOTCA) consisting of 26 sub-tests and can be used to assess six
domains (orientation, visual perception, spatial perception, motor praxis, visuomotor
organization, and thinking operation). The battery of tests takes 30&#x02013;40&#x02005;min to administer.
The LOTCA has been standardized, and its reliability and validity in various populations
have been investigated since 1989<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
second measure is the Motor-free Visual Perception Test-3 (MVPT-3), a tool used to evaluate
visual perception abilities without motor function use; this was devised for screening,
diagnosis, and research purposes<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>After the previous testing session, all subjects were randomly assigned to either the
control group (CG) or the experimental group (EG) in accordance with a random-numbers table.
All outcome measures were administered to the patients at baseline and at the end of
treatment (after the 4-week intervention) by the assistant researcher with 5&#x02005;years&#x02019;
experience in using the measures.</p><p>During the sessions, all subjects participated in a standard rehabilitation program
according to a daily inpatient treatment schedule. In addition to standard rehabilitation,
all subjects received 30-min daily sessions of either the CG or the EG treatment.</p><p>Subjects from the EG group performed 20 sessions (5 days a week for 4 weeks) of CBCR with
the CoTras program (Netblue Co., Ltd, Korea) made for Koreans. CoTras consists of a diverse
training program including visual perception, attention, memory, orientation, and others
(categorization, sequencing). A joystick and a large button on the CoTras panel make the
training easy for patients who are unfamiliar with computer use. The training allows
adjusting to individual patient&#x02019;s abilities at all levels of the program. Training data are
automatically stored for accurate analysis, aimed at establishing treatment plans<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, EG subjects received the
visual perception training consisting of object recognition, object constancy, figure-ground
organization, visual discrimination, and visual organization. The therapy for CG subjects
was designed to match that for the EG subjects in terms of duration (in minutes). The CG
subjects received conventional cognitive rehabilitation with a pencil and paper with
emphasis on visual perception ability.</p><p>All data analyses were performed by using SPSS version 20.0. The independent t-test was
used to compare the difference between group means and changes in values, and the paired
t-test was used to test differences in continuous variables within groups. Statistical
significance was accepted for values of p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>After applying the inclusion criteria, 37 subjects were screened for this study, with 7

advantages<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. One of the advantages of
CBCR is the cost-effectiveness by providing individualized treatments to continuously and
repeatedly stimulate impaired cognitive areas<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of this study showed that CBCR with CoTras may
significantly improve cognitive function and visual perception ability of patients with
acute stroke, with a statistically significant improvement in LOTCA and MVPT in both groups
of subjects. The improvement in LOTCA and MVPT was higher in EG than in CG subjects after 20
sessions, confirming that CBCR contributes to obtaining better results than those of
conventional cognitive rehabilitation at the early stage of recovery<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recently, one of the most widely used CBCR programs in Korea is RehaCom<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The effects of CBCR with RehaCom have been
proved in several studies<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, in some parts of RehaCom, the stimuli presented
on the screen do not fit the culture and situation in Korea; therefore, it is difficult to
use in Korean<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. To solve this problem, Kim
developed a CBCB program for Koreans. The effectiveness of CBCR with CoTras for the
rehabilitation of patients with cognitive dysfunction has been proved in several
studies<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Especially, Kim, in 2011, indicated
that subjects who received CBCR with CoTras showed improvement in LOTCA and MVPT after
treatment, which is consistent with the results of this study.</p><p>We conclude that CBCR with CoTras can be used as a therapeutic approach for restoring the
cognitive function and visual perception ability of patients with acute stroke. Furthermore,
CoTras can be used as an alternative to other CBCR programs aimed at improving cognitive
function and visual perception ability.</p><p>The focus on the early stage of stroke recovery makes this study useful in clinical
practice. Although the sample size is small, the results of this study have potential
significance in terms of effectiveness and suggest a potential large clinical use of
CoTras.</p><p>The long-term effects of CBCR with CoTras were not identified in this study. Therefore,
further controlled studies with a larger sample size and longer interventions are needed to
clarify the clinical benefits of CoTras as a rehabilitation treatment for cognitive
dysfunction in patients with acute stroke.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Diamond</surname><given-names>PT</given-names></name><name><surname>Felsenthal</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Macciocchi</surname><given-names>SN</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Effect of cognitive impairment on rehabilitation
