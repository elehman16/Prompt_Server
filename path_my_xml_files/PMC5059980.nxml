According to the Global Burden of Disease 2013 project, musculoskeletal disorder contributes 6.8&#x000a0;% of the total disability-adjusted life-years(DALYs), with 10&#x000a0;% of this due to OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Increased longevity and obesity in most developed countries are expected to dramatically increase the incidence and prevalence of OA of the knee within the next decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Current estimates indicate that the prevalence rates of knee OA are approximately 15&#x000a0;% in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and about 34.5&#x02013;45.6&#x000a0;% in elderly Thai [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It has been estimated that 40&#x000a0;% of the population aged over 65&#x000a0;years is affected by knee or hip symptomatic OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Currently, there is no known cure for OA, and no intervention has been unequivocally demonstrated to delay disease progression before joint replacement surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. As for pharmacologic therapy, first-line drugs for OA are used purely for managing pain. Analgesic agents and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors, are the most widely prescribed. However, the side effects of these treatments, which include an increased risk of cardiovascular events (e.g., heart attacks and stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]), suggest that these drugs should be used with caution and should be avoided in patients with OA who have underlying cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Therefore, there remains a need for a therapeutic agent for OA that has symptom-modifying effects, a better safety profile, and positive (or at least no negative) effects on cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Patented crystalline glucosamine sulfate (pCGS) and diacerein are commonly used for treatment of symptomatic mild to moderate knee OA to relieve joint pain and delay joint destruction and cartilage loss. pCGS was developed as a prescription drug for OA in Europe and Asia, but it is available as an over-the-counter product in the United States and Australia. Diacerein is also available as an over-the-counter product in some countries in Asia, but not in other countries (e.g., Thailand) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. pCGS is found naturally in the human body, acting as one of the building blocks of cartilage and a precursor for glycosaminoglycan, a major component of joint cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Diacerein works by inhibiting interleukin-1, one of the first cytokines that induces fever, controls lymphocytes, increases the number of bone marrow cells, and causes degeneration of the bone joint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The efficacy of pCGS and diacerein compared with placebo and active drugs has been estimated in systematic reviews and a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The results of these investigations suggest that diacerein may be better than glucosamine for reducing pain, but both have similar efficacy for improving joint function. Because pCGS and diacerein have anabolic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and catabolic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], respectively, combining them may have synergetic effects and thus improve pain and function better than monotherapy. However, no RCT has directly compared the clinical outcomes between monotherapy (i.e., diacerein or pCGS) and a combination of the two drugs. We thus wanted to determine whether combined diacerein and pCGS is superior to pCGS alone. Therefore, we conducted a RCT with the aim of comparing clinical outcomes (i.e., pain and OA score) at 6&#x000a0;months as well as the safety profiles of treatment with combined pCGS and diacerein versus pCGS alone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>The study design was a double-blind, parallel, randomized, controlled superiority trial. The trial was conducted at the orthopedics outpatient clinic of Ramathibodi Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, between August 2013 and August 2014. It was conducted according to the original protocol regarding trial design, treatments, and outcome assessments, except dealing with missing data using imputation. The trial was also conducted and reported in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>Patients were recruited from the orthopedic outpatient clinic at Ramathibodi Hospital by orthopedic residents and staff between August 2013 and August 2014.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Treatment regimen and randomization</title><p>Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive either a sachet of pCGS 1500&#x000a0;mg (Rottapharm Madaus, Monza, Italy) plus placebo once daily or pCGS 1500&#x000a0;mg plus diacerein 50&#x000a0;mg once daily (TRB Chemedica International S.A., Geneva, Switzerland) for 6&#x000a0;months. TRB Chemedica International prepared placebo capsules identically to diacerein by appearance, smell, and taste. Patients, physicians, assessors, and research nurses did not know which one was the active drug or the placebo.</p><p>A block randomization with a ratio of 1:1 was applied to generate a randomization list, with varying block sizes of 4&#x02013;8. This procedure was prepared by a biostatistician (AT) who was not involved in patient recruitment or data collection. STATA version 13.0 software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) was used to generate the random sequence lists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], which were then prepared using coded drug packages and administered by a research nurse if patients met the inclusion criteria and had given informed consent. Patients might be prescribed other pain relief (acetaminophen 500&#x000a0;mg or NSAIDs), depending on the physician&#x02019;s judgment. The use of NSAIDs could be started with ibuprofen 400&#x000a0;mg one tablet three times per day or naproxen 250&#x000a0;mg one tablet two times per day if patients were allergic to ibuprofen. The patients were provided with a diary to record their daily pain medication intake.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcomes of interest were pain score measured at 24&#x000a0;weeks using a VAS (ranging from 0 to 10, where higher score indicates greater pain) and the OA score measured at 24&#x000a0;weeks using the Thai version of the Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The WOMAC consists of 3 domains and 22 items comprising pain (5 items), function (15 items), and stiffness (2 items). Each item was graded from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. Total and subdomain scores were calculated by summation of scores for relevant items. The total scores range from 0 to 220, where higher scores indicate more severe OA.</p><p>The secondary outcomes of interests were WOMAC subscores for pain, function, stiffness, and joint space width (JSW). The WOMAC scores were measured by a well-trained research assistant using WOMAC questionnaires at baseline and weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 after treatment. JSW was assessed using weight-bearing metatarsophalangeal radiography at baseline, 12&#x000a0;weeks, and 24&#x000a0;weeks, and determined by computer-generated measurements taken from digitized images. JSW was defined as the distance from the distal femoral condyle to the proximal tibia, and it was measured by one orthopedist (JK) at 12 and 24&#x000a0;weeks after treatment. The intra- and interobserver reproducibility of this technique were considered to be acceptable, with an interobserver intraclass coefficient of correlation of 0.912 (0.887&#x02013;0.931) and an intraobserver intraclass coefficient of correlation of 0.996 (0.991&#x02013;0.998) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In addition, adverse events, including gastrointestinal effects (i.e., dyspepsia and diarrhea), were assessed at each visit after treatment. All adverse events reported by the patients during the study treatment were recorded on their Case Report Form and classified in terms of type, time of onset, severity (mild, moderate, or severe), duration, and outcome. The physician asked the patient, &#x0201c;How well did you tolerate the test medication?&#x0201d; and recorded the patient&#x02019;s response. All the information concerning expected adverse events was provided on the informed consent form. Information regarding other covariables, including age, sex, knee symptoms (i.e., warmth and stiffness), underlying disease (i.e., diabetes, hypertension, malnutrition, cardiovascular disease, and obesity as defined by body mass index [BMI] &#x02265;30&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>), and disease severity at baseline, was also collected.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The sample size was calculated on the basis of a superiority trial detecting a mean difference in VAS between pCGS plus diacerein and pCGS plus placebo. For the meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], the mean and SD of VAS scores in the pCGS group were 4.78 and 1.9, respectively. Type I error with a two-sided test, power of test, and ratio of the treatment groups were set at 0.05, 0.80, and 1:1, respectively. The estimated sample size needed was 59 for each group to detect a mean difference in VAS score of 1 unit. Loss to follow-up was estimated at 20&#x000a0;%, which yielded a required sample size of 148 patients.</p><p>Data were described using frequency for categorical data and mean (SD) or median (range) where appropriate for continuous data. The distributions of these baseline characteristics were then explored. If the distributions were different between the two intervention groups (i.e., &#x02265;10&#x000a0;% for binary/categorical variables and &#x02265;1 of the pooled SD for continuous variables), these variables were then considered for adjustment in the main analysis.</p><p>Continuous data for both primary and secondary outcomes, including VAS pain score and WOMAC total scores and subscores at 24&#x000a0;weeks, were compared between treatment groups using a mixed linear regression analysis with a hierarchical approach, in which a subject variation term was fitted in the model as a random effect and treatment was considered as a fixed effect. Marginal treatment effects between treatments and times were then estimated and compared. Covariables at baseline were included if they were unequally distributed between two groups as mentioned above. The normality of residuals of the mixed model was then checked using normality plots (i.e., quantile of normal distribution) and the Shapiro-Wilk test. Diagnostic measures were explored if the assumption of normality was violated. The continuous outcomes were then transformed where appropriate to meet the assumption.</p><p>Secondary outcomes with dichotomous data (i.e., adverse events at 24&#x000a0;weeks) were compared between treatment groups using a mixed-effects Poisson regression analysis in which a subject variation was fitted in the model as a random effect and the treatment was considered as a fixed effect. The incidence of adverse events in both groups and a ratio of the incidence (i.e., a risk ratio [RR]) between treatments and times were then estimated and compared. Unbalanced covariables at baseline were also included in a Poisson regression model.</p><p>An intention-to-treat (ITT) approach was applied for all analyses if there was any evidence of a protocol violation. Missing outcome data were imputed for maintaining ITT using a multivariate normal regression analysis with 20 replications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Complete data (i.e., age, sex, BMI, VAS, and WOMAC subdomain scores at baseline) were used to simultaneously predict VAS and WOMAC subdomain scores after treatments. All analyses were performed using STATA version 14.0 software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The Bonferroni correction was applied to adjust for inflation of type I error from six outcomes and thus six multiple tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. If a significance level for the whole family of tests was 0.05, then the Bonferroni-corrected threshold for individual tests was 0.0083.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Patient characteristics</title><p>A total of 148 patients was recruited and randomly allocated to treatment groups (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Of these, 1 patient was ineligible because his pain scores on the VAS and WOMAC at baseline were 0, leaving 147 patients for assessment of clinical outcomes. Baseline characteristics were described, and their distributions between treatment groups were explored (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In the pCGS plus diacerein group, the majority were female (83.1&#x000a0;%), the mean (&#x000b1;SD) age was 58.8 (&#x000b1;6.6) years, and the mean BMI was 28.9 (&#x000b1;5.3) kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The mean age in the pCGS plus placebo group was about 2.4&#x000a0;years older, and the mean BMI was about 1.7&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> lower, than in the pCGS plus diacerin group. The rest of the variables and disease severity at baseline, including pain, function, and stiffness scores were comparable between treatment groups.

Our findings suggest that combined treatment does not reduce VAS pain score, WOMAC total score, or WOMAC subscores compared with pCGS monotherapy in patients with mild to moderate knee OA. Although the efficacy in both treatment groups did not differ, clinical signs and symptoms were improved in both treatment groups at 12&#x02013;24 weeks, and this was particularly evident in the pCGS plus placebo group.</p><p>pCGS, which comprises essential components of the proteoglycans in normal cartilage, is found naturally in the knee joint of the human body. With its possible anabolic effect, it is used for inhibition of metalloproteinase activity, prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> release, nitric oxide production, degradation of glycosaminoglycans, and stimulation of the synthesis of hyaluronic acid in the joint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It has a slow onset of response, provides long-lasting pain relief and functional improvement, and delays progression of the joint space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] in OA of the knee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Diacerein may be beneficial for OA in that it inhibits interleukin-1, controls lymphocytes, increases the number of bone marrow cells, and reduces degeneration of the bone joint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. As a result, diacerein is also claimed to improve pain and function in OA of the knee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In a recent animal study, researchers found chondroprotective effects of diacerein and pCGS, but a better range of motion of the knee joint was found in response to diacerein than to pCGS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. With the different mechanisms of action of pCGS and diacerein, it could be expected that combined treatments should result in synergetic effects.</p><p>Our findings are similar to those of a previous study in which researchers compared combined pCGS plus chondroitin sulfate with pCGS or chondroitin sulfate alone in patients with OA of the knee whose Kellgren-Lawrence grade was 2&#x02013;3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. That study was later combined in a network meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], which showed similar results. Although the potential synergistic effects derived from a pharmacologic study of pCGS and diacerein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] looked promising, our findings indicate that combined treatments did not provide any benefit over monotherapy.</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first double-blind RCT designed to assess the effects of combined pCGS plus diacerein versus pCGS monotherapy with 6&#x000a0;months of follow-up. The active treatments, both capsules and sachets, were identical in appearance and were administered to patients using coded drug packs; therefore, patients, investigators, and outcome assessors were truly blinded. We considered the most relevant outcomes, including subjective (i.e., VAS pain score, WOMAC total score, and WOMAC subscores) and objective (i.e., minimal tibiofemoral JSW) measures. In addition, all possible adverse effects were collected. Drug compliance was reasonably high, ranging from 88&#x000a0;% to 100&#x000a0;% and 79&#x000a0;% to 100&#x000a0;% in the combined treatment and monotherapy groups, respectively (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.133). Cointervention with additional pain medications was also similar at 17.6&#x000a0;% versus 21.6&#x000a0;% in the combined treatment and monotherapy groups, respectively (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.534). We applied an ITT analysis by considering all patients in the groups to which they were originally randomly allocated, thus minimizing bias.</p><p>Our study has some limitations. The dosage of diacerein that we used was 50&#x000a0;mg in the combined treatment group because the side effect of diacerein has been shown to have a correlation to the drug dosage in prevention of drug withdrawal, according to a previous study in which researchers compared diacerein in different dosages (50, 100, and 150&#x000a0;mg) with placebo. The highest safety profile is at a dose of 50&#x000a0;mg/day, and we did not up-titrate the dose. However, the positive effects on VAS pain symptoms are decreased in a dose-dependent manner as the dose is decreased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This could explain the lack of difference between the two treatment groups.</p><p>The sample size calculation was computed to assess primary outcomes between groups, but it may not be generalized to assessment of secondary outcomes; therefore, statistical insignificance might be due to the risk of type II errors. We considered mostly patients with knee OA with mild to moderate pain scores at baseline, which might have made it difficult to detect the benefits of combined treatment. In addition, our patients with knee OA were mainly diagnosed. The uncertain clinical diagnosis and classification may affect the outcomes of clinical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. There is a widespread belief that there is a high discordance between clinical and radiographic knee OA. In an attempt to overcome this problem, we included the participants in our study on the basis of American College of Rheumatology criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] for diagnosis of knee OA with the radiographic criteria of Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2&#x02013;3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. However, the Kellgren-Lawrence classification strongly depends on adequate patient positioning when taking x-rays. It is also not specific to cartilage loss. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides somewhat superior sensitivity to change compared with commonly used radiographs, and it has recently provided non-location-dependent measures of cartilage thickness loss and gain, which are potentially more sensitive in detecting symptomatic slow-acting drug for osteoarthritis effects than radiographic JSW. The cost of MRI is about 20 times greater than that of radiographs; therefore, we used radiographically measured JSW with strict positioning to obtain the highest-quality outcome measurements. Moreover, knee pain and function of patients with these inclusion criteria, which we assessed using subjective outcome VAS and WOMAC scores, may be imprecise owing to the nonspecific nature of knee pain (e.g., non-OA pathology such as tendinitis or muscle strain, referred pain, and nonphysical pain such as depression), and all these factors can coexist at the same time, composing multiple layers of causality of knee pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p>The potential sources of bias that could substantially impact interpretation of the trial were noncompliance, cointervention, and contamination. For cointervention and contamination, there were no reports of use of nonprotocol medications or other cotreatments, which meant cointervention or contamination between the groups was unlikely. However, the data were analyzed by the ITT method. As for compliance, missing outcome data were imputed using a multivariate normal regression analysis with 20 replications. Complete data (i.e., age, sex, BMI, VAS and WOMAC subdomain scores at baseline) were used to simultaneously predict VAS and WOMAC subdomain scores after treatment.</p><p>We measured outcomes over 6&#x000a0;months owing to time restrictions, making the study a short-term assessment. However, according to previous studies of both drugs, there have been long-term effects lasting up to about 1&#x000a0;year (longest effect lasted 3&#x000a0;years). There were also sustained effects lasting longer than 3&#x000a0;months; therefore, when assessing stratified patients with knee OA in a subgroup with longer follow-up times, a sustained effect could be considered to deduce the benefits of combined treatment. Replication using larger samples with repeated measurements might show greater, more conclusive differences in all possible outcomes over time between the two groups. This information could be used to more properly address the treatment effects. Moreover, the results derived from this study were based on plain radiographs, which may not be sufficient to assess knee cartilage, the major component that responds to both drugs (based on the JSW of the knee joint). MRI may better facilitate the assessment of cartilage changes in the knee joint in the next study because MRI is much more sensitive than plain radiography. However, in this study, we assessed JSW at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months. These time periods may not be adequate for assessing changes in JSW and may be a reason for the insignificant results regarding radiographic changes in JSW. In postmarketing data, elevations in serum liver enzymes and acute hepatic injury have been recorded. In this study, although participants with preexisting liver problems were excluded, there were no measures to monitor liver toxicity; therefore, we were unable to detect any potential liver-related adverse drug events. Finally, there are various generic preparations of glucosamine that were approximately five times cheaper than the original ones. Bioequivalence trials between original and generic glucosamine samples should be conducted.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study did not demonstrate that coadministration of diacerein with pCGS improves pain and WOMAC scores compared with pCGS monotherapy in patients with mild to moderate OA with Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2&#x02013;3.
