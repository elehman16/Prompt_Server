The prevalence in Norway is between 20% and 25%,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and one-third have mixed urinary incontinence (MUI).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> MUI is defined as a complaint of involuntary loss of urine associated with urgency, and also with effort on physical activity or exertion, or upon sneezing or coughing.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> MUI is a mix of urgency urinary incontinence and stress urinary incontinence. Between 7%<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and 19%<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> of women with urinary incontinence define themselves as bothered with either decreased self-esteem, reduced social life or being less physically active as a result of their urinary incontinence.</p><p>The costs associated with urinary incontinence are substantial; about 2% of the healthcare budget in Sweden and the USA is allocated to incontinence problems.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Urinary incontinence is undertreated and &#x0003c;50% of housebound women seek help for their incontinence, which they believe is part of the ageing process.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>The aetiology of MUI is unclear. Urgency urinary incontinence is characterised by instability of the muscle that empties the bladder, termed detrusor instability. Stress urinary incontinence is characterised by a weakened urethral sphincter or closure mechanisms at the urinary bladder neck. Births, oestrogen deficiency or prolapse of the uterus are often contributing factors, and the condition is most prevalent around menopause, with another peak later in old age.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>The standard treatment of MUI is currently pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), electrostimulation (biofeedback and feedback), and medication (eg, oestrogens or anticholinergics). Surgery is adequate treatment only for women where leakage during coughing and sneezing are more dominant than the urge symptoms.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><sec id="s1a"><title>Pelvic floor muscle training</title><p>There is level 1 evidence that PFMT is better than no treatment for women with urinary incontinence.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>

We added the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence-Short Form (ICIQ-UI SF) to a semi-structured template. This template included boxes for inclusion criteria, exercise diary, questions about expectation of treatment effect, adverse events, satisfaction with the treatment, and whether the women would recommend the treatment for others with MUI (the latter three in questionnaire 2, after 12&#x02005;weeks). SurveyMonkey supplies a unique web address for all surveys. This address was referred to in the recruitment channels.

The treatment regimen reflected the &#x02018;real world&#x02019;; hence some women came for treatment once a week, and others twice a week and then not for a month. The medical history was taken using a TCM interview based on the four interrogations, and the diagnostic system of pattern identification named eight principles.

The individual consultation included vaginal examination to verify that the correct procedure of using the pelvic floor muscles was obtained. The regional ethics committee approved this procedure for this pilot study, and had no objection to this being performed.

Urodynamic testing is no longer required for the diagnosis. ICIQ-UI SF takes less than 5&#x02005;minutes to fill in and it has been tested for responsiveness to both surgery and PFMT interventions, but not acupuncture interventions.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Correlation between expectations and the results after treatment</title><p>The expectations of treatment effect were measured using the following questions: (1) To what degree do you think acupuncture can help for your urinary incontinence? (2) To what degree do you think PFMT can help for your urinary incontinence? This was measured on a linear scale with values ranging from 1 to 11, 1 meaning &#x02018;not at all&#x02019; and 11 meaning &#x02018;to a large extent&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Sample size and data analysis</title><p>As this was a pilot trial, it was estimated that 34 women would be sufficient to answer our questions on feasibility and to estimate a proper sample size for a full scale trial.

Once the women had started the interventions, compliance was high in the physiotherapy and acupuncture groups, and the questionnaires were completed properly. In order to perform the power calculation of the full-scale study, the mean value of ICIQ-UI SF (N=34) was calculated to be 10.37 (SD 3.42). Clinical relevance is regarded as an improvement of 3&#x02005;units on a scale of 0&#x02013;21.

SurveyMonkey worked adequately as a randomisation tool, but it was not feasible to stratify or cluster the randomisation based in the ICIQ-UI SF median score at baseline, resulting in the present difference in baseline score (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ACUPMED2015010828TB1">table 1</xref>). In a full-scale trial, the groups would be more likely to be similar due to the effect of randomisation of more women. A difference in ICIQ-UI SF baseline score between the groups should be avoided, because we do not know if the severity of urinary incontinence matters for the treatment effect.</p><p>Dropout rates were high in all groups (see flowchart in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ACUPMED2015010828F1">figure 1</xref>). Three of the four dropouts in the physiotherapy group dropped out before attending the first session, due to the inconvenient training time of 09:00. Hence in a full scale trial we will offer women PFMT both in the morning and evening. Another woman, aged 87&#x02005;years, dropped out after her first session of PFMT because she was not able to exercise. Of the six women who completed PFMT, four attended 12 sessions of PFMT, one attended 11, and one attended 10 sessions. All women completed the training diary of 10&#x02005;min PFMT at home every day.</p><p>In the acupuncture group, only two women withdrew during the study, one due to no effect, and the other due to cancer. A further two dropped out before treatment, leaving eight women completing 12 sessions of acupuncture during 12&#x02005;weeks. Once the women had started both treatments, the compliance was high in both groups, suggesting that the interventions should be kept as they are in a full-scale trial.</p><p>There is a need for better motivation especially in the waiting list group. This can be done by regular phone contact during the study by the investigator, including better explanation and provision of information throughout the study on the importance of their answers.</p><p>The acupuncture intervention being flexible for treatment time during the 12&#x02005;weeks is compatible with a pragmatic approach. We think that this is close to everyday practice, and necessary for motivating the women in the trial to complete it.</p><p>In planning for a larger study, better information should be provided to all groups, adding an exclusion criterion of vaginal bleeding after menopause (cancer was detected in two women during this pilot) and offering two classes of PFMT a week (more compatible with working hours) to help reduce dropout.</p><p>Higher expectations for the treatments were associated with higher outcome scores in both the acupuncture and physiotherapy groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ACUPMED2015010828F3">figure 3</xref>). This may suggest that what the women think of the treatment before attending PFMT and acupuncture is important for the results of the treatment when it comes to MUI. This finding is supported by other acupuncture trials on chronic pain<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and menopause.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The second question concerning adverse events<italic>&#x02500;</italic>whether the urinary incontinence symptoms worsened at the beginning of treatment<italic>&#x02500;</italic>was included because, to our knowledge, this has not been measured for PFMT before. One woman in both treatment groups perceived a worsening of incontinence symptoms after the first two treatments, but this disappeared as treatment persisted.</p><fig id="ACUPMED2015010828F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Regression on expectations and changes in International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence-Short Form (ICIQ-UI SF).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="acupmed-2015-010828f03"/></fig><p>This study has limitations. Firstly, we had too short a follow-up period. The effect of treatment should be measured immediately after and then at 6&#x02005;months and 1&#x02005;year after the intervention, to see if the intervention effects persist, and also to see whether any of the participants are continuing to undertake treatment on their own. A 3-year follow-up would be the best. This is also important for the cost-effectiveness comparison we want to perform following a full-scale trial.</p><p>A three-day bladder diary will be used in a full-scale trial, to perceive objective measurements as suggested by the NICE guidelines of 2013.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>This trial could be biased by the fact that the acupuncturist and the investigator were the same person.

Adding regular phone contact during the study by the investigator to the waiting list group, introducing evening classes of PFMT and acupuncture, and adding menopausal bleeding to the exclusion criteria and general health to be able to perform PFMT to the inclusion criteria will all help in reducing dropout. The sample size for a full-scale three-armed trial was estimated at 129 women with 43 in each group. Further research is warranted in terms of determining which treatment is most effective for reducing symptoms and bothersomeness of MUI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ACUPMED2015010828TB2">table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ACUPMED2015010828F2">figure 2</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Twitter:</bold> Follow Atle Klovning at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/atleklovning">@atleklovning</ext-link></p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> MS initiated the study, AK and TA helped in planning the study.
