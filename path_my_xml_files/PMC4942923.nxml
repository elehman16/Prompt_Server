Early and effective treatment of BPD is crucial to the prevention of its individual, psychosocial, and economic consequences.

Mentalization-based treatment is an evidence-based program for BPD, originally developed for adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Aims/hypotheses: We will investigate whether a specifically designed mentalization-based treatment in groups is an efficacious treatment for adolescents with BPD or subthreshold BPD compared to treatment as usual. The trial is a four-center, two-armed, parallel-group, assessor-blinded randomized clinical superiority trial. One hundred twelve patients aged 14 to 17 referred to Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics in Region Zealand are randomized to 1&#x000a0;year of either mentalization-based treatment in groups or treatment as usual. Patients will be included if they meet at least four DSM-5 criteria for BPD. The primary outcome is self-reported borderline features at discharge. Secondary outcomes will include self-harm, depression, BPD criteria, externalizing and internalizing symptoms, and social functioning, together with parental reports on borderline features, externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Measures of attachment and mentalization will be included as mediational variables. Follow-up assessment will take place at 3 and 12&#x000a0;months after end of treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of a group-based mentalization-based treatment for adolescents with BPD or subthreshold BPD.

In comparison to other personality disorders (PDs), BPD is associated with more severe impairments in social functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], higher rates of psychiatric comorbidity and increased risk of suicide attempts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Prevalence in the general population ranges from 0.5 to 2.7&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In clinical populations the prevalence ranges between 9 and 22&#x000a0;% in outpatient settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and up to 40&#x000a0;% in inpatient settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Research into the etiology of BPD indicates that it is multifactorial and includes genetic dispositions, neuropsychological dysfunctions, and environmental factors such as neglect and physical abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>It has been disputed whether it is possible and meaningful to diagnose PDs in general and BPD in particular in adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, there is evidence that BPD can be diagnosed reliably and validly in adolescents with reliability rates comparable to those found with adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The possibility of diagnosing adolescent PD has been introduced in the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition</italic> (DSM-5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and BPD prevalence rates among adolescent inpatients are similar to those of adult inpatients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Stability of PD diagnoses among adolescents also resembles that of adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>BPD is associated with both chronic medical illnesses and comorbid psychiatric disorders, and psychiatric comorbidity may be even higher in adolescents than in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Patients with BPD tend to use inpatient and outpatient treatment far more than patients with other PDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] leading BPD to be associated with costly health service use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], also in adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Therefore, the development of early and effective treatment programs, which include adolescents with BPD at the threshold level is important and may have long-term benefits for patients, their families and society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. While pharmacological treatments can reduce specific symptoms experienced by BPD patients, they fail to bring about a fundamental or long-lasting change in the disorder itself. In contrast, several structured outpatient psychotherapeutic programs such as dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), mentalization-based treatment (MBT), transference-focused therapy (TFP), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and schema-focused group therapy (SFT) have been shown to be efficacious. Although further evidence is still warranted, psychotherapy is suggested as the primary treatment for BPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p>Adaptation of structured and manualized treatment programs to adolescents with BPD is novel, and relatively few controlled studies have tested their efficacy: In an randomized controlled trial (RCT) by Mehlum et al., DBT-A was found to be superior to the control condition in reducing the frequency of self-harm, both at treatment end and at follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Other studies on feasibility and efficacy of DBT-A also indicate a positive outcome for DBT-A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], but these studies are uncontrolled, small scale, and use different outcome measures, leading the evidence base to be considered insufficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. As the target population for DBT-A is adolescents with suicidal and self-harming behavior, the overlap between this group and adolescents with BPD is only partial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], and the efficacy of DBT-A for treating BPD in adolescents is unknown. Chanen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] tested individual cognitive analytic therapy (CAT) for adolescents with BPD symptoms and found no significant differences between the outcomes of CAT and the control condition at 24&#x000a0;months, but with faster rates of symptomatic improvement in the CAT condition. Schuppert et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] also found no superiority of a 17-session group-based emotion regulation training course. In contrast, Rossouw and Fonagy&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] adaptation of mentalization-based treatment (MBT) for borderline personality patients to adolescents yielded more promising results: A 1-year treatment program for adolescents with self-harming behavior (of whom 73&#x000a0;% met the diagnostic criteria for BPD) comprising weekly individual MBT sessions and monthly family-therapy sessions, was more effective than treatment as usual (TAU). In an uncontrolled study, Laurenssen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] adapted MBT to an inpatient setting with adolescent BPD patients, and found a significant improvement in Axis-I symptomatology and personality functioning.</p><p>MBT is specifically developed to treat BPD and its efficacy of treating BPD in adults has been tested in several RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. MBT is based on attachment theory and psychodynamic principles and has a high degree of structure and a clear treatment goal of improving patients&#x02019; mentalizing skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Mentalization has been defined as the capacity to understand and interpret - implicitly and explicitly - one&#x02019;s own and others&#x02019; behavior as an expression of mental states such as feelings, thoughts, fantasies, beliefs, and desires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. The capacity develops during childhood and is intimately linked with the quality of early attachment relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. When the caregivers affective mirroring of the child&#x02019;s mental state is marked and congruent, i.e., is representative of the child&#x02019;s mental state, and not her own, it serves as a representation of the state that the child can incorporate into its own representation of self [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. The theoretical framework of MBT links BPD pathology to an impairment in the capacity to mentalize. In states of emotional arousal, BPD patients are vulnerable to shifting toward a non-mentalizing mode. In short, MBT offers therapeutic techniques for identifying when this shift is occurring and how to help the patient return to a mentalizing mode, where an understanding of one&#x02019;s own and others&#x02019; minds can be used to regulate the patient&#x02019;s emotional state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In the original model for MBT, group psychotherapy is supported by individual psychotherapy that ensures patients&#x02019; attendance to group sessions by motivating and working constructively with patients&#x02019; negative experiences that could otherwise lead them to drop out of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. However, such a relatively resource-demanding treatment model can impede implementation, and research into the effectiveness of the separate modalities of MBT is sparse.</p><p>While the overall aim of developing patients&#x02019; mentalizing skills overlaps in individual and group therapy, there may be some particular advantages to using the group modality in the treatment of BPD. Karterud [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] summarizes the literature on these advantages as follows: First, the relatively intimate two-person relationship of individual therapy is likely to activate attachment patterns and transference/countertransference that are emotionally too burdening for the BPD patient to endure. In the group, such interpersonal processes will be &#x0201c;spread out&#x0201d; on different group members and therefore be experienced as less intense. Second, as the interpersonal difficulties associated with BPD naturally unfold between group members, group therapy offers an opportunity to explore and work on them in vivo. Third, difficulty with authority figures experienced by many BPD patients can diminish their receptiveness to feedback coming from the therapist. In contrast, when feedback comes from group members, this difficulty may be bypassed. Furthermore, compared to individual therapy, group therapy is considerably less expensive.</p><p>Including parents in the MBT program for adolescent BPD and targeting the parent-child relationship is important. Parental and family circumstances are contributing factors to the development of BPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], and BPD symptoms such as affect dysregulation and impulsivity are especially prone to be exhibited within the context of attachment relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], such as the relationship between adolescents with BPD and their parents. We suggest that guidance for parents on how to understand and respond to their child in interpersonal stressful situations can promote mentalization and co-regulation within the parent-adolescent relationship, and that these intersubjective experiences may serve as a pathway to development of the adolescents&#x02019; mentalizing skills. We also propose that it will reduce premature dropout to educate and guide the parents about the importance of supporting their child in times of low motivation for attending treatment sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge, group-based MBT for adolescent BPD or subthreshold BPD that includes parents in the treatment has not yet been tested for efficacy in a controlled study. However, in an uncontrolled feasibility trial (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;25) of a group-based MBT program similar to the one presented in the present protocol, we found symptomatic improvement in 92&#x000a0;% of the patients. On the Borderline Personality Features Scale for Children (BPFS-C), which is also the primary outcome measure in the present trial, the difference in before and after scores were highly significant (Bo, Sharp, Beck, Pedersen, Gondan and Simonsen (submitted)).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims and hypotheses</title><p>We will investigate whether a specifically designed treatment program, Mentalization-based treatment in groups for adolescents with BPD or subthreshold BPD, is an efficacious treatment compared to treatment as usual (TAU). The MBT program includes an introduction to mentalization (MBT-I), mentalization-based group therapy (MBT-G) and mentalization-based psychoeducation for the parents of the patients (MBT-P) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].

A simple screening instrument has been developed, and staff will be trained in using it prior to recruitment. When clinicians encounter patients who fulfil the inclusion criteria, the patients are sent to an assessor, who will inform the patient and parents thoroughly about participation in the M-GAB trial including the assessment procedure. Patients are then invited to two sessions of assessment for eligibility. Both sessions last between 2 and 3&#x000a0;hours including breaks. Subsequently the family is told if they are invited to participate in the randomization, and if so, outcome measures at baseline are administered. Randomization will take place after completion of the baseline assessment and patients will be allocated to either the MBT in groups or the TAU group (see below).

Naturally, some principles overlaps with individual MBT (i.e., &#x0201c;regulating arousal&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;keeping an affect focus&#x0201d;), but others are specific to the group component (i.e., identifying and mentalizing events in the group) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. The patients&#x02019; profound difficulties with interpersonal functioning and affect regulation require therapeutic techniques potent enough to counteract the difficulties that can arise during sessions. A main therapeutic goal is to balance the management of therapist authority and structure of each session with the open-minded, exploring, and curious stance in order &#x0201c;to create and sustain a mentalizing discourse in the group&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>].</p><p>MBT in groups is a 1-year psychotherapy program with three components, MBT-Introduction (MBT-I), MBT-Group (MBT-G) and MBT-Parents (MBT-P).</p><p>MBT-I is a structured 3-week introductory psychoeducative program for patients covering the concepts of mentalizing and attachment, and information about BPD. MBT-I includes role plays and discussions of cases and video clips in order to encourage active participation. Furthermore, the group members will be encouraged to participate in small homework assignments between the sessions. MBT-I was developed by Karterud and Bateman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], and modified for our purpose in collaboration with the authors.</p><p>Mentalization-based group therapy (MBT-G) consists of 37 weekly sessions of mentalization-based psychotherapy in groups. Sessions are not accompanied by continuing individual sessions. However, case formulations are made with patients during individual sessions with both therapists, and this process scaffolds and supports the therapeutic work in the group. The overall purpose of the case formulation sessions is for therapists and patient to develop a clear mutual understanding of the patient&#x02019;s main difficulties and psychotherapeutic focus points, which can be drawn on during group sessions. The case formulation is to be formulated within the mentalization-based framework, applying the theoretical understandings and principles from mentalization theory. The individual focus in these sessions organizes thinking for therapists and patient and supports the mentalizing work in the ensuing group sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Three individual case formulation sessions are scheduled before the initiation of the MBT-G. The patient will also be informed which therapist is his or her contact person, and an updated crisis plan with the therapist&#x02019;s contact details is included in the formulation. After eight to ten group sessions and again toward the end of the program (after 25 group sessions), a case formulation session is scheduled for revising the formulation according to the deepened knowledge and development of the patient.</p><p>MBT-P is a psychoeducation program for the patients&#x02019; parents running parallel to MBT-I and MBT-G. It is a slow-open six-session program comprising role plays, plenary analysis of difficult interpersonal events between parent and adolescent and therapists&#x02019; presentations with information on BPD, mentalization, and attachment. The importance of parents&#x02019; continuous support of their adolescents&#x02019; attendance to treatment is also discussed. All sessions have a length of 90&#x000a0;minutes. MBT-P is adapted from Karterud and Bateman&#x02019;s manual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. An overview of the entire MBT in groups program is presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Both MBT-P as well as the contact-person function mentioned above are intended to prevent premature dropout of the treatment.</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Therapists</title><p>MBT will be delivered by clinical psychologists and a psychiatrist. Prior to starting the MBT treatment, therapists will have participated in a 2-day introduction to MBT theory and basic principles and a 5-day training program by Professor Sigmund Karterud, who developed the manual for MBT-G and MBT-I in collaboration with Anthony Bateman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Replacement of therapists during the trial may be necessary, in which case at least one therapist in each group will have finished training, while the co-therapist is undertaking or waiting to begin training. National specialists in MBT and adolescent psychiatry provide 1&#x02013;2 hours of supervision per month to secure adherence to the manual. All sessions are videotaped and 10&#x000a0;% are randomly selected for ratings of adherence to the treatment manual applying the MBT-G adherence and competence scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Therapists delivering MBT within this trial will not deliver TAU, but may carry out non-MBT-based clinical work outside the trial such as clinical assessments or case management for in-patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Organization of MBT in groups within the four clinics</title><p>Whenever patients terminate/drop out of a MBT-G group and new patients can be admitted into the group, a new MBT-I group starts up. As a default, patients will be offered MBT-I in their local clinic, but may also choose to enter MBT-I in a different clinic in order to participate in a larger group.

A 12-point difference between the two treatment groups is considered to be clinically important. The only outcome study using the BPFS-C to date reported a standard deviation of outcome of 15.4 for psychotherapeutic treatment with a patient group similar to ours. With 90&#x000a0;% power and a two-tailed significance level of 5&#x000a0;%, 72 patients would need to be randomized to the two treatment arms. This calculation does not, however, take into account the similarity of patients who are treated by the same therapists and potential dropout.</p><p>Patients in the MBT group will be treated in five groups with two therapists in each group. These are slow open groups with six to seven patients, which will include a new patient as soon as another patient has finished treatment. Group treatments are known to cause similarity of the outcomes within groups, which needs to be accounted for in the sample size planning. We expect an intraclass correlation of 0.03, and a total number of eight patients treated in each of the groups, the design effect is 1.24. Thus, the sample size has to be increased by 24&#x000a0;% (which would be 90 patients). For simplicity, we assume the same intraclass correlation in the control group because the control patients are nested within therapists even if the treatment is individual.</p><p>Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis will be used, as it is the recommended approach to evaluating RCTs ITT analysis includes every subject who is randomized according to randomized treatment assignment and it ignores noncompliance, protocol deviations, withdrawal, and anything that happens after randomization. Hence, ITT analysis preserves prognostic balance produced from the original random treatment allocation, but the treatment effect generated from ITT analysis is generally conservative. We will recruit 20&#x000a0;% more patients to have powerful tests in both the ITT as well as in the per protocol population even in the presence of dropout. This yields a total of 112 patients to be randomized, in a 1:1 ratio.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Randomization, methods to minimize bias, and blinding</title><p>In order to keep assessors blind to the patients&#x02019; treatment allocation, all pretreatment assessments will be carried out prior to randomization. Randomization to either MBT or TAU are done online by the trial coordinator (the first author) using a stratified block randomization procedure with a computer-generated allocation sequence with a varying block size kept unknown to the investigators by Public Health and Quality Improvement Data Management<italic>.</italic> Stratification will be according to clinic affiliation and borderline severity, that is, scores on the BPFS-C. More stratification variables are relevant (i.e., socioeconomic status), but not possible to apply due to the small number of participants. Patients randomized to the MBT will initiate the individual case formulation sessions (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) prior to MBT-I, and thereby will initiate the treatment program immediately. Patients randomized to TAU are allocated to a therapist and begin individual sessions immediately.</p><p>Assessments during the treatment phase are limited to self-report measures, hence no blinding will be possible. All information given to the participants before completing the self-reports will be standardized.</p><p>Regarding outcome assessments at discharge, we will minimize bias that knowledge of treatment allocation could cause by implementing the following strategies: (a) outcome assessors will be blind to treatment allocation, (b) outcome assessors and therapists will not directly communicate with each other, and (c) patients are asked not to reveal their treatment allocation during outcome assessments. Furthermore, outcome assessors will be asked to guess the patients&#x02019; treatment allocation so that the effects of possible bias can be examined in the analysis and all outcome assessor interviews will be recorded and a random sample will be re-rated by independent raters. Outcome assessors will be research assistants or clinical psychologists, who have not been trained in MBT, have not been involved in delivering treatment to participating patients, and have not carried out any intake procedures, including baseline assessments. The statistician will perform statistical analyses with the two intervention groups coded as &#x02018;A&#x02019; and &#x02018;B&#x02019;, with randomly chosen therapist identifications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Data management and statistical approach</title><p>Data-management will be handled by Public Health and Quality Improvement Data Management from Central Denmark Region, Aarhus. They will provide support with randomization, set up questionnaires electronically and will keep the data on their secure servers. Hence, none of the staff members involved in the study will have access to outcome data during the treatment phase.</p><p>All analyses will be conducted according to the ITT principle. Characteristics of the treatment groups will be described at baseline. Preliminary analysis will investigate the pattern of missingness at follow-up, and multiple imputation will be used for missing values. The primary outcome is the total score of the BPFS-C, which is treated as a continuous, normally distributed variable. The primary efficacy hypothesis will be tested using a multilevel two-group comparison (MBT vs. TAU), with Group as a main effect, Therapy Group as a random intercept (within the MBT group, see, e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]), the prerandomization BPFS-C as a continuous covariate and the stratification factor clinic as categorical covariate. The test will be performed at the 5&#x000a0;% two-tailed significance level. The primary test for efficacy will be based on the intention-to-treat population, with all randomized patients entering the analysis set, and multiple imputation of missing values. The result will be expressed as the covariate-adjusted difference in group averages, along with the two-sided 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval.</p><p>For the secondary outcomes, similar analyses will be used, taking into consideration the scale of the variable (e.g., logistic regression for binary outcomes). A sensitivity analysis will be based on the per protocol set for the available cases (without imputation). Linear regression and logistic regression analyses will be conducted to examine the predictive power of the different covariates (i.e., personality pathology, mentalizing, and attachment) on treatment efficacy and treatment completion.</p><p>We will use multiple imputations for missing values in the primary and secondary outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. Separate imputation models will be used for the two treatment groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. The imputation models will include the primary and secondary endpoints (baseline and follow-up) as well as the covariates of the primary statistical analysis, and therapist time in hours.</p><p>The primary analysis will be based on the pragmatic comparison of the two treatment arms and will, therefore, not take different amounts of therapist time within or across groups into account. To account for possible differences in therapist time, a sensitivity analysis will be performed on the change scores in which the obtained values will be divided by the actual patient-specific hours of therapist contact.</p><p>Mediation analyses will be carried out to test for potential mediating effects of both mentalizing and attachment. As recommended by Hayes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>], we will conduct structural equation analyses (SEM), using Preacher and Hayes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>] methods for estimating indirect and direct effects with multiple mediators.

However, only recently has research begun to investigate essential questions such as the relative effectiveness of separate program components and which level of specialization versus generalist treatment is needed for treatment of adolescent BPD to be successful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. The evidence base for cost-effective treatment programs for adolescent BPD is limited.</p><p>This is the first randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of a MBT in groups for adolescents with BPD or subthreshold BPD. Below, we discuss some of the potential limitations and strengths of the M-GAB trial.</p><p>The trial is subject to at least three potential limitations. First, our primary outcome measure, the BPFS-C, was selected because it reliably and validly measures borderline personality features <italic>specifically</italic> in adolescents (rather than in adults) and has shown to be a sensitive outcome measure for adolescents in a previous randomized trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. However, although patient-reported outcomes have obvious benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>], they are not observer blinded and therefore at risk of being assessed with some bias. In our trial, patients allocated to MBT may be biased by their knowledge of having received a relatively specific psychotherapeutic treatment and therefore be more optimistic about their outcome. In response to this potential limitation, we included an observer rated measure of change in BPD symptoms, the ZAN-BPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>], as a secondary outcome.</p><p>Second, no standardizations for treatment of adolescent BPD pre-existed within the child and adolescent department, Region Zealand and for the purpose of this study, the limit for the minimum treatment in the TAU arm was defined as 12 monthly individual sessions. Individual treatment allows therapists to focus more intensely on the patient compared to group-based treatment and therapists in the TAU arm may choose to deliver treatment to some patients with a higher frequency than once a month. However, this does not completely rule out the risk of a dose&#x02013;response effect since MBT is delivered on a weekly basis. We defined the minimum frequency for TAU treatment in order to minimize the possible effect of dose&#x02013;response, but as completely equal doses of treatment in the two treatment arms is not guaranteed, the risk is not completely ruled out. We will monitor and register both the MBT and TAU patients&#x02019; contact to the health system during the treatment period, to be able to report on any differences in the treatment doses received.</p><p>Third, the MBT therapists are trained and supervised by engaged and specialized supervisors in a specific treatment model. It is possible that, as the supervisors believe in the advantages of the MBT model, this may influence the therapist allegiance. We were aware of the potential allegiance bias when designing the trial, but wanted to ensure therapist adherence to treatment model. The alternative of having less training or less specialized supervisors increases the risk of therapists not being adherent to the treatment model, which we considered an even greater risk to the trial.</p><p>We would also like to emphasize at least three possible strengths of the trial. First, we included borderline severity as a stratification variable in order to minimize the risk of confounding our findings by an unbalanced distribution of patients with BPD at the threshold versus subthreshold level. Second, we included outcome measures relying on different methods and sources of data (self-report, parental reports, observer-rated interviews and expert ratings) and covering different aspects of quality of life such as symptomatic improvement and social functioning. By including multiple outcome measures, we hope to be able to discuss outcome in broader terms. Third, in the selection of in- and exclusion criteria we aimed for participants to be as close to patients with BPD or subthreshold BPD typically referred to treatment at Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Department, Region Zealand. For example, patients living with foster parents or other kinds of parental substitutes and patients presenting comorbidity or substance abuse were included. Accordingly, the findings of the trial should have a wide generalizability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is currently in the recruitment phase.

SB and LP ran pilot treatment groups and derived experiences and information as a knowledge base for further modification of the MBT-I manual and the MBT-P sessions. ES developed the medical protocol in collaboration with clinical psychiatrists from the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Department Region Zealand. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Competing interests</title><p>We have received external funding for the trial from the Health Science Fund, Region Zealand, Denmark and &#x0201c;Region Sjaellands Forskningsfremmende Pulje&#x0201d; (both are governmental funding).
