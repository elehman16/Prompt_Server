bowel movement through physiotherapy. The purpose of the present study was to compare the
effects of passive exercise of the lower limbs and trunk (PELT) and combination therapies
(COM) with those of conventional thermotherapy (TT) on bowel sounds (BSs) in healthy adult
subjects. Since autonomic activity (AA) significantly influences intestinal motility, we
also investigated the relation between intestinal motility and AA by measurement of BSs.
[Subjects] The subjects were 16 healthy adult males. [Methods] The subjects were randomly
assigned to 3 different physiotherapies, and BSs and sympathetic nerve activity were
measured before and after the physiotherapies. [Results] While BSs significantly increased
following all physiotherapies, the temporal changes in BSs were different among the
physiotherapies. AA measurement showed that PELT and TT significantly decreased the heart
rate. While the high-frequency (HF) component was increased in all physiotherapy groups,
the increases in HF did not reach statistical significance. There were no significant
correlations between BSs and AA. [Conclusion] We found that all of the tested
physiotherapies increased BSs, suggesting that they are clinically useful for treatment of
patients with reduced intestinal motility due to limited spontaneous movement or inability
to rise up from bed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Intestinal motility</kwd><kwd>Passive exercise</kwd><kwd>Thermotherapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Patients treated in an intensive care unit (ICU) tend to have reduced intestinal motility
due to various drug treatments (opioid and sedative agents, etc.), inflammation, metabolism,
pain, anxiety, and bed rest, resulting in a higher risk for postoperative bowel
obstruction<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Reduced intestinal
motility delays enteral or oral alimentation, resulting in malnutrition and digestive
symptoms, such as abdominal distension and abdominal pain, which often affects early
physiotherapy. Reduced intestinal motility in ICU patients sometimes affects their
prognosis, and thus, it is important to facilitate intestinal motility in these
patients.</p><p>Previous studies showed that early postoperative ambulation in the ICU is effective for
facilitating intestinal motility, and &#x0201c;early ambulation&#x0201d; is recommended for prevention and
treatment postoperative bowel obstruction<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In contrast, Waldhasen et al. reported that early ambulation
(starting from postoperative day 1) had no significant effect on intestinal motility
compared with their control group (ambulation from postoperative day 4)<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, &#x0201c;the beneficial effect of early ambulation on
postoperative bowel obstruction remains unclear&#x0201d;<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>We previously reported that passive exercise of the lower limbs and trunk (PELT)
facilitates intestinal motility in patients who have to stay in bed due to various
reasons<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is speculated that PELT
stretches the intestinal tract and enhances parasympathetic nerve activity, resulting in
physiological facilitation of intestinal smooth muscle activity.</p><p>In Japan, a form of thermotherapy (TT) that warms the abdomen or back of patients with
reduced intestinal motility has been widely used in clinical practice. There are many
Japanese reports in which TT was found to be effective for treatment of patients with
cardiovascular diseases<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, patients after
orthopedic<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, patients with prolonged
immobility<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, patients with
psychiatric<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, etc., and for increasing
the local intestinal tract blood flow and parasympathetic nerve activity.</p><p>Thus, the purpose of the present study was to compare the effect of PELT on bowel sounds
with that of conventional TT. We also investigated the effect of a combination therapy (COM)
of TT and PELT on bowel sounds. Since autonomic activation is significantly involved in
intestinal motility, both bowel sounds and autonomic activation were measured before and
after physiotherapy. We then investigated the relation between intestinal motility and
autonomic activation. This was a pilot study to determine whether these physiotherapies have
beneficial effects on facilitation of intestinal motility in patients with physical
immobility due to various therapeutic reasons.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Sixteen healthy adult males without a history of digestive, bone, and joint diseases were
recruited for this study (mean age [SD], 21.2 [1.4] years old; mean body height [SD], 172.1
[5.9] cm; mean body weight [SD], 65.1 [19.8]&#x02005;kg; mean BMI [SD], 21.9 [5.5]). We excluded
female subjects in the current study, since female intestinal motility is influenced by the
menstrual cycle (changes in progesterone levels), which may have affected the results. We
also excluded subjects who smoked and those with daily ingestion of alcohol or caffeinated
foods or drinks, as these things may affect autonomic activity.</p><p>This study was approved by the Hyogo University of Health Sciences Institutional Research
Ethics Committee (Approval #12014). All subjects received an explanation of the research
purpose, methods, and data management, and written informed consent was obtained from each
subject who agreed to participate in the study.</p><p>All study participants were asked not to exercise or eat excessively a day before the
study. They were also asked not to consume caffeinated foods/drinks or alcohol within 24
hours before the study to avoid any influence on autonomic activity. We confirmed that all
participants followed the instructions before the study. We examined the participants to
ensure that they had no digestive symptoms, such as abdominal pain, loose stool, and
diarrhea, and if the participants showed digestive symptoms, we postponed the study. In
normal subjects, bowel sounds are usually recorded 5 to 35 times/minute in the resting spine
position. Thus, when bowel sounds were recorded less than 5 times/minute or 35 times or
more/minute, we also postponed the study. All participant ate the same meal (100g steamed
rice [instant cooked rice, Nishin Co, Kobe, Japan] and 230&#x02005;mL mineral water), and the
measurements of bowel sounds and autonomic activation were carried out 1 hour later in a
room in which the temperature was maintained at 25&#x02005;&#x000b0;C and excessive noise from outside was
blocked. Since body posture influences bowel motility, and patients in ICUs are often
treated in a semirecumbent position to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia, we carried
out the study 15 minutes after the subjects were set in a semirecumbent position. The
physiotherapy, PELT, TT, or COM, was randomly assigned to each subject by a blind technique,
and the assigned physiotherapy was performed for 10 minutes.</p><p>In PELT, one leg was passively flexed, and the full flexion position was maintained for
five seconds. Each subject was administered this passive exercise ten times for each leg. In
addition to leg flexion, right and left trunk rotations were also alternately performed.</p><p>In TT, a hot pack (35 &#x000d7; 45&#x02005;cm) was warmed in a hydrocollator (Sakai Co, Tokyo, Japan) at
80&#x02005;&#x000b0;C. The warmed hot pack was wrapped in a cotton towel and placed on the abdomen. The hot
pack was composed of a cotton canvas bag filled with bentonite.</p><p>In COM, PELT was performed while a hot pack was placed on the abdomen.</p><p>Measurements were performed for 5 minutes before and right after the physiotherapy. Both
bowel sounds and autonomic activation measurements were carried out at the same time. We set
an interval of more than 24 hours between physiotherapies and carried out the
measurements.</p><p>Bowel sounds are generated by contractions of the alimentary tract, and the mixing of
gaseous and liquid contents<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recording
bowel sounds with a stethoscope and then analyzing them is simple, easy, and minimally
invasive, so this procedure has often been used to assess intestinal motility<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. This procedure was used in the current
study.</p><p>An electronic stethoscope with recording capability (Fuji Medical Co., Memory Stethoscope
F-812) was used to record bowel sounds at the midpoint of the line connecting the umbilical
region and the right anterior superior iliac spine. Anatomically, the recording site roughly
corresponds to the area of the ileocecal valve, and this is the area normally listened to
for postprandial peristaltic sounds. Recorded peristaltic sounds were passed through an
amplifier and fed to a data acquisition and analysis system (ADInstruments, Power Lab2/26).
Waveforms of the peristaltic sounds were converted from analog to digital signals using the
PowerLab system and uploaded to a PC. Frequency analysis was performed at 100&#x02013;500&#x02005;Hz, the
primary frequency range of peristaltic sounds<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the integral was calculated every 10 sec.</p><p>Intestinal motility is influenced by autonomic activation. When the parasympathetic nerve
system is activated, intestinal smooth muscle activity is increased, and the activity is
suppressed by sympathetic nerve activation<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In order to clarify the relation between autonomic activation and
changes in intestinal motility induced by physiotherapy, we measured autonomic activation.
The autonomic activity was measured using a MemCalc/Bonaly Light system (GMS Co., Ltd.,
Tokyo, Japan), and the high-frequency (HF) component representing parasympathetic nerve
activity, low-frequency (LF) component representing sympathetic nerve activity, and LF/HF
ratio were measured. The measurements were made by placing an autonomic nerve sensor at the
electrocardiogram V5 lead position, and the HF, LF, and LF/HF ratio were recorded every 2
seconds. We carried out measurement for 5 minutes in a resting state before physiotherapy
and after physiotherapy, as in the case of measurement of bowel sounds.</p><p>Data were expressed as means (SD) where available. The Student&#x02019;s t-test was used to compare
the bowel sounds between before and after physiotherapy. The temporal changes in bowel
sounds were analyzed by multiple comparisons with Dunnett&#x02019;s post hoc test. The regression
coefficient between changes in bowel sounds and autonomic activities was also calculated.
All statistical analyses were performed using a SPSS version 21.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) and
p&#x0003c;0.05 was defined as indicating statistical significance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Changes in bowel sounds following physiotherapy</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean BS (SD)<break/>before PT</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean BS (SD)<break/>after PT</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PELT (mV&#x02219;sec)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.87 (1.31)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.45 (3.93) *</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TT (mV&#x02219;sec)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.75 (2.11)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.98 (3.75) **</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">COM (mV&#x02219;sec)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.71 (1.63)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.47 (4.10) **</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*Significantly different between before and after PT (p&#x0003c;0.05) **Significantly

similar to the results of our previous study in which PELT increased bowel sounds by
14%<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The significant increase in bowel
sounds right after physiotherapy was also similar to the results of our previous study. The
intestine is composed of smooth muscle, in which stretch stimulation of the intestine
depolarizes the smooth muscle cell membrane potential and increases the action potential,
resulting in muscle contraction, which is called stretch induced contraction<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stretching of the alimentary tract is an
important factor that facilitates intestinal motility, and we speculate that passive
exercise of the lower limbs and trunk affects stretching of the intestinal smooth muscle in
the abdomen. In addition, the fact that the increase in bowel sounds continued for several
minutes after PELT suggests that the effect of PELT on smooth muscle contraction of the
alimentary tract is sustained for a certain period.</p><p>Following TT, although bowel sounds significantly increased compared with before treatment
in the resting state, the temporal changes in bowel sounds did not reach statistical
significance, and the increased bowel sounds tended to be sustained throughout the
treatment.</p><p>Previous studies showed that TT increases bowel sounds by 1.6 to 2.3 times, although the
assessment methods were different<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. We
speculate that TT increases alimentary tract blood flow and parasympathetic activation. In
the current study, TT increased bowel sounds by approximately 30%, and this result was
similar to those of previous studies. While it remains unknown what the exact mechanism of
the effect of TT is, the significant HR reduction and 40% increase in the HF component after
TT suggest that parasympathetic nerve activation facilitates intestinal motility.</p><p>After the COM treatment, bowel sounds increased by more than after the individual
treatments of PELT and TT. This result may be due to the combined effects of stretching of
the intestine resulting from PELT, and the increase in blood flow in the alimentary tract
and parasympathetic activation resulting from TT.</p><p>In the current pilot study, we investigated the effect of different physiotherapies on
intestinal motility within the same patients. We found that all the tested physiotherapies
resulted in increased bowel sounds, suggesting that they can be applied to patients with
limited spontaneous movement or prolonged immobility in clinical practice.</p><p>A limitation of the current study is that we cannot prove the underlying mechanisms
responsible for facilitating as a result of physiotherapy. It is practically quite difficult
to directly measure intestinal motility without applying invasive approaches to patients,
which is also ethically problematic. Further studies are necessary to prove the underlying
mechanisms in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 24792477.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Mattei</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Rombeau</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Review of the pathophysiology and management of
