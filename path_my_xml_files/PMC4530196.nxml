Pain management is the most important task in emergency wards when a patient with renal colic attends. This study aims to compare intravenous acetaminophen plus a low dose of morphine with a full dose of morphine in renal colic.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods</title><p>In present randomized clinical trial, 100 patients with confirmed renal colic were recruited from the Emergency Ward of Imam Reza Teaching Hospital affiliated to Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Iran, during a one-year period. These patients randomly received either intravenous acetaminophen (Apotel, 1 g) plus a low dose of morphine (n = 50), or a high dose of morphine (5 mg) (n = 50). Visual analogue scale (VAS) was used for reporting pain during 35 minutes.

In industrialized countries, 1-5% of the population is affected by this condition annually. The lifetime risk of developing this disease is estimated at 20% in men and 5-10% in women.<xref rid="b1-AHJ-07-066" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The most common cause of renal colic is the acute obstruction of the urinary tract by urinary system stones which often causes severe pain.<xref rid="b2-AHJ-07-066" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-AHJ-07-066" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The first goal of renal colic treatment is to relieve the pain. Spasmolytic drugs such as hyoscyamine and dicycloverine are among the traditional medicines in this field.<xref rid="b4-AHJ-07-066" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug may also inhibit pain by inhibiting the release of prostaglandins in this situation. However, the injectable form of the drug is not available and causes many complications.<xref rid="b5-AHJ-07-066" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-AHJ-07-066" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Another standard treatment used in patients with acute renal colic is narcotic drugs such as morphine and pethidine. Despite the widespread use of these drugs, they have many problems, including side effects, lack of public access, and the possibility of drug-dependency.<xref rid="b7-AHJ-07-066" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="b10-AHJ-07-066" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> A new drug used to control pain is intravenous acetaminophen. This antipyretic analgesic drug is used to relieve mild to moderate pain. The analgesic effect of acetaminophen is due to its raising of the pain threshold. Intravenous acetaminophen usually has few side effects and is well tolerated. Furthermore, unlike narcotic drugs, it does not develop drug-dependency.<xref rid="b11-AHJ-07-066" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-AHJ-07-066" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Bektas et al., in a study on patients diagnosed with renal colic, compared the efficacy and safety of the injectable form of paracetamol (46 patients) and morphine (49 patients). In this study, no significant differences were observed between the two medications regarding the effectiveness of pain management, complications, and rescue analgesic demand. Accordingly, the use of injectable paracetamol was recommended.<xref rid="b13-AHJ-07-066" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Serinken et al. conducted a similar study in this field. In this study, 38 patients received injectable paracetamol and 35 patients received morphine. Finally, it was shown that both drugs were similar in terms of treatment efficacy and safety.<xref rid="b14-AHJ-07-066" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Given the high prevalence of renal colic and problems associated with its standard therapy (narcotic drug use), and the lack of similar studies in Iran, this study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous acetaminophen (apotel) plus a low dose of morphine and full dose of morphine in these patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial, 100 patients with a definite diagnosis of renal colic were randomly divided into 2 groups of 50 patients and were matched for age and gender. In one group, a low dose of acetaminophen injection plus morphine was administered to the patients. The other group received a full dose of morphine. Finally, pain intensity, possible complications, and the need for supplemental analgesic use in the two groups were compared. The location of the study was the emergency ward of the Imam Reza Teaching Hospital, Tabriz, Iran. The study duration was 12 months. From the beginning of June 2012 until the beginning of June 2013, the primary data collection and analysis of data was performed. A written informed consent was obtained from every patient before entering the study. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences (Ethics Committee Act No. 9243).</p><p>Patients diagnosed with renal colic were consecutively recruited into the study. Patients were placed into one of the two treatment groups using stratified block randomization method using balanced randomized blocks with variable size. To maintain a balance between the two treatment groups, patients were randomized according to gender and age. Random allocation software sequence listing was separately made in these groups. Allocation of each of the categories was concealed in opaced sealed envelopes. In addition, the code for each of the treatments was written on paper in the order in which they were created by the software, and was placed in a box. This was a blinded experiment; thus, a code was given to each of the treatment groups and the person who performed the randomization process was not involved in other steps of the study. The participants received envelopes containing the treatment code, in the order of entering the study and according to their age and gender, and based on that the medicine was injected. Thus, neither the patient nor the administrator of the drug had any information about the injection and codes were disclosed only after statistical analysis. To explore the 2-unit difference (based on the visual analog scale or VAS) between the two groups and considering the standard deviation (SD) of 2.5 units, the power of 95%, at least 35 patients in each group, is required.<xref rid="b13-AHJ-07-066" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Finally, 100 patients (50 in each group) were enrolled in the study. The inclusion criteria included diagnosis of renal colic by ultrasound or abdominal radiography, and age of 18-50 years. Exclusion criteria included receiving any analgesic treatment before admission, allergies to medications, history of opioid dependency, high blood pressure, fever and chills, pregnancy, and intolerance of pain during the first 35 minutes of drug administration. In one group of patients, intravenous acetaminophen (apotel 1 g) plus a low dose of morphine was injected. The second group received 5 mg of morphine injected intravenously (total dose of morphine). Using a visual analogue scale (VAS) &#x000fd;, the intensity of pain (pain scale of 10 units; 0 = no pain, 10 = maximum pain level) was measured at 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 25, and 35 min after intravenous injection of the drugs. Patients who were unable to tolerate the pain within 35 minutes after administration of intravenous drugs were excluded from the study and were treated with common narcotic drugs. Data from the study were analyzed and compared using descriptive statistics (frequency, percentage, mean &#x000b1; SD).</p><p>Moreover, the mean difference test, and chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were used for quantitative and qualitative variables, respectively. A repeated measure ANOVA was used to compare pain intensity between the two groups at specific time intervals. All statistical analyzes were performed using SPSS software (version 16, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="result"><title>Results</title><p>The mean age of the patients receiving apotel plus a low dose of morphine was 40.58 &#x000b1; 13.45 (range: 19 to 50) years. The mean age of patients receiving full dose of morphine was 38.62 &#x000b1; 10.35 (range: 20 to 50) years. Based on the results of Student's independent t-test, the mean age of patients was not significantly different between the groups (P = 0.42). In the group receiving apotel plus a low dose of morphine, 36 patients (72%) were male and 14 (28%) were female. In the group receiving a full dose of morphine, 38 patients (76%) were male and 12 (24%) were female. Based on the results of chi-square test, the two groups showed no statistically significant difference regarding gender (P = 0.65).</p><p>Visual analogue pain scale, at different levels in the two groups is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-AHJ-07-066">table 1</xref>.

Intravenous acetaminophen was first introduced in 80 countries and was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the USA in 2010.<xref rid="b15-AHJ-07-066" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Recently, the use of this form of medication to relieve pain and fever in different conditions has been studied. For example, the efficacy of the intravenous form of acetaminophen and its ability to reduce the dose of intravenous morphine for pain relief of traumatic limb,<xref rid="b16-AHJ-07-066" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> environmental damage pain,<xref rid="b17-AHJ-07-066" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and pain after tooth extraction,<xref rid="b11-AHJ-07-066" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b18-AHJ-07-066" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> orthopedic joint replacement of the hip or knee,<xref rid="b19-AHJ-07-066" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and heart surgery<xref rid="b20-AHJ-07-066" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> were mainly studied.</p><p>However, studies on the effect of this drug on patients with renal colic are very few. In the first study in this area, Bektas et al. studied 146 patients with renal colic admitted to the emergency ward of a hospital in Turkey.<xref rid="b13-AHJ-07-066" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The patients were divided into 3 groups: 46 patients receiving a single dose of intravenous paracetamol (1 g), 49 patients receiving intravenous morphine (1 mg weight per kg body weight), and 51 patients receiving placebo. In this study, the mean reduction in pain based on the VAS during the 30 minutes after injection in the intravenous paracetamol group was 43 mm and in the group receiving morphine was 40 mm. Although both drugs, compared with placebo in reducing pain of the patients after 30 minutes, were more successful than placebo, no statistically significant differences were reported between the two groups of paracetamol and morphine in this regard. The study also found that the need for analgesic drugs after 30 minutes in both groups was similar; 45% in the paracetamol group versus 49% in the morphine group and 67% in the placebo group.<xref rid="b13-AHJ-07-066" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>In the current study, however, pain reduction, based on VAS over time, was significant in both groups, but no significant differences were found between the two groups. On the other hand, the need for analgesic drugs after 30 minutes, in both groups showed no statistically significant difference (36% in the acetaminophen plus morphine group versus 40% in full dose of morphine group P = 0.68).</p><p>In a similar study, Serinken et al. reported the same results. In this study, the first group (n = 83) received a single dose of intravenous paracetamol (1 g), while the second group received a dose of 0.1 mg of morphine injection based on body weight per kg (n = 35). The mean reduction of pain at 30 minutes, based on the VAS, in the first group was 63.7 mm and in the second group 56.6 mm, which were significantly different. Furthermore, the need for analgesic drugs 30 minutes after administration of the drug were similar in both groups.<xref rid="b14-AHJ-07-066" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Based on the results of these studies and the present study, intravenous acetaminophen was similar to a full dose of intravenous morphine in terms of reduction of renal colic pain. This reveals the clinical importance and effectiveness of this medication. Due to the similarity of intravenous acetaminophen and morphine in terms of clinical efficacy in reducing pain, it appears that one of the factors in clinical decision making is its side effects and frequency.</p><p>In the study by Bektas et al., at least one complication was reported in 24% of patients receiving paracetamol and 33% receiving morphine. No statistically significant difference was observed in this respect. Nausea and vomiting, headache, dry mouth, and other complications were reported in 15, 2, 7, and 9 percent of the patients receiving paracetamol, respectively. These cases in the group receiving morphine were 18, 2, 8, and 20 percent, respectively. In addition, 2% of patients in the group receiving morphine reported cases of urinary retention. The rate of complications were similar in the two groups.<xref rid="b13-AHJ-07-066" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>In the present study, nausea and vomiting, headache, dry mouth, and at least one complication were reported in 26, 6, 8, and 38 percent of the cases in the group receiving acetaminophen plus a low dose of morphine, respectively. Furthermore, in the group receiving a total dose of morphine they were reported in 32, 2, 8, and 44 percent of cases, respectively. The frequency percentage of the cases in the two groups was not statistically significant. In the study by Serinken et al., complications related to the treatments were observed in 5.3% of the cases in the paracetamol group and in 14.3% of the cases in the morphine group, which were statistically similar.<xref rid="b14-AHJ-07-066" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>The results in this area show that although the frequency percentage of complications associated with the treatment in intravenous acetaminophen group was apparently lower than that of the morphine group, this difference was not statistically significant. These results emphasize the safety of this drug in patients with renal colic. Based on the results on the effectiveness of intravenous acetaminophen in reducing renal colic pain and its safety, it appears that the third factor that can influence clinical decision making is the cost. Although this was not compared in this study or previous studies, earlier studies have shown that the benefits of intravenous acetaminophen pharmacokinetics compared to similar analgesics, such as no steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids, justify the higher costs.<xref rid="b21-AHJ-07-066" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>However, for a direct comparison and better valuation, further studies are necessary. The current study compared the combination of intravenous acetaminophen and low doses of morphine in patients with renal colic to the effect of high doses of morphine. Thus, the role of this drug in reducing the dose of morphine was emphasized. The role of lowering the dose of morphine by intravenous acetaminophen in surgical patients was also emphasized.<xref rid="b22-AHJ-07-066" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b23-AHJ-07-066" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> However, the current study was the first in this field on patients with renal colic; therefore, more clinical trials can help in obtaining definite results and correct clinical decision making.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Changes in pain intensity (based on a numerical visual scale) and incidence of complications in patients with renal colic treated with intravenous acetaminophen plus low doses of morphine, and total doses of morphine did not have a significant difference.
