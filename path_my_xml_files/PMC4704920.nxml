The percentages of relapse are between 95% for the cold turkey method and 75% for combined therapies of counseling and pharmacotherapy [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A systematic review of the effectiveness of smoking relapse prevention [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] indicates that the most effective long-term methods in preventing relapses are self-help materials. Different types of pharmacotherapy showed varied results from short-term to long-term effectiveness and behavioral interventions for relapse prevention appeared effective in the short-term only. The skills approach to behavioral intervention has been widely studied as a method with promising results [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Nevertheless, there is no strong evidence to support any specific behavioral intervention as being most helpful to avoid relapses after quitting smoking and there is little research available regarding other behavioral approaches [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The latest efforts to develop a taxonomy of behavior change techniques, used in interventions in general [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and more specificly in smoking cessation interventions [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], are expected to help develop stronger evidence in future research in this field.</p><p>Exercise has recently been incorporated as a smoking cessation aid into existing programs with promising results. In general, studies examining the effects of exercise on variables related to smoking cessation have focused on either the long-term effects after long interventions or on the acute effects of exercise on smoking-related variables. A recent review [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] of exercise interventions for smoking cessation revealed mixed results. The heterogeneity of the studies reviewed did not allow credible conclusions to be drawn. They focused more on studies that provided data for long-term effects (ie, follow-up data collection at more than 6 months). Within that focus, they identified 15 trials, 3 of which showed significantly higher abstinence rates in a physically active group versus a control group at the end of treatment [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. One of the studies also showed a significant benefit for exercise versus control on abstinence at the 3-month follow-up and a benefit for exercise at the 12-month follow-up [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The main reason for relapsing is the craving that smokers experience. Results on the effects of exercise on smoking-related variables have provided strong evidence that physical activity acutely reduces cigarette craving [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Fourteen reviewed studies that compared a bout of exercise with a passive condition or compared 2 intensities of exercise concluded that even relatively small doses of exercise should be recommended as an aid to managing cigarette cravings and withdrawal symptoms [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The results of 12 reviewed studies were similar, showing that cigarette craving was reduced following exercise with a wide range of intensities, from isometric exercise and yoga to activities with heart rates as high as 80%-85% [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Using individual participants&#x02019; data from 17 studies, participants&#x02019; engagement in physical activity was compared to that of control group participants. The results showed that the effects of all primary studies were in the same direction, with physical activity groups showing a greater reduction in cravings compared with controls, implying strong evidence that physical activity acutely reduces cigarette craving [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Evidence of the positive effects of exercise on acute reduction of cravings from experimental laboratory-based studies is strong [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], but findings are limited by a lack of long follow-up and artificial settings. Therefore, there is a need to start experimenting with interventions in real-life situations. One effort in this direction is a recent study that used a lab-based scenario with high ecological validity to show that an acute bout of exercise can reduce cravings following concurrent stressors [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Similar attempts to collect data from real life for smoking and exercise behavior using ecological momentary assessment methods (EMAs) have also been observed in the recent literature [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, the investigation of the effects of short bouts of exercise as a means to acutely manage cravings in real life and the long-term effects of this method on relapse rates has not yet been the focus of any study. Our approach is similar to EMA methods in that it offers real-time data, but it differs in that entries are self-initiated and in how the app also acts as an intervention by offering suggestions to overcome craving and supportive motivation messages. The growing use of mobile technology may provide some valuable tools to move from explanatory randomized control trials that test the acute efficacy of exercise on abstinent smokers under highly controlled conditions to pragmatic randomized control trials that test the acute effectiveness of exercise on quitters under real-life conditions.</p><p>Mobile technologies are a means for providing individual-level support to health care users and a promising platform for health interventions [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Behavioral intervention technologies offer promising opportunities to expand psychological practice [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Several mobile health interventions have been designed to increase healthy behavior (eg, to promote smoking cessation or increase activity levels) and are also cost effective [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A review of mobile phone-based interventions for smoking cessation revealed only 4 trials: 2 using SMS text messages and 2 using the Internet and mobile phones. The trials were heterogeneous. However, when the data from both programs were pooled, they found statistically significant increases in both short- and long-term self-reported quitting [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A more recent systematic review [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] concluded that SMS-based smoking cessation interventions more than doubled biochemically verified smoking cessation at 6 months. Moreover, the self-help methods have been indicated in previous literature as effective for long-term effects [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and the use of mobile phone applications as a self-help method sounds promising.</p><p>Therefore, a mobile phone application has been developed for the needs of this study. The aim of the app is to support quitters in managing their cigarette cravings and abstaining over the long term by using exercise as the main behavioral substitution strategy. The mHealth app called &#x0201c;Physical over Smoking (Ph.o.S)&#x0201d; includes a data collection mechanism to collect real-time data regarding relapses. The Ph.o.S app was developed based on evidence-based practices for relapse prevention after smoking cessation. Following that, a trial has been designed to test the effectiveness of the mHealth app.</p><sec><title>Trial Aim</title><p>The aim of this study is to present the protocol of a study that assesses the effectiveness of the Ph.o.S app, which helps abstaining users to manage their cigarette cravings. The study will examine the quit rates of abstaining users of the app versus the quit rates of a comparator group for a 6-month period after quitting smoking. The trial&#x02019;s main hypothesis is that users of the Ph.o.S app will have higher 7-day point prevalence abstinence rates during the follow-up measures in comparison to the comparator group (trial registration number ISRCTN55259451).</p><p>Four additional hypotheses have been proposed:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Users of the Ph.o.S app will have fewer self-reported relapses during the follow-up measures than the comparator group will.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Users of the Ph.o.S app will report higher self-efficacy from being aware of experiencing cravings than the comparator group will.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Users of the Ph.o.S app will report higher self-efficacy in managing cravings in relapse situations than the comparator group will.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Users of the Ph.o.S app will report a higher power of control to manage cravings in everyday situations than the comparator group will.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Trial Design</title><p>This study is a 2-armed randomized clinical trial. Participants identified as eligible and who give their consent to participate will receive a smoking cessation program consisting of 3 group sessions (once per week). After the quit day, participants will be randomly assigned to 2 groups. Both groups will have a separate fourth session where they will receive training on relapse prevention and a plan to cope with cravings. The intervention group will receive an additional short training session on how to use the Ph.o.S app as an additional support tool whenever they experience cravings in their everyday life during the follow-up period. Preintervention, postintervention, and 6-month follow-up assessments will be conducted. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> displays an overview of the study&#x02019;s timeline and the schedule of enrollment, interventions, and assessments. <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Multimedia Appendix 1</xref> displays the detailed measurement time points for each group.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Study timeline: overview of schedule of enrollment, interventions, and assessments.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" width="614" border="0" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0"><col width="89" span="1"/><col width="75" span="1"/><col width="94" span="1"/><col width="73" span="1"/><col width="109" span="1"/><col width="90" span="1"/><thead><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Timeline points</td><td colspan="5" rowspan="1">Schedule</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">

Noneligible participants are advised to contact their doctor or nurse for help. Participants are adults (between the ages of 18 and 65) who have been smokers for at least 1 year and who smoke more than 10 cigarettes per day. (Those who use snus only are excluded.) They should have no other addictions (ie, alcohol, prescription drugs, or illegal drugs) according to the behavioral screening tool NIDA Quick Screen V1.0 [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Eligible participants should be addicted to nicotine, with a score of more than 4 out of 10 on the Tobacco Dependence Screener (TDS) [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. TDS is a 10-item self-report questionnaire, and it generates a continuous dependence score. It demonstrates acceptable reliability in different samples as well as validity because it has a high association with smoking heaviness measures (eg, number of cigarettes smoked per day, carbon monoxide levels) and years of smoking [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>-<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Participants should have a strong motivation to quit and score more than 3 out of 7 on the Motivation to Stop Smoking Scale (MTSS) [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The MTSS is a single-item scale assessing an individual&#x02019;s motivation to quit smoking, combining aspects of desire and intention to quit. Scores range from 1 (I don&#x02019;t want to stop smoking) to 7 (I really want to stop smoking and intend to in the next month).

All interested participants will be screened for eligibility. The enrollment period ended in May 2015. The first 50 eligible participants will start the smoking cessation intervention, which consists of 3 weekly counseling sessions and will help them set a quit date. The rest of the eligible participants will be put on a waiting list and invited to participate in case of dropouts before the quit day/randomization time point. The first 50 participants to reach the quit day/randomization time point will then form the intention-to-treat group that will continue in the study. After the quit day/randomization, participants will be assigned to an experimental group (25 participants) and a comparator group (25 participants), and both groups will separately have 1 more counseling session on how to manage cravings. In this fourth session, the only difference in treatment between the groups is that the experimental group will have an extra 10-15 minutes of guidance on how to use the Ph.o.S app to manage cravings during the follow-up period. Both groups will be followed up for the main and secondary efficacy outcomes of interest for 6 months. The method of randomization is a set of numbers generated by online software [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The principal investigator will generate the allocation sequence and the study nurse will assign participants to the groups.

During the first session, baseline data are collected and then a group or individual motivational interview session takes place for about an hour, aiming to motivate participants to take further responsibility for making important health-related behavior changes (ie, to gradually decrease smoking and be more physically active). During the second session, participants discuss the barriers for behavior change and they brainstorm facilitators to apply. In the third session they set specific goals and make plans for behavior change. In this meeting, participants also set a quit day and they get training on the use of pedometers.

Additional support for the development was provided for graphic design and user interface design by 2 students from the IT department. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> presents examples of the database contents by category (eg, introductory messages, physical activities, and motivational messages). The database contents are based on the relapse prevention model [<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and the behavior change techniques for smoking cessation via text-messaging intervention [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].

For example, the principles of tailoring [<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], personalization, suggestion, praise, trustworthiness, and expertise have been used in the design of the application. The application database includes a pool of 57 introductory messages, 49 motivational messages, and 64 physical activities, all of which are coded to appear according to the users&#x02019; profile and status. Introductory and motivational messages were reviewed by 3 experts on health and exercise psychology and physical activities by 2 experts on sport and exercise science. <xref ref-type="app" rid="app4">Multimedia Appendix 4</xref> includes examples of screenshots of the sequence from a sample usage session.</p><p>During the fourth session, experimental group participants are instructed to use the application whenever they experience cigarette cravings and to give feedback for every use. As a result, data entries are self-initiated whenever participants use the app. The Ph.o.S. app is installed on participants&#x02019; personal mobile phones, but if they do not have a mobile phone, then a device is provided by the study team. No incentives are provided to use the app or to complete data during the entire follow-up assessment period. When they need to, participants can use the app without an Internet connection. All information is uploaded to the server as soon as the device is connected. Participants&#x02019; identification number and profile settings are entered when the Ph.o.S app is installed on their mobile phones and used for the first time. Profile settings include gender, age, weight, and height, days since quit date, the origin of the decision to quit, and heavy and moderate intensity physical activity history during a typical week (screenshot 1, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app4">Multimedia Appendix 4</xref>). After that, every time a user experiences a craving situation, specific information regarding mood (eg, positive, neutral, negative), place (eg, home, at work, outdoors), and social environment (eg, alone, not alone) are requested (screenshot 2, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app4">Multimedia Appendix 4</xref>). According to users&#x02019; profile information and the situational status, a variety of animated physical activities, matched with introductory and motivational messages, are suggested. Physical activities were animated to model/demonstrate the suggested activities in a visual form (screenshot 3, see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app4">Multimedia Appendix 4</xref>). Each time the participant uses the app, he or she is asked to provide feedback on the effectiveness of the app to manage the craving.

The questionnaire consists of a short overview of the aim of the study and questions regarding the person&#x02019;s addictions, quitting history, willingness to quit, general health, and readiness for physical activity. The website used to assess eligible participants is a safe and secure site called Fluid Surveys. People who are eligible, based on the online assessment, receive a follow-up telephone call from the study nurse to verify eligibility and will be invited to come to the health center to complete the consent to participate and the baseline measures.</p><p>Baseline data and behavioral and psychological self-reported data at time points -<italic>t</italic>

In addition, data from the phone app users (experimental group only) will be collected during the follow-up period. Users&#x02019; phone data will be uploaded daily to a secure university server reserved for this purpose.</p><p>Once participants have participated in the final meeting, the researchers will make every reasonable effort to follow the participant for the entire follow-up period of 6 months. Participants may, however, withdraw from the study for any reason at any time. However, early discontinuation of Ph.o.S app for any reason is not a reason for exclusion from the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Management</title><p>The University of Jyv&#x000e4;skyl&#x000e4; is responsible for storing and protecting the research data. The research registry is kept at the University of Jyv&#x000e4;skyl&#x000e4; in a locked cabinet. All electronic data will be stored on a university computer with password protection. Only the principal investigator and the research assistant will have access to the computer-based data. All participants will be assigned a code number in order to protect their confidentiality. All stored data will be under the unique code number. All data will be entered electronically. Original study forms will be entered and kept on file at the participating site. Participant files are stored in numerical order and in a secure and accessible place and manner. Participant files will be stored for a period of 3 years after completion of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>Generalized linear mixed models will be used to examine differences between the groups on the dichotomous primary outcome variable: abstinent versus smoker status at the 6-month follow-up time point (ie, <italic>t</italic>
<sub>8</sub>). The differences at all follow-up time points will also be examined, but the 6-month follow-up is considered to be the primary focus. Descriptive statistics will be used to report process data. Any covariates identified in the preliminary analyses will be added to the model. Linear mixed models will be used to analyze the secondary efficacy measures for data that are normally distributed or are approximate to a normal distribution (via data transformations). For count variables, a generalized Poisson mixed model will be applied. Alternatively, we will use nonparametric tests by time point separately.</p><p>Finally, 3 separate logistic regressions on the primary dichotomous outcome (abstinent-smoker) will be performed using the theory of planned behavior (TPB) constructs of quit smoking behavior and increased physical activity behavior at the -<italic>t</italic>
<sub>2</sub> time point and the TPB constructs of manage cravings behavior at the <italic>t</italic>
<sub>1</sub> time point as predictors. Linear regressions for the continuous variables of the secondary efficacy outcomes will be used to test the predictive ability of all TPB constructs. All analyses will be conducted using intent-to-treat principles with participants remaining in their originally assigned groups after randomization regardless of adherence or protocol deviation. This is done to increase the likelihood that group differences are due to the intervention and unaffected by biases that lead to an overestimation of the intervention effect [<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Power</title><p>We determined the power for our primary hypothesis, which stated that the 7-day PPA at the 6-month follow-up would be higher in the experimental group than in the comparator group. In order to detect a difference of 10% in quit rates between the experimental and comparator groups, with an expected quit rate of 25% in the comparator group, the study would require, at 80% power with a two-sided <italic>p</italic> value of 0.05, a sample size of 326 participants. Given the budget and time limitations as well as the location (eg, a small city in a sparsely populated area, which makes recruitment a challenge), a sample size of 50 has been set by the research group as a more realistic number when taking into account the available resources. Given the sample size of 50 participants equally assigned to the groups, we calculated the smallest PPA that we could detect with power greater than 0.80. Assuming that the abstinence in the comparator group will be 25% [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], power analysis through online calculations [<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] indicate that we will be able to detect a significant difference between the experimental and comparator groups with power greater than 0.80 if the PPA in the experimental group is 59% or higher. The percentage of 59% required to obtain statistical power is considered to be very high. At the end of the study we will re-estimate the power of the final percentage differences between groups in the effectiveness report, depending on the exact final sample size as well. Nevertheless, the sample size is considered as an a priori limitation to the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and Dissemination</title><p>Ethics approval has been obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Central Finland Health Care District (Keski-Suomen Sairaanhoitopiirin Eettinen Toimikunta).</p></sec><sec><title>Consent</title><p>All eligible participants are given a copy of the information sheet and informed consent form to read. The information sheet provides a summary of the research study and the informed consent document states what the individual is about to participate in, the individual&#x02019;s rights as a research participant, and information about confidentiality. The study nurse explains all aspects of the study and answers all of the participant&#x02019;s questions regarding the study. If the person chooses to participate in the study, that person will be asked to sign the informed consent form. No study procedure is performed prior to signing the informed consent form. Subjects who refuse to participate or who withdraw from the study are treated without prejudice. The reason for refusal or withdrawal will be noted on the form if reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Confidentiality</title><p>All study-related information will be stored securely at the study site under a coded identification number in order to maintain participant confidentiality. All records that contain names or other personal identifiers, such as screening data for eligibility and informed consent forms, will be stored separately from study records identified by code number. All local databases are secured with password-protected access systems. Forms, lists, logbooks, appointment books, and any other listings that link participant identification numbers to other identifying information will be stored in a separate, locked file in an area with limited access. Participants&#x02019; study information will not be disclosed to third parties.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial and its findings will contribute to the evidence available to inform the development and delivery of relapse prevention on smoking cessation treatment. The primary objective of the study is to contribute to the literature calling for the development of mHealth applications that support individuals in remaining abstinent after they quit smoking. The overall implementation of the project can have an impact on participants&#x02019; motivation to initiate and adhere to physical activity. Increasing physical activity can reduce health-risk factors and improve self-esteem as well as quality of life. The use of the Ph.o.S app is not restricted to any specific place, time, situation, or quitting method and it is free to use. It can also contribute to the reduction of health care costs. In addition to the impact on public health, the project will have a significant contribution to future research on how physical activity affects cigarette cravings in real-life situations and will offer the potential to improve the understanding of the mechanisms that underlie these effects. Nevertheless, the relatively small sample size due to time and budget limitations, as well as the recruitment and engagement difficulties that are common with smokers in clinical trials [<xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], is a threat to the power of the trial.</p><sec><title>Trial Status</title><p>Recruitment for this project commenced in December 2014 and proceeded until May 2015.
