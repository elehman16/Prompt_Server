Patients with irresectable pancreatic cancer (n = 16) were treated with either ibuprofen (1200 mg day-1 for 7 days (n = 10) or placebo (n = 6). A group of 17 age-related non-cancer subjects were also studied. Indirect calorimetry, anthropometry, multifrequency bioelectrical impedence analysis and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) estimation were performed immediately before and after treatment. Before treatment, total REE was significantly elevated in the pancreatic cancer patients compared with healthy controls (1499 +/- 71 vs 1377 +/- 58 kcal) (P &#x0003c; 0.02). Following treatment the mean REE of the ibuprofen group fell significantly (1386 +/- 89 kcal) compared with pretreatment values (1468 +/- 99 kcal) (P &#x0003c; 0.02), whereas no change was observed in the placebo group. Serum CRP concentration was also reduced in the ibuprofen-treated group (pre-ibuprofen, 51 mg l-1; post-ibuprofen, 29 mg l-1; P &#x0003c; 0.05). These results suggest that ibuprofen may have a role in abrogating the catabolic processes which contribute to weight loss in patients with pancreatic cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00041-0189.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="185" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00041-0190.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="186" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00041-0191.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="187" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00041-0192.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="188" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
