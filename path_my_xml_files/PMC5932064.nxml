Complicated zygomaticomaxillary complex fracture, known as one of the most challenging facial bone fractures, is often hard to achieve an accurate reduction, thus leading to facial deformity. In this study, twenty patients with unilateral complicated zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures were included and randomly divided into experimental and control groups, which is with and without the aid of surgical navigation, respectively. The pre- and postoperative imaging data were collected and then analysed using Geomagic Studio 11 software and Brainlab iPlan CMF 3.0. A more precise reduction was showed in the experimental group according to the measurement results of both software programmes than in the control group. In conclusion, surgical navigation showed great value in performing accurate reductions of complicated zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures and restoring facial contour.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The face occupies the most prominent position in the human body, rendering it vulnerable to injuries quite commonly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Among facial fractures, the zygomaticomaxillary complex fracture is one of the most frequently occurring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Patients suffering from zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures always present deformity because the zygomaticomaxillary complex strongly contributes to midfacial width and protrusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Hence, accurate reductions of zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures play a vital role in re-gaining satisfactory facial contour<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. For invert fractures, open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) should be considered as the main and reliable option for restoring appearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. However, fractures are quite difficult to handle, especially in cases of complicated zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures. Complicated zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures refer to comminuted fractures, fractures with delayed surgery and/or bone defects of the zygomaticomaxillary complex. Lacking available landmarks for anatomical reduction, surgeons handle the fractured fragments mainly according to their own clinical experience, thus frequently resulting in unsatisfactory outcomes of over- or under-reduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Failure of anatomical reduction will cause the incorrect width and protrusion of zygoma and asymmetry of midface, and may lead to poor self-esteem and health problems related to poor quality-of-life. Therefore, an accurate reduction is the key to the treatment of complicated zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">With the rapid development of computer technology, surgical navigation has gradually become a new supportive tool for diagnosis, operation planning and treatment in medicine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. For synchronization of real-time actual surgical anatomy with the imaging of the patient&#x02019;s anatomy previously obtained by CT imaging, surgical navigation was first used in neurosurgery and has gained rapid progress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.

Once zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures occur, midfacial deformities are mostly involved. Therefore, the primary treatment objective of zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures is restoration of the facial contour, and the key to treatment is the reduction accuracy. However, reduction is still greatly dependent at present on the preference and experience of surgeons, make it hard for beginning and inexperienced surgeons to achieve anatomic reductions. Once complicated zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures occur, accurate reduction will be a daunting challenge even for experienced surgeons. Thus, complicated zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures are always regarded as one of the most challenging facial bone fractures to treat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par10">Surgical navigation provides new ideas and means to help solve this problem. Previous studies reported that surgical navigation was used to assist in treating zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Carsten Westendorff <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> conducted a non-comparative pilot study of five patients with severely displaced orbitozygomatic fractures. All patients in the study were treated with surgical navigation and got satisfactory results. Akihiro Ogino <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> showed that surgical navigation assisted in improving accuracy of the reduction and achieving recovery of the profile after treating six patients with zygomatic fractures. But to date, most of the studies were case reports or clinical experience lacking multiple variables and randomized controlled design, which makes the effects of treatment less persuasive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Whether surgical navigation really improves the accuracy of reductions in the treatment of complicated zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures remains controversial. Some scholars think surgical navigation is an effective aided tool, while others think it is just an expensive toy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Therefore, we conducted this randomized controlled clinical trial and twenty patients were randomly assigned to the experimental group and the control group to make an objective assessment of the effects of the surgical navigation technique.</p><p id="Par11">To make the results more objective and valid, two software programmes were applied to evaluate the value of the surgical navigation technique in the reduction and fixation of unilateral complicated zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures. The results of the mean values of AD measured by the Geomagic Studio 11 software in two groups were, respectively, 0.59 (0.74&#x02013;1.58) mm and 1.23 (1.94&#x02013;2.56) mm. The AD in the experimental group was significantly lower than in the control group. And the mean values of surgical deviations measured by the Brainlab iPlan CMF 3.0 software in the two groups were, respectively, landmark oz (0.69&#x02009;mm vs 1.22&#x02009;mm) and landmark ztl (0.87&#x02009;mm vs 1.57&#x02009;mm). The mean value of surgical deviations of the landmark oz and ztl was lower in the experimental group. The above results indicated that surgical navigation could assist with achieving better accuracy. Surgical navigation can assist the accurate locations of the surgical instruments and the surrounding anatomic structure in real-time, can guide to complete reductions and can check visually whether the position of the moved segments is desired, which makes the surgery precise, minimal and less invasive.</p><p id="Par12">For the evaluation of treatment outcomes of the complicated zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures, there have been no standardized methods. At present, the following methods are commonly used: (1) The patients&#x02019; feedback. In general, if the clinical symptoms caused by the fractures completely resolve or partially resolve after surgery, patients will think that they achieve satisfactory results. Although the patients&#x02019; feedback is a critical aspect, it is relatively subjective. (2) The clinical and imaging examinations. They are relatively reliable but are also affected by the subjective impression of surgeons. (3) Measurement and analysis of imaging data. It&#x02019;s an objective method as it evaluates the treatment outcomes by the exact measurement of imaging data. In this study, all the above methods were applied to evaluate the accuracy of reductions. The third method is the most important while the first two methods are relatively unreliable. Moreover, in the future projects, we will quantify clinical observation outcomes, such as the evaluation of function and soft tissue symmetry, to demonstrate the clinical significance objectively.</p><p id="Par13">The accuracy of surgical navigation is influenced by various errors, including image conversion, software and hardware products, data registration, and intraoperative procedure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Based on our experience, here are some tips to increase the odds of success in the use of surgical navigation.</p><p id="Par14">The first tip is the establishment of the reference plane through the midline. According to previous studies, there has been no standardized guide to establish the reference plane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Marmary <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> and Forsberg <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the midline is based on the neural foramen at the bottom of the skull. Akihiro Ogino <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> reported that the midline is based on the anterior and posterior nasal processes and on the centre of the left and right external acoustic foramens. In this study, we referred to the guide proposed by Feng <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. For those patients with condylar fractures, the reference plane is a sagittal plane through the comb, according to Shen <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The last and perhaps the most important step in the preoperative plan is to adjust the mirrored image. Because the facial bony contour of any given individual is not perfectly symmetrical, mirrored images must be manually adjusted to fit as precisely as possible to the fixed anatomic landmarks, such as the petrous apex of the temporal bone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par15">The second tip is the firm installation of the navigation reference frame. The reference frame with 3 light-reflecting balls was fixed with a titanium screw to the patient&#x02019;s skull, realizing the patient-to-image registration. Once the position of reference frame changes, re-registration is necessary throughout the procedure. Thus, the firm installation of the navigation reference frame must be guaranteed, with any moving or loosening avoided.</p><p id="Par16">The third tip is an accurate registration. Accurate registration is crucial as it has a direct effect on the precision of all subsequent outcomes of operation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Laser surface surgical navigation has been demonstrated to be sufficiently precise in previous studies and was used in this study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. With the guidance of surgical navigation, bilateral zygomatical facial regions were scanned in a figure &#x0201c;8&#x0201d; shape. Followed by multipoint verification, performed with a probe to ensure that the patient and operative tools were interconnected. To improve the accuracy, surgeons need to pay attention to the following things. Firstly, movable soft tissues can result in a significant registration error to the clinical precision of laser surface scanning. Therefore, the scanner should be vertical to the skin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> and the lateral canthus and nasal root, which is thin and undulating, should be selected to test. Secondly, eye ointment should be chosen to replace eye masks to avoid the distortion and displacement of soft tissue. Thirdly, orotracheal intubation should be chosen to get an undisturbed nasal appearance. Nine patients in the study underwent nasotracheal intubation in the experimental group. Last but not the least, preoperative plan and surgery should be performed as soon as possible after the imaging data of patients were collected to ensure the consistency of preoperative and intraoperative shape of the soft tissue. For patients with obvious swelling, delayed operation and detumescence treatment were sensible. Imaging data were regained after the swelling approximately subsided.</p><p id="Par17">The fourth tip is thorough verification of reduction. The zygomaticomaxillary complex is an irregular-shaped complex, and thus the verification of reduction based on only one or several points is obviously unpersuasive. In this study, a totally scan of the edges of the reduced fragments was performed by the probe and only when the path of probe coincided with the edges of the fragment in the desired position were considered as an accurate reduction.</p><p id="Par18">A concern of use of the navigation system is that surgical virtual plan and navigation process need additional time and cost. As we know, an additional 30&#x02009;minutes were needed at the beginning of the surgical procedure for installation and fixation of the navigation reference frame, registration process, and recalibration of anatomic landmarks. However, as the results showed, the average preoperative plan time was 48 (32 to 64) minutes vs 46.8 (34 to 64) minutes in the experimental and control groups, respectively. The average surgery time was 183.70 (153 to 229) minutes vs 179.00 (162 to 235) minutes in the experimental and control groups, respectively. There were no significant differences between the groups. We thought the time spent for navigation process during surgery to be more or less compensated by the time saved owing to better orientation and faster reduction. The additional cost for the use of surgical navigation was about 1,000 RMB. Taking treatment outcomes into account, we believe the additional time and cost were acceptable and deserved.</p><p id="Par19">Another concern is whether it causes potential complications of navigation or not. As we know, the application of navigation reference frame is invasive, which may lead to some additional complications, including infection, scarring, or intracranial injury. The results showed that there were no any additional complications related to temporary implantation of this device. Moreover, the scars were minor and invisible in all cases. So, the technology is safe and worthy recommended.</p><p id="Par20">To sum up, we provided evidence that the surgical navigation technique provides an intro-operational guide for surgeons in obtaining accurate reductions. Our findings suggested that the surgical navigation technique is valuable in performing accurate reduction of complicated zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures and restoring facial contour.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study design and sample</title><p id="Par21">To address the research purpose, the authors designed and conducted a randomized controlled clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03075384, March 8, 2017).

Considering the dropout and other reasons, the estimated sample size was expanded by 20%, so that the final sample size was 20 patients. Twenty patients were randomly divided into 2 groups according to a random number table, 10 in each group. Patients in the experimental group were treated with surgical navigation, while the control group was treated without it. All patients signed an informed consent document to participate in this study, and the patients who appeared in the figures provided full permission for their photographs and personal data to be used in medical publications, journals, textbooks, and electronic publications. The data collectors, data analysts and the surgeon were not aware of the allocation. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) unilateral complicated zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures, which includes type B with delayed surgery and/or bone defect (complete monofragment zygomatic/tetrapod fracture) or type C (multifragment or comminuted type B zygomatic fracture), as proposed by Zingg <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>; (2) conscious patients aged between 18 to 60 years; (3) no contraindications of operation in patients; (4) willing to participate in the study.

We regarded the centre point of the left and right condyle as points A and B, respectively. Point D was the midpoint between point A and B. The sagittal plane was defined as a reference plane through point D and was perpendicular to the line AB. For those patients with condylar fractures, the reference plane is a sagittal plane through the comb. According to the established symmetric plane, the affected side model was obtained by mirroring the healthy side. Then, the mirrored images were manually adjusted to fit the adjacent anatomical structures. The final preoperative virtual plan was collected and saved in digital imaging and communications in Standard Triangle Language (STL) format to help with intraoperative and postoperative analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Anaesthesia and maxilla-facial preparation</title><p id="Par25">After routine anaesthesia induction, orotracheal intubation was a preferred anaesthesia.

The surgical incisions used varied according to the different situations, including hemicoronary, subconjunctival, intraoral vestibule incision, facial scar, local incision or combined incision. Once the fracture sites were exposed, open reduction was performed. Then, the navigation probe was placed on the edges of the segments to precisely verify the reductions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). After the accurate reduction was verified, internal fixation was applied with titanium plates and screws.
