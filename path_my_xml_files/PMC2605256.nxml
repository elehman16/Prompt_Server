The effect of OPV at birth on overall child mortality was never studied. During a trial of vitamin A supplementation (VAS) at birth in Guinea-Bissau, OPV was not available during several periods. We took advantage of this &#x0201c;natural experiment&#x0201d; to test the effect on mortality of receiving OPV at birth.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology</title><p>Between 2002 and 2004, the VAS trial randomised normal-birth-weight infants to 50,000 IU VAS or placebo administered with BCG. Provision of OPV at birth was not part of the trial, but we noted whether the infants received OPV or not. OPV was missing during several periods in 2004. We used Cox proportional hazards models to compute mortality rate ratios (MRR) of children who had received or not received OPV at birth.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>A total of 962 (22.1&#x00025;) of the 4345 enrolled children did not receive OPV at birth; 179 children died within the first year of life. Missing OPV at birth was associated with a tendency for decreased mortality (adjusted MRR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.69 (95&#x00025; CI&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.46&#x02013;1.03)), the effect being similar among recipients of VAS and placebo. There was a highly significant interaction between OPV at birth and sex (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.006). Not receiving OPV at birth was associated with a weak tendency for increased mortality in girls (1.14 (0.70&#x02013;1.89)) but significantly decreased mortality in boys (0.35 (0.18&#x02013;0.71)).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In our study OPV at birth had a sex-differential effect on mortality. Poliovirus is almost eradicated and OPV at birth contributes little to herd immunity. A randomised study of the effect of OPV at birth on overall mortality in both sexes is warranted.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In low-income countries, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends oral polio vaccine (OPV) at birth and in 3 doses together with diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccines at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age <xref rid="pone.0004056-Immunization1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Furthermore, OPV has been delivered in campaigns to children aged 6 months to 5 years of age as part of the attempt to eradicate polio infection. The policy to provide OPV at birth was introduced more than 20 years ago to increase the coverage for OPV <xref rid="pone.0004056-Expanded1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. OPV at birth might also be associated with increased antibody titres <xref rid="pone.0004056-Weckx1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004056-Khare1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, the effect of OPV at birth on overall child mortality was never studied.</p><p>Routine vaccinations in childhood may have non-specific and sex-differential effects on overall mortality <xref rid="pone.0004056-Aaby1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0004056-Aaby3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The effects are large and may strongly influence overall mortality and seriously distort female- male mortality ratios in high-mortality settings. Our previous work has concentrated on measles vaccine (MV) and BCG vaccine, which are associated with decreased overall mortality and decreased female-male mortality ratios <xref rid="pone.0004056-Aaby1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004056-Roth1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, and DTP vaccine, which has been associated with increased female-male mortality ratios <xref rid="pone.0004056-Aaby2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004056-Aaby3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Furthermore, we also conducted one study of an OPV campaign; receiving OPV in the campaign compared with not receiving OPV was associated with significantly decreased mortality among the youngest children <xref rid="pone.0004056-Aaby4" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. At the national hospital in Guinea-Bissau, following periods with DTP being unavailable, patients having received OPV only and no DTP had significantly lower in-hospital mortality than patients having received both the recommended DTP and OPV <xref rid="pone.0004056-Aaby5" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The results suggest that OPV might also have non-specific beneficial effects on mortality.</p><p>We recently conducted a large vitamin A supplementation trial in Guinea-Bissau. Children were randomised to 50,000 IU vitamin A or placebo when they received BCG after delivery <xref rid="pone.0004056-Benn1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Hence, all children received BCG at enrolment. All children should also receive OPV according to current recommendations. However, during the last year of the trial the national immunization programme experienced several periods during which OPV was not available. We took advantage of this &#x0201c;natural experiment&#x0201d; to test the effect of receiving OPV at birth on infant mortality. Our <italic>a priori</italic> hypothesis was that not receiving OPV at birth would increase mortality, particularly for girls.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Setting</title><p>The Bandim Health Project (BHP) has a demographic surveillance system (DSS) which covers approximately 90,000 inhabitants in six suburban districts of the capital of Guinea-Bissau. All houses are visited monthly to register new pregnancies and births. Children are followed with home visits every third month to register vaccinations, infections, hospitalisations, feeding patterns and survival. The study area is economically poor. Most people live in multi-family mud-brick houses with zinc or straw roofs. More than 60&#x00025; have no electric installations in the house. Around 30&#x00025; of the mothers in the present trial had no education. During the trial, the prevalence of HIV-1 was around 5&#x00025; in the study area among women of fertile age <xref rid="pone.0004056-daSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. A large proportion of pregnant women are screened for HIV to prevent vertical transmission. With the vertical-transmission control program ongoing, we expect less than 1&#x00025; of the children to be HIV-1 infected.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Vitamin A trial</title><sec id="s2b1"><title>Participants</title><p>As described in detail elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0004056-Benn1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> the vitamin A trial took place from November 13, 2002 to November 28, 2004. It enrolled infants who came for the BCG vaccination recommended at birth. The inclusion criteria were weight &#x02265;2500 g at presentation for BCG vaccination and no signs of overt illness/malformations. It was not a criterion that the child should receive OPV at birth. Mothers giving birth at the maternity wards at the national hospital and the local health centre were offered BCG and enrolment immediately after the delivery. Mothers who delivered at home were invited to participate when they came for BCG at two of the three health centres in the study area. The third health centre in the study area was not enrolling children for logistic reasons. A total of 1181 (27&#x00025;) of the children came after the first week of life; their median age at enrolment was 16 days (10&#x02013;90 centiles&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;9&#x02013;64 days).</p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Details regarding the trial were explained to the mother by a trained assistant, who also asked the mother if she had any questions about the study. Oral consent was obtained. Written consent was obtained if the mother knew how to write her own name. If not, a statement that she had understood the information given and agreed to participate was signed by the assistant. The mother drew a lot from an envelope prepared by the study supervisor. Each envelope contained 100 lots, 50 marked &#x0201c;1&#x0201d;, and 50 marked &#x0201c;2&#x0201d;, indicating from which of two numbered bottles, &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;2&#x0201d;, the child should receive its supplement. Hence, half of the children received 50,000 IU vitamin A as retinyl palmitate and 20 IU vitamin E in &#x000bd; ml vegetable oil, the other half received only 20 IU vitamin E in &#x000bd; ml vegetable oil. The code was only opened when all children had reached 12 months of age.</p></sec><sec id="s2b3"><title>Outcomes examined</title><p>All children were followed through the DSS every third month and were visited by a special team at 12 months of age. Deaths were registered at each visit and followed by a verbal autopsy conducted by a trained local physician. The physician used a questionnaire designed by the INDEPTH network <xref rid="pone.0004056-httpwww.indepthnetwork.orgcoredocumentsdownloads.htm1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Based on the questionnaire a panel of three medical doctors, including at least one local doctor, all being ignorant of the randomisation group, reached consensus on the cause of death. If consensus could not be reached a fourth doctor was consulted. Deaths were categorised based on suggestions from the WHO <xref rid="pone.0004056-Anker1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. No death within the first year was due to accident. The BHP registers hospitalisations of children from the study area at the paediatric department of the nearby national hospital. By linking the trial database with the hospitalisation database we were able to identify trial children who had been hospitalised.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Current study</title><p>All trial infants were vaccinated intradermally in the upper left deltoid region with 0.05 ml BCG vaccine (Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark). The BHP provided BCG vaccine for the trial participants. According to recommendations all infants should also receive OPV at birth. OPV is administered orally. During the study three types of OPV were used in Guinea-Bissau, produced by Novartis, Sanofi Pasteur, and GlaxoSmithKline. All vaccines were supplied through the national immunization programme. However, OPV was missing during periods of the trial. Hence, the children who were BCG vaccinated during these periods would only receive BCG and not OPV. As part of our trial routines, we noted at the inclusion form whether the children received OPV or not. Based on the distribution of children who had not received OPV, OPV was missing at one or more inclusion sites 1) from the beginning of February 2004 to the beginning of June 2004, 2) briefly in late June 2004, and 3) from mid-October 2004 to the trial enrolment ended in November 2004 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004056-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Hence, all non-OPV recipients were enrolled in 2004. We tested the mortality levels among OPV recipients in 2002, 2003, and 2004. The mortality levels were the same during all three years (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.754). Furthermore, the female-male mortality rate ratio among OPV recipients was the same throughout the whole study period (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.799). Hence, we included all children in the analysis.</p><fig id="pone-0004056-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004056.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Percentage of enrolled children who received OPV at birth during a vitamin A trial from 2002&#x02013;2004 in Guinea-Bissau.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0004056.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We compared baseline characteristics of children who had or who had not received OPV at birth in a logistic regression analysis including all variables in order to identify important potential confounders, which could be adjusted for in subsequent analyses.</p><p>In the main analyses we studied the effect of <italic>not</italic> receiving OPV at birth on the following three outcomes: mortality, hospitalisation and risk of dying when hospitalised (hospital case-fatality).

Effect modification was analysed by investigating the homogeneity of the effect of OPV in the different categories of the suspected modifier using Wald test statistics. Hence, we obtained p-values for equal effect of receiving or not receiving OPV in different strata of a covariable. When addressing the effect of OPV according to birth weight and arm circumference, we restricted the analysis to children enrolled on day 0 and 1 (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2572) for whom information on birth characteristics was available and dichotomised the anthropometric measurements into the lowest quartile and the three highest quartiles.</p><p>Test for proportionality of hazard rates were computed using Schoenfeldt residuals and by visual inspection of the Nelson-Aalens estimator.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 962 children (22.1&#x00025;) of the 4345 enrolled children did <italic>not</italic> receive OPV at birth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004056.s001">Appendix S1</xref>).

The effect of OPV on mortality has never been investigated. In our study, missing OPV at birth was associated with significantly reduced mortality among boys but a weak tendency for increased mortality among girls, indicating that OPV at birth may have a sex-differential effect on mortality.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Bias and confounding factors</title><p>The study was observational. Though it was a &#x0201c;natural experiment&#x0201d; in the sense that it was logistic that determined the availability of OPV there was nonetheless more children of uneducated mothers and with low arm circumference who did <italic>not</italic> receive OPV. These children may have had a higher risk of dying during the first year of life <italic>a priori</italic>. However, control for maternal education and arm circumference did not change the estimates much. Also, if it was the less well-off children who did <italic>not</italic> receive OPV, it would not explain the significantly lower mortality among boys who did <italic>not</italic> receive OPV. In conclusion, we do not think that there is any plausible uncontrolled background factor, which may explain our observation.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Consistency of the findings</title><p>It strengthens the observation that the effect of <italic>not</italic> receiving OPV was comparable during the two major independent periods without OPV. Though no significant associations were observed between <italic>not</italic> receiving OPV at birth and major causes of death, hospitalization or hospital case-fatality, the pattern was the same. For all major causes of death there was lower mortality for boys and higher for girls if they had <italic>not</italic> received OPV; for both hospitalization and case-fatality there was a 20&#x02013;25&#x00025; difference between boys and girls which went in the same direction as the overall result. Hence, the results are compatible with the hypothesis that OPV at birth increases mortality of infant boys. Many factors influence a mother's choice to bring the child to the hospital, and hospitalizations may not be the best proxy for severe disease. The vast majority of children died outside the hospital.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Sex-differential effects</title><p>We have found sex-differential effects for almost all routine vaccinations. Our previous studies of OPV did not show any strong sex-differential effects <xref rid="pone.0004056-Aaby4" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004056-Aaby5" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In the present study the sex-differential effect was pronounced and worrying because it suggested a negative effect of OPV at birth in boys. We have no biological explanation for the sex-differential effect. However, the consistent observation of sex-differential effects on overall mortality of routine vaccinations such as DTP and measles vaccine does add plausibility to the hypothesis that boys and girls may have different immune systems, which are affected in a differential manner by our current interventions.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Conclusion</title><p>OPV given with BCG at birth became policy for logistic reasons. Subsequently a single study showed that it may increase antibody titres. The effect of providing OPV at birth on overall mortality was never tested. Many routine vaccines have non-specific effects on mortality that affects boys and girls differently. This &#x0201c;natural experiment&#x0201d; suggests that the same may apply to OPV administered with BCG at birth. Not receiving OPV at birth was associated with a tendency for increased mortality in girls, but significantly decreased mortality in boys. There is political interest in substituting OPV with IPV <xref rid="pone.0004056-Hull1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. However, this may take many years. If OPV at birth has unwarranted effects in boys, provision of OPV at birth to boys should be stopped since OPV at birth probably contributes little to immunity. If OPV has beneficial effects in girls, substituting with IPV may increase overall mortality in girls. Randomised studies of the effect of providing OPV at birth on overall mortality in both sexes are warranted.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The protocol was presented to the Ministry of Health in Guinea-Bissau and the Danish Central Ethical Committee for approval (624-02-0010).
