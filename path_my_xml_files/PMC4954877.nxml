Introduction</title><p>Anxiety is a physiological condition that includes cognitive, physical, emotional, and behavioral components, and everybody experiences it in their lives (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Isra et al., 2008</xref>). Presence of an acceptable level of anxiety is considered as an adapted response which brings about humans&#x02019; different position taking against natural and unnatural events. Therefore, presence of a little anxiety can have a positive effect on the process of life and its revolution. It is natural that this type of anxiety not only causes no damage to human&#x02019;s growth process but also it is considered as a useful event (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Hatami &#x00026; Ardalan, 2010</xref>). However, a high level of anxiety can cause different types of diseases.</p><p>The results of different studies indicated that there has been an increase in prevalence and intensity of remarkable problems of mental health among university students (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Zivin et al., 2009</xref>). Depression and anxiety are the most common psychological problems among university students (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Erol Deirbatir, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Raja et al., 2012</xref>). Some have reported prevalence of psychological disorders to be 12.75-30.4% among Iranian university students (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Saheb Al-zamani, 2010)</xref>. University students&#x02019; mental health is one of the essential affairs of student life, and paying attention to it can have a direct effect on the growth and development of the community and is the main factor in optimal exploitation of efficient educated workforces (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Shirbim et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Timmerman et al. (1998)</xref> studied the effects of stress management lesson planning. The results of their study indicated that this type of training can reduce mental pressure, anxiety, and daily involvements and increase courage and satisfaction. <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Halamandaris and Power (1999)</xref> concluded that training behavioral or muscular relaxation could reduce the students&#x02019; anxiety. Mizuno et al. (1999) stated that there is a significant relationship between mental health and problem-oriented coping style, and that training how to deal and control stress significantly reduces the individuals&#x02019; scores on anxiety, depression, and social dysfunction. The results of the study conducted by <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Shirbim, Sudani, and Shafi&#x02019; Abadi (2008)</xref> indicated that training stress management enhances mental health and reduces physical symptoms, anxiety, social dysfunction, and depression. Therefore, one of the objectives of the present study is to examine the effectiveness of stress management training on anxiety among university students.</p><p>Moreover, another variable that was considered in the present study is psychological hardiness. With an increasing growth of awareness in the field of psychology and advent of new scopes, the concept of hardiness has been paid unique attention by positivist psychologists. In this framework, hardiness is defines as a combination of attitudes and beliefs that give an individual motivation and courage so that he can perform well and strategically in the face of pressure-causing and difficult situations and try to adapt himself; therefore, he can step toward his growth and development through unfavorable and catastrophic events (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Maddi, 2002</xref>).</p><p><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Kobasa, Maddi, and Zola (1983)</xref> defined hardiness as a combination of beliefs about oneself and the universe that is composed of components like commitment, control, and competitiveness. Belief in change, revolution, dynamism of life, and the attitude that there is no event as a threat to human security and health can cause cognitive flexibility and tolerance against stress-causing difficult events and vague situation. <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Maddi, Wadha, and Haier (1996)</xref> and <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Kobasa and Puccetti (1983)</xref> believe that psychological features of hardiness such as remarkable curiosity, tendency to have interesting and meaningful experiences, self-expression, liveliness, and the belief that change in life is natural can help with the individuals&#x02019; adaptation to the life stressful events. Investigations indicate that there is a positive relationship between physical health and mental health, and as an internal tolerance resource, it reduces negative effects of stress and prevents the appearance of mental and physical discrapancies (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Kobasa, 1979</xref>; <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Florian, Mikulincer &#x00026; Yaubman, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Brooks, 2003</xref>). Therefore, the second objective of the present study is to investigate the effectiveness of stress management training on psychological hardiness.</p><p>Moreover, self-efficacy is another variable that was investigated in the present study. Self-efficacy is a key construction in social cognitive theory (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Bandura, 2004</xref>). Social cognitive theory is derived from an agentic perspective in which the individuals&#x02019; behavior is perceived in a purposeful and predictable way, and they regulate their motivation and behavior through active self-assessment. According to this perspective, individuals with beliefs of self-efficacy can control their feelings and behavior using their beliefs through a working model, and the individuals&#x02019; behavior is predictable through these beliefs (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Bandura, 2004</xref>).</p><p><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Bandura (2004)</xref> believes that self-efficacy or the individual&#x02019;s judgment about his abilities and capacities to control his life events has the greatest impact on his actions and self-regulation. It assesses the important choices of the individual&#x02019;s life procedure. Moreover, devotion of necessary attempt to actualization of activities, endurance against problems, and unsuccessful experiences of life are affected by self-efficacy.</p><p>One of the reasons for significance of studying general self-efficacy among university students is that, on the one hand, there is a relationship between this variable and mental disorder. In this regard, research studies have concluded that mental disorders occur when there is a low level of self-efficacy. The results of one of the studies that were conducted by <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Rezayat and Dehghan Nayeri (2013)</xref> indicated that there is a significant relationship between high depression and low self-efficacy. Moreover, <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Bakhtiyarpour, Hafezi, and Shini (2010)</xref> concluded that exam anxiety can be predicted through self-efficacy. On the other hand, another reason for significance of studying general self-efficacy among students is that there is a relationship between self-efficacy and the students&#x02019; academic achievement, which can be understood from the results of the study conducted by <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Abolghasemi and Javanmiri (2012)</xref>. The results of their study indicated that academic achievement can increase as a result of a high level of self-efficacy. Moreover, <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Tamadoni, Hatemi, and Zarrini (2011)</xref> concluded that there is a significant relationship between self-efficacy and academic achievement. Therefore, due to the high significance of self-efficacy among university students, measures that are adopted to enhance this variable are highly significant. Stress management lesson planning is one of these measures. The results of the study conducted by <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Hardin et al. (2002)</xref> indicated that psychological measures cause the individuals&#x02019; understanding of stress, self-efficacy, and social support to rise. The results of the study conducted by <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Abolghasemi et al. (2012)</xref> training life skills can affect the spouses&#x02019; self-efficacy of the addicts. Since stress management is one of the life skills, along with anxiety and psychological hardiness, the present study investigates the effectiveness of stress management training on self-efficacy among university students.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>2. Method</title><p>The study was a quasi-experimental intervention (pretest-posttest-follow-up) including a control group, it was a fundamental applied study.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>2.1 Statistical Population and the Study Sample</title><p>The statistical population included all students of Islamic Azad University, Karaj Iran. Convenient sampling was utilized to select 30 students as the study sample that was assigned into an experimental group and a control one. In the present study, stress management lesson plan was the independent variable, and anxiety, psychological hardiness, and self-efficacy were dependent variables. Beck Anxiety Inventory, Long and Goulet scale of psychological hardiness, and General Self-efficacy Scale (GSE-10) were administered before and 45 days after the investigation.</p><p>Mean and standard deviation were employed to describe the collected data. Variance analysis was employed to compare the collected data. And statistical analyses were carried out through SPSS 16.0.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>2.2 Instrumentation</title><p>A. Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI): Beck Anxiety Inventory is a self-report questionnaire that is composed of 4-option 21 questions that are scored in the range of 0-3. The total score ranges from 0 to 63. The results of the conducted studies in Iran indicate that this questionnaire has a high level of reliability and validity. For example, <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Ghorayi (1993)</xref> reported its reliability to be 0.80. Moreover, <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Kaviyani and Mousavi (1999)</xref> reported its reliability and Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha to be 0.72 and 0.92, respectively.</p><p>B. Long and Goult Hardiness Scale (LGHS): It is a self-report questionnaire that is composed of 45 questions. It developed by <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Long and Goult (2003)</xref> based on the definition of psychological hardiness construction in order to assess this variable in certain stressful situations. This scale contains 3 subscales of control subscale (16 question), commitment (16 questions), and challenge seeking (16 question). The questionnaire&#x02019;s items are scored based on a 5-point Likert scale where 1 indicates &#x0201c;completely disagree&#x0201d; and 5 stands for &#x0201c;completely agree&#x0201d;. The respondent&#x02019;s total score is calculated from the sum of the scores obtained from each question of the questionnaire. In the study conducted by <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Long and Goult (2003)</xref>, the results of the reliability of the scale indicated that the correlation between the total scores of the questionnaire and the respondents&#x02019; scores in the subscales was average and high, and the Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha indicated a good level of internal consistency of the scale (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Long &#x00026; Goult, 2003</xref>).</p><p>C. General Self-efficacy Scale (GSE-10): It was designed in 1979 by Schwartzer and Jerusalem in order to assess general and social self-efficacy. It has 10 items all of which evaluate general self-efficacy. The construction of perceived self-efficacy indicates the individual&#x02019;s optimistic view toward himself (Schwartzer, 1992). Individuals with a high level of self-efficacy believe that they can manage, solve the problems, and adapt themselves when they are faced with problems and difficult situations. Perceived self-efficacy facilitates determination of goals, energy devotion, hardiness against barriers, and recovery after failure. This scale is a self-report questionnaire used for adults (over 12 years old) in which the respondents are required to decide their agreement of disagreement using a 4-point Likert scale (from &#x0201c;Not correct al all&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;Completely correct&#x0201d;). To calculate the total score of the scale, the score of the 10 items need to be summed up. The score of this scale ranges from 1 to 40. In Germany, Schwartzer et al. (1992) calculated the internal consistency of this scale to be 0.84, 0.81 in Costa Rica and Spain, and 0.91 in China. <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Rajabi (2006)</xref> has calculated the reliability and validity coefficients of this scale and has reported it acceptable.</p><p>The lesson plan and intervention in the present study was a structured and group intervention that was composed of 10 weekly sessions held once a week for 1.5 hours (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Antoni et al., 2007</xref>). In general, every session was composed of two sections; the first section dealt with skills of stress management and the second section included relaxation practices.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>2.3 The Structure of the Sessions Was as Follow</title><p>First session: Administering the pre-test, explaining stress-causing factors and the importance of stress management, how to respond to stress-causing factors, creating a list of such factors, and relaxation practice</p><p>Second session: Getting aware of spontaneous thoughts, understanding the relationship between thoughts and feelings, understanding the physical symptoms, relaxation practice along with diaphragmatic breathing</p><p>Third session: Explaining the relationship between thoughts and excitements, identifying negative thoughts and understanding their effects on behavior, imagination and relaxation practice</p><p>Fourth session: Awareness of reasonable and unreasonable self-talks, relaxation practice in the form of imagination along with diaphragmatic breathing</p><p>Fifth session: Replacing reasonable thoughts, autogenetic training of heaviness and warmth feeling (sunlight meditation practice), relaxation practices in the form of mental imagination along with positive self-induction</p><p>Sixth session: Training efficient dealing, autogenic training of heartbeat, breath, stomach, and forehead</p><p>Seventh session: Administering responses of efficient dealing, autogenic training along with imagination and self-induction</p><p>Eighth session: Training anger management and mantra meditation</p><p>Ninth session: Training assertiveness, breath count meditation</p><p>Tenth session: Social support, a total review of the program, and creating a personal stress management plan.</p><p>The procedure of the intervention in each session was like this that the lessons of the last session were reviewed in the beginning of each session.

Discussion and Conclusion</title><p>The present study utilized a quasi-experimental method to assess the rate of effectiveness of stress group management training on anxiety, psychological hardiness, and general self-efficacy among university students. In so doing, a stress management educational package was used for the experimental group, and its effects on anxiety, psychological hardiness, and general self-efficacy was measured.</p><p>It was concluded that group training of stress management caused a reduction in anxiety among university students, such that their anxiety dropped significantly after the intervention. This finding is in agreement with those of the studies conducted by <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Timmerman et al. (1998)</xref>, <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Halamandariz and Power (1999)</xref>, <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Koegh et al. (2005)</xref>, <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Soltani (2004)</xref>, <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Kaviyani et al. (2007)</xref>, and <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Shirbim et al. (2008)</xref>. The results reported by these researchers indicated that stress management training can improve stress, tension, and social dysfunction.</p><p>The results of the present study also indicated that the students&#x02019; psychological hardiness increased remarkably after the educational intervention, i.e. group training of stress management resulted in an increase in psychological hardiness. This finding is in agreement with those of the studies conducted by Florian et al. (2012) and <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Brooks (2003)</xref>. There are few studies in this field, and there is no study conducted on this issue in Iran, which limits the generalizability of the results. Therefore, it should be investigated in a larger sample in the future studies.</p><p>Moreover, the results of the present study indicated that group training of stress management can enhance general self-efficacy among university students. This finding is in line with those of the studies conducted by <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Hardin et al. (2002)</xref> and <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Abolghasemi et al. (2012)</xref>. Life skill is one of the stress management and mental pressure skills, which strengthens the ability of uniqueness in the individual, such that he feels committed and responsible toward his life, and activities like discussion and debate, lesson taking, activity in small groups results in presentation of different responses in unpredicted situations, which is the same self-efficacy. Self-efficacy influences how individuals think, feel, and behave. The level of self-efficacy relies on the individual&#x02019;s choice of assignments, commitment, attempt, and skill acquisition (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Yari, 1997</xref>).</p><p>In general, it can be stated that group plan of CBT-based stress management is effective in reduction of anxiety among university students; it enhances psychological hardiness and self-efficacy among them.</p><p>One of the limitations of the present study was that the student&#x02019;s homework was not controlled by the researchers. Moreover, personal and emotional variables were not controlled. Therefore, it is suggested that more reliable results can be achieved by increasing the education time and utilizing other therapeutic methods that can influence anxiety, psychological hardiness, and general self-efficacy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest</bold></p><p>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abolghasemi</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Javanmiri</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The role of social acceptability, mental health, and self-efficacy in predicting female students&#x02019; academic achievement</article-title><source>School Psychology Journal</source><year>2012</year><volume>1</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>6</fpage><lpage>20</lpage><comment>In Persian</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abolghasemi</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Falah</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Babaei</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Hojjat</surname><given-names>S.
