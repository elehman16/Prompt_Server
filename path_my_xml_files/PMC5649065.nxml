HIV is now the leading cause of death among this age group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The increase in adolescent HIV-related deaths has been attributed to poor prioritization of adolescents in national HIV plans, inadequate provision of accessible and acceptable HIV-testing, counseling and treatment services for this age group, plus a lack of tailored support for adolescents to remain in care and adhere to taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa have poorer ART adherence than adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and are at high risk of loss to follow-up from treatment and care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This supports findings among adolescents with other chronic childhood illnesses (e.g., diabetes, asthma) when medication adherence frequently becomes worse as the child becomes more independent from parental control as they enter adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">In 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) released the first consolidated ART prevention and treatment guidelines which recommended innovative models of ART delivery (decentralization, integration and task-shifting) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In response, Zimbabwe revised its national ART guidance, released in December 2013, to simplify recommended treatment regimens for children and adolescents, hence facilitating the decentralization of pediatric HIV care to primary healthcare facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Decentralizing pediatric HIV care has resulted in improved access and coverage, but little is known about the capacity of primary care facilities to provide effective adherence support as well as support for the broader psychosocial issues that many of these children and adolescents face [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">A key tenet of both the WHO and Zimbabwe&#x02019;s treatment guidelines is that expanded access to ART needs to be accompanied by interventions to maximize retention in care and medication adherence. Poor retention and adherence to ART leads to treatment resistance and ultimately, to treatment failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. International guidelines recommend at least 95% adherence to ART to minimize the risk of virological failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A systematic review of 17 studies relating to ART programs in children and adolescents from low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) found that non-adherence was associated with a child&#x02019;s socioeconomic environment, stigma, caregiver characteristics, dynamics of child-caregiver interactions, disclosure of HIV status, regimen complexity, side effects, and cost of medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">The 2013 and 2015 WHO adolescent HIV-testing and treatment guidelines recommend community-based interventions to support ART adherence and retention in care, while acknowledging that the evidence to support this recommendation is weak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Evidence-based strategies to provide support to the growing number of adolescents receiving ART from LMIC are urgently required. Preliminary evidence suggests that the Zvandiri (&#x0201c;As I am&#x0201d;) program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.africaid-zvandiri.org/">http://www.africaid-zvandiri.org/</ext-link>) has the potential to make a significant impact on the lives of adolescents living with HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">The Zvandiri program is a model of differentiated clinical service delivery for HIV-positive children and adolescents in Zimbabwe, has been cited as a &#x0201c;best practice&#x0201d; intervention by the WHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], USAID, Southern African Development Community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and has been recommended for adaptation and regional scale-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The program uses trained and mentored community adolescent treatment supporters (CATS) to deliver structured support groups and tailored community-based adherence support coupled with counseling for the broader psychosocial issues that these young people are facing (including coming to terms with their emerging sexuality in the context of a life-threatening, sexually transmissible infection). The CATS are aged 18&#x02013;23 years, living with HIV, have been identified by the healthcare facility as committed, competent and motivated to support their peers as well as adherent to ART, having completed secondary schooling and having consent from their caregivers to enroll as CATS. The Zvandiri program also includes an intervention for caregivers which focuses on enhancing their knowledge, skills and confidence of HIV and treatment literacy as well as communication and parenting through a participatory training program.</p><p id="Par42">In this paper we describe the protocol for a cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Zvandiri program on HIV-related and psychosocial outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par43">The trial will provide evidence on whether enhancing community-based support for adolescents on ART through the Zvandiri program will, compared with standard care:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par44">Reduce the proportion of adolescents with ART treatment failure (lack of viral suppression)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par45">Improve retention in care</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par46">Reduce the severity of anxiety and depression</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par47">Reduce the proportion of adolescents reporting non-disclosure</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par48">Be cost-effective</p></list-item></list>

The districts were selected in consultation with the Ministry of Health and Child Care (MoHCC). At the time of selection, it was estimated that 24,871 adolescents were living with HIV in the province and that ART coverage among children and adolescents was the lowest in Zimbabwe (estimated to be 29%). Additionally, although the Zvandiri program was being scaled-up, it had not yet been initiated in these two districts. Altogether, there are 33 healthcare facilities in the two districts. Of these, 16 with at least 20 adolescents on ART (excluding private clinics and those not yet offering pediatric HIV treatment and care services) were selected to participate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Trial design</title><p id="Par52">The trial is a cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT).

As per MoHCC guidelines, adherence support is provided by adult counselors and nursing staff. After ART initiation, adolescents are seen monthly, with cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) monitoring at 6-monthly intervals. Prescription refills, pill counts and participant interviews are used to measure adherence. Although routine viral-load testing was adopted by MoHCC in 2010 and scale-up began in 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], the MoHCC is currently only able to provide targeted rather than universal viral-load testing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Intervention arm</title><p id="Par57">All eligible adolescents attending intervention clinics will receive MoHCC standard care. In addition, one to three (ideally at least one man, one woman) trained and supported CATS are at each clinic to provide adherence counseling and support to adolescents at their clinic visits as well as on-going individualized community-based support. Each CATS supports 6&#x02013;10 adolescents in their geographical location irrespective of level of Zvandiri support. CATS were recruited from the clinic in partnership with the clinic staff, or from the local support group if a group was already in place.</p><p id="Par58">The CATS receive 2&#x000a0;weeks of MoHCC-endorsed training to equip them with counseling skills and skills in community outreach plus knowledge specific to adolescent HIV (ART and adherence, disclosure, sexual and reproductive health, psychosocial support and mental health). The training combines both theoretical and practical components, including the &#x0201c;shadowing&#x0201d; of existing CATS in Harare to acquire practical experience of providing adherence support. Training includes learning how to identify &#x0201c;red flags&#x0201d; for ill-health, adherence challenges, psychosocial distress and common mental disorders (CMDs), plus basic skills in problem solving and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Training is participatory and uses case studies. All CATS attend a weekly supervision meeting at the clinic with a designated nurse and provide each other with peer-to-peer support (through a WhatsApp group and via Skype from Harare) with oversight from a professional counselor. Trial participants are allocated to a designated CATS according to their residential area and followed up through the short message service (SMS), phone calls and home visits. The type and frequency of contact is determined following assessment of their individual situation (i.e., whether they are considered &#x0201c;stable&#x0201d; or in need of enhanced support):<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par59">&#x0201c;Stable&#x0201d; adolescents are those: (a) with a viral load&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1000 copies/ml and/or most recent (and within the last 6&#x000a0;months) CD4 count&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;200 cells/ml and (b) attending all scheduled clinic visits in the last 3&#x000a0;months assessed using the patient-held record.
