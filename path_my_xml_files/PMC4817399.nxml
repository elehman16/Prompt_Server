Rectal morphine suppositories are one of the newly released morphine forms. The aim of this study is to compare the impact of suppository morphine with placebo on pain relief after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Seventy patients scheduled for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia, were randomly allocated to two groups according to the drug used for postoperative analgesia: Group morphine suppository (MS - 10 mg) just before induction of anesthesia And Group placebo suppository (PS) (the pills were made from cocoa butter, physically similar to the real drug). Pain intensity based on visual analog scale (VAS) and opioid consumption were assessed 30 and 60 min, and 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 h after arrival of the patient to the recovery room.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>VAS scores were significantly lower in MS group (from 3.8 &#x000b1; 1 to 5.3 &#x000b1; 1.6) compared with PS group (from 4.9 &#x000b1; 0.9 to 6.7 &#x000b1; 1) from 30 min after arrival to the recovery room until 16 h postoperatively (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).

Rectal morphine suppositories are one of the newly released morphine forms. Each rectal suppository can contain 5, 10, 20, and 30 mg of morphine, approximately two-thirds of which is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and maximum effect is after 20&#x02013;60 min and its metabolism occurs in the liver.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there was no previous study to evaluate the analgesic effect of suppository morphine for pain prevention after laparoscopic cholecystectomy and as this method of preemptive analgesia by morphine is not routinely used in our university hospitals especially in ophthalmologic operating rooms, and some studies have showed beneficial effect of this method in other surgeries so we designed the present study to assess the effect of suppository morphine on postoperative pain relief in patient's candidate for laparoscopic cholecystectomy and we hope that this method of analgesia become routine in our operating rooms as a new routine route.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After institutional approval and obtaining an informed patient consent, 70 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I&#x02013;II patients, scheduled for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy, under general anesthesia, were included in this double-blind prospective randomized study (power analysis with &#x003b1; = 0.01 and &#x003b2; = 0.05 suggested that a sample size of 35 patients per group was needed to detect a 20% reduction in postoperative pain score and also postoperative analgesic requirements). Other inclusion criteria of patients into the study was as follows: Age span from 18 to 65 years, body mass index (BMI) &#x0003c;30, lack of sensitivity to morphine and or similar compounds, lack of addiction to opioids and no renal, and liver failure.</p><p>Before the study began, a random number table was used to generate a randomized schedule specifying the group to which each patient would be assigned upon entry into the trial. In case of exclusion, the next patient was randomized per schedule.</p><p>The included patients were divided into two groups each with 35 members. The patients in the first group (morphine suppository [MS] group) were randomly assigned to their treatment (10 mg morphine rectal suppository) and placebo suppository (PS) group (control group) received rectal placebo just before induction of anesthesia.</p><p>General anesthesia was used in patients by injecting of sodium thiopental (5 mg/kg), Atracurium (0.6 mg/kg), and fentanyl (2 &#x000b5;gr/kg); followed by 1.2% isoflurane and 50% oxygen with 50% N<sub>2</sub>O as maintenance of anesthesia. At the end of surgery, muscle relaxation was completely reversed by injecting of 0.04 mg/kg of neostigmine and 0.02 mg/kg of atropine, after getting back to normal respiration at full consciousness the patient was extubated.</p><p>All patients underwent pain assessment with visual analog scale (VAS, ranges 0&#x02013;10 cm) from 30 min after recovery to 24 h after surgery. In the recovery room controlling of pain, consciousness, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate (RR) was done at the time of admission to the recovery room 30 and 60 min and 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 h after surgery by someone who was not aware of the group type of the patients.</p><p>Moreover, the first request for additional analgesic and the related dosage along with implications were recorded in both groups. In the case VAS &#x0003e; 3, intravenous pethidine with a dose of 0.5 mg/kg was injected intravenously. When vomiting or marked nausea (VAS &#x0003e; 3) was observed, intravenous ondansetron with a dose of 0.1 mg/kg was injected. BMI (BMI - the ratio of body weight in kg to body surface area in m<sup>2</sup>), age, sex, and duration of anesthesia (the time from induction of anesthesia to extubation of the patient), duration of surgery (the time from skin incision to skin closure), recovery time (the time from entrance of the patient to recovery room to discharging from recovery) were also recorded. Also, questions about drug complications were asked from the patients and any complication recorded. At the end of 24 h, questions about patients&#x02019; satisfaction were asked using the following: Excellent, very good, good, and poor.</p><p>The analysis of obtained data was by the statistical software SPSS (version-20) and statistical tests, including Student's <italic>t</italic>-test and Chi-square test as well as analysis of variance with repeated observation.

Previous works demonstrated that preemptive morphine can be superior to morphine given postoperatively for pain relief after surgery.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Also, it was shown in another study that nonparenteral morphine provides better analgesia than parenteral route but with an effect limited to the first postoperative day.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In the present study the need for additional analgesics was lower in the MS group; again the finding of the other studies in this regard is in accordance with the results of our study.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Also pain process after the surgery was shorter for the intervention group compared to the control group. These results are similar to finding of the study of Cole <italic>et al</italic>. and Beaver and Feise. Cole <italic>et al</italic>. and Beaver and Feise demonstrated that morphine hydrogen suppository can be effective in controlling postoperative pains.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>In another study, Beaver and Feise demonstrated that single rectal oxymorphone has lower and more delayed peak analgesia and a longer duration of action than intramuscular oxymorphone administration on postoperative pain. He concluded that because intramuscular oxymorphone is 9&#x02013;10 times as potent as intramuscular morphine, 5&#x02013;10 mg suppository oxymorphone provides better analgesic effects than routinely used parenteral narcotics, and suggested that the rectal route is an acceptable and practical way of administering potent analgesics and is probably being underutilized by physicians in the control of moderate to severe pain.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>In another study, Bourke <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that oral sustained release morphine sulfate tablet is a suitable alternative to the intramuscular route for relieving postoperative pain.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] So it seems that low-dose mucosal opioid administration like a rectal prescription to be safe compared with other systemic routes.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Some other researchers show an anomalous response to morphine in patients with unexplained pain in the upper abdomen which persists or recurs after cholecystectomy.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Some authors have reported side effects of rectal morphine administration due to inattention to the narrow therapeutic ratio for opioid drugs and staff education and clinical protocols.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In our study, the total amount of used analgesic in the postoperative period was significantly less in MS group compared with PS group. Furthermore, basic science investigations suggest that opioids decrease central and peripheral sensitization via direct central nervous system effect.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Hemodynamic parameters such as blood pressure, heart rate, RR and blood SPO<sub>2</sub> were not significantly different between two groups just before anesthesia and during the first 24 h after surgery. In addition, no case of hemodynamic instability and respiratory difficulty were seen in both groups. So we concluded that suppository morphine prescription before surgery may induce hemodynamic stability during anesthesia. This is in accordance with basic science investigations that postoperative pain relief stabilizes patient hemodynamics.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Again there was no significant difference between two groups in mean arterial blood pressure, and RR; this finding is comparable to other studies.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Ventilator rate is considered a more reliable and adequate index of hypoventilation in most studies.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Although nausea and vomiting were higher implications in the MS group than in the PS group, however, no significant difference were observed between two groups; other studies have shown a similar result. Nausea and vomiting have been major side effects of opioid used for postoperative analgesia.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>In our study, patient's satisfaction was significantly higher in PS group compared with PS group.</p><p>However, it should be remembered that the analgesic efficacy is likely dependent upon multiple variables. First, it is possible that by altering the volume and concentration of the drug administered, an improved analgesia may be achieved. Second, the relative efficacy of the analgesic regimens investigated is study design &#x02013; dependent. Therefore, we suggest that by altering the delivery set-up, different results may be achieved. However, this hypothesis requires further investigations.</p><p>Our study demonstrates that the use of preoperative morphine suppositories may considerably be more effective in reducing postoperative pain in patients and since the morphine suppositories have no adverse impact on the hemodynamic status of patients and also have no other severe complication we recommend to use it as an analgesic medication in laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgical procedures in the absence of contraindication and under control of anesthesiologist. The limitation of this study was the small sample size and the fact that we followed patients with age span from 18 to 65 years, BMI &#x0003c; 30, and ASA physical status I&#x02013;II only for 24 h postoperatively; however, the findings seem particularly robust in spite of this. Also, we suggest altering the study design and further investigation.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors wish to thank sincerely the support of all the colleagues in AL-Zahra Hospital in Isfahan, Iran.
