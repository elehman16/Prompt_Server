This study aimed to determine whether it was feasible and acceptable to undertake a definitive multicentred randomised controlled trial assessing the effectiveness of acupuncture for treating lower limb amputees with PLP.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A mixed-methods embedded design, including a randomised controlled trial and semistructured interviews, was undertaken. A total of 15 participants with PLP were randomly assigned to receive either eight pragmatic Traditional Chinese Medicine acupuncture treatments and usual care or usual care alone over 4&#x000a0;weeks. Outcome measures were completed at baseline, weekly throughout the study and at 1&#x000a0;month post completion of the study and included: a numerical pain-rating scale, the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire 2, the EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Perceived Stress Scale 10-item, the Insomnia Severity Index, and the Patient Global Impression of Change. Post completion of the trial, participants in the acupuncture group were interviewed about their experience. Feasibility-specific data were also collected.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 24 amputees meeting the study inclusion criteria, 15 agreed to participate (recruitment rate 62.50&#x000a0;%). Qualitatively, acupuncture was perceived to be beneficial and effective. Quantitatively, acupuncture demonstrated clinically meaningful change in average pain intensity (raw change&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.69) and worst pain intensity (raw change&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.00). Feasibility-specific data identified that before undertaking a definitive trial, recruitment, practitioner adherence to the acupuncture protocol, completion of outcome measures at 1&#x000a0;month follow-up and blinding should be addressed. Appropriate outcome measures were identified for use in a definitive trial. Data were generated for future sample size calculations (effect size 0.64). Allowing for a 20&#x000a0;% dropout rate, a sample size of 85 participants per group would be needed in a future definitive trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A future definitive trial may be possible if the areas identified in this study are addressed. As acupuncture may be effective at treating PLP, and as this feasibility study suggests that a definitive trial may be possible, a multicentred trial with adequate sample size and blinding is now needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02126436">NCT02126436</ext-link>, registered on 4 September 2014.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-016-1639-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Phantom limb</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Acupuncture</kwd><kwd>Amputation</kwd><kwd>Mixed-methods research</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000380</institution-id><institution>Guy's and St Thomas' Charity</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EFT140402</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robinson</surname><given-names>Nicola</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture UK</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Phantom limb pain (PLP) is defined as painful sensations in the missing portion of the amputated limb. It is neuropathic in nature and caused by a lesion of the somatosensory nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It may be chronic and has been found to influence individuals&#x02019; subjective wellbeing, affecting both physical and mental components of quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Currently, PLP is not well-managed. A systematic review evaluating the use of preemptive analgesia found that only one case-controlled study supported using combined bupivacaine, diamorphine, and clonidine. Epidural and perineural infusions containing local anaesthetic with or without opiates were deemed only effective for treating acute perioperative pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A small randomised controlled trial found that intravenous ketamine could significantly reduce PLP during, and for 30 mins after, infusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, a subsequent systematic review found it to be ineffective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The most commonly used first-line treatment is gabapentin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] but a systematic review found this to be beneficial for short-term analgesic efficacy only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Many case studies report positively on the effectiveness of mirror therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] but few randomised controlled trials have been completed and adverse effects have been reported.</p><p>Acupuncture has been found to be effective for treating a variety of chronic pain conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] but little quality evidence is available on the use of acupuncture for PLP. A recent systematic review identified only two nonrandomised controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and 26 case studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture for treating PLP, but prior to a definitive trial a study is needed to inform on feasibility.</p><p>This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of completing a small randomised controlled trial in preparation for a definitive multicentred randomised controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Objectives were to: (1) explore the feasibility of recruiting, randomising, and retaining participants, (2) evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of having a usual care control, (3) evaluate adherence/compliance and acceptability of acupuncture as an intervention, (4) evaluate the appropriateness of outcome measures, (5) identify appropriate primary and secondary outcome measures which could be used in future trials, (6) explore the perceived effectiveness of acupuncture for treating PLP, (7) generate data on effect size for use in future sample size calculations, and (8) inform the development of an appropriate and feasible protocol for use in a definitive multicentred randomised controlled trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>A comparative effectiveness study using a mixed-methods embedded design, including a small randomised controlled trial incorporating semistructured interviews, was undertaken. The randomised controlled trial was unstratified, open, pragmatic, with two parallel arms, balanced randomisation and a usual care control. Interviews were cross-sectional. The study protocol has been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02126436). A Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist is included within the article&#x02019;s additional files (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, CONSORT 2010 checklist of information to include when reporting a randomised trial.pdf). Ethical approval was granted from the NRES Committee London &#x02013; Bloomsbury (14/LO/0817) and London South Bank University; the trial commenced in October 2014 and closed 1&#x000a0;year later in October 2015.</p><p>Participants were recruited from an NHS inpatient amputee rehabilitation unit in London. All participants were provided with information and were required to consent orally and in writing. Participants were included if they were: (1) 18&#x000a0;years of age or above, (2) had full cognitive ability and were able to communicate in English, (3) had had traumatic or medical amputation of a lower limb (more than just toes), and (4) were currently experiencing worst PLP of &#x02265;5 on an 11-point verbal rating scale. Participants were excluded if they: (1) had congenital limb absence, (2) were medically unwell, (3) were pregnant, and (4) if acupuncture use was cautioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Participants were randomly allocated to either receive usual care and acupuncture or usual care alone. A usual care comparator was chosen as the study was undertaken under the Medical Research Council guidelines for developing and evaluating complex interventions. Usual care included pharmacological medical intervention, physiotherapy, and occupational therapy. Acupuncture was provided by an NHS clinic colocated in the same building by one British Acupuncture Council-registered acupuncture practitioner (BSc (Hons) Acupuncture) with more than 15&#x000a0;years of clinical experience. Acupuncture was delivered pragmatically under the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) paradigm. A protocol developed prior to the study, using Delphi consensus methodology was used to provide guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and included:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Using a combination of body and auricular acupuncture</p></list-item><list-item><p>Treating the contralateral limb and possibly the ipsilateral limb</p></list-item><list-item><p>Including auricular acupuncture points such as the <italic>Shen Men</italic> and the sympathetic and points corresponding to the lower limb</p></list-item><list-item><p>Depending on the health of the tissue and the individual participant, needling around the stump</p></list-item><list-item><p>Mirroring local and distal points by needling the opposite limb</p></list-item><list-item><p>Including points on the lower back (taking a segmental approach to dermatomal pain)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Including points such as LI4&#x02009;+&#x02009;LR3, LR3, GV20, SP10, and also specified points according to participants&#x02019; specific symptoms</p></list-item><list-item><p>Attempting to obtain <italic>deqi</italic>

</p><p>Treatment could include electroacupuncture or other adjunctive interventions including cupping, exercises, and lifestyle advice. All participants in the acupuncture group were allocated eight 1-h sessions (twice weekly for 4&#x000a0;weeks).</p><p>Outcome measures were completed at baseline, weekly for the duration of the trial and 1&#x000a0;month post completion of the study. The primary outcome measure was an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) capturing average PLP over the past week, using the anchors 0 meaning &#x02018;no pain&#x02019; and 10 meaning &#x02018;pain as bad as you can imagine&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Secondary outcome measures included; NRS capturing worst PLP over the past week, the Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire 2 (SF-MPQ-2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], the EuroQol-5 dimensions, 5 levels (EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L) questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], the Perceived Stress Scale 10-item (PSS-10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and a 7-point Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale ranging from 1 meaning &#x02018;no change&#x02019; to 7 meaning &#x02018;a great deal better&#x02019;. Phrasing of the PGIC question was similar to the phrasing used by Hurst and Bolton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and stated &#x02018;since being enrolled in this study how would you describe the change (if any) in activity limitations, symptoms, emotion, and overall quality of life in relation to your phantom limb pain?&#x02019; Feasibility-specific data were collected (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>) and post completion of the study, participants in the acupuncture group were interviewed. Interviews were conducted by the researcher who enrolled participants and collected outcome measures. Interviews were semistructured, audio-recorded, followed a topic guide and were transcribed verbatim.</p><p>No sample size calculation was undertaken but a sample of 20 was deemed adequate to inform on feasibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Interim safety and effectiveness were not formally evaluated but data were collected through participant interviews. Randomisation and allocation concealment was undertaken by a researcher not involved in the study using a computer-generated random numbers table. Randomisation was unstratified and balanced using a block size of 4 and allocation concealment was implemented using sequentially numbered opaque envelopes which were only opened once participants had been enrolled. The researcher collecting outcome measures and analysing the data enrolled the participants and was blinded to their allocation. Participants and acupuncture practitioners were not blinded.</p><p>Quantitative data analysis used an intention-to-treat approach and missing data were imputed using last observation carried forward. The intervention was discontinued after week 4 and this was chosen as the primary endpoint of the study (day 28). As this was a feasibility study no significance tests were performed and no hypothesis testing is reported. Raw change, the difference between mean baseline and subsequent scores was calculated for the NRS and considered meaningful/clinically significant when &#x02265;1.80 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

Participants were initially sceptical and apprehensive about being involved in the trial, had low expectations of acupuncture and hoped to be randomised to usual care. However, these views changed; participants liked treatment (even if it was not physically needed) and found it relaxing. Electroacupuncture was considered beneficial and pleasant and receiving two treatments a week was considered acceptable though some participants found this tiring. Acupuncture was perceived to be effective at resolving or reducing PLP and other health problems and four to six treatments were needed for it to be effective. Acupuncture was not perceived to cause any adverse effects. The environment where the acupuncture was conducted was considered to affect the effectiveness of treatment.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Acupuncture group participant quotes from semistructured interviews</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Theme</th><th>Quote</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Scepticism and lack of expectations</td><td>&#x02018;I was a bit worried about what it was all about.

Other CAM studies report a lower participation rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and studies evaluating the effectiveness of interventions for treating PLP also report a lower participation rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This study may not have met its target recruitment rate because it was set unrealistically high. Participation rate was good, suggesting that a future trial would be possible.</p><p>Amputees have often undergone extensive unpleasant interventions prior to amputation, and this may partly explain the reason for those refusing to consent. The study site may not have been optimal for recruiting due to it being a busy unit providing rehabilitation care for those at a key life point. Although, overall, recruitment was good, future studies may benefit by including amputees who are not in an inpatient unit receiving multiple interventions at a key life point and by making the proposed intervention less intensive.</p><p>Blinding was unsuccessful. A future study may benefit from clearly including information on the participant information sheet about the necessity of blinding and should ensure that the outcome measures used are reliable and objective. Additionally, a future trial could use duplicate assessments of outcomes and report the level of agreement between assessors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Also, different data analysts to data collectors could be used.</p><p>Establishing acceptability and compliance to an intervention is vital because if the intervention is unacceptable and participants are not compliant, the study will fail. This study suggested that acupuncture and usual care were acceptable and participants were compliant with the protocol. Unlike usual care alone, acupuncture did appear to be clinically effective at reducing pain intensity and the findings suggested a &#x02018;meaningful change&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This is in keeping with results from case studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and nonrandomised controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Clinically meaningful change is important as this is relevant to patient care. Across a diverse patient group a change of 1.74 on an 11-point NRS has been associated with &#x02018;much improved&#x02019; and a change of 2.76 &#x02018;very much improved&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] suggesting that by the primary endpoint participants in the acupuncture group average pain was &#x02018;much improved&#x02019; and worst pain was &#x02018;very much improved&#x02019; but this was not so in the usual care group for either average or worst pain. In keeping with quantitative findings, qualitatively acupuncture was perceived to be effective at resolving symptoms. Findings from this study support the need for a definitive trial to determine effectiveness. As less than eight treatments may be effective this may be a more appropriate and cost-effective dosage. A usual care control should be used in future studies as it has the advantage of being safe (physicians make individualised treatment decisions about participant care) and, unlike efficacy trials, ensures that the intervention can claim to be superior to usual practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>Unexpectedly, practitioners were found to not adhere to the acupuncture protocol. This lack of adherence may have been partly due to tensions between clinical and research workload [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and also due to poor communication with the research team. This would need addressing before undertaking a future trial as lack of participants receiving the full intervention as intended could lead to reduced effectiveness, a decrease in study power and inappropriate conclusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Robiner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] provides a table of adherence-enhancing strategies which could be used in a future trial, including: promoting collaboration and good communication between acupuncturists and research staff, providing feedback on adherence, promoting nonjudgemental discussion around adherence, and addressing adherence problems proactively.</p><p>Although adverse events were captured during semistructured interviews, practitioner compliance of capture of adverse effects was poor. This is not uncommon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] but would need addressing before undertaking a definitive trial. Recommendations of capture of adverse events include capturing the frequency, incidence, timing, and severity of each event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. A future study may benefit from giving practitioners a log book designed to capture this information.</p><p>The study identified appropriate outcome measures which could be used in a future trial. However, as the SF-MPQ-2 included some terminology which was not understood, an alternative outcome measure may be more appropriate such as the neuropathic pain scale, the neuropathic pain symptom inventory, or the Pain Quality Assessment Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Although participants adhered to completing outcome measures, this was not sustained post the primary endpoint of the study. This lack of long-term retention needs addressing as poor retention has implications for statistical power and the internal and external validity of a study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Strategies could be implemented such as including a follow-up contact, prenotification reminders, and mentioning an obligation to respond [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In randomised controlled trials offering and giving small monetary incentives has been found to be successful in improving response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. However, lower limb amputees tend to be a frail population and long-term survival post amputation is poor. By 1&#x000a0;year post amputation almost half (44&#x000a0;%) of lower limb amputees will have died and by 5&#x000a0;years 77&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Additionally, major amputations are associated with high morbidity and complication rates. This would need to be taken into consideration when designing a definitive trial.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study did not consider the effect of attention on symptoms and did not include a control that mimicked the theoretically inactive elements but not the active elements of acupuncture. Further research needs to be carried out to identify optimal dosage, which aspects of acupuncture intervention causes change and whether environmental factors affect outcomes. The study did not recruit the number of participants it initially aimed to recruit and the quantitative findings reported in this study should be interpreted with caution. Only one practitioner was involved in this study and as differences in effectiveness are known to occur with different practitioners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] future studies would benefit from the use of multiple practitioners. Practitioners did not adhere to the acupuncture protocol and participants were not offered eight treatments, making it difficult to determine the effectiveness of the protocol. Two participants in the acupuncture group were not interviewed and data saturation of qualitative data cannot be assumed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The study provides novel data on the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial to establish the effectiveness of acupuncture for treating lower limb amputees with PLP. The study identified that acupuncture may cause clinically meaningful change. The protocol used in this study was acceptable and data on effect size were generated allowing for a sample size calculation. Areas which would need addressing prior to undertaking a definitive trial were identified.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec10"><title>Additional files</title><p>
