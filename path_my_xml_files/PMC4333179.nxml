Traditional management of MPE usually involves an inpatient stay with placement of a chest drain, followed by the instillation of a pleural sclerosing agent such as talc, which aims to minimise further fluid build-up. Despite a good success rate in studies, this approach can be expensive, time-consuming and inconvenient for patients. More recently, an alternative method has become available in the form of indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs), which can be inserted and managed in an outpatient setting. It is currently unknown whether combining talc pleurodesis with IPCs will provide improved pleural symphysis rates over those of IPCs alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>IPC-PLUS is a patient-blind, multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing the combination of talc with an IPC to the use of an IPC alone for inducing pleurodesis in MPEs. The primary outcome is successful pleurodesis at five weeks post-randomisation. This study will recruit 154 patients, with an interim analysis for efficacy after 100 patients, and aims to help to define the future gold standard for outpatient management of patients with symptomatic MPEs.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>IPC-PLUS is the first RCT to examine the practicality and utility of talc administered via an IPC. The study remains in active recruitment and has the potential to significantly alter how patients requiring pleurodesis for MPE are approached in the future.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This trial was registered with Current Controlled Trials (identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN73255764">ISRCTN73255764</ext-link>) on 23 August 2012.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Catheters</kwd><kwd>indwelling</kwd><kwd>Chest tubes</kwd><kwd>Outpatients</kwd><kwd>Pleural effusion</kwd><kwd>malignant</kwd><kwd>Pleurodesis</kwd><kwd>Sclerosing solutions</kwd><kwd>Talc</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) are a common complication of many cancers, with 40,000 new cases in the United Kingdom each year and up to 250,000 in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Their presence usually indicates metastatic disease, and hence possibly a poorer prognosis.</p><p>The traditional management of MPE involves inpatient insertion of a chest drain, to ensure fluid drainage and pleural apposition, before the instillation of a sclerosant substance to cause pleural inflammation and adhesion, also known as pleurodesis. Many substances can be used as a pleural irritant, although by far the most commonly used worldwide is talc, which has been shown to be superior to numerous alternatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Quoted pleurodesis success rates are typically high with talc, ranging from 81 to 100% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], although these figures may vary considerably in real-world practice due to differences between clinicians and between the practices of individual centres. To achieve such high efficacy, a patient typically requires admission for the insertion of a chest tube and drainage. Only once the pleural space is felt to be dry is the talc inserted. This usually requires an inpatient stay of five to seven days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], which can have a significant health economic impact, as well as the potential to impair the quality of remaining life for patients. Following the widespread use of large-particle talc, the side effects of pleurodesis have tended to be minor, the commonest of which are fever, pain and gastrointestinal upset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], although there have been rare cases of empyema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The main drawback of the traditional method of pleurodesis is the length of hospital stay and the inconvenience to patients. In more recent years, indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) have become more widely used and may the potential to alleviate these problems.</p><p>IPCs are silastic tubes, which have the potential to be left in place for weeks to months after being tunnelled under the skin. They can be inserted under local anaesthetic or at thoracoscopy, and are usually performed as a day case. Once at home, the aim is to drain fluid regularly (usually three times per week) in the patient&#x02019;s own environment. This maximises the opportunity for pleural apposition and adhesion, which potentially leads to complete pleurodesis. Drainage can be performed by anyone with appropriate training, including the patient, but is often managed by district nursing teams.</p><p>IPCs have been shown to be effective in the management of MPEs, although there is a paucity of evidence comparing them directly to talc pleurodesis. In a retrospective series of 250 cases, almost 90% of patients experienced complete or partial relief of dyspnoea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], a finding bettered in a later study in which all patients experienced improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Indwelling drains have also been shown to improve other outcomes, such as length of hospital stay and future admissions, even in comparison to talc pleurodesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Despite the need for proprietary drainage kits, they may also be cheaper overall to healthcare providers, if used for limited periods of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Regardless of patients&#x02019; short life expectancies, this is an achievable goal as IPCs can often be removed following sustained reduction in drainable fluid volumes, a reliable surrogate indicator for pleurodesis. Such spontaneous pleurodesis generally occurs in around 50% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and is heavily influenced by the underlying tumour type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], although rates as high as 70% were reported in one study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The presence of &#x02018;trapped lung&#x02019; (usually due to central airways obstruction or visceral pleural fibrosis) can lead to incomplete expansion following pleural fluid drainage, which no doubt influenced the variability of the time to pleurodesis in these studies. Indeed, in patients with trapped lung, the persistent failure of pleural apposition makes the achievement of any degree of pleurodesis much less likely overall, meaning regular fluid management with an IPC may be the only feasible approach to their care.</p><p>However, IPCs are not without drawbacks. There may be significant pain associated with the immediate and short-term post-procedure period, and in some cases pleural tract metastases have been documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Complications including empyema formation (3%), secondary fluid loculation (12%) and cellulitis (2%) have also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Nevertheless, meta-analysis data has shown IPCs are generally safe to use, with an overall complication rate of 12.5%.</p><p>It would seem, therefore, that the optimal approach to the management of MPEs should be the combination of talc instillation, to achieve the highest pleurodesis rates and long-term fluid prevention, and placement of an IPC to allow greater convenience and quality of life for the patient. This should also theoretically lead to reduced overall healthcare costs when compared to either individual method. Despite the potential for combining fluid management approached being recognised in the literature, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] there have been no studies to date to test this hypothesis, although ambulatory pleurodesis for malignant effusions was attempted in one small series by Saffran <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In this study, a closed-system pigtail catheter was inserted and pleurodesis was attempted at a later date using four grams of talc. Patients were managed as outpatients and the authors describe their method as being a viable alternative to traditional inpatient management. However, patient numbers were limited to 10 and there was no attempt at randomisation. The study took place before the widespread introduction of IPCs.</p><p>The IPC-PLUS trial aims to test the hypothesis that the combination of talc in addition to IPCs is superior to IPCs alone in the management of MPEs. This trial has the potential to significantly affect, on a global scale, the way in which such effusions are managed in the future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study questions</title><p>Our primary research question is, &#x02018;In patients with a proven MPE, does the use of talc as a sclerosant in conjunction with an IPC increase the number of patients achieving successful pleurodesis, when compared to using an IPC alone?&#x02019;</p><p>Our secondary research questions are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Does using talc and an IPC together alter the amount of pain and breathlessness a patient experiences, when compared to using an IPC alone?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Does the use of talc and an IPC together alter a patient&#x02019;s quality of life, when compared to using an IPC alone?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What are the medical complications of using talc in conjunction with an IPC?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What are the logistical and clinical difficulties with using talc in conjunction with an IPC?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Does the combination of talc and an IPC together influence the degree of fluid septation and loculation seen on thoracic ultrasound?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Does the baseline level of serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) correlate with the volume of pleural fluid drained and chance of successful pleurodesis?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Does pleural elastance during initial drainage correlate with lung entrapment and the chance of successful pleurodesis?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Is using talc in combination with IPC cost-effective when compared to IPC alone?</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Sample size and power calculation</title><p>Talc pleurodesis alone has been shown to be up to 90% efficacious in trial conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and we expect the combination of talc and IPC to be at least as effective as talc alone. IPCs used alone have a more variable range for pleurodesis efficacy, but suggest an average rate of around 50%.</p><p>Therefore, in order to detect a 25% difference in pleurodesis success at five weeks (using conservative estimates of 60% IPC alone versus 85% IPC and talc) with 90% power, a 5% significance level and 5% loss to follow-up, we would require 154 patients (77 in each arm).

Talc is a naturally occurring mineral which, when processed for medical use as Steritalc, takes the form of a white powder of controlled particle size (graded). It is not licensed in the United Kingdom but is commonly used for the induction of pleurodesis, usually to prevent recurrence of MPEs or pneumothoraces. Medicinal talc has been licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States since 2003. Prior to introduction into the pleural cavity it is reconstituted into slurry using an inert solvent such as 0.9% saline. The typical dose of talc is two to four grams. Common side effects following pleural administration of talc are mild pleuritic pain and low-grade fever.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study setting and design</title><p>The IPC-PLUS study is a non-commercial, patient-blind, multicentre, randomised controlled trial of a medicinal product.

This first drainage may be to the maximum clinically appropriate volume, with subsequent drainages to a maximum of 1,000 mls per drainage. The patient&#x02019;s fifth drainage can take place as part of their randomisation visit.</p><p>Patients will attend their local trial centre 10&#x000a0;days (+/&#x02212; one day, as above) after IPC insertion. Their pleural space should be drained to dryness, or as close to dryness as allowed by symptoms. Following this, they should undergo a chest X-ray (ideally posterior-anterior) and have an appointment with a member of the trial team, who will perform a standardised medical assessment. Quality of life will be assessed using the EQ-5D and QLQ-C30 questionnaires. The chest X-ray should be examined for evidence of lung entrapment and significant fluid. A thoracic ultrasound of the side where the IPC has been inserted should be performed, looking for evidence of fluid loculation and septation.</p><p>If there is evidence of significant lung entrapment (defined as &#x0003e;25% of the hemithorax without expanded lung visible on a chest X-ray, as judged by two separate clinicians) or significant pleural fluid (defined as pleural fluid, confirmed on thoracic ultrasound, occupying more than one third of the hemithorax as judged by two separate clinicians using visual estimation on a chest X-ray), then the patient should be excluded from randomisation. Patients who do not meet the criteria for randomisation should have their on-going care devolved to the appropriate local services. Patients may also be excluded for other clinical reasons not relating to the degree of lung entrapment or residual fluid. If a patient is eligible for trial continuation at this point then they should be randomised at the same visit and given the allocated treatment substance before returning home.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Randomisation, blinding and emergency unblinding</title><p>Those who are eligible for will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either receive intrapleural talc slurry (4&#x000a0;g Novatech Steritalc mixed with 50 mls 0.9% saline) via the IPC, or to receive a placebo instillation of 0.9% sterile saline alone.</p><p>Treatment allocation will be performed by an independent computer randomisation service, which will be accessed by the main trial coordination centre on behalf of recruitment centres following confirmation of suitability for randomisation. Minimisation with a random component will be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>The minimisation factors are:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Volume of pleural fluid removed in the first 10&#x000a0;days post IPC (&#x02264;1,999 mls or &#x02265;2,000 mls),</p></list-item><list-item><p>Malignancy subtype (ovarian and breast, mesothelioma or other), and</p></list-item><list-item><p>Day 10 chest X-ray appearance (expanded with no evidence of trapped lung or evidence of trapped lung but fits the criteria for randomisation).</p></list-item></list></p><p>The study is to be performed in a single blind fashion. Patients are to be kept unaware of their treatment allocation, but the physician and other healthcare professionals involved with administering the slurry or placebo are made aware of the allocation. A number of methods are to be used to reduce the likelihood of a patient learning of their allocation. These include:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Making the randomisation phone call in a separate room to the patient,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Preparing the slurry or placebo in a separate room to the patient and ensuring materials are covered before the patient is brought in,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Opaque syringes being used to make it less clear which substance is being administered and</p></list-item><list-item><p>The slurry or placebo being administered from behind the patient, with the patient facing forward.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Patients may have their treatment allocation revealed (unblinded) at any time according to clinical need. A 24-hour telephone number will be available for unblinding queries.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Post-randomisation</title><p>The administration of the randomised substance should be followed by an adequate flush to ensure as little as possible is left in the IPC line. Patients should then be observed for a minimum of two hours before being discharged home. Observations should include at least half-hourly measurements of pulse, blood pressure, temperature, pain score and respiratory rate. Patients must have their first post-randomisation drainage between 12 and 36&#x000a0;hours after instillation, and early communication with community nursing teams is vital to ensure this takes place.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Community drainage</title><p>Following randomisation, all patients should receive fluid drainage in the community, although if necessary patients may attend their local trial centre. Drainages will be done by an appropriately trained healthcare professional up to and including the day 28 follow-up visit. After this, until the end of the trial follow-up period, drainages may be performed by anyone with an appropriate level of training. This may include the patient&#x02019;s family or carers, but should not be the patient themselves. The frequency of drainage will be at the discretion of the patient and community team, but should occur at least twice per week, and should begin at three times per week. Drainage volumes will be recorded on each occasion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Clinical assessments (days 14, 28, 42, 56 and 70 post-randomisation)</title><p>The follow-up period for each patient is 10&#x000a0;weeks post-randomisation, or until death. During this time, the first clinical assessment will occur 14&#x000a0;days after randomisation, and at two-weekly intervals thereafter. The appointments scheduled for days 42 and 56 may take place over the telephone. Appointments on days 14, 28 and 70 must take place at the base hospital or satellite centre.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Face-to-face appointments (mandatory on days 14, 28 and 70, optional on days 42 and 56)</title><p>Before each assessment, but following arrival at the trial centre, the patient&#x02019;s IPC should be drained to dryness by a trained member of staff.

If a drain is to be removed, patients should be given an appointment to have this done within 14&#x000a0;days of the clinical assessment at which this decision was taken. Any patient who has a drain removed during their post-randomisation trial period will continue to undergo planned follow-up for the full 70&#x000a0;days.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Blockage of drains</title><p>All care should be taken to ensure IPCs do not become blocked, beginning with an adequate flush at the end of sclerosant administration. If there is a suspicion that a blockage has occurred then standard local unblocking procedures should be followed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Biological samples and storage</title><p>During the trial baseline assessment, all patients should have standard blood tests for full blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver function, clotting function and C-reactive protein taken if there are no results available from within the previous 24&#x000a0;hours. In addition to these, at the research sites at North Bristol and Oxford, one ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), one serum gel tube and one citrate tube of blood should be taken. During IPC insertion, one EDTA, one serum gel tube and one citrate sample tube of pleural fluid should also be collected from patients at the North Bristol and Oxford sites. All such trial samples should be processed and stored as per the appropriate standard operating procedure.</p><p>At the North Bristol and Oxford research sites, prior to each trial follow-up appointment (every two weeks for 10&#x000a0;weeks), additional samples of pleural fluid should be collected during IPC drainage, before being processed and stored in the same manner as above.</p><p>Participants will give their permission for linked anonymous blood and pleural samples to be stored and analysed at North Bristol NHS Trust (NBT), or, if from another site, for those samples to be transferred to NBT for storage and analysis. Samples will be stored in a dedicated freezer in the University of Bristol laboratory on the NBT site. Samples will be stored, anonymised and eventually destroyed in line with local policy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Ultrasound scans</title><p>All ultrasound scans must be performed by fully trained operators (with sufficient experience to scan and interpret images independently) on the local research team. Scans will be used to assess the presence and degree of pleural fluid complexity, and fluid depth.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Visual Analogue Scale scoring</title><p>All patients will complete a VAS assessment of thoracic pain and breathlessness during their baseline assessment. After IPC insertion, beginning the following morning, patients should repeat this assessment using the documentation provided. VAS scores should then be recorded on a daily basis for the duration of trial involvement, with recordings being made each morning. If IPC drainage is due to take place that day, then the score should be noted before the drainage takes place.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>End of trial</title><p>The trial will cease recruitment once the target of 154 randomised patients has been met, or if the Trial Steering Committee feels the interim analysis after 100 patients justifies early cessation. The provisional end of trial date will therefore be 10&#x000a0;weeks after the randomisation of the final trial patient. At the end of each patient&#x02019;s follow-up period they will be stratified as &#x02018;alive&#x02019; or &#x02018;dead&#x02019;, and survival data collated. Further information regarding participants&#x02019; health status and survival may be obtained by accessing the NHS central register. This will require consent to be given separate to trial involvement. Those who still have an IPC <italic>in situ</italic> will have their care devolved to the appropriate local services.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Patient withdrawal and loss to follow-up</title><p>Patients will have originally consented to trial follow-up procedures, including sample collection, storage and analysis where appropriate. Patients have the right to withdraw from the trial at any point. A request by a patient to withdrawal does not have to be justified and will not affect future or on-going care. In the event of withdrawal, any details available regarding the reason(s) should be recorded in the patient&#x02019;s CRF. Patients may still be stratified as &#x02018;alive&#x02019; or &#x02018;dead&#x02019; at the end of their follow-up period, unless consent for clinical data use is withdrawn. Patients who withdraw before randomisation will not be included in the final analysis.</p><p>If a patient moves to an area outside of the trial centre catchment, every effort should be made to continue follow-up in conjunction with the new local services, or via the new GP.

For the primary outcome measure, successful pleurodesis will be defined as the collection of less than, or equal to, 50 mls of pleural fluid on three consecutive occasions, with chest opacification on the side of the IPC less than 25%, as judged by two independent clinicians, who should be blind to treatment allocation. Information on drainage volumes will be collected in the community and during follow-up visits as described above. The X-ray for chest opacification must have been taken after the third consecutive occasion of collection of less than 50 mls of fluid, and within the 10-week follow-up period. All three occasions of collection of less than 50 mls of fluid should also occur within the 10-week follow-up period.</p><p>Patients who drain less than 50 mls of fluid on three or more occasions but who continue to have greater than 25% pleural opacification on a chest X-ray due to pleural fluid (as proven by thoracic ultrasound), will be defined as having an unsuccessful pleurodesis. If there is a clinical suspicion that the drain may be blocked then appropriate attempts to resolve this should be made prior to a definition being made.</p><p>The achievement of pleurodesis should be dated to the first drainage of less than or equal to 50 mls. Even if patients achieve the requirements for pleurodesis during the trial period, they will continue to receive fortnightly follow-up visits as originally planned until the 70-day follow-up period is complete.</p><p>Patients who die during the 10-week trial period will be assessed for whether they achieved pleurodesis success prior to death. This requires the collection of less than, or equal to, 50 mls of pleural fluid on three consecutive occasions, with chest opacification on the side of the IPC less than 25%, as judged by two independent clinicians, who should be blind to treatment allocation, with the X-ray having been taken after the third consecutive collection volume of less than 50 mls.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Secondary endpoints</title><p>The secondary endpoints for this trial are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Self-reported quality of life status, measured at 14, 28, 42, 56 and 70&#x000a0;days, using the EQ-5D and QLQ-C30 health questionnaires.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Self-reported VAS scores, measured daily from randomisation to 10&#x000a0;weeks post-randomisation, for thoracic pain and breathlessness.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Total volume of pleural fluid drained from randomisation to 10&#x000a0;weeks post-randomisation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>All-cause mortality up to 10&#x000a0;weeks post-randomisation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Number of hospital inpatient bed-days required from randomisation to 10&#x000a0;weeks post-randomisation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Degree of loculation of pleural fluid following talc instillation as judged by thoracic ultrasound and septation score at two-weekly intervals for the 10-week follow-up period.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Pleurodesis success at 10&#x000a0;weeks post-randomisation, as defined by consecutive fluid volume measurement.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Number of pleural procedures to relieve pleural fluid, excluding IPC drainage, from randomisation to up to 10&#x000a0;weeks.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Pleurodesis success at five and 10&#x000a0;weeks post-randomisation, as defined by total volume of fluid collected over two consecutive weeks.</p></list-item></list></p><p>As part of a secondary analysis, patients who have recorded drainages of less than or equal to a total of 250 mls of fluid over two consecutive weeks during their follow-up period (with appropriate radiological findings) will also be defined as having a successful pleurodesis. The period of two consecutive weeks may begin with any drainage which is undertaken during the post-randomisation trial period, and ends two weeks later on the same day of the week. The drainage volume recorded on this final day is included in the total volume for the two-week period. Patients must be drained no less frequently than twice per week.</p><p>In order to be defined as having a successful pleurodesis, a patient&#x02019;s chest X-ray must have chest opacification on the side of the IPC of less than 25%, as judged by two independent clinicians, who should be blind to treatment allocation. The X-ray for chest opacification must have been taken after the last drainage of the two-week period, and within the overall 10-week follow-up period.</p><p>For patients who successfully drain less than or equal to 250 mls of fluid in a two-week period, the date of pleurodesis is defined as the day of the first drainage in that period. All drainages which count towards the total volume must occur within the study period.</p><p>Patients who die during the follow-up period will also be assessed for pleurodesis using measurements collected prior to death.

Due to the population of patients involved in the IPC-PLUS trial, a high number of adverse events are to be expected. Many of these will not be related to the investigational medicinal product administration or trial-related procedures, but will be as a direct consequence of the patient&#x02019;s underlying malignancy. Other events may occur as a result of a trial-related intervention, but are well-documented and regarded as normal reactions in the context of talc administration. Expected adverse events in these settings are:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Death due to underlying malignancy;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Admission due to underlying malignancy;</p></list-item><list-item><p>New fever after instillation of slurry or placebo (&#x02265;38&#x000b0;C);</p></list-item><list-item><p>New mild tachycardia after instillation of slurry or placebo(&#x02265;20 beats per minute over baseline);</p></list-item><list-item><p>New pleuritic chest pain after instillation of slurry or placebo, requiring simple analgesia (simple analgesia is defined as any medication which is not a morphine derivative or equivalent);</p></list-item><list-item><p>New tachypnoea after instillation of slurry or placebo (increase in respiratory rate of five or more breaths per minute over baseline) and</p></list-item><list-item><p>New hypoxia after instillation of slurry or placebo (to saturation of &#x02264;92% on air, or to a level requiring additional supplemental oxygen).</p></list-item></list></p><p>If any doubt in the causality of an event exists the local investigator should inform the trial coordinator who will notify the chief investigator. Pharmaceutical companies and/or other clinicians may be asked to advise in some cases.

In the event that no agreement is made, the MHRA will be informed of both points of view.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec36" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The IPC-PLUS trial is a multicentre, randomised controlled trial which has the potential to significantly affect how patients with malignant pleural disease are treated. Although the TIME2 study published by Davies <italic>et al</italic>. suggested that first-line therapy for MPE might include IPCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], they are currently viewed by many practitioners as predominantly a second-line treatment in those patients who have not had success with a talc pleurodesis.</p><p>The combination of talc and an IPC has been used in anecdotal reports, but this is the first study to examine its utility in a robust way. Theoretically, the addition of talc to an IPC should allow for pleurodesis rates similar to that seen in bedside slurry to be maintained, but with the added benefit of outpatient management. This approach is likely to be applicable to a wide range of patients, including those with shorter life expectancies, those who want to minimise the duration of an IPC being in place or to those who have a strong preference for talc therapy but do not want to spend time in hospital. Given both the increasing use of IPCs worldwide and the availability of talc as a sclerosing agent, a positive trial outcome will likely have a global impact. A negative trial outcome, or if it is shown that the addition of talc via an IPC is detrimental to patients, would still be useful information as there remains a dearth of knowledge regarding this important population of patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Trial status</title><p>IPC-PLUS gained REC approval in May 2012 and MHRA approval in June 2012. The first recruitment site gained local approval in July 2012 and opened shortly after. There are currently 16 active recruitment sites in the United Kingdom, with a further three sites in the set-up phase. Recruitment will only begin at future sites once all necessary local approvals have been granted. As of July 2014, the study has enrolled 98 patients with 60 randomisations. The trial is due to complete in May 2015.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>CRF</term><def><p>Case report form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CT</term><def><p>Computed tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECOG/WHO</term><def><p>Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group/World Health Organisation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EDTA</term><def><p>Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQ-5D</term><def><p>EuroQol 5D health questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IPC</term><def><p>Indwelling pleural catheter</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MHRA</term><def><p>The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MPE</term><def><p>Malignant pleural effusion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NBT</term><def><p>North Bristol NHS Trust</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NHS</term><def><p>National Health Service</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NT-proBNP</term><def><p>N-Terminal pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PA</term><def><p>Posterior-Anterior</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QoL</term><def><p>Quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>REC</term><def><p>Research Ethics Committee</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p>Visual analogue scale.</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>Dr Maskell has sat on advisory board meetings, and has received unrestricted research funding and research consumables from CareFusion (IL, USA).
