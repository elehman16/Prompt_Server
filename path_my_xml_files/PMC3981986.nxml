Ciliopathies include polycystic kidney disease (PKD), a pathology associated with vascular hypertension. We previously showed that cilia length regulates cilia function, and cilia function is required for nitric oxide (NO) biosynthesis in endothelial cells. Because patients with PKD show abnormal sensory cilia function, the aim of our current study was to search for a targeted therapy focused on primary cilia, which we refer to as &#x02018;ciliotherapy&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results</title><p>In the present studies, our <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses refined fenoldopam as an equipotent and more specific dopaminergic agonist to regulate cilia length and function. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> studies indicated that fenoldopam increased cilia length and serum NO thereby reducing blood pressure in a PKD mouse model. Our crossover, multicenter, double-blind and placebo-controlled clinical study further indicated that cilia-targeting therapy showed an overall reduction in mean arterial pressure in PKD patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall, our studies provide the first evidence of ciliotherapy as an innovative intervention in patients with abnormal primary cilia.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Primary cilium</kwd><kwd>Blood pressure</kwd><kwd>Mechanosensor</kwd><kwd>Mechanotransduction</kwd><kwd>Chemosensor</kwd><kwd>Fluid-shear stress</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is the most common life-threatening hereditary genetic disease, compared to the combined numbers of individuals affected by cystic &#x0fb01;brosis, Downs syndrome, hemophilia, muscular dystrophy, and sickle cell anemia.

In our clinical study, domperidone was also used as a peripheral D2 dopaminergic antagonist for two reasons. First, it prevents some adverse effects such as nausea induced by levodopa.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>,<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> Second, by blocking D2 receptors, it potentiates activation of the D1 receptors, including DR5, in the peripheral vascular system. From our clinical data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="jgc-11-01-063-t02">Table 2</xref>), the baseline serum creatinine level was significantly higher in the PKD group than in the HTN group. This suggests a progressive deterioration in renal function in PKD, consistent with the imaging studies that indicate the presence of renal cysts in our patients.</p><p>All physicians (Altaei QH, Alshimmari IK, Alsaidi MM and Khammas H) from different clinics or hospitals enrolled participations suitable to our study criteria independently, and they administered the interventions to the participants. The random allocation sequence of participants was generated by Kathem S and supervised by Ismail SH. Thus, neither physicians nor patients knew the subgroup classifications or treatment types. Because the steady state concentration of drug depends of its half-life, levodopa with a short half-life would reaches steady state within two days. As such, effects of levodopa on vasculatures should be apparent within a week of our study, which serves as an endpoint of our study. Blood pressure, heart rate and blood samples were taken before treatment (baseline), two hours after the first treatment, and two hours after the last dose on the seventh day of the treatment period.

Levodopa, a dopaminergic agonist, was selected because it is clinically safe for convenient oral use; however, it functions as a non-specific dopaminergic agonist for DR5 activation.

More importantly, DR5 activation increased cilia length, partially rescued mechanosensitivity of PKD endothelial cells to fluid-shear stress, and thereby decreased the overall mean arterial pressure. In the clinical study, we showed that hypertensive PKD patients had a significantly lower baseline level of NO compared to hypertensive-only patients. More importantly, modest dosage of levodopa at 50 mg or 100 mg decreased the mean arterial blood pressure in the PKD group. We also confirm that the baseline level of ADMA, an endogenous inhibitor for eNOS and a marker for endothelial dysfunction, is significantly higher in the PKD group compared to the hypertensive-only group.</p><p>Consistent with the <italic>in vitro</italic> study, our <italic>in vivo</italic> data suggest that fenoldopam could extend the length of primary cilia and induce a greater NO production. These would ultimately decrease the overall mean arterial pressure in <italic>Pkd1</italic> mouse model. Of note is that fenoldopam at 1.5 mg/kg showed a trend of lower blood pressure in wild-type mice, albeit this decrease was not statistically significant. One possible explanation is that the baseline vascular tone in wild-type mice was already low. As a result, no significant effect of increasing NO on vasodilation was observed. It is worth mentioning that the baseline serum levels of NO were significantly lower in <italic>Pkd1</italic> mice compared to wild-type.</p><p>ADMA acting as a physiological inhibitor of NO biosynthesis has been used as a marker for endothelial function in the clinical setting.<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> Plasma ADMA levels are highly correlated with the severity of endothelial dysfunction, and high ADMA level further impairs blood flow and accelerates atherogenesis through endothelial dysfunction.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> Thus, our clinical data indicated that compared to the hypertensive-only group, the PKD group had an abnormality in regulating NO biosynthesis. This is consistent with our previous study indicating that vascular-lining endothelia from patients with PKD are dysfunctional due to their non-responsiveness to flow-induce NO biosynthesis.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref></p><p>In particular, the mechanism of dopamine receptor, especially DR5, in blood pressure regulation still remains unknown. Although it has been propose that peripheral dopaminergic activation increases renal blood flow,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> we propose that this vasodilation effect of dopamine on renal arteries acts by sensitizing primary cilia function. In our study, levodopa had a minimal effect on individual systolic or diastolic blood pressure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="jgc-11-01-063-t02">Table 2</xref>). Without doubt, a more specific dopaminergic agonist for DR5 may be more suitable for therapeutic management of hypertensive PKD patients. Unfortunately, fenoldopam was not approved for use in our study. We did not seek for a higher dosage of levodopa due to the safety concerns in our patients. Nonetheless, our clinical study sheds light on the possibility for cilia-targeted therapy in PKD patients and possibly in general hypertensive patients.</p><p>In summary, our results show that fenoldopam increased cilia length, which further enhanced the mechanosensory function of cilia in NO biosynthesis. Results from a less complex <italic>in vivo</italic> rodent system with endothelial cilia dysfunction support the idea that a DR5-cilia-NO axis plays an important role in regulating blood pressure in PKD. In a more complex clinical setting, dopaminergic receptor activation showed a potential therapeutic benefit on overall arterial blood pressure. Together, our studies serve as a proof of principle for targeted-clinical therapy on primary cilia as a novel mechanism to modulate the progression of a ciliopathy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are particularly grateful to all the patients participated in our study.
