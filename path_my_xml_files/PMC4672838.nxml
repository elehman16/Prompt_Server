These are presented with different physical characteristics, colors, and shades. Currently, four types of direct esthetic restorations are commonly used in dentistry which includes - resin composites, poly-acid modified resin composites (copolymer), glass-ionomers and resin-modified glass-ionomers. Resin composites were introduced in the early 1970s and are widely used as direct esthetic restorations.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> However, composite restorations have several significant disadvantages despite their continuous improvements.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Despite the fact that composites are currently the most preferred material for restorations, the polymerization shrinkage of 2.6-7.1% prompting microleakage is one of the most often observed issues.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Microleakage is one of major drawbacks of composites which lead to the development of recurrent caries, post-operative sensitivity, enamel fracture, marginal staining, and eventual failure of restorations.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Studies have reported several ways to decrease this problem such as slowing down the composite polymerization rate, utilizing an incremental build-up technique or placement of low modulus in-between layer, and reducing the C factor (the ratio of bonded to non-bonded restoration surfaces).<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Silorane-based dental resin composite materials introduced to clinical dentistry with an intention to reduce the polymerization shrinkage. Its matrix consists of siloxanes and oxiranes, which differ from the conventional methacrylate (Bis-GMA) composite matrix. Manufactures claimed that the silorane-based composites produce low-polymerization shrinkage of &#x0003c;1% volume by using Archimedes&#x02019; method. Silorane-based composites polymerize by open ring polymerization reaction minimizing polymerization shrinkage and polymerization stress. Thus, it provided a high-performance bond to the tooth with significantly lower shrinkage than other methacrylate composites.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Moreover, oxirane and siloxane were hydrophobic in nature making silorane based composites chemically stable in aqueous solution with less water sorption. Additionally, silorane-based dental resin composites showed less microleakage and cusp deflection compared to other Bis-GMA composite materials.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>By utilizing Bis-GMA based technology, nontraditional &#x0201c;nano-hybrids&#x0201d; composite materials have been developed. These contained sub-micrometer particles (Nano fillers) to further improve the physical and optical properties of the resins. Nanohybrid composites with Bis-GMA base has been recommended for both anterior and posterior restorations. Further, it has been improved to overcome composite drawbacks of recurrent caries, post-operative sensitivity, enamel fracture, marginal staining, microleakage and eventual failure of restorations.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of reported studies on the comparative evaluation of microleakage of methacrylate based nanohybrid and microhybrid composite materials with that of silorane based microhybrid composite materials. Hence, the present study is aimed to evaluate the microleakage of silorane based (Filtek P90, using two-step self-etching prime and bond adhesive system) composite material with that of methacrylate based (Filtek Z250 using single bond universal total etching technique, and Filtek Z250 XT using single bond universal self-etching technique) composite materials in Class I restorations by using stereomicroscope.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Sixty extracted intact upper premolar teeth were collected, and removal of calculus and debris was carried out by hand scaling. Teeth were kept in 5% sodium chloride solution at 37&#x000b0;C for the duration of 1-month. Teeth were prepared approximately 4 mm in length mesio-distally, 2 mm bucco-palatally in width and 3 mm in depth to receive standardized Class I restoration by using prefabricated polyvinylsiloxane mold of 2 mm &#x000d7; 4 mm. The corresponding depth of the cavity was obtained with a diamond bur marked 3 mm from the tip of the bur. Marking on the bur was carried out by using carborundom disk (B&#x00026;D Technologies CO, Nanyi Street, Qiaonan, PanYu, Guangzhou, 511400 China). All the Class I cavities was prepared by using high-speed hand piece (NSK, Avtec Dental, Mount Pleasant, SC, U.S.A.), under constant water irrigation. New bur was supplanted after preparing five teeth. 90&#x000b0; cavosurface margins were prepared, and the dimensions of the cavities were checked with a Boley gauge. Specimen measurement tolerance of 0 &#x000b1; 0.3 mm was accepted in the study. Later teeth were randomly divided into three (n = 20) groups to receive restorative materials.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Group A</title><p>Filtek Z250 resin composite shade A2 (3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA) with single universal bond (3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA) was used as per the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. A Phosphoric acid etching gel 35% (Scotchbond Universal Etchant, 3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA) was applied to the prepared tooth structure for 15 s. Rinsed with water and dried carefully without incorporating oil or water. Precautions were taken to avoid over drying of the cavity. Then, the bonding agent applied with a scrubbing motion for 20 s and exposed to the gentle stream of air for 5 s, followed by light curing for 10 s. Filtek Z250 was placed in a cavity in two increments with each increment of 2 mm size as per the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions and light cured for 40 s.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Group B</title><p>Filtek Z250 XT resin composite shade A2 (3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA) with single bond universal self-etch (3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA) was used according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. The bonding agent was applied with a scrubbing motion for 20 s and the gentle air stream was passed for 5 s before it could be light-cured for 10 s.

The integrated radiometer was utilized to continuous monitoring of the light intensity. Specimens were kept in distilled water for 24 h at 37&#x000b0;C. Teeth were then subjected to thermocycling, according to the International Organization for Standardization standard 11405 for 500 cycles at 5C-55C with a 30-s dwell time.</p><p>Before the evaluation of the microleakage, the root apices of the teeth were completely sealed with sticky wax and two coats of nail varnish was applied over the crown root surfaces except for 1 mm around the restoration margins. Teeth were then drenched in 2% methylene blue dye (pH = 7) (Merck Specialties Private Ltd, Mumbai, India) at 37&#x000b0;C for 24 h,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> washed and dried. Later on, teeth were embedded in the acrylic resin block sectioned longitudinally in bucco-lingual direction with a diamond saw mounted on a cutting machine (Isomet 1000; Buehler 41 Waukegan Road Lake Bluff, Illinois USA). Deepest dye penetrated section was selected to represent the tooth. Stereomicroscopic (Motic Microscopes, China) examination was carried out to determine the extent of dye penetration at &#x000d7;40 magnification based on five-point scale.</p><p>

These Class I cavities was chosen due to the high C-factor that leads to greater polymerization stresses,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> as a result of confined contraction by number of bonded surfaces.</p><p>All the three composite materials utilized in this study exhibited some degree of leakage. We did not observe any significant differences in microleakage among the three composite resin systems. This could be due to the use of high intensity light in a continuous mode, self-etch hydrophilic adhesive systems, the increased C-factor of Class I cavity and the relatively excess concentration of methylene blue dye used in this study.</p><p>The results of this study showed that the novel low-shrink composite restorative material Filtek P90 showed microleakage score very similar to Z250 with total etch single universal bond and Z250 XT with self-etch systems after thermocycling.</p><p>Assumption that microleakage of the cavities restored with the Filtek P90 (silorane) compared to the other resin-based composite materials was due to the innate ring-opening polymerization reaction of the silorane monomers, which make-up the volumetric reduction as the molecules approximate each other. However, radical polymerization of the other resin based composites is obvious with a decrease in polymerization shrinkage stresses at the tooth/restoration border. Therefore, methacrylate based composite resins better withstand thermocycling fatigue at the tooth/restoration interface.</p><p>Our study is in agreement with the study reported by Ernst, who presented no differences in microleakage of teeth restored with silorane and methacrylate composite (Tetric Ceram) with adhesive (Clearfil SE Bond) system.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This finding was due to the fact that author used an all-in-one (7<sup>th</sup> generation) experimental bond of silorane before produced by the company. Whereas in the present study new bond produced with silorane composite system consisting of two-step and two components (6<sup>th</sup> generation) was utilized. However, we disagree with study results of Palin <italic>et al.</italic>, who have reported that the microleakage of silorane based composite material was lesser than that of methacrylate based composite after occlusal loading forces.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Within the limitation of this study, we conclude that all the restorative systems tested in this study exhibited microleakage.
