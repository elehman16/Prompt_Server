This study aimed to determine the role of the sciatic and obturator nerve blocks (in addition to femoral block) in providing painless arthroscopic medial meniscus trimming/repair.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The Research and Ethical Committee of Abu Dhabi Knee and Sports Medicine Center approved this prospective controlled randomized double-blind study (#06:06:2012). Patients who had been scheduled to knee arthroscopy were planned to be included in the study group. Only patients with a radiological diagnosis of medial meniscus tear (with or without coexisting intra articular pathologies) were included. After obtaining the patients' written informed consent; the patients were randomly allocated (by the use of sealed envelopes) into three equal groups (FSO, FS, and FO). In the FSO group, the patients received femoral, sciatic, and obturator nerve blocks. In the FS group, the patients received femoral and sciatic nerve blocks. In the FO group, the patients received femoral and obturator nerve blocks in addition to lateral portal site infiltration. For blinding, placebo blocks were performed.</p><p>In the induction room, after application of routine monitoring and supplemental oxygen, all the patients received 3 mg of midazolam IV. Under aseptic condition, all blocks were performed using an S-Nerve ultrasound machine (SonoSite Inc., Bothell, WA, USA), curved (C60, 5-2 MHz) and linear (HFL 38, 13-6 MHz) probes, 20G 12 cm and 21G 5 cm needles (Locoplex, Vygon, Ecouen, France). The sciatic nerve was identified at the presacral area; deep and medial to the posterior border of ischium.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] After electrical confirmation, 20 ml of 1.7% lidocaine (with epinephrine 5 mcg/ml) was slowly injected. The femoral nerve was blocked at the level of the inguinal crease, lateral to the femoral artery, using 15 ml of 1% lidocaine.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The obturator nerve was blocked between the pectineus and obturator externus muscles using 10 ml of 1% lidocaine (with epinephrine 5 mcg/ml).[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] All the above blocks were performed as described in the three groups, except that the sciatic and the obturator nerve blocks were performed using normal saline in FO and FS groups, respectively. The lateral portal site was infiltrated (in the first 20 patients) with 10 ml of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine in FO group or with 10 ml of normal saline in FS and FSO groups.</p><p>The adequacies of the nerve blocks were assessed every 10 min until successful blocks were achieved or to a maximum of 30 min. Successful femoral, sciatic, and obturator nerve blocks were defined as inability to extend a fully flexed knee, to flex the foot (plantar and dorsal flexion), and inability (or marked weakness) to adduct an abducted hip, respectively.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Incomplete blocks (corresponding to each group) were supplemented before taking the patient to the operating room. The nerve blocks, assessments, and supplementations were performed by a single operator (aviation maintenance technician).</p><p>No intraoperative sedations were used. The surgeon was asked to manage coexisting intra articular pathologies, when present, before managing the medial meniscus tear. Intraoperative pain was assessed using visual analog scale (VAS); 0 = No pain, 10 = Worst imaginable pain. A VAS up to three was considered as discomfort. A VAS more than three was considered as pain that was managed with 10 mcg of sufentanil IV. If this could not control pain, general anesthesia (GA) was induced. Intraoperative pain, its causative surgical maneuver and any complications were recorded. All the patients were assessed neurologically before hospital discharge and also during the physiotherapy visits for 3 weeks after surgery. All the intraoperative measurements were performed by the assistant not aware of the used block solutions.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Based on alpha and beta levels of 0.05 and 0.2, respectively, it was estimated that at least 40 patients were needed in each group to detect the difference in the frequency of intraoperative pain, assuming its average incidences in FSO group and FS group were 7% and 31%, respectively.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> for Windows v16 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

The surgically dissected intra articular structures and the required knee positions are varied with the existing pathology.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The knee joint is supplied by the femoral, sciatic, and obturator nerves.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The femoral nerve innervates the majority of the joint and the skin at the medial portal site.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Hence, its successful block is important for painless knee surgery. The sciatic nerve supplies both the knee joint (via six articular branches) and the skin at the lateral portal site (via the lateral sural cutaneous nerve).[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Therefore without a sciatic nerve block, painless knee arthroscopy could not be achieved in FO group. It was reported that psoas compartment or femoral nerve blocks (without sciatic nerve block) can provide adequate anesthesia for knee arthroscopy.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] However, in these studies; inhalational, intravenous, or intra articular anesthetics were added perioperatively.</p><p>The obturator nerve supplies the posterior capsule and cruciate ligaments and may innervate the skin at the medial aspect of the knee.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] However, these structures are not dissected during the usual arthroscopy, therefore, a combined femoral and sciatic nerve block (without obturator nerve block) was reported to provide adequate anesthesia for knee arthroscopy in some studies.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] However, other studies showed that some patients (8% up to 100%) still had intraoperative pain and required opioid supplementation.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Unfortunately, in the later studies, pain was correlated only to the type of anesthesia but not to the precisely performed arthroscopic procedure. In FS group, combined femoral and sciatic nerve blocks (without obturator nerve block) provided excellent anesthesia for surgical management of different intra articular pathologies with the exception of the medial meniscus trimming/repair where 22.5% of the patients experienced pain. This associated pain was mainly related to the knee positioning.</p><p>Unlike other knee positions (as flexion, extension or figure of four), the valgus position is a nonphysiological position where the medial collateral ligament (MCL) is stretched.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] This may be responsible for the associated knee pain. Innervation of the MCL, to our knowledge, has not been described. However, it is derived embryologically from the adductor magnus muscle.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Therefore, the obturator nerve may play a role in its innervation. This may explain why the valgus position associated pain was less frequent in FSO group as compared to FS group.</p><p>The performance times of different block combinations were not measured in this study. However, the ultrasound (US)-guided obturator nerve block is a simple block.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] It is performed using the same position, skin preparation, draping, and US probe as that used for femoral nerve block. Therefore, adding an obturator nerve block to a combined femoral and sciatic nerve blocks can provide a reliable anesthesia of the knee without apparent significant prolongation of the whole block time. However, the risk of overdose local anesthetic toxicity must be always considered. No complications were reported, however, the majority of the patients in this study were middle-aged athletes. The tourniquet was not inflated in any patient; therefore, the current results may or may not be applicable when the tourniquet inflation is needed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Adding a sciatic nerve block to the femoral nerve block is important for painless knee arthroscopy. Further adding of an obturator nerve block may be needed when a valgus knee position is required to manage the medial meniscus tear.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and
