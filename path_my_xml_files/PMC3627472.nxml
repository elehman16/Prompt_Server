It is commonly used in doses of 1&#x02013;2 &#x003bc;g per kg per dose in children, or 50&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;g in adults, every 2&#x02013;3 hours as required.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dddt-7-317">1</xref> Among the current products on the market, fentanyl is the only opioid formulated for transmucosal administration. The lollipop or lozenge formulation (Actiq&#x000ae;, Abbott Laboratories Inc, Abbott Park, IL, USA), known as oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate, was designed to allow rapid absorption of fentanyl through the mucosa as a result of its lipophilicity and appropriate molecular weight.<sup>23</sup> However, this dosage form stimulates saliva production and swallowing, such that some fentanyl is swallowed and metabolized due to a significant first-pass effect. Typical opioid dose-related side effects occur.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-dddt-7-317">4</xref></p><p>An effervescent buccal fentanyl tablet (Fentora&#x000ae;, Cephalon Inc, Frazer, PA, USA) is based on a proprietary OraVescent&#x000ae; drug delivery system (Cima Labs Inc, Brooklyn Park, MN, USA) that changes the local pH, the purpose of which is to enhance the absorption of fentanyl through the buccal mucosa. Pharmacokinetic data from effervescent buccal fentanyl tablet studies show that fentanyl is rapidly absorbed, with a time to maximum concentration of 35&#x02013;45 minutes and an average onset of analgesia at approximately 15 minutes. The side effects are also typical of opioid analgesics.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-dddt-7-317">5</xref> Another formulation, developed as a buccal-soluble fentanyl film, shows an absolute bioavailability of 71%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-dddt-7-317">6</xref> Fentanyl is clearly an effective analgesic when administered via the oral cavity.</p><p>Interest in noninvasive but fast-acting formulations for opioid administration has generated investigation of the sublingual route.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-dddt-7-317">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-dddt-7-317">8</xref> Compared with the transmucosal and buccal routes, the sublingual route may be even more attractive for fentanyl delivery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-dddt-7-317">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-dddt-7-317">11</xref> Clinical studies have shown that sublingual fentanyl formulations give rise to detectable plasma concentrations (C<sub>first</sub>) 8&#x02013;11 minutes after administration, but there are no data on its bioavailability.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-dddt-7-317">10</xref> We observed that a sublingual fentanyl wafer had an absolute bioavailability of 78.9% in healthy volunteers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-dddt-7-317">11</xref> In addition, fentanyl is particularly suitable for sublingual administration because it lacks the bitter taste of some other opioids.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-dddt-7-317">12</xref></p><p>This study describes the development and evaluation of the physicochemical properties of a sublingual fentanyl wafer, including a pilot investigation of its bioavailability and pharmacokinetic profile in surgical patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Fentanyl powder was purchased from Professional Compounding Centers of America (Houston, TX, USA). Intravenous fentanyl was purchased from Mayne Pharma Ltd (Melbourne, Australia) as Fentanyl DBL 500 &#x003bc;g in 10 mL. Amylogum&#x000ae; CLS was obtained from Avebe Food (Veendam, The Netherlands). D-Mannitol, D-lactose, and glycine were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). Sodium carboxymethylcellulose was purchased from BDH (Poole, UK). Avicel&#x000ae; PH 101 and polyethylene glycol 2000 were obtained from Fluka (Steinheim, Germany). All other chemicals were purchased commercially as analytical grade reagents.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of fentanyl wafer</title><p>The fentanyl (0.12% as the citrate salt) wafer was prepared by freeze-drying an aqueous solution using carboxymethylcellulose (1.62% w/w) and Amylogum (13.16% w/w) as matrix forming agents, lactose (30.87% w/w), mannitol (46.48% w/w), and microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel PH101, 1.55% w/w) as filling agents, glycine (3.1% w/w) as an anticollapsing agent, and polyethylene glycol 2000 (3.1% w/w) as a lubricant. The formulae for the ingredients were all dry weight. Amylogum and carboxymethylcellulose were first dissolved in MilliQ water (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) at 50&#x000b0;C, and when the solution had cooled to room temperature, polyethylene glycol 2000, glycine, Avicel PH101, lactose, and mannitol were added individually, stirring mechanically to obtain a homogenous mixture. Fentanyl (as the citrate salt) was subsequently dissolved in the mixture by stirring (freely soluble; the solubility of the citrate salt in water is 1 in 40 mL).</p><p>The resulting mixture was transferred by pipette and accurately weighed into preformed foil blister pack wells, resulting in a fentanyl dose of 50 &#x003bc;g per wafer, before freezing at &#x02212;30&#x000b0;C for approximately 24 hours. After freezing, the sample was freeze-dried (Dynavac Engineering Pty Ltd, Bayswater, Australia) for 24 hours. The prepared sample was subsequently stored in a desiccator over silica gel at a room temperature of 22&#x000b0;C &#x000b1; 1&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of wafers</title><sec><title>Uniformity of weight</title><p>The uniformity of the weight of the fentanyl wafer was tested in accordance with the British Pharmacopoeia 2009 test.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-dddt-7-317">13</xref> That is, 20 wafers were individually weighed, and the average weight and relative standard deviation was calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Friability</title><p>The strength of the fentanyl wafer, ie, its ability to be reduced from a solid matrix into smaller pieces or powder, was measured. The test<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-dddt-7-317">13</xref> was also conducted according to the method (ie, friability of uncoated tablets), using a friability tester (Erweka GmbH, Heusenstamm, Germany). A sample of 20 fentanyl wafers was weighed accurately and placed in the apparatus. A rotation time of 4 minutes at 25 rpm was used. Whole fentanyl wafers were removed and reweighed, and the percentage weight loss was calculated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Moisture analysis</title><p>The moisture content of the fentanyl wafer after freeze-drying was analyzed using a 870 Karl Fisher Titrino Plus device (Metrohm Ag, Filderstadt, Germany). A fentanyl wafer was weighed and powdered, then dispensed into the cell containing Hydranal&#x000ae; methanol (Sigma-Aldrich) and titrated using Hydranal Composite A. The test results are presented as the mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (n = 4).</p></sec><sec><title>Scanning electron microscopy</title><p>Surface morphology and a cross-section of samples from randomly selected wafers were observed by scanning electron microscopy (Zeiss, EVO 40 XVP, Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, UK). Cross-sectional samples were prepared by cutting a thin slice of the wafer using a scalpel. Samples were then coated with carbon prior to examination. The accelerating voltage was 10 kV.</p></sec><sec><title>Powder x-ray diffraction</title><p>Powder x-ray diffraction experiments were performed using a D8 Advance instrument (Bruker, Karlsrube, Germany) with a LynEye detector. The radiation used was nickel-filtered CuK&#x003b1;, which was generated using an acceleration voltage of 40 kV and a cathode current of 40 mA.

The temperature of the medium was 37&#x000b0;C &#x000b1; 0.5&#x000b0;C. A fentanyl wafer was used to determine the amount of drug release from the formulation. Dissolution rates for the fentanyl wafer were determined in 200 mL of phosphate-buffered solution (25 mM, pH 6.8) with a basket rotation speed of 75 rpm. At given intervals (ie, 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 minutes), 1.0 mL samples were replaced with an equal volume of fresh medium. The drug released was measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography using a C<sub>18</sub> column (150 &#x000d7; 4.6 mm, 5 &#x003bc;m, Alltech Associates Inc, Deerfield IL, USA), a mobile phase of methanol to 0.04 M phosphoric acid (50:50, v/v, pH 3.0) and a flow rate of 1.2 mL per minute. The monitoring wavelength was at 210 nm.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-dddt-7-317">9</xref> The calibration curve for concentrations in the range of 5&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;g/mL (seven-point calibration) was linear. The coefficient of variation for the high-pressure liquid chromatography assay was 0.57% at a fentanyl concentration of 0.5 &#x003bc;g/mL (n = 8) and 0.54% at a fentanyl concentration of 4 &#x003bc;g/mL (n = 8).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>In vivo study</title><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Study subjects and design</title><p>After receiving The Women and Newborn Health Service of King Edward Memorial Hospital for Women ethics committee approval, the trial was registered with the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration under the Clinical Trial Notification scheme and with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (12609000743268).

A dedicated intravenous cannula was placed in the forearm for subsequent venous blood sampling. Blood samples (5 mL) were collected into sterile polypropylene tubes at 0, 2, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after fentanyl administration.

Although this weight loss does not comply with British Pharmacopoeia 2009 standard<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-dddt-7-317">13</xref> for compressed tablets, there is no such standard for wafers in either the British or US pharmacopoeias.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-dddt-7-317">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-dddt-7-317">16</xref> This implies that the wafers would not withstand robust handling, but in practice they did not crumble when handled by patients. The diameter and thickness of the wafers were approximately 10 mm and 4 mm, respectively. The moisture content was 3.51% &#x000b1; 0.10%, indicating that water had been removed efficiently by the freeze-drying process.

Spectra for the fentanyl, blank matrix, and fentanyl wafer are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-dddt-7-317">Figure 2</xref>. It was observed that the powder patterns of all wafers prepared were dominated by intense scattering peaks located at approximately 2-theta of 9.58&#x000b0;, 19.68&#x000b0;, and 20.05&#x000b0;, indicating the crystalline nature of the excipient, Avicel. Absence of the characteristic peaks for fentanyl pointed to amorphization of fentanyl during the freeze-drying process. This finding was also supported by the data generated from the scanning electron microscopic analysis. Indeed the excipients used in the formulations, including glycine, lactose, mannitol and microcrystalline cellulose, were crystalline in nature, but amorphization appeared to have occurred during freeze-drying.</p></sec><sec><title>In vitro dissolution studies</title><p>The dissolution profiles are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-dddt-7-317">Figure 3</xref>. The cumulative percentage of fentanyl dissolved from four wafers was approximately 90% within one minute. Total release occurred within five minutes. This result indicates that the fentanyl wafer was a solid dispersion of fentanyl within a porous matrix that permits rapid fluid disintegration and release of the contents. The fentanyl wafer formulation complied with the British Pharmacopoeia standard for orodispersible tablets of disintegration within 3 minutes. An excellent correlation has been reported between in vitro and oral disintegration times in volunteers taking rapidly disintegrating tablets.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-dddt-7-317">17</xref></p></sec><sec><title>In vivo studies</title><p>Twenty-one patients were randomized, 11 to the sublingual followed by intravenous sequence and 10 to the intravenous followed by sublingual sequence. Of these 21 patients, 11 received both sublingual and intravenous fentanyl; six patients were only given intravenous fentanyl (sublingual fentanyl was subsequently not required because of no further pain) and two patients received only sublingual fentanyl (intravenous fentanyl was not subsequently required). Two patients did not complete the sublingual and/or the intravenous administration arm of the study and were eliminated from all analyses. The demographic characteristics of the patients are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-dddt-7-317">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>On commencing the study, it was noted that the wafer did not disintegrate/dissolve in the first five patients until approximately 12 minutes, as a result of dry mouth immediately after general anesthesia. Subsequently, the study patients were given a mouth rinse using 3 mL of water before placing the wafer sublingually, and this reduced the mean disintegration time to 6.6 minutes. Accordingly, the pharmacokinetic results were later divided into two subgroups, ie, a dry mouth group and a wet mouth group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Pharmacokinetic data</title><p>Plasma fentanyl concentration versus time curves for the intravenous and sublingual routes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-dddt-7-317">Figure 4</xref>.

This may have been influenced by the relatively short sampling time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Clinical results</title><p>The median time taken for the sublingual wafer to dissolve was 5 (range 1&#x02013;12) minutes. The median satisfaction score was 9 (range 2&#x02013;10), with 80% reporting that it dissolved completely and 87% reporting that there was no bitter or unpleasant taste. Effectiveness was rated as excellent by 31%, good by 54%, fair by 8%, and poor by 8%, compared with reports of excellent by 56% and good by 44% after intravenous fentanyl administration. Sixty-two percent found the wafer to be very acceptable, 33% found it acceptable, and 5% found it reasonably acceptable. Among nine patients who were able to compare the sublingual and intravenous routes, 33% (three of nine) expressed a preference for the sublingual wafer, 44% (four of nine) a preference for the intravenous injection, and 22% (two out of nine) had no preference.</p><p>There are several limitations to the design of this study, which reflect its pilot nature. These included the limited clinical information that could be obtained from a pharmacokinetic study with a small sample size within a heterogeneous surgical population, and the clinical difficulty in obtaining data for both intravenous and sublingual administration from all participants. It is noteworthy that dry mouth is a critical factor in drug delivery by the sublingual route if a rapid response is desired. This finding should be noted for other drugs, such as glyceryl trinitrate, where a rapid response is important.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The fentanyl wafer studied was a solid dispersion of amorphized fentanyl in a porous matrix. The fast in vitro release pattern correlated well with in vivo absorption profiles. Sublingual administration of the fentanyl wafer resulted in rapidly detectable plasma fentanyl concentrations (at a mean of 3.5 minutes) after administration to patients with a moist mouth. The absolute bioavailability of the fentanyl wafer was approximately 53%. The high interindividual variability of t<sub>first</sub> was due to slow dissolution of the wafer in patients with a dry mouth postoperatively. Advice to rinse the mouth with water prior to insertion may be advisable using other sublingual products for which a rapid onset of action is desired.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank iX BioPharma Pte Ltd, Singapore, for financing this project, and the Department of Physics, Curtin University, for scanning electron microscopy and x-ray analysis.
