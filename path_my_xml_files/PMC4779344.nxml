INTRODUCTION</title><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) designated the infertility as a disease, and its treatment as one of the fundamental human rights. Infertility is defined as the inability to conceive after 1 year of unprotected relations of couples in the reproductive age (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Male infertility factor is the most common cause of not having children (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The diagnosis is based on the results of the analysis of semen. The WHO revised and defined cut-off value for differentiating normal and abnormal semen (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Van der Steeg and his associates in 2011, tried to check the WHO criteria parameter analysis of seed in 1999 (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) for a spontaneous pregnancy, and it was concluded that the predictive value of the WHO classifications seed analysis was deficient. In other words, although the WHO proposed classification accuracy of seed analysis, relevance for prognosis and treatment choices are bad (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The parameter for assessing the quality of sperm is the total motile sperm count (TMSC). The total number of mobile sperm has a better predictive value for spontaneous pregnancy (ST) then of the WHO classification system. Sperm morphology parameter is not used in this calculation (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Van der Weert et al. (2004) showed in a meta-analysis of 16 studies that post wash TMSC between 0.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> and 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> has a prognostic value in couples who underwent IUI (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Badawy et al. (2009) showed that the IUI is less successful when TMSC post wash is low with poor morphology (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). So, there is a need for new parameter values in seed analysis for clinical use in sorting out male infertility factors and selecting the treatment. The majority of the published studies show that IUI is more effective than planned sexual intercourse regardless of whether they are couples with unexplained infertility or male infertility. Intrauterine insemination shows a significant increase in pregnancy rates compared to the planned time sexual intercourse in natural cycles, regardless of the type of infertility (OR = 2.43) (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The aim of this study was to determine the predictive value TMSC for spontaneous pregnancy (ST) and pregnancy after treatment with IUI in couples with male factor and unexplained infertility.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>2. MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p><bold>Study design</bold></p><p>Prospective study included examination of 223 infertile couples for marriage infertility with duration longer than 1 year. The study was conducted from January 2013 throughout December 2015 in the Department of Human Reproduction &#x0201c;Dr Hajder&#x0201d; Tuzla. Treatment of infertility was conducted in accordance with the guidelines for infertility (NICE) and consists of the examinations of both partners. All married couples underwent the following examinations: spermiogram, analysis of sex hormones in the early follicular phase of the cycle, ultrasonic cycle monitoring (folliculometry), mid-luteinizing progesterone measuring, microbiological and immunological treatment of the infection, hystero sonosalpingographia, diagnostic laparoscopy in indicated cases.</p><p><bold>Study population</bold></p><p>Total cohort consisted of 223 infertile couples. Of these, 115 pairs were excluded from the study due to female factor infertility, such as disorders of ovulation, tubal disease, endometriosis, cervical factor or sexual dysfunction. The study also excluded couples with a combination of female and male factors, couples in which the male partner had azoospermia and couples with TMSC &#x0003c;1 x 10<sup>6</sup> / ejaculate. The study included 98 couples with male infertility factor (bad spermiogram) and couples with normospermia and normal female factor (unexplained infertility). The study group was randomized to: group (A) with TMSC&#x0003e; 3x10<sup>6</sup> / ejaculate and a spontaneous conception; group (B) with TMSC &#x0003c;3 x 10<sup>6</sup> / ejaculate and conception after IUI, plus couples who did not achieve SP with TMSC&#x0003e; 3 x 10<sup>6</sup> / ejaculate and couples who did not achieve pregnancy. Both groups were classified in five subgroups based on TMSC subgroup (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) with TMSC 1-5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> / ejaculate; subgroup (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) with TMSCl 5-10 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> / ejaculate; subgroup (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) with TMSCl 10-20 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> / ejaculate; subgroup(<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) with TMSCl&#x0003e; 20 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> / ejaculate and subgroup (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) with unexplained infertility</p><p>Definition. Infertility is defined as the failure of conception, despite 12 months of unprotected intercourse (Ciglar). Normozoospermia is defined according to the WHO criteria, 2010. TMSC is calculated by multiplying the concentration of sperm / milliliter (SC) x volume (ml) x motility (A + B) divided by 100%. Sperm is normal if TMSC&#x0003e; 20 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> / ejaculate, lower values are considered abnormal spermiogram and define male infertility factor. Infertile couples with normozoospermia and normal female factor were considered unexplained infertility. The normal menstrual cycle is between 25 and 35 days, the level of progesterone in the medium luteal phase is&#x0003e; 27 mmol / l, the duration of the luteal phase &#x0003e; 11 days.</p><p><bold>Treatments</bold></p><p>Couples with TMSC&#x0003e; 3x10<sup>6</sup> / ejaculate, with the chance of conceiving&#x0003e; 30% (mild cases)were given an advice on planned sexual relations with ultrasound monitoring of follicular growth. Six IUI cycles were offered to couples with TMSC from 1 to 3 x 10<sup>6</sup> / ejaculate with a forecast of conception &#x0003c;30% (moderate male infertility), and couples with TMSC&#x0003e; 3 x 10<sup>6</sup> / ejaculate with a conception prognosis&#x0003e; 30%, that did not achieve SPafter 6 months of planned sexual intercourse. After six unsuccessful IUI cycles couples were offered in vitro fertilization (IVF) and were excluded from the study. Couples with TMSC &#x0003c;1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> / ejaculate were immediately offered in vitro fertilization by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and were excluded from the study.</p><p><bold>Outcome measures</bold></p><p>The primary objective was to determine the rate of spontaneous pregnancies without treatment and pregnancy rates after IUI treatment. Pregnancy is defined by ultrasound measurement of the fetal heart beat after the 12th week of pregnancy, and increased b-hCG after 1-2 days of the period, the values of which should be doubled when re-measurement after 48-72 hours.</p><p><bold>Semen analysis</bold></p><p>The men had their spermiogram made on arrival at the Institute. In the case of abnormal spermiogram, a second sample was analyzed 10 weeks later. Male partners gave a semen sample after 2-3 days of sexual abstinence. The seeds were stored in the Institute in sterile plastic container, or at home and delivered to the laboratory of the Institute within 1 hour. During the analysis volume was measured by a numbered syringes. The sperm was read in Megler chamber, with an increase of 200 times MAKLER COUNTING CHAMBER for rapid sperm analysis (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Mobility was expressed as a percentage of: (A) fast forward progressive sperm, (B) slowly forward progressive, (C) non-progressive (D) immovable sperm within the total number of 200 sperm in at least five fields, according to WHO guidelines (WHO, 2010) . Sperm morphology was scored according to the criteria of Tygerberg (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), 200 spermatozoas were analyzed. This study used a floating techniques of seed processing that is simple and inexpensive. Treated seed is then inseminated with soft catheter (MedGyn intrauterine insemination catheter, MedGyn Products, Inc., USA).</p><p><bold>Statistics</bold></p><p>The data were entered into a database.

To test the hypothesis between the groups independent students t&#x02013;test and Fisher exact test (univariate analysis) were used, with the level of significance of p &#x0003c;0.05. A binary logistic regression was performed for the dependent variable (such as pregnancy), which has two endpoints, i.e. spontaneous pregnancy and pregnancy after treatment IUI. Relative risk ratio (RR) and their 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each subgroup TMSC.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>3. RESULTS</title><p>The study included a total of 223 couples with marital infertility. After examination of patients, 115 of them (55%) had a female infertility factor, and were excluded from the study. According to the WHO criteria, after seed analysis, 108 pairs (45%) had male infertility factor, of which 10 (11%) had azoospermia and were excluded from the study. The study included 98 (89%) of couples with male and unexplained infertility. After analyzing semen according to the WHO criteria 76 couples (77.5%) had male infertility and unexplained infertility 22 (22.5%) pairs. According to TMSC range, male infertility, i.e..

DISCUSSION</title><p>According to the new WHO classification system normozoospermia is based on the cut-off values obtained on a sample of 1,953 couples with proven fertility. Although this classification indicates the accuracy, relevance for prognosis in infertile couple and the choice of treatment is questionable. Abnormal spermiogram can be diagnosed as oligozoospermia (O), astenozoospermia (A), teratozoospermia (T) or a combination of these, and azoospermia (image x) .. TMSC is obtained by multiplying the volume of semen x concentration x the percentage of concentration of A and B sperm divided by 100. TMSC shows a better correlation with spontaneous pregnancy rate (SOPR) than the WHO classification system from 2010. For everyday practice, there are three prognostic groups: couples with TMSCl &#x0003c;5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>, couples with TMSC 5- 20 x 10<sup>6</sup> and couples with TMSCl greater than 20 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> ejaculate normozoospermia (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). It is significant to point out that there is no difference in SOPR if TMSC was &#x0003c;1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>, 10<sup>6</sup> &#x000d7; 1-3 or 3-5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>. Spontaneous pregnancy are possible in the presence of extremely poor quality of sperm, although most doctors recommend ICSI. However it was noted that a quarter of couples conceived spontaneously. There is still evidence that the semen analysis is weak predictor of pregnancy in the low range (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) 345 consecutive couples presenting for subfertility. It is also illogical that 20% of couples with unexplained infertility and normospermia did not conceive (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The National Institute for Health and Care (NICE) guidelines in fertility recommended repeated spermiogram in the event that the first was abnormal (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Results of this study showed that spontaneous pregnancy are present in all subgroups of TMSC. After treatment with IUI there was a statistically significant increase in pregnancy rates in the subgroup of TMSC&#x0003e; 5 x 10<sup>6</sup> ejaculate, while in sub-groups with TMSC &#x0003c;5 x 10<sup>6</sup>/ejaculate and unexplained infertility after IUI pregnancies were reported, but without statistically significant differences. IUI is less expensive and less invasive than other ART methods, and this therapeutic treatment should be offered to couples with male factor and unexplained infertility as the first choice of treatment (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Intrauterine insemination shows a significant increase in pregnancy rates compared to the planned time sexual intercourse in natural cycles, regardless of the type of infertility (OR = 2.43). In the analysis of 3,662 cycles showed that intrauterine insemination shows a significant increase in pregnancy rates compared to the planned time sexual intercourse in natural cycles, regardless of the type of infertility (OR = 2.43). It is also proven that the cycles of intrauterine insemination with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) show higher pregnancy rates (OR = 2.2) compared to the time planned intercourse in a natural cycle (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Ayala et al. (1996) showed that in the group of 1,055 infertile couples TOPR was significantly higher if the TMSC was greater than 25 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> ejaculate compared to TMSC under 25 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>/ejaculate [RR = 6.1. 95% CI: 7.4.-9.7] (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) 055 infertile couples seen at the Texas Institute for Reproductive Medicine and Endocrinology for a total of 9,409 follow-up months. The medians of sperm concentrations (SC. Van der Weert et al. (2004) showed in a meta-analysis of 16 studies that post wash TMSC between 0.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> and 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> ejaculate had prognostic value in couples undergoing IUI (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Badawy et al. (2009) showed that the IUI was less successful when the total number of motile spermatozoa was low and post wash morphology was bad (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Hamliton et al. (2015) in their study indicated that TMSC is better diagnostic and prognostic method for male infertility factor (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Pregnancy after IUI were present in all subgroups TMSC, even in subgroups with TMSC &#x0003c;1 x 10<sup>6</sup> ejaculate.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>5.
