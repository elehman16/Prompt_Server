New therapeutic targets are needed in this disorder. The objective of this randomized, sham-controlled, blinded exploratory study is to identify a specific motor system target for non-invasive neuromodulation and to evaluate this target in terms of safety and tolerability in the cervical dystonia (CD) population. Eight CD subjects were given 15-minute sessions of low-frequency (0.2 Hz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the primary motor cortex (MC), dorsal premotor cortex (dPM), supplementary motor area (SMA), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and a sham condition with each session separated by at least two days. The Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) score was rated in a blinded fashion immediately pre- and post-intervention. Secondary outcomes included physiology and tolerability ratings. The mean change in TWSTRS severity score by site was 0.25 &#x000b1; 1.7 (ACC), -2.9 &#x000b1; 3.4 (dPM), -3.0 &#x000b1; 4.8 (MC), -0.5 &#x000b1; 1.1 (SHAM), and -1.5 &#x000b1; 3.2 (SMA) with <italic>negative</italic> numbers indicating improvement in symptom control. TWSTRS scores decreased from Session 1 (15.1 &#x000b1; 5.1) to Session 5 (11.0 &#x000b1; 7.6). The treatment was tolerable and safe. Physiology data were acquired on 6 of 8 subjects and showed no change over time. These results suggest rTMS can modulate CD symptoms. Both dPM and MC are areas to be targeted in further rTMS studies. The improvement in TWSTRS scores over time with multiple rTMS sessions deserves further evaluation.</p><sec id="sec001"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01859247">NCT01859247</ext-link>

It is characterized by abnormal posturing due to sustained muscle contractions, which not only leads to pain but also often causes significant disability in activities of daily living such as driving and reading. Primary focal dystonia such as cervical dystonia (CD) affects both genders and all ethnicities and races. The current gold standard treatment of botulinum toxin injections has limitations&#x02014;painful, frequent injections as well as expected adverse events, which can include dysphagia, neck weakness, voice changes and fatigue [<xref rid="pone.0124937.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In addition, many CD patients do not have relief of their symptoms for the entire treatment period as the effect &#x0201c;wears off&#x0201d; prior to the next injection. Employment is affected by CD and in one study, a large percentage of patients were not employed even with standard treatment [<xref rid="pone.0124937.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. New therapies and new therapeutic targets are urgently needed in this disorder.</p><p>Previous work implies that CD is a <italic>neurofunctional</italic> disorder arising from abnormalities of neural connectivity or plasticity, rather than being caused by neurodegeneration [<xref rid="pone.0124937.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The functional rather than structural nature of the disorder raises the possibility that symptoms of CD can be persistently modified through noninvasive means. Several trials using low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the premotor cortex have shown modulation of symptoms in focal hand dystonia (FHD) [<xref rid="pone.0124937.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0124937.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In one pilot study, patients with secondary dystonia received low-frequency rTMS over the premotor cortex and showed significant improvement in painful spasms in proximal and axial musculature [<xref rid="pone.0124937.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A subsequent case report demonstrated a 50% reduction in CD symptoms in a patient who had received a course of low-frequency rTMS over the premotor cortex, and the effects were sustained for four months [<xref rid="pone.0124937.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Our previous work has also identified an abnormal premotor-motor interaction in patients with focal dystonia in both writer&#x02019;s cramp [<xref rid="pone.0124937.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124937.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and CD [<xref rid="pone.0124937.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus, the premotor cortex may be an appropriate target for therapeutic intervention. The motor cortex (MC) has also been evaluated as a therapeutic site. Low-frequency rTMS over the MC in a single session showed a decrease in writing pressure in writer&#x02019;s cramp patients [<xref rid="pone.0124937.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Given these results in the FHD population, we proposed this randomized, sham-controlled, blinded exploratory pilot study to identify a specific motor system target and to evaluate this target in terms of safety and tolerability in the CD population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec003"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Participants</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref rid="pone.0124937.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 CONSORT Checklist</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0124937.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Protocol</xref>. We enrolled 9 CD patients (5 men) with mean age 53 years (standard deviation (SD) 16) (<xref rid="pone.0124937.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). As there was no prior data on the influence of rTMS on patients with CD using our primary outcome measure, we were not able to calculate a formal sample size and thus estimated that enrolling approximately 7 patients would be a reasonable approach for an exploratory trial. Patient recruitment began June 1, 2013 and patient follow-up was completed by July 31, 2014. Eight CD patients completed the study. One patient withdrew after enrolling, but prior to beginning any study intervention, due to an unexpected move out of state (<xref rid="pone.0124937.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). The study intervention began at 8 weeks after their usual care botulinum toxin injection. All subjects met inclusion criteria: 1) patients with idiopathic cervical dystonia; 2) age 18 years or older; 3) normal findings in the medical history, physical and neurological examination, except for dystonia; and 4) last treatment with botulinum toxin more than two months prior to first intervention. All subjects did not have any exclusion criteria: 1) history of seizure disorder; 2) pregnancy- a pregnancy test will be performed for women of childbearing potential; 3) symptoms of a clinically relevant illness in the 4 weeks before the first study day, including history of any other neurological disorders or conditions requiring the use of anti-depressants that are known to increase seizure threshold, neuroleptic medication, anticholinergic drugs and muscle relaxants with the exception of benzodiazepines; 4) history of neuroleptic medications/ prior use of neuroleptics; and 5) presence of pacemaker, implanted medical pump, metal plate or metal object in skull or eye. They all signed an informed consent. The study was approved by the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center Institutional Review Board.</p><fig id="pone.0124937.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0124937.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Consort diagram.</title><p>*Prior to enrolment, a randomization schedule was created by random sorting of the five rTMS sites for each subject.

Registration with the neuronavigation system was completed and then the hotspots were identified (as described below) for the MC and dPM. These locations were saved in the neuronavigation system for future reference. Depending on the randomization schedule, additional anatomical sites were determined. Neurophysiologic testing (dorsal premotor-motor cortical inhibition (dPMI) and cortical silent period (CSP)) was performed. The rTMS session was completed.

The site order was randomized for each participant as described in <xref rid="pone.0124937.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>.

The resting motor threshold (RMT) was determined over the primary motor cortex corresponding to the right (dominant) FDI. The coil over dPM was placed 2 cm anterior and 1 cm medial to the &#x0201c;hotspot&#x0201d; for FDI. With both coils placed, RMT and active motor threshold (AMT) during a 10% maximum voluntary contraction of FDI as measured by force transducer, were determined to the nearest 1% of stimulator output.</p><p>Two Magstim 200<sup>2</sup> stimulators (Magstim Co., Whitland, Dyfed, UK), connected to two custom figure 8 coils with an inner loop diameter of 35 mm, were used. The motor cortex coil corresponding to the FDI &#x0201c;hotspot&#x0201d; was placed tangential to the scalp with handle pointing backward and laterally at a 45-degree angle away from the midline.

The change in scores was analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, which is a non-parametric version of a one-way analysis of variance since the distributions were found not to be normal. To test the primary hypothesis that a particular stimulation site had greater effect than non-specific activation of the motor system, change in TWSTRS severity score pre- to post-intervention was analyzed by site.

Both MC and dPM showed the largest change in the pre- to post-intervention TWSTRS rating. The stimulation was confined to the left hemisphere and showed benefit even though the neck muscles involved in CD can have both unilateral (e.g. trapezius) and bilateral (e.g. sternocleidomastoid) innervation [<xref rid="pone.0124937.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This study provides proof-of-principle evidence that the same targets (MC and dPM) used in FHD are reasonable targets for further study in the CD population [<xref rid="pone.0124937.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0124937.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, all participants who began the interventions were able to complete all sessions and found it tolerable and safe.</p><p>Although encouraging, there are limitations to the interpretation of this study given the small sample size and these findings need to be replicated in a larger trial. In terms of reaching our target sites, we did attempt to target the ACC during this study, but it is possible that we were not able to reach this target with the figure-of-8 air cooled coil used in this study. Therefore we cannot draw a firm conclusion that ACC is not a potential therapeutic site, especially if an alternative coil was used for the targeting. Our choice of targets was based on previous studies that had been shown to be potentially therapeutic in focal dystonia; however, a recent case report described a new potential site, the left posterior parietal cortex, which was not examined in this study [<xref rid="pone.0124937.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Remote targeting is another potential avenue of therapy to explore.</p><p>The trend, in one patient, to have a positive sham response is worth mentioning. One other subject had an even smaller (1 point in the TWSTRS score) to sham stimulation. Possible explanations for the sham response in these individuals include a placebo effect or a sustained benefit of sitting in a chair with their head touching the back of the chair during the rTMS session&#x02014;a common sensory trick for many patients with cervical dystonia [<xref rid="pone.0124937.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We also cannot exclude the possibility of a mild therapeutic effect as a result of the physiologic testing pre- and post-intervention affecting the sham condition. However, this was seen only in one subject and did not seem to have a significant effect on our findings.</p><p>In terms of the neurophysiologic data, we had previously shown in FHD patients [<xref rid="pone.0124937.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and recently in CD patients [<xref rid="pone.0124937.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], enhanced dPMI compared to a healthy control population. In this current study four of our six subjects did show dPMI values &#x0003c; 100% as seen in our previous work. There was no significant effect change in dPMI over time. We did not power the study to detect change in these secondary outcomes and thus our ability to conclude that there was no effect on dPMI by the rTMS is limited. In addition, we have shown previously that patients with CD had shorter CSP than healthy controls suggestive of a loss of motor inhibition [<xref rid="pone.0124937.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In our small population, the CSP at the pre-Session 5 was almost 10 msec longer than at the beginning of the trial but was not significantly different. Although these physiologic parameters did not seem to be effective surrogate markers in this exploratory trial, they may lend themselves to further examination in a larger study.</p><p>The most promising (and <italic>unexpected</italic>) finding in this study was the reduction in TWSTRS severity over time, suggesting a cumulative effect of rTMS sessions. Since the subjects were studied 8 weeks after the last botulinum injection, it is expected that the TWSTRS scores would worsen over time due to the waning of the effects of botulinum toxin. Seven of the eight subjects had maintenance or improvement in symptoms over the study duration. Only one subject approximated the natural history of therapeutic duration of botulinum toxin injection with gradual worsening in his TWSTRS score (although he showed immediate changes in TWSTRS score with several of the interventions administered) (<xref rid="pone.0124937.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This yields support for a further exploratory, multisite Phase II trial to identify whether rTMS has the potential to step into the treatment gap seen with current therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This exploratory trial using low-frequency rTMS in CD showed immediate pre- and post-intervention improvements in TWSTRS severity&#x02014;maximal over MC and dPM.

These data support further study of this potential treatment in a larger population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0124937.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0124937.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0124937.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Trial protocol.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0124937.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Meg Radigan for her efforts as coordinator for this study and the patients who kindly volunteered to participate.
