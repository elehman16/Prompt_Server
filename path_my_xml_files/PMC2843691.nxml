There are currently more than 6 million people with dementia in the European Union with the prevalence of the disease increasing in the next decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>People with dementia are often inapproachable due to symptoms of their illness. Besides cognitive disorders, primarily the non-cognitive symptoms of dementia, such as apathy, anxiety, depression, and challenging behavior, complicate the course of the disease and impede communication. Therefore nurses should establish relationships with dementia patients via their remaining resources and facilitate communication. Emotions, memories, important characteristics of the patients' biography, as well as perceptions on the somatic and emotional level can be used as resources in order to approach persons with dementia by using different pathways, even if communicative relationships are seemingly impeded.</p><p>In order to achieve this, different conceptualized non-pharmacological interventions are recommended in practice guidelines and practiced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].

In order to preclude that the effects arise only due to the intensified social contacts, analogous individual contacts are implemented in the control group via unstructured verbal communication.</p><p>It is hypothesized that the interventions will have a positive impact on apathy in long term care residents with dementia in comparison to the control group. The primary outcome measures apathy after 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion of clusters</title><p>A cluster is defined either as a nursing home by itself or a working ward of a large nursing home. None of the clusters may share facilities or staff.</p><p>10 nursing homes in the areas of Leipzig, Saxony, and Halle, Saxony-Anhalt (Germany) respectively, will be recruited that have implemented none of the study interventions in routine care prior to the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment of individual participants</title><p>The identification and complete inclusion of participants must be done before cluster randomization to avoid foreknowledge of allocation and to reduce selection bias and empty randomized clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Information and instruction of the participants will be done personally and in written form by trained nursing home staff, the consent to participate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] will be obtained in writing from the residents. In case guardians are appointed, they will be informed about the possibility of taking part in the trial and will be asked for a participation of their charge in the trial.</p><p>In the total 20 nursing homes all residents fulfilling the inclusion criteria (suffering from dementia, informed consent in person or by legal guardian, age: &#x02265; 55 years) will be assessed using the <italic>Mini Mental State Examination - MMSE </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] or the <italic>MMSE version for vision impairment - MMblind </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] by the external investigators. Exclusion criteria are Korsakoff's syndrome or cognitive impairments from other causes than dementia.</p><p>Then from each cluster 18 participating residents with a cut-off value MMSE &#x02264; 24 or MMblind &#x02264; 17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] will be included using computer-generated random number tables.</p></sec><sec><title>Cluster randomization</title><p>The 20 included nursing homes will be randomized into 4 study groups consisting of 5 clusters each, stratified according to province:</p><p>&#x025aa; structured reminiscence therapy (experimental group 1),</p><p>&#x025aa; 10-minutes activation (experimental group 2),</p><p>&#x025aa; snoezelen (experimental group 3),</p><p>&#x025aa; unstructured verbal communication (control group).</p><p>An individual randomization on the resident level does not seem possible out of methodical and practical reasons. A clear distinction between individual interventions on the resident level cannot be assumed in the training of different nurses in different interventions within one institution. Therefore, to avoid contamination and to achieve a feasible approach a cluster randomization design is chosen.</p><p>For concealed allocation of clusters the randomization list will be computer-generated by the Institute of Medical Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Informatics, Halle/Saale, which is blind to the identity of the nursing homes and the included residents, after all baseline measurements.</p><p>The summary of the study design is presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Study design</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2318-10-5-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Study procedure</title><p>In each of the 20 included nursing home clusters 6 registered nurses will be selected and trained in the intervention their cluster will be randomized to. Nurses in the experimental groups receive training by external experts. Training takes place in three-day courses outside the facility. Instead of three-day training, nurses in the control group clusters will receive a one-day instruction on performing conversation-based individual contacts relating to everyday life.</p><p>After the training, the interventions in each of the participating nursing homes will be monitored by the investigators in order to evaluate the training effects. This is to secure that the interventions are carried out consistently and on the same level.</p><p>The interventions in the experimental groups will be carried out once or twice a week as one-to-one sessions by the trained nursing staff, over a period of 20 or 10 minutes over 12 months. This period was selected according to the intervention type and regards the feasibility in the nursing homes considering the time and personal resources.</p><p>In order to examine the possibility that effects can be observed solely due to intensified social contacts, the control group is designed as sham intervention on the basis of 20-minutes individual contacts once a week offering topical conversations.</p><p>Nursing staff will have to fill in a continuous documentation form about the topics and characteristics of every intervention session for every participating resident, including the case and reason of possible non-conduction.

Data collection will be done by interviews of the nursing staff.</p><p>Secondary outcome measures on the resident level are behavioral disturbances, isolated aggressive events and well-being.</p><p>Behavioral disturbances will be measured using the <italic>Neuropsychiatric Inventory (Nursing Home) - NPI-NH </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The instrument is a caregiver-based rating scale to evaluate 12 neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with dementia: delusions, hallucinations, agitation, depression, anxiety, apathy, irritability, euphoria, disinhibition, aberrant motor behavior, night-time behavior disturbances, and appetite and eating abnormalities. Isolated aggressive events will be continuously documented by the staff members using the <italic>Staff Observation Aggression Scale-Revised - SOAS-R </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This instrument is to monitor the frequency, nature, and severity of aggressive incidents. Well-being will be measured using a Likert-type <italic>Smiley Face Rating Scale </italic>- <italic>SRS </italic>range from 1 to 4 marks by the residents.</p><p>Socio-demographic data like age, gender, and treatment data will be assessed and documented thoroughly in a Case Report Form, including the German versions of the <italic>Clinical Dementia Rating </italic>- <italic>CDR </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and the <italic>Care Dependency Scale: Pflegeabh&#x000e4;ngigkeitsskala </italic>- <italic>PAS </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].

To detect a mean reduction of the apathy score from 45 to 35 points (23%) with standard deviation (SD) 12 points between one intervention and one control group we need 13 residents in 10 nursing homes. The power of 80% for a cluster randomized t-test with a significance level alpha = 0.016 (0.05/3) is obtained with assumed intra-cluster correlation coefficient of ICCC = 0.05. The number of nursing homes increases to 20 (4 groups consisting of 5 nursing homes each) as there are three intervention groups and one control group and all intervention groups are tested against the same control group. Considering a mortality rate of 40%, the number of required study participants in each nursing home increases to 18 residents with dementia and thus to a total sample size of N = 360 residents (20 nursing homes * 18 residents).</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>In accordance to the mode of the interventions the residents and field researchers are not blinded to group allocation.

For nominal or ordinal variables this will be done by reporting rates with declaration of the 95% confidence interval. The changes of the primary outcome apathy score <italic>AES </italic>over time and additional data taken at the other measurement points are compared between the intervention and the control group and are treated as changes in proportions or means and their standard errors, according to the nature of the variables.
