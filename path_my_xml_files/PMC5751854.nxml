Fifty stable but symptomatic patients with chronic heart failure, despite optimized guideline-recommended treatment, were enrolled at baseline. In total, 40 participants (median age 76 years; New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification II&#x02212;III) adhered to the study. Most patients (<italic>n</italic>=17) were randomized into MBI, a structured eight-week mindfulness-based educational and training programme, or controls with usual care (<italic>n</italic>=16). Primary outcome was self-reported fatigue on the Fatigue severity scale. Secondary outcomes were self-reported sleep quality, unsteadiness/dizziness, NYHA functional classification, walking distance in the six-minute walk test, and heart and respiratory rates.

Of these, 33 were randomized (MBI, <italic>n</italic>=17; control, <italic>n</italic>=16) into the study. Results include data on seven openly assigned participants (MBI, <italic>n</italic>=5; control, <italic>n</italic>=2), all carefully assessed with no &#x02018;outliers&#x02019; among them. The flow of participants is presented in a modified flow diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1474515117715843">Figure 1</xref>). Many patients did not meet inclusion criteria and 35 declined to participate, among whom some felt &#x02018;too tired and sick&#x02019;, others did not perceive themselves to be needful of intervention, while others hesitated because of the effort and work required during the study.

Two &#x02018;dropouts&#x02019; were known to be associated with the MBI. One patient did not manage to follow the programme, while the other reported a &#x02018;gloomy mood&#x02019; related to increased bodily symptom awareness as a consequence of MBI learning and training. Two other participants did not offer reasons for dropping out, although one of them reported high scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales<sup><xref rid="bibr36-1474515117715843" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> at baseline (noticed after the study was closed) and the other disliked group sessions. In the process handling the &#x02018;suspected MBI-related dropouts&#x02019;, psychological consultation was used. Because of the slow recruitment rate, in 2013 the study was extended to also include patients from another study on follow-up two years after MI with CHF as secondary diagnosis. Five patients (enrolled from the &#x02018;post MI&#x02019; study) did not know of their CHF diagnosis and, based on safety and ethics, these five patients, reporting &#x02018;not knowing about their CHF diagnosis&#x02019; and with no CHF follow-up, were offered a consultation with the cardiologist and then openly assigned to MBI. In total, 10 participants were openly assigned to MBI (2010&#x02212;2011, <italic>n</italic>=5; 2013, <italic>n</italic>=5) and towards the end two patients were also openly assigned to the control group. Most participants (<italic>n</italic>=38) were randomized to either the MBI group (<italic>n</italic>=21) or the control group (<italic>n</italic>=16). In total 10 patients failed to complete the study, seven of whom dropped out from the MBI because of &#x02018;reasons given&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1474515117715843">Figure 1</xref>).

No one in the control group dropped out from this study. One participant in NYHA class IIIb, living on the third floor, completed the MBI at distance via telephone because of a broken elevator. Some participants (<italic>n</italic>=3) had a &#x02018;slow start&#x02019;, could not attend group sessions and needed individual meetings with the instructor or additional weeks to complete their training. Because of comorbidities, one patient attended the course together with his wife. In total, five participants experienced adverse events (e.g. falls): two of 18 in the control group and three of 22 in the MBI group. All falls happened outdoors in the community, and no fall was related to mindfulness training at home.

Unsteadiness/dizziness was found to be a frequent and bothersome symptom and possibly also to be affected by MBI.

Notably, a positive median sum-change in walking distance (25.8 m) was obtained in the 6MWT, indicating improved physical functioning by several participants who were learning and practising MBI, albeit not significantly powered on the group level. On the individual level, MBI was effective regarding sleep quality in MBI group participants. Each positive outcome change potentially contributes to reducing patients&#x02019; suffering with CHF.</p><p>Major feasibility problems arose from the slow recruitment rate, which might have been for several reasons: one is that our study patients had multiple comorbidities that made them too sick to participate, and another is that there were extensive inclusion criteria. That is why non-randomized participants were included and the interventional study was transformed into a feasibility study. No patient diagnosed with CHF can assuredly be considered to be &#x02018;stable&#x02019; or &#x02018;optimally treated&#x02019; because of the unpredictable trajectory of CHF. However, these requirements also strengthen the evidence of the study exploring the effects of MBI as an additional treatment. Several patients declined participation because of &#x02018;feeling too sick and tired&#x02019; and the amount of work required by the eight-week MBI programme. Feasible problems related to the MBI were few among included participants, but still needed to be considered. Psychologist expertise consultations are also valuable in future trials. However, the programme could perhaps be modified to include fewer group sessions, with the possibility also for only individual-based sessions, together with relatives and/or web-based study with telephone support at a distance. The feasibility in this study turned out to be high because of the efficacy of &#x02018;utilization&#x02019;, which involves active participants learning and training both in instructor-led group sessions at the clinic and in their daily life at home while using the integrated course material in their own personal way. Giving the opportunity to participants in the control group to attend the MBI programme later on might have contributed to their adherence.</p><p>The underlying mechanisms for effects of mindfulness on the cardiovascular system remain unsettled.

Moreover mindfulness seems to have a strong positive effect on cardiovascular modulation by decreasing cardiac sympathovagal tone, vascular resistance and ventricular workload.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1474515117715843" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> The respiratory component was probably linked to the focused breathing and low-frequency component of systolic blood pressure, and variation of inhalation and exhalation rates.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1474515117715843" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Their results suggest that mindfulness may be clinically pertinent for patients with increased cardiovascular sympathetic activity,<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1474515117715843" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> which is an important characteristic of CHF and the main focus.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1474515117715843" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-1474515117715843" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-1474515117715843" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p>Kessing and colleagues<sup><xref rid="bibr40-1474515117715843" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> measured general and exertion fatigue in outpatients with CHF using methods similar to ours, and demonstrated that both were significantly associated with poor CHF self-care, which could not be explained by sleep problems or mood symptoms. Neither did most participants in our study suffer from severe sleep disturbances or mood symptoms that contributed to their fatigue experiences. These findings indicate that treatment of fatigue by practising MBI may improve heart failure self-care skills <sup>40</sup> and, ultimately, other outcomes in CHF.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1474515117715843" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-1474515117715843" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>Regarding our secondary outcomes, symptoms of unsteadiness/dizziness have received limited attention in previous research<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1474515117715843" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-1474515117715843" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> although it is well known and reported frequently by patients. Therefore it is an interesting finding in the present study that unsteadiness/dizziness could be relieved by MBI. Sullivan and colleagues<sup><xref rid="bibr41-1474515117715843" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> demonstrated clinical symptom improvements over time (one year), after a mindfulness-based stress reduction programme and a psychoeducational intervention (also including coping skill training and an expressive support group) in patients with HFrEF. Our study has extended these findings, including HFpEF in addition to HFrEF. Surprisingly MBI did not affect sleep quality as measured by the KSQ-sqi in this study. A recent secondary analysis of mindfulness-based stress reduction interventions<sup><xref rid="bibr42-1474515117715843" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> indicated that to improve sleep quality, high levels of sleep disturbances must represent the point of departure. Our results may be explained by low degrees of sleep disturbances among most of our participants, therefore allowing less room for improvement in sleep quality. A recent study on younger patients with heart disease by Younge et&#x0202f;al.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-1474515117715843" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> showed beneficial physiological effects on exercise capacity as measured by the 6MWT and significantly lower heart rate in favour of the intervention group practising a 12-week online web-based mindfulness programme. Participants had diagnosed heart disease (ischaemic, valvular, congenital heart disease, or cardiomyopathy) and a mean BMI of 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, but were not assessed with regard to symptoms of fatigue, breathlessness or NYHA classification.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-1474515117715843" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Our small sample study was probably underpowered to be able to reach a significant effect on 6MWT and heart rate. However, changes showed a favourable trend with decreased median change in heart rate of 2 beats/min, comparable to findings from medical trials.<sup><xref rid="bibr43-1474515117715843" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> The strength in our study compared with that of Younge et&#x0202f;al.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-1474515117715843" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> lies in the high median age of 76 years, which is more representative of real-life CHF patients.</p><sec id="section32-1474515117715843"><title>Limitations and strengths of this study</title><p>This study has limitations, the main one being that it was a single-centre study with a small sample and a relatively short-term follow-up. The character of the study, whereby it was not possible for researcher to be blinded to MBI treatment, is a potential limitation. On the other hand we have thoroughly described a representative heart failure population with verified diagnosis, well-defined comorbidities, symptom assessment and median age of 76 years. Other strengths are the systematic application of MBI in a mostly randomized and controlled manner. Although not all participants were randomized into the study, the two groups appear to be comparable regarding characteristics at baseline. Both the FSS and KSQ-sqi were answered at home after visits, sent in to a university address and not opened until the study was closed, in an attempt to reduce experimenter demands on patient self-reported measures. All outcome variables are of clinical relevance and the research methods also feasible and reproducible by others. An additional major strength is that very few internal data are missing with regard to those participants who completed the study. The training programme to become a certified MBI instructor as used in this study is practically oriented, approachable by heart failure RN specialists but also by other clinicians, and, although accessible today only in Swedish, is internet-based and available for translation into other languages.</p></sec><sec id="section33-1474515117715843"><title>Clinical implications</title><p>Our results support the clinical relevance of MBI as an additional complementary treatment to conventional therapy in outpatients with CHF.

To make the intervention more accessible, RCTs including web-based MBI learning might also be possible with professional telephone support at a distance. Recruiting patients earlier and in parallel with drug titrations might be more feasible, as would less frequent group sessions.

Our findings also support the role of MBI as a feasible complementary, both clinically and home-based treatment, for further optimized heart failure care and possible reduction of the burden of symptom for patients in daily life with CHF. However, further studies, designed as multicentre RCTs, that include active control groups and instructor-led sessions, are needed.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to acknowledge all the participants in this study.
