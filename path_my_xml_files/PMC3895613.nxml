Fifteen NOD patients, 6 (40%) men, median age of 61 years (IQR, 51-81), referred to our center for esophageal manometry, were consecutively enrolled, after excluding subjects with systemic diseases which could affect esophageal motility (i.e., diabetes and scleroderma), eosinophylic esophagitis or the following motility disorders, as defined in the Chicago classification<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>: achalasia, absent peristalsis, esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction, distal esophageal spasm, hypercontractile esophagus and nutcracker esophagus.

The most distal side hole, placed 2 cm from the tip of the catheter, recorded the intragastric pressure; at 5 cm more proximally, 5 side holes spaced 1 cm apart, recorded motor activity of the esophago-gastric junction; the remaining 13 side holes, spaced 2 cm apart, recorded motor activity of the esophageal body, the upper esophageal sphincter and the pharynx. Catheter lumens were perfused with distilled, degassed water at a rate of 0.1 mL/min. Each lumen was connected to a pressure transducer (DTX Plus TNF-R; Becton Dickinson, Erembodegem, Belgium). The manometric signals were visualized as isobaric contour plots on a dedicated screen and were stored in a computer using a commercial software (MMS Investigation &#x00026; Diagnostic Software Version 8.19 build 2188) for subsequent analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>After an overnight fast the esophageal manometry catheter was passed trans-nasally under topical anaesthesia (Lidocaine spray 10%). The catheter was positioned so that side holes spaced 1 cm apart straddled the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). The test was performed in the recumbent right-sided position. A second catheter (10 F, Gastric Sump Tube; Medovations, Milwaukee, WI, USA) was inserted and the tip positioned at 30 cm from the nares, in order to perform aspiration both after intubation and at predetermined intervals (see below), and to infuse water.</p><p>As detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, each subject was tested at room temperature and cold (4&#x02103;) water in a randomized order with the 2 experimental condition being separated by 15 minutes in order to allow recovery of physiological esophageal temperature. Water temperature was monitored with a dedicated thermometer located inside the water's jar. Both with water at room-temperature and cold water, subjects first underwent a series of eight 5 mL single swallows (SS) and 2 multiple rapid swallows (MRS) of 20 mL each (20 mL MRS), within 10 seconds,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref> each separated by 20-30 seconds; SS and MRS were followed by esophageal aspiration in order to keep intraesophageal pressure negative. Afterwards, esophageal motility was recorded for 30 seconds as baseline period followed by infusion of 50 mL of water into the esophagus at a rate of 1 mL/sec through the second catheter, asking subjects to avoid swallowing. Finally, in healthy subjects only, the esophagus was exposed to a stronger cooling stimulus with multiple rapid swallowing of 200 mL within 30 seconds (200 mL MRS).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref></p><p>Along the whole study period, patients and subjects were encouraged to report their symptoms of chest pain and dysphagia by raising their hands.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Analysis</title><sec><title>Esophageal pressure waves and lower esophageal sphincter relaxation after water swallowing</title><p>Distal contractile integral (DCI) and contractile front velocity (CFV) for SS were registered.

Overall percentage of events with failed peristalsis attributed to cold water increased from 13% for 5 mL SS to 33% for 20 mL MRS and up to 67% for 200 mL MRS.</p></sec><sec><title>NOD patients</title><p>Compared with room temperature water, cold water significantly reduced DCI after SS (0.68 [95% CI, 0.51-0.84]), MRS (0.69 [95% CI, 0.40-0.97]) and 1-minute DCI during water infusion (0.48 [95% CI, 0.20-0.76]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).

Motor response in the esophageal body after swallows was also analyzed separately for patients with panesophageal pressurization (n = 9) and those with peristalsis (n = 4). In the first group maximal esophageal pressure in the distal esophagus was not modified by cold water both after SS (1.14 [95% CI, 0.80-1.40]) and 20 mL MRS (0.80 [95% CI, 0.50-1.15]).

Our major findings were that cold water reduced strength of the peristaltic wave in healthy subjects and NOD patients, whereas it had no effect on achalasia patients.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the effect of temperature on esophageal motility in patients with NOD and achalasia patients after successful pneumatic dilation. A small study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref> was recently published on the effect of cold water in 12 untreated achalasia patients, suggesting an increased duration of pressure activity in the esophageal body.</p><p>However results of this study should be viewed with caution because of the limitations in study design. Cold water was administered after room temperature water, i.e., without randomization, and no aspiration was applied in a group of untreated patients, who are known to have esophageal stasis. This raises the concern for sequential effect, i.e., that progressive accumulation of swallowed water and air in the esophagus had stimulated motility. Previous studies had already explored the effect of swallow-induced motility on healthy subjects using standard manometry.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref> Findings were controversial, some showing reduced amplitude and velocity of the peristaltic wave<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref> and others no effect.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref> Our report confirms a definite effect on peristalsis. We have expanded observations in healthy subjects by evaluating spontaneous motor activity induced by intraesophageal water infusion. The effect of cooling was similar to the one observed in primary peristalsis both in healthy subjects and the 2 patients groups, suggesting that the underlying mechanism of cooling is predominantly within the esophagus itself, although at present it has not been clarified yet. Previous studies on extraesophageal muscle tissue have suggested that it could be the result of an effect of temperature on neurotransmitter release<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref> or on smooth muscle contractility.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref> Moreover, esophageal thermoreceptors, which have been documented in the lower thoracic esophagus of the cat,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref> could play a role. It is interesting to note that, in the study conducted with the isolated cat esophagus, cold stimulations increased esophageal contractions,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref> while in our experiments cold water reduced pressure waves amplitude in healthy subjects and NOD patients. The difference in response could be due either to the different experimental condition, i.e., "ex vivo" vs. "in vivo," or to the different species.</p><p>Differently from the esophageal body, LES motor function was not affected by cooling in all the 3 groups of subjects, in line with previous studies conducted in healthy subjects using standard manometry.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref> This could be explained by experimental data from De Carle et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref> showing that the LES is much less temperature sensitive than the esophageal body.</p><p>With regards to NOD patients, they are a heterogeneous group and variable damages in both inhibitory and excitatory neural pathways have been hypothesized. We have included only NOD patients with normal or weak peristalsis according to the Chicago classification, thus excluding patients with an hypercontractile disorder in order to decrease pathophysiological heterogeneity. Previous studies have suggested that, in NOD patients with ineffective motility, neuromuscular structures are at least partially preserved and the main nerve damage is at the neural cholinergic stimulation level.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref> Our observations that NOD patients both with weak and normal peristalsis showed a consistent DCI reduction after cold water, which was similar to the one observed in healthy subjects, are in line with this hypothesis. Differently from healthy subjects, cold water did not affect velocity of peristalsis. This difference should be viewed with caution because, on one side, the effect of cold water on CFV was modest in healthy subjects and on the other, only half of the NOD patients were evaluated. Whether NOD patients with hypercontractile disorders, who may have an alteration of inhibitory neural pathways, retain the ability to decrease their DCI with cooling remains to be determined.</p><p>With regards to achalasia patients, esophageal cooling did not affect motor activity also in the subgroup where peristaltic activity was present. Achalasia is a primary motility disorder characterized by impairment of inhibitory neural pathways due to degeneration of inhibitory ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus of the esophagus and degenerative lesions in the vagal nerves and the dorsal motor nucleus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref> Nerve damage is probably heterogeneous, as suggested by motor response to MRS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref> The likely explanation for the lack of effect of cooling in achalasia is abolition of temperature induced neural reflexes because of the severe neural damage. In particular the neurodegenerative process could involve sensory neural pathways, which have been little explored in achalasia. Some uncontrolled data and controlled experimental data looking at mechanosensitivity using a barostat, at chemosensitivity using a modified Bernsten test and at the response to esophageal electrical stimulation have suggested that achalasia patients have a disordered visceral perception.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref></p><p>Two theoretical concerns regarding our finding in achalasia patients should be mentioned. First of all it could be argued that panesophageal pressurization in response to water swallowing, present in the majority of our patients, represents a cavity pressure wave rather than a true contraction as detected in patients with peristalsis. Although this is true, previous convincing findings with the use of high-frequency intraluminal ultrasonography have shown that panesophageal pressurization is the result of longitudinal muscle contraction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref> Nevertheless we have added measurement of a simple index related to esophageal wall contraction, i.e. maximal distal intraesophageal pressurization, which has confirmed no effect of cooling in these achalasia patients. The second concern relates to the fact that the esophagus of achalasia patients may be more dilated than the one of NOD patients or healthy subjects and therefore could need more volume of water to get cool. In order to avoid this bias, we recruited only patients successfully treated with pneumatic dilatation in whom the esophageal body was not dilated and checked that the esophagus was empty by aspirating at predetermined intervals during the study.</p><p>A final consideration needs to be done on the amount of esophageal cooling. Intraluminal temperature was not measured during the experiment, however previous studies have shown that intraesophageal temperature decreased immediately after the first cold water swallow and remained stable during the whole cooling stimulus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref> Healthy subjects have been shown to develop chest pain associated with esophageal dilatation and absence of esophageal peristalsis during rapid ice cream ingestion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref> and occasionally patients with dysphagia report exacerbation of symptoms during swallowing of cold food. During our experiments no one complained of dysphagia or chest pain. It is possible that stronger cooling stimuli are needed in order to induce symptoms with more severe impairment of esophageal motility. In this respect it is interesting to note that in our study impairment of swallow-induced peristalsis increased as the volume of cold water did.</p><p>In conclusion, our data have expanded observations in healthy humans, showing that cooling induces inhibition of both primary peristalsis and spontaneous motor activity, presumably as result of a neural reflex. Furthermore they have shown impairment of cold induced motor inhibition in achalasia, but not in NOD patients with normal or hypotensive motility.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Financial support: None.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>Conflicts of interest: None.</p></fn><fn fn-type="participating-researchers"><p>Author contributions: Roberto Penagini and Alessandra Elvevi designed the study.
