In contrast, futsal players more frequently perform all-out sprint and a fast-paced movement than football players because of the rules and cramped space during a futsal game. The HR responses during a futsal match ranges between 170 and 190&#x02005;bpm and the intensity of futsal competition is relatively high (above 85% of HR<sub>max</sub> during the majority of match time).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> It has been suggested that futsal players cover more high-intensity running distance than do football players during a regular match (22.6% vs 10% of total covering distance in high-intensity running).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02009;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Therefore, a greater physical demand in anaerobic performance is required in futsal players as compared with football players.

One of the non-invasive methods used to assess the cardiac autonomic nervous modulation is to record the ECG signals, measure the intervals between consecutive R waves, and assess the HR response and variation in the R-R intervals (RRI) by using the power spectral analysis. The HR variability (HRV) obtained in this way can provide useful information to understand the intrinsic factors involved in cardiac modulation during exercise<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> or physiological adaption after an acute and chronic training regime.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;8</xref> Specific adaptation of a vagal-related HR change has been shown in professional futsal players after a preseason training<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>

For example, Soares-Caldeira <italic>et al</italic> has reported that there was about 25% reduction in the RSA decline rate and about 23% increase in the total covered distance of the YY test in association with an increase in the SD of normal R-R interval (SDRR), root mean square different of successive normal R-R intervals (rMSSD), and low-frequency power after 4 weeks of preseason training in Brazilian professional futsal players.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Clearly, the physical, technical and tactical demands of the sports may contribute to the discrepancy in the anaerobic and aerobic capacities between football and futsal players. However, information regarding the physiological characteristics between these two sister sports is limited in the literature. Recently, we found increased vagal modulation, decreased sympathetic activation and lower resting HR in amateur football players than in sedentary adults.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> However, the participants in our study were measured without exercise-induced physiological stress. This limits our ability to understand the underlying mechanisms modulating the cardiac responses during different exercise modalities.

<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> the aim of this study was to investigate the acute effects of RSA and YY exercises on the autonomic nervous modulation in university football and futsal players.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Thirty-six male collegiate students voluntarily participated in this study (control group: n=14; football group: n=12; futsal group: n=10). The participants with a football or futsal training background were recruited from the first division of a university championship in Taiwan, whereas the control participants were physically active collegiate students with a background of physical education (no football or futsal activity within a year). The first reason for using physical education students as the control group in this study was that they matched with the study groups (football and futsal groups) in terms of age, body figure, lifestyle, etc. The major difference among the control group and the study groups was football exercise. Although some control subjects were engaged in other kinds of sports such as volleyball, cycling, jogging, etc, they had no experience in regular football or futsal training. This specific difference made them suitable for studying the effects of football and futsal training on the body adaptations of the participants. The second reason was that the exercise intensity in the RSA and YY protocols was extremely high. Non-physically active participants were unable to complete the exercise protocols in our study.</p><p>While the frequency of a training session was four times a week, the duration of a training session was around 2&#x02005;h in the football and futsal groups. The experiment was conducted during the precompetition period. The physical characteristics in all three groups are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJSEM2015000049TB1">table 1</xref>.

A starting position was set 30&#x02005;cm behind the starting line. The participants performed a 20&#x02005;m all-out shuttle sprint with a 20&#x02005;s rest interval. They were given two preliminary trials to familiarise themselves with the RSA followed by a 5&#x02005;min rest. A passive recovery during a 20&#x02005;s rest interval was allowed. A time gate system (Fusion Sport, Coopers Plains, Australia) was aligned on the starting line to record the sprint time.

The ECG signals were measured 15&#x02005;min before warm-up and 30&#x02005;min after exercises. The analogue signals of ECG were transformed into digital signals by using an analogue-to-digital converter with a sampling rate of 1000&#x02005;Hz via Biopac Student Lab system. The ECG waveforms were then filtered to remove any artefact by using Acqknowledge 4.2.1 software (Biopac Inc, California, USA). The RRI were calculated after eliminating the ectopic beats. If the percentage of ectopic beats was greater than 5%, then the participant was excluded from the analysis. A custom-written programme was then used to identify the peaks of the R waves (Mathcad 15, Parametric Technologies, Natick, MA). The last 512 RRI were obtained for HRV data analysis.</p><p>The mean, SD<sub>RR</sub>, coefficient of variation of R-R interval (CV<sub>RR</sub>) and rMSSD of RRI were calculated by using the standard formula for time domain analysis.

The participants were informed to take light training 1&#x02005;day before the visits and refrain from taking caffeine-containing substances and smoking 2&#x02005;h before the experiments. At the beginning of the experiments, the participants rested comfortably in supine position in a sports massage room. The locations of lead II arrangement were cleaned with alcohol wipes prior to application of ECG electrodes (Kendall 200 Series Foam Electrodes, Covidien, Mansfield, Massachusetts, USA). A portable HR monitor (FT 80, Polar Electro, Finland) was used to assess HR during exercises. Adhesive tapes were applied to secure the electrode placements during exercises. Resting ECG signals were then recorded for 15&#x02005;min by using a multichannel recorder (MP35, Biopac Inc, California, USA), followed by pre-exercise BL concentration measurement.

The participant wore sports shoes and performed the exercise protocols indoors on artificial lanes. The blood sample was taken immediately after the RSA or YY test, and the ECG signals were recorded 30&#x02005;min after exercise with supervision throughout the experiment.

Descriptive data are presented as median values with IQR. Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance on ranks was used to determine the differences in physical characteristics, HRV, BP and exercise performance among the groups. A <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis with Dunn's method was used to identify the differences among the groups when a significant difference was identified. To avoid daily variation of physical status, the percentage changes in HRV and haemodynamic measures 5&#x02005;min and 30&#x02005;min after the exercise were calculated by using the following formulae:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="bmjsem2015000049ueq1.jpg" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula><disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="bmjsem2015000049ueq2.jpg" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula></p><p>where &#x0201c;X&#x0201d; stands for the HRV or haemodynamic measure to be evaluated. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare the percentage changes in HRV and haemodynamic measures after exercise between the exercise protocols. The &#x003b1; level of significant difference was set at p&#x0003c;0.05. The Sigmaplot 13 for Windows was used to conduct a post hoc analysis of statistical power for comparisons among groups. The power was calculated as the minimum detectable difference in means of variable and expected SD of residuals of variable in the comparison among three groups of participants. The number of groups was set at 3, the group size was set at 36 participants and the level of &#x003b1; value was set at 0.05. The resultant powers of each variable are shown in all tables. We also used Sigmaplot 13 for Windows to estimate the sample size of the study. By using %LHR as the variables for the estimation of sample size, we found that 34 participants were required to minimise the type I errors in our study. Therefore, we recruited 36 participants in our study. The reason for choosing %LHR as the variable for estimation was that LHR is an essential HRV measure which is often used to represent sympathovagal balance of the subject. The sympathetic modulation of the subject was expected to be different in various sports protocols.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Exercise performance is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJSEM2015000049F1">figure 1</xref>.

percentage change in nHFP after exercise and increases in the percentage changes in VLHR and LHR after exercise in the RSA test, as compared with the control group. In addition, the HFF was found to be significantly reduced in the football and futsal groups as compared with the control group in the YY test, but not in the RSA test.</p><p>Our findings regarding the HRV indices in the RSA test are in agreement with a series of futsal studies investigating the effects of futsal training on the autonomic functions.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Interestingly, football and futsal are sister sports with high physiological demands, with variations in running patterns and physical activities. However, in contrast to the aerobic-oriented energy demand in football, the futsal outfield players are required to continuously execute all-out sprints (3&#x02013;4 bouts) with short recovery time (20&#x02013;30&#x02005;s low-intensity activities).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> de Freitas <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> reported that an anaerobic exercise test was more sensitive at reflecting the training adaptation to futsal players than an aerobic exercise test. In this study, the futsal group demonstrated significantly decreased %nHFP and significantly increased %VLHR and %LHR during the recovery period, as compared with the football and control groups. Solid evidence has supported that the component of HFP is related to vagal influence, whereas LHR is a mathematical expression to assess the autonomic balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic controls. Owing to the reciprocal relationship and coactivation between the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches in the ANS, autonomic control is the consequence of neural interaction between these two neural mechanisms. The result of this study demonstrated the excitatory effect of cardiac sympathetic activity in university futsal players after repeated bouts of short-distance sprint.</p><p>It is interesting to note that the main HRV indices had no significant differences among the groups in the YY protocol. Dutra <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> found that individual aerobic capacity was not a factor to determine cardiac autonomic modulation in healthy adults at rest. In contrast, our laboratory recently reported that there are increased vagal and decreased sympathetic modulations in amateur football players at rest, as compared with sedentary health adults.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Regarding the physiological adaptation to specific exercise training, previous studies have shown that the resting HR was decreased while the parasympathetic modulation was increased after completing a period of aerobic training.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> However, no significant changes in all HRV indices were found after exercise in the YY test. This finding seemed to be in contradiction to the common notion that the autonomic nervous modulation of the participants should be changed after specific exercise training. The control participants in this study were physical education students. It seems that university students with high compliance of sports adherence demonstrated similar postexercise profile of cardiac autonomic nervous modulation with football or futsal players after aerobic intermittent exercise, despite an attenuation of the total covered distance. The higher respiratory rate found in the control group after acute aerobic intermittent exercise may be a potential factor to undermine the true interpretation of cardiac autonomic activation during the recovery period. In addition to the HRV indices, other physiological markers such as plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine might be used to indicate the level of sympathetic activation. The lack of blood sample analysis in this study might therefore limit our understanding about the changes in sympathetic and parasympathetic modulations in the YY protocol.</p><p>Exercise duration and exercise mode may contribute to the discrepancy in sympathovagal balance and baroreflex control.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Baroreflex control via the sympathetic and parasympathetic activities is a key determinant to adjusting the HR response.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Our results showed increases in SBP and PP and decreases in DBP and MAP after completing both exercise protocols. The increases in SBP and PP are related to the elevation of peripheral vasoconstriction and stroke volume. However, no significant difference in the postexercise BP changes in all groups indicated that vasomotor activation was not a major mechanism in the findings of sympathetic activation and sympathovagal balance after the RSA exercise in futsal players and the change in %HFF after the YY exercise. Indeed, all groups experienced similar physiological and psychological strains during the RSA and YY exercises due to no significant differences in peak HR, RPE and BL concentration in group comparison. Thus, the metabolic demand and exercise intensity was equivalent in these three groups. The potential mechanisms related to postexercise change in HR responses in the football and futsal groups may not be supported by the carotid-cardiac baroreflex.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study showed that the percentage decrease in vagal modulation after exercise in futsal players was significantly reduced, while the percentage increase in sympathetic modulation in futsal players after exercise was significantly enhanced in the RSA test, but not in the YY test, as compared with the control group. The increase in sympathetic activity and the decrease in vagal activity in the futsal players were greater than the corresponding increase and decrease in the football players in the RSA test. In addition, the respiratory frequency was significantly reduced in the football and futsal players as compared with the controls in the aerobic YY test, but not in the anaerobic RSA test.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> Y-SC contributed to research design, data collection and manuscript preparation.
