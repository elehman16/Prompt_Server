In today's world, college students frequently have more complex problems than they used to have over a decade ago, including the typical or expected problems of college student &#x02014; difficulties in relationships and developmental issues; as well as the more severe problems, such as depression, sexual assault and thoughts of suicide.</p><p>Counseling is, in its essence, a &#x02018;helping relationship.&#x02019; The goal of counseling is to help individuals overcome many of their future problems. Counseling service for adults comprises a follow-up service, which may help counselees secure continuing education and assistance for personal and occupational adjustments. Modern counseling is a product of the educational system, which has deep roots in terms of concern for the individual's freedom, rights, dignity and worth as a human being. Counseling in the educational context comprises a very important and vital part of educational activities. Many students at different levels of education have been found to function at levels far below their capacities. Counseling would certainly help brighten the lives of many young individuals. It promotes emotional maturity, personality development, self-responsibility, creativity and ability to solve problems. Educational counseling has emerged as a discipline to provide help to students on campus of schools, colleges and universities, such that they are not tormented by their internal conflicts, do not become cynical and do not resort to self-destructive strategies. In recent times, education has come to have a wider meaning, namely, counseling, for it has increasingly been realized that learning in the ultimate analysis is individual learning or self-learning. The collegiate student is, for all practical purposes, an adult with no adult responsibilities. Thus, a total counseling program at the collegiate level would comprise an extension of the various services provided to the pupils at the earlier stages of their lives.</p><p>Anxiety is experienced by every individual at some point or the other in his/ her life. According to Coleman, &#x0201c;Anxiety is an internalized fear aroused by an impulse to commit mistakes.&#x0201d;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] It is a series of symptoms, which arise from faulty adaptation to the stresses and strains of life. Anxiety is one of the most common problems faced by college students. An author investigated examination-related anxiety experienced by medical students, with the Visual Analogue Scale for Anxiety (VASA) for three situational cues &#x02014; usual day-to-day anxiety, highest anxiety associated with major exams the previous year and anxiety experienced during the end-of-term examination just completed.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Twenty-eight weeks later, the students rated the anxiety experienced by them during a subsequent end-of-term psychiatry examination. For day-to-day anxiety, most students rated themselves toward the lower end of the VASA, though not markedly higher anxiety during the end-of-term psychiatry examination.</p><p>According to Coleman, depression is &#x0201c;an emotional state characterized by extreme dejection, gloomy ruminations, feelings of worthlessness, loss of hope, and often of apprehension.&#x0201d;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] The World Health Organization has declared depression as the leading cause of disability because of its physical, psychological and social impacts.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] The researchers conducted a study on depression among 129 first year psychology students in South Africa.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] The results revealed that psychology students reported significantly lower levels of depression than non-psychology students on the Beck Depression Inventory. Students who experience depression may feel an oppressive sense of sadness, fatigue, guilt and hopelessness. Depression is a common experience among college students, with one in seven students experiencing it. Brought on by a combination of students&#x02032; vulnerable age and the stress and demands of college life, depression and related conditions can strike for the first time in college, or come back to haunt those who had first battled it in high school. Medical students are more prone to depression than their non-medical peers. Researchers noted that depression gets doubled among medical students between the beginning and end of an academic year.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Most people experience feelings of being stressed out or anxious before an important event such as an exam or a class speech. An author pointed out that fear of failure is one of the sources of stress in a medical school.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] But many students face more than just normal stress; their lives are filled with overwhelming worrying and fear that are chronic and debilitating.</p><p>A researcher studied the relationship between depression and anxiety among undergraduate students in 18 Arab countries by a cross-cultural study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Beck Depression Inventory was administered to 9,168 participants, comprising 4,230 males and 4,938 females, their ages ranging from 18 to 25 years.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Findings indicated that depression was positively significant and correlated with anxiety. Authors studied the relation of depression and anxiety to life stress and achievement in students.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] The result showed that 9% of previously symptom-free students became depressed, and 20% became anxious at a clinically significant level. The explosion in medical knowledge means that every year they need to learn more to update themselves.</p><p>The pace of receiving knowledge is faster in a medical college than the student ever faced before. Authors stated that stress, health-related and emotional problems increase during the period of undergraduate medical education.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] This can lead to mental distress and has a negative impact on cognitive functioning and learning. Any student who has a scintilla of self-doubt will find that self-doubt got activated and magnified during his/ her education in a medical college. Countless hours spent in the library, harsh exams, competitions, stress and a small-to&#x02013;non-existent income for several years, sum up the everyday life of many medical students. Researchers found that unlike residents, medical students are not protected by limits on work hours.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Exam anxiety is the emotional reaction that some students face before exams. It has been observed by Morrison that medical students have marked undue stresses during pre-examination and examination period.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Studying itself can be stressful, but researchers found that there were specific health-related effects of medical education, including high levels of anxiety and depression. Suicidal ideation among medical trainees has been investigated less often and only periodically. The National College- Health Assessment Survey found that 9.5% of students preparing for health-related fields reported that they had experienced suicidal ideation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Emotional intelligence is highly associated with better psychological adjustment. Individuals reporting greater emotional clarity and a greater ability to repair their own emotional states report higher levels of self-esteem, another important indicator of mental health.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Researchers studied the prevalence of emotional disorders using the English version of the General Health Questionnaire-12 among respondents who were medical students at a private medical school in Ipoh, Perak, Malaysia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] The researchers indicated that the prevalence of emotional disorders among the medical students was high (46.2%). Previous studies on the psychological health of physicians shows the medical community exhibits a relatively high level of certain mental health problems, particularly depression, which may lead to drug abuse and suicide.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Counseling programs are essential among students for subjective well-being and mental health. The positive effects of such counseling services and stress management programs are frequently reported.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] The authors illustrated the behavioral treatment of medical students and physicians whose debilitating test-related anxiety was associated with their failure to pass the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Treatment featured progressive muscle relaxation, systematic desensitization, the self-control triad, behavioral rehearsal and a psycho-educational component. Ninety-three percent of the clients eventually passed the examination while in treatment. Pass rates for this group were substantially higher than the national average for repeat USMLE test takers.</p><sec id="sec1-1"><title>OBJECTIVES</title><p>

The questionnaire is composed of items relating to symptoms of depression, such as hopelessness and irritability; of cognition, such as guilt or feelings of being punished; and physical symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss.

As both the groups belong to the same institution and suffer from more or less similar problems, the result indicated that there was no significant difference between them before counseling. Therefore, the hypothesis &#x0201c;There will be no significant difference in depression between the experimental and control groups before counseling.&#x0201d; is accepted.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Depression among experimental and control groups before counseling</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IPJ-19-41-g003"/></table-wrap><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref> shows the values of mean, standard deviation and the F ratio, which reveals a significant difference in depression between the experimental and control groups.

Medical students are prone to depression due to hard work, no resting time, Inadequate sleep, fatigue, etc. It is believed that, students&#x02019; coping strategies and personal health deteriorate as they progress through medical school. Students often dismiss their feelings of despondency as a normal emotional response to medical school education, where they live from test to test and don&#x02032;t take time off for themselves. Almost similar problems were faced by the medical students in this study, wherein it was found that they needed help to overcome such depression, and it was also found that counseling was effective for the students in considerably relieving them from depression and finding solutions of their choice. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T8">Table 8</xref> shows that there was a significant difference in the levels of depression among girls in the experimental group before and after counseling; and there was no significant difference in the pre-test and post-test levels of depression among girls of the control group.

Counseling certainly helped to increase the levels of self-confidence and the ability of adjustment of the medical students. It is suggested that counseling should be an integral part of any educational course, especially professional courses, in order to boost self-confidence and adjustment ability of the students. Relaxation techniques have time and again proved that they are adjunct to medicine in a number of ways; thus they have to be imbibed as a way of life for many to overcome such problems.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Coleman</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name></person-group><source>Abnormal Psychology and Modern Life</source><year>1998</year><publisher-loc>Los Angles</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Scott Foresman and Co</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kidson</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Hornblow</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Examination anxiety in medical students: Experiences with the visual analogue scale for anxiety</article-title><source>Med Educ</source><year>1982</year><volume>16</volume><fpage>247</fpage><lpage>50</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7132800</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Vogelsang</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The visual analog scale: An accurate and sensitive method for self-reporting preoperative anxiety</article-title><source>J Post Anesth Nursing</source><year>1988</year><volume>3</volume><fpage>235</fpage><lpage>9</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><article-title>WHO department of non communicable disease surveillance (August 18th 2006)</article-title><date-in-citation>Last accessed on 2007 Mar 20</date-in-citation><comment>Available from:
