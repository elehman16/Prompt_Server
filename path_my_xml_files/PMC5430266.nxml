treadmill-based analysis systems for measuring gait parameters during comfortable walking
in healthy young adults. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty-three healthy adults participated
in this study. Gait parameters were measured with simultaneous use of accelerometer-based
and treadmill-based gait analysis systems, while participants walked for 30 s. [Results]
There was a highly-significant correlation between the two systems with respect to cadence
and velocity. The cadence, speed, and stride measured with the accelerometer system were
significantly and highly correlated with the cadence, velocity, and number of steps
measured with the treadmill-based system. The gait cycle duration measured with the
accelerometer system was significantly and highly correlated with the step time and stride
time measured with the treadmill-based gait system. [Conclusion] Gait analysis using an
accelerometer system is a valid method for assessment of the effectiveness of therapeutic
interventions in a clinical setting.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Accelerometer</kwd><kwd>Treadmill</kwd><kwd>Gait analysis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Gait analysis systematically evaluates human movement during walking, and enables
quantitative analysis of gait patterns and kinematic characteristics<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Gait analysis is important in clinical practice, and is
used to determine whether a patient needs surgery, to evaluate postoperative outcomes, and
to determine when outcomes need to be monitored<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Pressure sensor systems (PSS) or motion capture systems (MCS) are used to obtain kinematic
information after gait analysis. However, these conventional methods require special
laboratories and expensive equipment, as well as technically skilled experts and long
post-processing time to obtain results. Moreover, due to limited measurement space, it can
be difficult to acquire a large number of gait cycles.</p><p>Recently, accelerometer-based gait analysis (AGA) systems have been widely used due to
their ability to overcome the limitations of existing methods. AGA offers several advantages
compared to conventional methods. First, the accelerometer is portable, due to its small
size and light weight. Second, AGA only requires an accelerometer and a computer, with no
restriction of location. Third, the setup process is very simple, and AGA can even be
implemented by beginners. Fourth, the accelerometer does not interfere with walking motion,
enabling accurate data collection. These advantages of AGA make it appropriate for use in
clinical practice<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Various studies have
tested the reliability of AGA results and compared them with the results of direct gait
analysis. The reliability and validity of AGA results have been demonstrated by a study on
the consistency of repeated measurements, a study on the correlation with results using the
Walkway PSS, and a study comparing the results with those using a 3-dimensional (3D)
infrared camera<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there has been
little research on the correlation between AGA and treadmill-based gait analysis (TGA)
systems. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the correlation between gait parameters
measured using an AGA system and a TGA system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty-three healthy adults (9 males, 14 females) participated in this study. Healthy young
adults in their 20s or 30s who were capable of voluntary and independent walking, who had no

University in Seoul (2-1040781-AB-N-01-2016070HR). Participants provided signed consent
after receiving verbal and written information about the study.</p><p>Gait parameters were measured while participants comfortably walked for 30&#x02005;s, with
simultaneous use of two different measurement systems: an AGA system (G-Sensor, BTS
Bioengineering S.p.A., Italy), and a TGA system (Zebris FDM-T, Zebris medical GmbH,
Germany). Gait speed measured during initial comfortable ground walking was then applied to
treadmill walking for assessment. Measurement was performed three times and averaged, with
participants facing forward and walking comfortably according to the set speed. Cadence,
speed, strides elaborated, gait cycle duration, and % stride length/height on each side
(left and right) were calculated by the AGA system. Cadence, velocity, number of steps, step
time, stride time, stance phase, swing phase, and double support on each side were
calculated by the TGA system. All collected data were analyzed using SPSS version 18.0 (SPSS
for Windows; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statistics were used for the general
characteristics of the participants and Pearson&#x02019;s analysis was used to determine the
correlation between the AGA and TGA results for gait parameters. Alpha was set at 0.05 for
all statistical tests.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The results of the study showed a strong correlation between AGA and TGA for cadence

system in healthy adults. The results confirmed a high correlation between major gait
parameters measured in the two gait analysis systems.</p><p>In this study, we selected TGA as the direct measurement method. TGA is able to collect a
large volume of gait data in a limited space. Moreover, TGA is often used in the
rehabilitation and evaluation of patients, since it is possible to adjust the walking speed
in steps of 0.1&#x02005;km/h, and to perform walking training while maintaining a constant speed.
The common use of TGA in clinical practice has prompted various studies on its effects.
Alton et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that walking speed
in stroke patients increased after gait training on treadmills. Miller et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that gait training on treadmills
contributed more to improving walking ability than gait training on even ground. Thus,
treadmill-based gait training and evaluation have been actively used in clinical practice
for stroke patients and other patients with impaired gait<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, treadmill-based gait evaluation requires data to be
collected in a laboratory, with associated high costs. Consequently, AGA is used as a
convenient and easy method in clinical practice. AGA systems are small and light, and they
impede walking during measurement less than conventional systems. Mens et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the highest reliability was
achieved when the accelerometer was fixed at the level of the lower lumbar and sacral
regions, which are at the same height as the center of mass of the body, and which also
comprise the center of rotation of the pelvis and trunk.</p><p>We used a G-Sensor (BTS Bioengineering, Italy) for AGA. Hartmann et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> and Park<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> studied the correlation between AGA results and those using a
Walkway, and reported a high correlation between gait velocity and cadence. Mayagoitia et
al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> and Liu et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> reported a high correlation between 3D
optical measuring equipment and AGA. Thus, combining the results of several previous studies
demonstrated a strong correlation between the results for AGA with those for direct gait
analysis. For these reasons, Bouten et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that accelerometers are appropriate for the evaluation of
human motion. The present study also confirmed strong correlations between AGA and TGA,
demonstrating that AGA can be used as a quantitative evaluation tool to evaluate gait in
clinical practice.</p><p>This study had some limitations. The subjects were healthy adults, and it might be
difficult to generalize the correlations to patients with an impaired gait. The small number
of subjects was also a limitation.</p><p>AGA systems are portable, small, and lightweight, and can easily be used by beginners.
Moreover, the results of AGA were shown to be strongly correlated with those of TGA.
Therefore, AGA can be an effective evaluation tool for gait analysis in clinical
practice.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Tao</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><etal>et
