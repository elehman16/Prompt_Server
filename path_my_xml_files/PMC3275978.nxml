It was also used for treating supraventricular tachycardia, asthma, and pain of Herpes Zoster.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Its ease of performance and unilateral effect has made it an ideal block for unilateral surgeries such as mastectomy, hernias, and renal manipulations.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Continuous PVB has been used for pain relief following thoracotomy and mastectomy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Breast surgery is frequently associated with postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), pain, and painful restricted movements.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] PVB has the potential to offer long-lasting pain relief because it can uniquely eliminate cortical responses to thoracic dermatomal stimulation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Recently, PVB has been used for postoperative analgesia as well as sole anesthetic in patients undergoing breast surgery by several workers.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Benefits include a reduction in PONV, prolonged postoperative pain relief, and potential for ambulatory discharge.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] It has also found to be effective in preventing chronic pain following mastectomy,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] and it has been suggested that the risk of recurrence or metastasis is reduced in patients undergoing radical mastectomy (MRM) for breast cancer under PVB.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Local infiltration is a very old and proven method for analgesia. Its use is associated with a decrease in opioid requirement. Patients receiving local infiltration for thoracotomy have better respiratory outcomes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Continuous infusion of local anesthetic at the incision site following MRM has been found to be useful.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] With the advent of new analgesia regimes, PVB needs evaluation with comparative studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>After approval of the Institutional review board, this prospective randomized study was conducted on 40 ASA grade 1&#x02013;3 patients admitted to Maulana Azad Medical College and Lok Nayak Hospital for elective unilateral mastectomy under general anesthesia. The exclusion criteria were bilateral surgery, infection at block site, coagulation derangement or bleeding disorder, patient refusal, and allergy to amide group of local anesthetics. Patients were randomly allocated using computer generated numbers to one of the two groups comprising 20 patients each. In one set of patients (group P), a catheter was inserted in paravertebral space after induction and in other set of patients (group L), the surgical site was infiltrated after the completion of surgery.</p><p>On the night before the surgery, the patients were explained about the whole procedure and lean body weight (LBW) was calculated by the following formula:[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>LBW (women) = (1.07 &#x000d7; weight (kg)) - 148 &#x000d7; weight (kg)<sup>2</sup> /height (cm)<sup>2</sup></p><p>All patients were premedicated with oral diazepam 10 or 5 mg, as per weight, 2 h prior to surgery. In the operation theater, patients were given morphine 0.1 mg/kg LBW intravenously (IV). Two minutes later, anesthesia was induced with thiopentone sodium sleep dose and vecuronium bromide 0.1 mg/kg LBW was used to facilitate the intubation of trachea. Lungs were ventilated with isoflurane and nitrous oxide in oxygen. Metoclopramide 0.2 mg/kg LBW IV was given 10 min before the end of the surgery.</p><p>In group P, following intubation, patient were turned lateral, with the side to be operated and blocked upwards. Under all aseptic precautions, a Touhy needle was inserted perpendicular to the skin 2.5 cm lateral from the cephalad edge of T3 spinous process. After the transverse process was contacted, the needle was withdrawn and redirected in the cephalad direction to walk off the transverse process. The ultimate goal was to insert the needle to a depth of 1 cm past the transverse process using loss of resistance technique.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] A catheter was threaded and left 3&#x02013;5 cm inside the space. A loading dose of 0.3 ml/kg LBW[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] of 0.25% bupivacaine was given through catheter and patient was turned supine. One hour after giving the loading dose an infusion of 0.25% bupivacaine was started @0.2 ml/kg/h and continued for next 20 h. Success of block was assessed by pin-prick after recovery from anesthesia. In group L, at the end of the surgery, the incision site was infiltrated with 0.25% bupivacaine 0.3 ml/kg LBW.</p><p>Patients were assessed for the following parameters after 30 min and subsequently after 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h after the reversal.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Pain</title><p>Visual analog score (VAS) score[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] was used to assess the pain scores in the patient at the above intervals . At any point of time if patient had VAS score &#x0003e; 3, intramuscular tramadol was administered 2 mg/kg LBW and continued for 8 h. Morphine was used as second line analgesic which was administered IV using patient controlled analgesia pump. If the patient had VAS score &#x0003e; 3, in between the subsequent visits, the patient was instructed to administer morphine 3 mg IV and lock out interval was fixed at 10 min.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Postoperative nausea and vomiting</title><p>PONV[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] was assessed at the same times.

The relative containment of the paravertebral space limits anesthetic diffusion, providing prolonged afferent blockade, and excellent surgical analgesia in both the inpatient and outpatient setting.-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] D&#x02019;Ercole <italic>et al</italic>. reported the use of PVB to achieve effective surgical anesthesia and postoperative pain control for breast cancer surgery in a pregnant patient requiring MRM with axillary dissection.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Several typesof pain syndrome are described: phantom breast pain, pain inor around the scar, pain in the chest wall, and pain in the arm. Phantom sensations after mastectomy have been studied extensivelyby Kroner and colleagues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] ,with an incidence varying from about 13% at 3 weeks to17% at 6 years. Kairaluoma <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] conducted a study on 60 patients scheduled for breast cancer surgery and randomly gave single injection PVB at T3 with bupivacaine 5 mg/ml (1.5 mg/kg) or saline before GA. A 1-year follow-up was performed and found that PVB reduced the prevalence of postoperative chronic pain.</p><p>In a retrospective analysis, Aristomenis <italic>et al</italic>. suggested that PVB for breast cancer surgery reduces the risk of recurrence or metastasis during the initial years of follow-up. This can be ascribed to the fact that the process of surgery inevitably induces a profound neuroendocrine, metabolic, and cytokine responses. A consequence of this stress response is transient perioperative inhibition of immune function. PVB analgesia reduces the need for opioids, which themselves impair immune function. Inhibition of the surgical stress response by PVB might attenuate perioperative factors that enhance tumor growth and spread.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>The results of our study demonstrated that thoracic PVB resulted in superior postoperative pain relief compared with GA, followed by local infiltration when used for MRM. 18 patients (90%) in group L required tramadol. The two patients who did not require tramadol were aged 60 and 65 years old. Requirement of first dose of tramadol was seen in 55% of patients at the time of 1<sup>st</sup> assessment at 30 min following reversal in group L. No patient in group P required tramadol. In a study, 81% patients undergoing MRM under GA (without local infiltration) required immediate postoperative analgesia (within 30 min) in contrast to 12.5 % of patients undergoing MRM under PVB[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]. Tramadol was chosen as the rescue analgesic as it is known to cause minimal sedation and respiratory depression.</p><p>In addition, there are other advantages of PVB for women undergoing breast surgery such as reduced incidence of PONV.-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] L&#x000f6;nnqvist <italic>et al</italic>. prospectively evaluated complications after PVB (thoracic and lumbar) in 367 patients (319 adults, 48 children) and observed the following frequency of complications: vascular puncture 3.8%, hypotension 4.6%, pleural puncture 1.1%, and pneumothorax 0.5%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] We had no complication.</p><p>PONV complicate between 20% and 50% of all operative procedures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] The incidence is greater in patients undergoing general anesthesia, in female patients, in patients experiencing postoperative pain, and in women undergoing breast surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] A 59% incidence of nausea and vomiting during the 24-h interval after breast cancer surgery with general anesthesia has been reported.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>In our study, in group L, 75% patients required antiemetics compared to group P in which 10% patients required antiemetics. This is in contrast to a study by Coveney <italic>et al</italic>. in which 20% incidence was noticed in PVB group and 39% in GA group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] However, they used propofol as the induction agent which may have resulted in a lower incidence of PONV in the GA group. They used single-shot PVB as compared to continuous PVB in our patients.</p><p>OASS were found to be consistently higher in group P, i.e., patients were less sedated than group L patients. The higher levels of sedation in group L can be ascribed to the use of tramadol and morphine as rescue analgesics. Patients undergoing surgery under GA with PVB had lower pain score, PONV, and sedation. These are criteria favorable for better patient comfort and early discharge from hospital.</p><p>To conclude, PVB with general anesthesia is associated with better postoperative analgesia, lower incidence of PONV, and better alertness score compared to general anesthesia with local infiltration.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold>
