Non-progressing patients could continue cilengitide for up to 1&#x000a0;year. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). No statistical tests were performed since the study was exploratory in nature and the number of patients enrolled was relatively small. <italic>Results</italic> Median PFS was 54, 63, 63, and 67&#x000a0;days for cilengitide 240, 400, and 600&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>, and docetaxel 75&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. One-year survival rates were 13&#x000a0;%, 13&#x000a0;%, 29&#x000a0;%, and 27&#x000a0;%, respectively. The response rate (partial response only) with docetaxel was 15&#x000a0;%. No responses were reported in any cilengitide arm. The most frequent grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events in the docetaxel group were leukopenia and neutropenia (experienced by 13&#x000a0;% of patients). Hematologic toxicity of this severity did not occur in cilengitide-treated patients. <italic>Conclusion</italic> With the highest dose of cilengitide (600&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>), median PFS and 1-year survival were similar to those in patients treated with docetaxel 75&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> and there were fewer grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cilengitide</kwd><kwd>Integrin inhibitor</kwd><kwd>Docetaxel</kwd><kwd>Non-small-cell lung cancer</kwd><kwd>Second-line treatment</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and the majority of cases (85&#x02013;90&#x000a0;%) are non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Only 30&#x02013;35&#x000a0;% of patients with NSCLC present with sufficiently localized disease at diagnosis to attempt curative surgical resection (stages IA and IB, IIA and IIB, and IIIA), and ~50&#x000a0;% of those who undergo surgical resection will experience local or systemic relapse. Thus ~80&#x000a0;% of all patients with lung cancer are considered for chemotherapy at some point during the course of their illness, and platinum-based combination regimens are still considered standard of care for the majority of patients in the first-line treatment of NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>At the time of this study (1999&#x02013;2001), single-agent docetaxel (75&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 3&#x000a0;weeks) was the only approved chemotherapy for the second-line treatment of advanced NSCLC in the USA and Europe, having demonstrated longer survival and better quality of life than best supportive care alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and higher rates of 1-year survival than vinorelbine or ifosfamide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Since then, although second-line options have broadened, efforts to improve on the efficacy of docetaxel, either by using an alternative agent or by combining docetaxel with carboplatin, have not proved successful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and single-agent docetaxel remains one of the second-line standards of care. However, docetaxel has only moderate activity and is associated with non-hematologic and hematologic toxicity, in particular, neutropenia and febrile neutropenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. There is therefore a continuing need for new therapies which are active in NSCLC and which have a favorable safety profile giving them potential for use in combination.</p><p>Cilengitide (EMD 121974) is the first compound in a new class of targeted anticancer therapies &#x02013; the integrin inhibitors &#x02013; to reach phase III clinical trial, and is currently in phase III in glioblastoma. Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane receptors that play key roles in the interaction between cells, adhesion to the extracellular environment, and cell migration involved in angiogenesis and tumor development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Cilengitide is a novel cyclized arginine&#x02013;glycine&#x02013;aspartic acid-containing pentapeptide that selectively inhibits the cell-surface integrins &#x003b1;V&#x003b2;3 and &#x003b1;V&#x003b2;5. Cilengitide is thought to act on &#x003b1;V&#x003b2;3- and &#x003b1;V&#x003b2;5-expressing tumor cells both directly, by deactivating signals involved in survival and growth, and indirectly, by inhibiting angiogenesis and thereby tumor growth. It blocks endothelial and tumor-cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The current clinical development program for cilengitide includes glioblastoma (the phase III CENTRIC and phase II CORE trials), head and neck cancer (phase II, ADVANTAGE), and NSCLC (phase II, CERTO). The randomized phase II trial in the first-line NSCLC setting (clinicaltrials.gov NCT00842712) is investigating the effects of adding cilengitide to cetuximab and platinum-based chemotherapy. Here we report the first phase II study (EMD 121974&#x02013;003) to examine the effects of cilengitide in patients with NSCLC. It investigated the efficacy and safety of three different doses of single-agent cilengitide compared with docetaxel monotherapy as second-line treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC who had failed first-line chemotherapy.</p><p>This study was conducted in the period 1999&#x02013;2001 and its results were not published &#x02013; in fact, the further clinical development of cilengitide was put on hold. However, the growing interest in anti-angiogenesis as a therapeutic approach prompted renewed interest in the molecule and has resulted in the extensive trial program noted above. In 2009, the results of this early NSCLC trial were published in poster form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and attracted interest. Moreover, this study remains relevant since the comparator used, docetaxel, is still a standard of care in second-line NSCLC, and efforts continue to find a drug with which to combine it without adding unacceptable toxicity. This study provides clinical evidence for the activity of cilengitide in NSCLC, complementing the preclinical in vivo data suggesting antitumor efficacy and evidence from tumor tissue that integrin overexpression may be of prognostic significance in NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a multinational, multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel-group, phase II study in patients with advanced (stage IIIB and IV) NSCLC who had failed first-line chemotherapy.

In the absence of a defined maximum tolerated dose for cilengitide, the three highest dose levels used in phase I (ie, 240, 400, and 600&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>) were chosen for comparison with docetaxel in this randomized phase II trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Assessments</title><p>PFS was defined as the time interval between the date of randomization and the date of disease progression or death, whichever occurred first.

Response rate was defined as the sum of the rates of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) per treatment arm. Tumor growth control was defined as the sum of the CR, PR, and stable disease (SD) rates. OS was defined as the time from the start of study drug administration until death. Safety was evaluated by laboratory assessments, physical measurements (heart rate; systolic/diastolic blood pressure; body temperature; body weight; status according to the Karnofsky Performance Index; physical examination electrocardiogram [ECG]), and monitoring of adverse events (AEs) which were graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) system version 2.

The first patient was enrolled in November 1999 and the study was completed in October 2001. Three patients did not receive any study medication (one in the cilengitide 240&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> group and two in the docetaxel group), meaning that 137 patients were included in the safety analysis. Patient baseline characteristics are shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>: the majority was male (67&#x000a0;%), their mean age was 60.2&#x000a0;years (range 33&#x02013;80&#x000a0;years), and 96&#x000a0;% had stage IV disease. Given the date of the study, histology data were not documented as rigorously as would be the case in current trials (and 46&#x000a0;% of tumors were not specified in this regard). However, from the data available, the predominant histology across treatment groups was adenocarcinoma. The majority of patients had received platinum-based regimens as first-line therapy. The proportion of patients who had had tumor-related surgery was higher among patients randomized to docetaxel and 600&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> cilengitide than in those randomized to lower doses of the integrin inhibitor.

Interestingly &#x02013; and supporting the relevance of this study &#x02013; the median 194-day OS we report with 3-weekly docetaxel closely matches the median 189-day OS in a meta-analysis of data from five second-line docetaxel trials involving 433 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>No CRs were seen with either cilengitide or docetaxel.

The safety profile of cilengitide in terms of grade 3/4 treatment-related AEs was superior to that of docetaxel: while 16&#x000a0;% of docetaxel-treated patients experienced grade 3/4 leukopenia and neutropenia, no such cases were reported in cilengitide-treated patients. Indeed, cilengitide was well tolerated generally in the present trial, and this has remained the case even at the substantially higher doses used in subsequent studies, such as those in which patients with recurrent glioblastoma received up to 2400&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> of the drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Importantly, the AEs with cilengitide showed little overlap with those of docetaxel, suggesting that the two agents might be combined, either simultaneously or sequentially.</p><p>This study was conducted 10&#x000a0;years ago, when requirements for histology were less rigorous than today, and trials in non-selected populations of NSCLC patients were routine. The direct applicability of its results to current management is therefore limited. However, the study remains important in showing the potential of cilengitide as a well-tolerated treatment option in advanced NSCLC and supports its development as a combination partner in therapy. An ongoing phase II study (CERTO) is investigating cilengitide in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy and the growth factor receptor inhibitor cetuximab as first-line treatment for advanced NSCLC. Recent results from the safety run-in phase of this trial have shown that cilengitide (at doses of 1000 or 2000&#x000a0;mg twice weekly) combined with standard therapy was well tolerated with no unexpected AEs and no dose-limiting toxicities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank patients, investigators, co-investigators, and the study teams at each of the participating centers and at Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany.
