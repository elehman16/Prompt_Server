We assessed the effect of tbo-filgrastim on cardiac conduction and repolarization in healthy subjects. A three-arm, parallel-group, active- and placebo-controlled, double-blind study randomized healthy adults to a single 5 &#x003bc;g/kg intravenous tbo-filgrastim infusion, a single intravenous placebo infusion, or a single 400 mg moxifloxacin oral dose. The primary end point was placebo-corrected time-matched change from baseline in QT interval corrected using a QT individual correction (QTcI) method. Secondary end points included heart rate, PR interval, QRS duration, change in electrocardiogram patterns, correlation between QTcI change from baseline (milliseconds) and tbo-filgrastim serum concentrations, and safety variables. A total of 145 subjects were enrolled (50 tbo-filgrastim, 50 placebo, 45 moxifloxacin). Peak placebo-corrected change from baseline for QTcI with tbo-filgrastim was 3.5 milliseconds, with a two-sided 95% upper confidence interval of 7.2 milliseconds, demonstrating no signal for any tbo-filgrastim effect on QTc. Concentration-effect modeling showed no evidence of an effect of tbo-filgrastim on cardiac repolarization. Tbo-filgrastim produced no clinically significant changes in other electrocardiogram parameters. Tbo-filgrastim was well tolerated.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>tbo-filgrastim</kwd><kwd>electrocardiogram</kwd><kwd>QT interval</kwd><kwd>granulocyte colony-stimulating factor</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neutropenia associated with myelosuppressive chemotherapy can often result in an increased risk of serious or life-threatening infections.<xref rid="b1-dddt-9-2653" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-dddt-9-2653" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Treatment with recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) stimulates neutrophil proliferation and differentiation, and reduces the severity and duration of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and febrile neutropenia.<xref rid="b3-dddt-9-2653" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10-dddt-9-2653" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Tbo-filgrastim, a recombinant methionyl human G-CSF produced in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2008 under the international nonproprietary name filgrastim and marketed in Europe under the trade names Tevagrastim<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Ratiograstim<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, Petach Tikva, Israel).

For the comparison of tbo-filgrastim versus placebo, a real prolongation effect of 3 milliseconds maximum was assumed, as this is a commonly used estimate of difference for drugs that have a negative cardiac risk in preclinical studies and is required to demonstrate a significantly shorter effect than 10 milliseconds, as supported by the ICH E14 guidance.<xref rid="b14-dddt-9-2653" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A sample size of 50 subjects was implied, assuming that statistical confirmation had to be performed simultaneously for up to 13 time points, that a prolongation existed for no more than two of the 13 time points (and that such prolongations were no more than 3 milliseconds), and that the overall power of confirming that there was no increased risk of QTc prolongation was approximately 90%. The statistical tests for the eleven time points for which no QTc prolongation was expected did not negatively affect the overall power, because the probability to reject the hypothesis of a QTc prolongation of &#x02265;10 milliseconds approached 1 for each of these tests (99% if the sample size was approximately 50 per treatment group).</p><p>Cardiac end points were evaluated in the ECG population, which included all randomized subjects who received the study drug and had digital ECG data collected before study-drug administration and at one or more time points after study-drug administration. Pharmacokinetic end points were evaluated in all subjects who received one dose of tbo-filgrastim and had sufficient pharmacokinetic samples to allow accurate calculation (six or more samples covering absorption and elimination phases). Pharmacokinetic effects on cardiac end points were evaluated in all subjects who received tbo-filgrastim and had digital ECG data collected before study-drug administration and at one or more time points after study-drug administration, as well as a time-matched serum concentration.</p><p>A linear mixed-effect modeling approach was used to quantify the relationship between the serum concentration of tbo-filgrastim and &#x00394;&#x00394;QTc in subjects who had both a time-matched &#x00394;&#x00394;QTc and a tbo-filgrastim serum concentration.

Moxifloxacin was the positive control for this thorough QT study, due to its consistent QT effect and favorable cardiovascular safety profile.<xref rid="b14-dddt-9-2653" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-dddt-9-2653" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b19-dddt-9-2653" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> It is a synthetic, broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic,<xref rid="b20-dddt-9-2653" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and is commonly used in thorough QT studies to demonstrate assay sensitivity, with an expected magnitude of placebo-corrected change from baseline of 8&#x02013;15 milliseconds using time-matched analysis.<xref rid="b15-dddt-9-2653" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Results for the moxifloxacin QTcI time-matched analysis (maximum response of 13.8 milliseconds at 6 hours and the lower bounds of the two-sided 97.5% CIs exceeding 5 milliseconds at all four prespecified time points) and the demonstration of the typical time course for the moxifloxacin-induced increase in QTcI confirmed the assay sensitivity for the study. To further confirm the validity of the study, the mean change from baseline for QTcI was within 3 milliseconds for the placebo group, demonstrating that any spontaneous factors potentially resulting in a change in QTc were well controlled.</p><p>Single doses of intravenously administered tbo-filgrastim and oral moxifloxacin were well tolerated in healthy subjects. The AE profile of tbo-filgrastim was similar to that observed in previous clinical trials conducted in healthy subjects,<xref rid="b12-dddt-9-2653" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-dddt-9-2653" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and similar to the profile for drug-related AEs in studies conducted in breast cancer, lung cancer, and non-Hodgkin&#x02019;s lymphoma patients receiving chemotherapy.<xref rid="b3-dddt-9-2653" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b8-dddt-9-2653" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-dddt-9-2653" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Whether thorough QT analyses should be required for biologics is a matter of debate. QT interval prolongation by most small-molecule drugs is thought to result from direct interaction of the drug with the human <italic>hERG</italic>-encoded channel conducting the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium current.<xref rid="b21-dddt-9-2653" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Large molecules, such as monoclonal antibodies (IgM monoclonal antibodies ~1,000 kDa) cannot interact directly with the <italic>hERG</italic>-channel pore.<xref rid="b21-dddt-9-2653" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b23-dddt-9-2653" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Therefore, a thorough QTc study is not usually required for monoclonal antibody drugs. However, thorough QT studies may be necessary for biologics that are smaller than 5 kDa, biologics that target cardiac or vascular tissues, and compounds with positive preclinical cardiovascular safety signals.<xref rid="b22-dddt-9-2653" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Furthermore, biologics and large molecules may still be able to interact with the <italic>hERG</italic> channel indirectly via effects on ion-channel trafficking. In the case of tbo-filgrastim, which has a molecular weight of 18.8 kDa,<xref rid="b11-dddt-9-2653" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> thorough QT studies were conducted to rule out any possible cardiac effects.</p><p>In conclusion, in this well-conducted, thorough, and valid ECG study, an intravenous dose of tbo-filgrastim with pharmacokinetic values that matched or exceeded those of the recommended therapeutic dose had no demonstrable effects on HR, PR interval, QRS interval duration, ECG morphology, or cardiac repolarization, and was well tolerated.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was sponsored by Teva Branded Pharmaceutical Products R&#x00026;D, Inc.
