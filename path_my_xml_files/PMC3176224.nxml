However, breakthrough parasitemias were disproportionately of the alternate dimorphic form of MSP2, the FC27 genotype. We therefore undertook a dose-escalating, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 1 trial in healthy, malaria-na&#x000ef;ve adults of MSP2-C1, a vaccine containing recombinant forms of the two families of <italic>msp2</italic> alleles, 3D7 and FC27 (<italic>Ec</italic>MSP2-3D7 and <italic>Ec</italic>MSP2-FC27), formulated in equal amounts with Montanide&#x000ae; ISA 720 as a water-in-oil emulsion.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>The trial was designed to include three dose cohorts (10, 40, and 80 &#x000b5;g), each with twelve subjects receiving the vaccine and three control subjects receiving Montanide&#x000ae; ISA 720 adjuvant emulsion alone, in a schedule of three doses at 12-week intervals. Due to unexpected local reactogenicity and concern regarding vaccine stability, the trial was terminated after the second immunisation of the cohort receiving the 40 &#x000b5;g dose; no subjects received the 80 &#x000b5;g dose. Immunization induced significant IgG responses to both isoforms of MSP2 in the 10 &#x000b5;g and 40 &#x000b5;g dose cohorts, with antibody levels by ELISA higher in the 40 &#x000b5;g cohort. Vaccine-induced antibodies recognised native protein by Western blots of parasite protein extracts and by immunofluorescence microscopy. Although the induced anti-MSP2 antibodies did not directly inhibit parasite growth <italic>in vitro</italic>, IgG from the majority of individuals tested caused significant antibody-dependent cellular inhibition (ADCI) of parasite growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>As the majority of subjects vaccinated with MSP2-C1 developed an antibody responses to both forms of MSP2, and that these antibodies mediated ADCI provide further support for MSP2 as a malaria vaccine candidate. However, in view of the reactogenicity of this formulation, further clinical development of MSP2-C1 will require formulation of MSP2 in an alternative adjuvant.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anzctr.org.au/ACTRN12607000552482.aspx">12607000552482</ext-link>

Most malaria cases occur in Africa, with 85&#x00025; of an estimated 781,000 deaths in children under five years of age due to <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria <xref rid="pone.0024413-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Although significant advances have been made in the control of malaria through the deployment of insecticide-treated bed nets and artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) <xref rid="pone.0024413-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, the growing threat of drug resistance in malaria parasites <xref rid="pone.0024413-Dondorp1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and the limited choice of insecticides necessitate the development of new tools to reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by this disease. A Phase 3 trial of the pre-erythrocytic circumsporozoite protein (CSP) vaccine RTS,S is currently ongoing, and has the potential to be the first licensed malaria vaccine. (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00866619). However, this vaccine is unlikely to confer complete protection. For this reason the continued clinical development of asexual blood-stage antigens as complementary or alternative vaccine components, remains a priority.</p><p>Of the life-cycle stages of the malaria parasite present in the blood that could be targeted by vaccine-induced immune responses, the merozoite has been the focus of most research. This is the life-cycle stage released when the infected erythrocyte ruptures, and is present only transiently in the blood before it invades another erythrocyte. Early experimental data demonstrating effective vaccination with whole merozoite extracts was followed by the identification of a number of important merozoite surface proteins, some of which remain vaccine candidates. These include Merozoite Surface Protein 1 (MSP1), Apical Membrane Antigen1 (AMA1), MSP2 (Merozoite Surface Protein 2) and MSP3 <xref rid="pone.0024413-Anders1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024413-Beeson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024413-Roussilhon1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. MSP2 is a &#x0223c;28 kDa protein that is anchored in the membrane of the merozoite by a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol (GPI) anchor <xref rid="pone.0024413-Smythe1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024413-Gerold1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The function of MSP2 is unknown but it appears to be essential for parasite viability, as attempts to &#x0201c;knock-out&#x0201d; the gene have not been successful <xref rid="pone.0024413-Cowman1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024413-Sanders1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Like many abundantly expressed surface proteins of the malaria parasite, MSP2 is highly polymorphic. Polymorphisms are largely confined to the central variable region of the protein, which is flanked by a short N-terminal, and a longer C-terminal conserved region <xref rid="pone.0024413-Smythe2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024413-Fenton1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The variable region consists of highly polymorphic tandem sequence repeats and flanking non-repetitive dimorphic sequences, which define the two allelic families of MSP2, 3D7 and FC27, respectively. As it is abundantly expressed on the merozoite surface <xref rid="pone.0024413-Gilson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, MSP2 is a potential target of antibodies induced by infection or vaccination. The majority of individuals living in regions where there is intense transmission of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> develop high titres of anti-MSP2 antibodies in response to repeated infections <xref rid="pone.0024413-alYaman1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Much of the natural anti-MSP2 antibody response is directed against epitopes in the central variable region of the molecule as well as the dimorphic regions <xref rid="pone.0024413-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Several sero-epidemiological studies, but not all <xref rid="pone.0024413-Fowkes1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, have shown an association between antibody responses to MSP2 and resistance to infection or disease <xref rid="pone.0024413-Taylor2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024413-Polley1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024413-Metzger1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024413-alYaman2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. MSP2-specific antibodies in immune individuals are predominantly of the cytophilic IgG3 subclass <xref rid="pone.0024413-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024413-Polley1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024413-Metzger1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024413-Tongren1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>Evidence that MSP2 has potential as a component of a malaria vaccine came from the testing of the Combination B vaccine in Papua New Guinea. This vaccine contained three recombinant malaria proteins, all expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>: full-length 3D7 MSP2, a small N-terminal fragment of MSP1, and a large C-terminal fragment of the ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen. This three component vaccine was adjuvanted with Montanide&#x000ae; ISA 720 (ISA 720) <xref rid="pone.0024413-Saul1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024413-Lawrence1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024413-Genton1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The development of Combination B culminated in a Phase 1/2b double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial in 120 children 5&#x02013;9 years of age living in the Wosera region of the East Sepik Province of Papua New Guinea <xref rid="pone.0024413-Genton1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. One half of the subjects in this trial (60 individuals) were drug-treated to eliminate existing parasitemias before vaccination. The incidence of malaria parasitemia in these drug-treated individuals was very low, a factor that impeded assessment of vaccine efficacy in this group. In contrast, a significant reduction in parasitemia was observed among the 30 vaccinated individuals who were not drug-treated, with mean parasitemia reduced by 62&#x00025; (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.024). Analysis of the <italic>msp2</italic> genotypes in breakthrough parasite populations demonstrated that among vaccinees in both the drug-treated and untreated groups, there was a lower prevalence of infection with parasites carrying the 3D7 allelic form of MSP2 (corresponding to that in the vaccine). Furthermore, over the 12-month follow-up, there was a higher incidence of morbidity associated with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infections of the FC27 <italic>msp2</italic> genotype in the vaccine group <xref rid="pone.0024413-Genton1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. This indicated that activity of the Combination B vaccine was at least partially attributable to the MSP2 component of the vaccine. Furthermore, the results suggested that the vaccine may exert a selective pressure on the parasite population by inducing immune responses that are more active against parasites expressing forms of MSP2 belonging to the 3D7 dimorphic family than against parasites expressing forms of MSP2 belonging to the FC27 dimorphic family. This finding indicated that any further testing of a MSP2 vaccine should include antigens representative of both families of MSP2 alleles, which have been found in all infected populations examined <xref rid="pone.0024413-Mwingira1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>Therefore we undertook a dose-escalating, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 1 trial in healthy, malaria-na&#x000ef;ve adults of a new MSP2 vaccine (MSP2-C1) containing the 3D7 and FC27 forms of MSP2, representative of the two families of MSP2 alleles. Equal amounts of the two antigens were formulated in a water-in-oil emulsion with ISA 720. Placebo subjects received saline emulsified in ISA 720. The aims of the study were to test safety and immunogenicity of this new vaccine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see Checklist (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0024413.s001">Checklist S1</xref>) and Protocol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0024413.s002">Protocol S1</xref>) with Amendments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0024413.s003">Protocol S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0024413.s004">Protocol S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0024413.s005">Protocol S4</xref>).

Briefly, both 3D7 and FC27 MSP2 were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> from synthetic genes cloned into the <italic>E. coli</italic> expression plasmid pET22b (GenBank Accession numbers: JN248383 and JN248384 respectively). Each recombinant protein had a 6-histidine C-terminal tag to allow purification by metal-chelate chromatography. The two recombinant proteins (<italic>Ec</italic>MSP2-3D7 and <italic>Ec</italic>MSP2-FC27) were purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> lysates by a combination of chelating, anion-exchange and reverse-phase chromatography. The purification processes were designed to separate monomeric MSP2 from non-product related components (e.g. <italic>E. coli</italic> proteins, DNA and endotoxin), as well as MSP2 aggregates or fragments. Both recombinant forms of MSP2 have a propensity to form amyloid-like fibrils <xref rid="pone.0024413-Adda1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> but this was inhibited by storing the purified antigens at -80&#x000b0;C in 10 mM acetic acid. <italic>Ec</italic>MSP2-3D7 and <italic>Ec</italic>MSP2-FC27 were shown by analytical reverse-phase chromatography to be &#x0003e;95&#x00025; and &#x0003e;93&#x00025; monomer, respectively. On SDS-PAGE a single species was detected in each of the protein preparations but the electrophoretic mobility of <italic>Ec</italic>MSP2-3D7 and <italic>Ec</italic>MSP2-FC27 differed slightly, thus allowing the two proteins to be distinguished when extracted from the formulated vaccine. Equal amounts of the two antigens were formulated in the experimental adjuvant ISA 720 (SEPPIC Inc) at CSL Ltd (Melbourne, Australia). A water-in-oil emulsion, with a droplet size of &#x0223c;1 micron, was generated by homogenization. Glycine (final concentration 250 mM) was added to the aqueous phase prior to homogenization because this has been shown to minimise modifications that can occur in ISA 720 emulsions <xref rid="pone.0024413-Miles1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The individual antigens stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C and the antigens in the formulated vaccine, stored at 4&#x000b0;C were shown to be stable for 24 and 18 months, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study design</title><p>The study was designed as a dose-escalating, placebo-controlled Phase 1a trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of three dosages of MSP2-C1/ISA720. The study was planned to include 45 volunteers to be vaccinated in three cohorts of 15 (10, 40, or 80 &#x000b5;g of MSP2-C1 formulated in ISA 720); volunteers in each cohort were randomized to receive vaccine (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;12) or ISA 720 emulsion as a control (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3), with a dosing interval of 12 weeks planned between each immunization. The three cohorts were screened and enrolled consecutively. For cohorts two and three, it was planned that immunizations be staggered, such that the first five volunteers of both cohorts be vaccinated four weeks before the remaining 10. All study staff including the volunteers, investigators, individuals responsible for the evaluation of study subjects and laboratory personnel were blinded to the randomization scheme except for the study pharmacist (or designee) who prepared the vaccine dose for administration.

Plates were washed and incubated for one hour with HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG at 1/5000 (Chemicon, Melbourne, Australia) in PBS-T plus 0.1&#x00025; casein. After washing, colour was developed by adding azino-bis(3-ethylbenthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) liquid substrate system (Sigma-Aldrich, Sydney; stopped with 1&#x00025; SDS after 15 mins) and the absorbance was read by spectrophotometry. All washes were performed with PBS-T, and all incubations were at room temperature. Positive and negative controls were included on all plates to enable standardisation. Serum samples were tested at 1/100 and 1/500 dilution; only results from testing at the 1/100 dilution are reported as no major differences in the pattern of reactivity were found when testing samples at 1/500. All available serum samples were tested for IgG responses to recombinant 3D7 and FC27 MSP2, the two vaccine antigens. Samples tested were: Cohort 1 &#x02013; Day 0, 28, 84, 112, 168, 196, and 336; Cohort 2 &#x02013; Day 0, 28, 84, 112, 168, 336 (note that day 196 was not available for this cohort). All samples were randomized and coded for testing in a blinded manner.</p><p>For Western blot and immunofluorecent antibody assays (IFA) schizont-stage isolates of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains 3D7 and D10 [a clone of the FC27 parasite line] were prepared from parasites cultured in RPMI-HEPES with 0.5&#x00025; Albumax <xref rid="pone.0024413-Beeson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. A subset of samples (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3) for testing in western blots and IFAs were selected on the basis that they were highly reactive by ELISA (in the top half of responses) at day 112. For IFA, parasites were washed and smeared onto glass slides and fixed with methanol/acetone (10&#x02236;90, v&#x02236;v). Smears were blocked with 0.1&#x00025; casein in PBS, incubated with cohort samples (diluted 1&#x02236;1000), then Alexa-Fluor 488-conjugated anti-human IgG. Slides were cover-slipped and examined by fluorescence and light microscopy. For Western blots, parasite proteins were extracted into 1&#x00025; Triton X100 (TX100) in PBS with protease inhibitors (Roche), separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked with 0.1&#x00025; casein in PBS, incubated with cohort samples diluted 1/500 in PBS with 0.1&#x00025; casein, and then with HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG. IgG-binding was determined by chemiluminescence.</p><p>PBMC for lymphocyte stimulation assays were prepared in Hepes-buffered RPMI-1640 with, 100 IU/mL Penicillin-Streptomycin (GIBCO BRL, Invitrogen), and heat-inactivated autologous serum in 96 well flat-bottomed plates in a volume of 200 &#x000b5;l/well. Positive control cultures were established with 10&#x00025; serum and the mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA; 2.2 &#x000b5;g/ml). Antigen-specific cultures were established with heat-inactivated autologous serum at a concentration of 20&#x00025; and each antigen individually at 1 and 10 &#x000b5;g/ml. Plates were incubated (six days, 37&#x000b0;C, humidified 5&#x00025; CO2) before labelling (25 &#x000b5;l <sup>3</sup>H thymidine, 40 &#x000b5;Ci/ml, 16&#x02013;18 hours) and harvested onto filter mats using a PerkinElmer FilterMate harvester. Incorporated <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine was determined using a PerkinElmer MicroBeta TriLux 1450 LSC Luminescence counter. Stimulation indices (SI) were calculated relative to control wells to which no recombinant antigen had been added. For inclusion of data, replicate values of thymidine incorporation were required to be within 150&#x00025; of each other, and replicate unstimulated and mitogen-stimulated values to be consistent.</p><p>Two growth inhibition assays (GIAs) were used to assess the ability of induced anti-MSP2 antibodies to inhibit parasite replication in vitro. In one assay serum samples from day 0 and day 112 were tested in a two-cycle flow cytometry-based assay <xref rid="pone.0024413-Persson1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024413-McCallum1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> for all subjects at 1/10 and 1/5 dilution against 3D7 and D10 (FC27) parasites. Randomized and coded serum samples were filter sterilized before testing. The <italic>P. falciparum</italic> lines 3D7 and D10 were cultured <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0024413-Beeson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and synchronised by alternate day re-suspension in 5&#x00025; D-sorbitol (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) in water. Growth assays were performed over two cycles of parasite replication and parasitemias were measured using flow cytometry (FacsCalibur, Becton, Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Assays were set-up with mature trophozoites and schizonts, at 1&#x00025; hematocrit and 0.3&#x00025; starting parasitemia (50 &#x000b5;l/well) in 96 well U-bottom culture plates (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, USA) with serum samples from cohort members. On all plates, PBS and samples from non-exposed Australian residents were included as a non-inhibitory controls and 1F9 anti-AMA1 monoclonal antibody <xref rid="pone.0024413-Coley1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> was included as an inhibitory control. Parasite growth for each sample is expressed relative to plate PBS controls. All samples were tested in duplicate in two separate assays.</p><p>GIA was also assessed using IgG fractions isolated from serum samples collected from 10 subjects on days 0 and 112.; all subjects were positive for antibodies to MSP2 by ELISA on day 112. IgG from serum samples was purified using protein G-Sepharose columns, dialysed, and then concentrated to 20 mg/ml. IgG samples, at a final concentration of 10 mg/mL, were incubated with the 3D7 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> blood-stage parasites for &#x0223c;40 hours. Parasite growth was then determined by colorimetric quantification of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> lactate dehydrogenase, <xref rid="pone.0024413-Malkin1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>The effect of purified IgG on parasite growth, measured by antibody-dependant cellular inhibition (ADCI) was performed as described previously <xref rid="pone.0024413-Jafarshad1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. IgG samples purified from the day 0 and day 112 of 10 subjects (as described above) were tested at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml for ADCI activity against the 3D7 and K1 parasite lines, expressing the 3D7 and FC27 <italic>msp2</italic> alleles, respectively. Isolates were obtained from MR4 and identity was confirmed by genotyping. Potential contamination of cultures with Mycoplasma was excluded by PCR testing. PBMC from healthy and malaria na&#x000ef;ve blood donors were separated by Ficoll-Hypaque and then aliquoted at a final concentration of 25&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in cryopreservation medium and stored in liquid phase of liquid nitrogen. Aliquots were kept in liquid nitrogen until use. Identification and enumeration of the monocyte sub-population was assessed by flow cytometry using anti-CD14-PE (mAb clone RMO2, a murine IgG2a, that emits a yellow colour at 575 nm), and anti-CD16-PC5 (mAb clone 3G8, a murine IgG1 that emits in dark red-brownish at 670 nm); both from Beckman Coulter. A single batch of monocytes was used for all experiments performed. Assays were performed in 96-well culture plates containing 2&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> monocytes per well with 100 &#x000b5;l of an asynchronous culture of either 3D7 or K1 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected red blood cells at 0.5&#x00025; parasitemia and 2.5&#x00025; hematocrit. Cultures were incubated for 72 hours and the number of infected erythrocytes per well was determined by flow cytometry using double-staining with hydroethidine and thiazole orange dyes <xref rid="pone.0024413-Jouin1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. IgG purified from African adults from Ivory Coast employed previously to passively transfer protection, and IgG purified from non-exposed donors were used as positive and negative controls respectively. Specific growth inhibition (SGI) was calculated as SGI&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;100&#x000d7;[1-(percent parasitemia with MN and test sample/percent parasitemia with test sample)/(percent parasitemia with MN and control IgG/percent parasitemia with control IgG)]. As previously described, the threshold of positivity in this assay is &#x02265;30&#x00025; SGI. To take into account experimental variations results are reported as Adjusted-SGI relative to the positive reference control employed in each ADCI plate.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical methods</title><sec id="s2g1"><title>Sample Size</title><p>A group size of 12 volunteers per dose, with 9 participants receiving the MSP2-C1/ISA720 malaria vaccine and 3 per dose cohort receiving ISA 720 Control vaccine was selected, as it was powered to provide sufficient safety data on an adult population living in an area without malaria.

The incidence, intensity and relatedness to vaccination were calculated for each treatment group. Safety analyses were based on intention to treat data selection.</p><p>Antibody levels between study groups at each time point were compared using Mann-Whitney U tests. Wilcoxon signed rank sum tests were used to compare the difference in antibody levels and ADCI activity between day 0 and other time points. The correlation between MSP-2-3D7 and MSP-2-FC27 responses at day 112 was assessed using Spearmans rho. One subject (subject 4) withdrew after the baseline bleed and was thus excluded from analysis. All other data points were used in the analysis. All p values&#x0003c;0.1 are shown.

The reasons for the lack of direct inhibitory activity of human MSP2 antibodies are unclear, as MSP2 is assumed to have an essential role in the attachment and invasion process. Possibly, the antibodies induced by immunizing with recombinant MSP2 do not have the correct fine specificity or a sufficiently high avidity to inhibit invasion directly.</p><p>The functional antibody assays were performed on day 112 samples, which coincided with the peak antibody response, four weeks after the second immunization. The antibody responses decayed markedly beyond day 112. Among subjects in cohort 1 who received a third immunization at day 196, only a slight boost in the response was observed. In view of the changes in antibody responses over the course of the trial, it is interesting to note that in the PNG Phase 2b study with Combination B, partial protection of the children was achieved by giving only two immunizations four weeks apart with the ISA 720-formulated vaccine. It is important to note that the limited number of participants who received the intended vaccine schedule, limits the interpretation of the antibody responses induced in the study.</p><p>Although the GIA has been widely used to assess antibody responses to asexual blood-stage vaccine candidates, evidence that activity in this assay correlates with protective immunity, and is predictive of vaccine efficacy is limited <xref rid="pone.0024413-McCallum1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024413-Crompton1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.

Ag1624 differs from the 3D7 MSP2 used here in that the hexa-His tag was located at the N-terminus rather than the C-terminus, and there were a small number of additional amino acid residues, at both the N- and C-termini of Ag1624, which were derived from the cloning site in the expression plasmid. In the first trial of Ag1624 where it was evaluated in combination with recombinant circumsporozoite protein (CSP) formulated on alum <xref rid="pone.0024413-Sturchler1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, no serious adverse events, and only mild injection site reactions were observed.

In two Phase 1 trials conducted in Australia in 1997 to test the safety and immunogenicity of the Combination B/ISA 720 vaccine candidate in healthy Australian volunteers <xref rid="pone.0024413-Saul1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, local reactions were common, particularly pain and tenderness on use of the injected muscle beginning shortly after vaccination and lasting a few days. In a smaller number of subjects (10 of 26 in the second study), delayed pain and tenderness developed approximately 10 days after the initial injection. The secondary reactions were mild to moderate in all but one of the subjects who developed severe pain and swelling in the injected thigh 10 days after the dose. When this subject was administered a second dose in the other thigh, the initial local response was mild. However, six weeks later a hard painful mass that limited mobility developed at the second injection site. This resolved over a few weeks.

The first study <xref rid="pone.0024413-Genton2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, undertaken in 10 healthy adult males was to assess the safety and immunogenicity. Poor cellular immune responses to MSP2 were observed, with no change in the anti-MSP2 antibody titers from baseline values. Approximately half the subjects had mild pain at the injection site. Subsequently, a Phase 1/2b double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial was carried out in 120 children 5&#x02013;9 years of age living in a malaria endemic region of PNG <xref rid="pone.0024413-Genton1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024413-Genton3" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.

It was in this study that the protective efficacy of the MSP2 component was identified.</p><p>In addition to five trials of MSP2 where ISA 720 has been used as the adjuvant, ISA 720 has been used in 10 Phase 1 studies testing safety and immunogenicity of other malaria vaccine candidates <xref rid="pone.0024413-Lopez1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024413-Audran1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024413-Saul2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024413-Oliveira1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024413-Walther1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024413-Hermsen1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024413-Malkin2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024413-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024413-Roestenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024413-Pierce1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref> and in three non-malaria Phase 1 clinical trials <xref rid="pone.0024413-Toledo1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024413-Elliott1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024413-Fourcade1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. As has been observed in the MSP2 trials, formulations of other malaria vaccines with ISA 720 have in general been more reactogenic than those formulated with Alum, with the most common adverse events being local reactogenicity at the injection site. While local reactions were more common in trials where the vaccine was given subcutaneously <xref rid="pone.0024413-Audran1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024413-Hermsen1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> than when given by the intramuscular route, sterile abscess and moderate to severe local reactions have been reported in studies where ISA 720-formulated vaccines have been administered intramuscularly. It has been suggested that the rather unusual pattern of delayed local reaction that has been reported in volunteers administered ISA 720-formulated vaccines is caused by Arthus-type reactions (type III hypersensitivity) induced by antibodies to the vaccine antigen <xref rid="pone.0024413-Walther1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. However, it has not been possible to confirm this by histological analysis as no biopsies have been taken.</p><p>The three non-malaria phase 1 clinical trials where ISA 720 has been used as an adjuvant include a trial of an experimental HIV-1 vaccine <xref rid="pone.0024413-Toledo1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, a peptide vaccine against Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection <xref rid="pone.0024413-Elliott1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, and a melanoma vaccine <xref rid="pone.0024413-Fourcade1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. The HIV vaccine was highly immunogenic but the reactogenicity in many subjects was severe, with pain &#x00026; tenderness, induration, erythema, granuloma and sterile abscess formation reported to be mild to severe. The severity of the local reactions was related to antigen dose, the highest dose (1 mg) being much higher than in any other clinical trial of an antigen formulated in ISA 720. Local adverse effects were also more frequent and severe after the second and third doses than after the first dose. In the EBV vaccine study, while the vaccine was well tolerated, mild to moderate injection site reactions occurred in 12 of the 14 subjects. In the melanoma vaccine study <xref rid="pone.0024413-Fourcade1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, mild to moderate local reactions were reported in all patients.</p><p>Homogenization is required to generate stable water-in-oil emulsions of antigens formulated with ISA 720 <xref rid="pone.0024413-Miles1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. This procedure contrasts with the ease of generating oil-in-water emulsions, e.g. RTS,S in ASO1 or 2, which can be formulated by simply mixing at the point-of-injection. A consequence of the need to pre-formulate MSP2-C1 in ISA 720 is the need to obtain stability data on the formulated vaccine. This can be problematic because of the extensive assay development that is required at an early stage of vaccine development <xref rid="pone.0024413-Miles1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Physicochemical analyses on the formulated vaccine and antigens extracted from the emulsion carried out at CSL Ltd Melbourne on preclinical batches of the vaccine prepared for toxicology tests indicated that the emulsion was stable, and the antigens retained their integrity for 18 months (data not shown). The same vaccine batches were tested for immunogenic stability by immunizing mice with three different antigen doses that were below the threshold for a maximum response. The results from a test carried out after 13 months storage of the preclinical batches suggested a loss of immunogenicity (data not shown) and for this reason the vaccine was unavailable for Cohort 2 to receive the third vaccine dose. The same vaccine batches passed a subsequent immunogenicity test, thus highlighting a problem with using <italic>in vivo</italic> potency as a pass-fail criteria at this early stage of vaccine development.</p><p>It is apparent from this study and a range of other human clinical trials of recombinant proteins as malaria vaccine candidates that eliciting a strong immune response is likely to be of major importance in inducing vaccine-induced protection, and that selection of an appropriate adjuvant is critical to ensuring that an appropriate balance between reactogenicity and immunogenicity is achieved. For example, it was only when RTS,S was formulated in an oil-in-water emulsion containing the immune stimulants monophosphoryl lipid A and QS21 that this anti-sporozoite vaccine showed protective efficacy <xref rid="pone.0024413-Stoute1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>.

Consequently, it will be important to compare the fine specificity of anti-MSP2 antibody responses induced by vaccination and infection, and further studies are required to determine the relative importance of antibodies to conserved and variable regions of MSP2 in protecting against infection or disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0024413.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Checklist</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0024413.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0024413.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0024413.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0024413.s003"><label>Protocol S2</label><caption><p>Revision one of the Protocol</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0024413.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0024413.s004"><label>Protocol S3</label><caption><p>Revision two of the Protocol</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0024413.s004.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0024413.s005"><label>Protocol S4</label><caption><p>Revision two of the Protocol</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0024413.s005.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0024413.s006"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Lymphoproliferative responses to recombinant MSP2 proteins.
