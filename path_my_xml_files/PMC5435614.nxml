Infants aged 6 weeks were randomized to receive three doses of either ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> or placebo along with childhood vaccines: Oral Polio Vaccine and vaccines against Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus, Hepatitis B and <italic>Haemophilus influenza</italic> type b given as Pentavalent at 6, 10, 14 weeks of age. Blood specimens were collected from all infants at baseline and 4 weeks post dose 3 to assess the immune response to antigens in Oral Polio Vaccine, Pentavalent and ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> vaccines. Non-inferiority of immune response to all vaccine components of the childhood vaccines when ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was administered concurrently was demonstrated. Non-inferior immune responses to childhood vaccines were evaluated based on the seroprotective levels of antibodies against polio types 1, 2, and 3, Diphtheria toxoid, Tetanus toxoid, <italic>Haemophilus influenza</italic> type b anti- polyribosyl ribitol phosphate antibodies and Hepatitis B antibodies; and the Geometric Mean Concentration for Pertussis. The proportion of infants who seroconverted (&#x02265;4 fold rise) was 38.6% in the ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group and 12.2% in the placebo group. The frequency and severity of immediate adverse events, adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in both groups. None of the five reported deaths were considered to be related to the ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and no case of intussusception meeting Brighton Diagnostic Certainty Level I criteria was reported.</p><p>This study demonstrated that ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> can be safely administered with childhood vaccines without interfering with the immune response to the antigens contained in these vaccines.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwd0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Pediatrics</kwd><kwd>Infectious disease</kwd><kwd>Immunology</kwd><kwd>Vaccines</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the universal use of rotavirus vaccines in the national immunization programs of all regions of the world, due to the high disease burden especially in high child mortality settings <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>The scale up of rotavirus vaccines in developing countries is limited by inadequate availability of high quality vaccines at affordable prices. Currently, the rotavirus vaccines available are: RotaTeq<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Merck) and Rotarix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (GSK) vaccines. These vaccines are not widely available or affordable for the developing world. The oral rotavirus vaccine (ORV), ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was developed and manufactured in India under the Indo-US Vaccine Action Program, through a unique collaborative Public-Private-Partnership <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. On the basis of successful completion of Phase I, II and III studies in the country, this vaccine was licensed for use in India in January 2014 [<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The national program delivers several vaccines at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age and new vaccines including the ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> targeted at infants can be delivered at these existing opportunities <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. This will reduce the cost and burden to the families in terms of visits to immunization clinics and optimize vaccine uptake. Post licensure ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was launched in the private market in April 2015 and introduced in the Universal Immunization Program in a phased manner in India in March 2016.</p><p>We report the findings of a study conducted to determine whether three doses of ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> when co- administered with other childhood vaccines i.e. Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) and Pentavalent Vaccine against Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus (DPT), Hepatitis B (HepB) and <italic>Haemophilus influenza</italic> type b (Hib) interferes with their immune response. These data are needed for obtaining WHO prequalification, which will allow access and equitable use of the vaccine for children in lower income countries. The immunogenicity and safety of ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and the clinical lot consistency of three production lots of ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> were also assessed. The results of the clinical lot consistency will be published separately.</p></sec><sec id="sec0010"><label>2</label><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This phase III randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted between May 2014 and August 2015 in Delhi, India.

Participants were identified through a household survey and infants were enrolled into the study after obtaining informed consent from the parents and screening the infant for eligibility. Infants between 42&#x02013;55 days of age whose parents were willing to participate and had no plans of moving away were eligible for enrolment. Infants were excluded if they had already received the first dose of the childhood vaccines or any other rotavirus vaccine, had immunodeficiency disease or chronic gastroenteritis disease, and/or any condition warranting exclusion by the investigator. Infants were temporarily excluded if they had diarrhea or any illness requiring hospital referral on the day of screening.</p><p>Enrolled infants were given three doses of ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> or placebo along with childhood vaccines (OPV and Pentavalent vaccine) at 6&#x02013;7 weeks, 10- &#x0003c;14 and 14- &#x0003c;18 weeks of age. A minimum interval of 4 weeks was maintained between two doses of ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> or placebo plus childhood vaccines. Infants also received OPV as mandated by the Government on the National Polio Immunization days. ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> or placebo 0.5 mL, were administered approximately 5 min after administration of 2.5 mL of citrate bicarbonate buffer. Infants were kept under observation in the study clinic for 30 min after the administration of the last vaccine for any immediate adverse events (IAEs). A participant booklet was given to families which included when to contact the study team, the address of study clinic and referral hospitals, study physician contact numbers, immunization record and daily record of temperature for 14 days after each dose of ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> or placebo. The study team made daily contacts through telephone calls or home visit for 14 days after each dose of ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> or placebo to ascertain adverse events (AEs). Thereafter, weekly contacts were made till infants were one year of age. During this period, information was obtained on the presence of any illness, signs and symptoms of intussusception and serious adverse events (SAEs) for 4 weeks after third dose; subsequently, only presence of signs and symptoms of intussusception and events of death were ascertained. Protocol deviations were reported for all subjects to the Ethics Committees, regulatory authorities and sponsor as per the required timelines throughout the study period.</p></sec><sec id="sec0025"><label>2.3</label><title>Randomization and blinding</title><p>Randomization was done by Diagnosearch Life Sciences Pvt.

ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> manufactured by Bharat Biotech International Limited in India has been launched in the public health system in India in March 2016. The data generated from this study, i.e. non-interference of ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> with the childhood vaccines and clinical lot consistency in the immune responses to the three production lots of ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> along with the phase III efficacy data <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> would be used to apply for WHO prequalification. The age and sex of the study population were similar across the two treatment groups; very few infants (1.25%) did not complete 4 weeks follow up post dose 3. The loss to follow up at the end of one year was 2.1%. Protocol deviations were minimal and generally minor. Dose compliance was high with 91% of infants receiving all three doses of ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> or placebo.</p><p>Three doses of ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> can be safely co-administered with three doses of Pentavalent vaccine and OPV without diminishing the infant&#x02019;s serum antibody response to each component of these vaccines. None of the differences in the seroprotective levels of antipolio type 1, 2 and 3 antibodies seen between the group receiving ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> with childhood vaccines and the group receiving placebo with childhood vaccines were statistically significant. The upper limits of the 95% CI for difference in antibody levels achieved against polio viruses, diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, HepB and Hib PRP was less than 10% and met the pre-established non-inferiority criteria, demonstrating non inferiority of antibody responses to these vaccines in the two study groups. The mean antibody level of antibody to pertussis between the two groups was not significantly different and the ratio of the GMC (placebo/ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) groups and the corresponding upper limit of the 95% CI was less than 2. The non inferiority of ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group over placebo group with respect to concentration levels to pertussis toxin was established.</p><p>ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is moderately immunogenic as measured by serum anti rotavirus IgA. This immune response of 38.6% in the vaccine recipients is similar to 40.3% observed in the phase III efficacy trial <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was well tolerated when administered with other routine childhood vaccines. The five episodes of vomiting observed immediately post dosing were all mild. The solicited and unsolicited AEs in the 14 days following vaccination and SAEs did not show any imbalances between the groups. Most of the AEs in this period were considered related to ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> or placebo, which is expected as a result of co-administration with routine childhood vaccines. The most common SAEs were lower respiratory tract infections and gastroenteritis.</p><p>Of the five deaths, all occurred among recipients of ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; none was judged related to ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. Four of the deaths occurred between 79&#x02013;141 days after ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> administration. One death which occurred 3 days after ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> vaccination was an unexplained sudden death.</p><p>No case of Intussusception was identified which met Brighton Level 1 criteria.</p><p>In conclusion, ROTAVAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> can be safely co-administered with three doses of pentavalent vaccine and OPV without diminishing an infant&#x02019;s serum antibody responses to each component of these vaccines. It is also well tolerated when administered along with the routine childhood vaccines at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age.</p></sec><sec id="sec0100"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="sec0105"><title>Author contribution statement</title><p>Temsunaro Rongsen Chandola, Nidhi Goyal: Performed the experiments; Contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools or data; Wrote the paper.</p><p>Sunita Taneja, Kalpana Antony, Kiran Bhatia, Iksung Cho: Analyzed and interpreted the data.</p><p>Deepak More, Sai D.
