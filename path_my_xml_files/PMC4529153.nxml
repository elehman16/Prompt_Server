Since DNA vaccines offer a number of potential advantages over other vaccine approaches, ways to improve their immunogenicity continue to be investigated including: i) adjuvantation and/or ii) intramuscular (IM) or intradermal (ID) administration followed by <italic>in vivo</italic> electroporation (EP). One possibility for adjuvantation is co-administration with plasmids encoding cytokines such as Interleukin-12 (IL-12) [<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134287.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. IL-12 plays a key role in the induction of adaptive immune responses and promotes cell-mediated immunity [<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Delivery of DNA by electroporation has been shown to significantly improve immunogenicity compared to conventional injection [<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134287.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134287.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The localized application of electrical fields is thought to lead to increased permeabilization of cell membranes which enhances the cellular uptake of large polar molecules such as DNA by a factor of 10&#x02013;1,000 over conventional intramuscular injection [<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In preclinical studies, delivery by <italic>in vivo</italic> EP has resulted in a greater magnitude of IFN-&#x003b3;-producing T cells, greater proliferative capacity of CD8 T cells, and increased polyfunctionality of CD4 and CD8 T cells to various DNA vaccines [<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134287.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In humans, <italic>in vivo</italic> EP has been used to deliver DNA vaccines IM or ID, and intratumoral delivery has been used in cancer patients to administer vaccines or chemotherapeutic agents [<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134287.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A clinical trial in the USA of an HIV DNA vaccine in healthy volunteers showed that the response rate, magnitude, breadth and durability of the immune responses were significantly increased in the IM/EP group compared to the same DNA vaccine given by IM injection (response frequency of 88% IM/EP vs. 0% IM). Assessment of the tolerability indicated that the IM/EP procedure was acceptable for healthy, HIV-seronegative volunteers [<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Two other studies have investigated different HIV DNA vaccines with or without plasmid IL-12 by IM/EP in US populations [<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134287.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Administration of an HIV DNA vaccine together with IL-12 (GENEVAX IL-12) by IM/EP (HVTN080) had a significant dose-sparing effect and provided CD4 and CD8 T cell responses superior to those observed in a previous trial (HVTN070) where the HIV DNA vaccine was given by standard needle injection [<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134287.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The HVTN087 trial tested <underline>M</underline>ulti-<underline>a</underline>nti<underline>g</underline>enic HIV (HIVMAG at 3mg/dose x3) + IL-12 (GENEVAX IL-12) at 3 dosage levels (250&#x003bc;g, 1000&#x003bc;g, 1500&#x003bc;g) given by IM/EP using the TriGrid Delivery System (TDS) electroporation device followed by boosting with a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-vectored Gag in 100 HIV-seronegative volunteers in the US. GENEVAX IL-12 at 1500ug increased the magnitude of CD8 T cell responses compared to no IL-12 [<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Recombinant, replication defective, adenovirus type 35 (Ad35) constructs have previously been studied by IAVI and partners in 3 Phase 1 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials with a total enrolment of ~400 individuals, in the USA and Africa. The Ad35-GRIN (expressing a fusion protein composed of clade A <underline>G</underline>ag, <underline>R</underline>T, <underline>I</underline>ntegrase and <underline>N</underline>ef) administered alone or combined with Ad35-Env (expressing clade A gp140) induced predominantly CD8+ T cells recognizing all proteins as well as Env and Gag-p24 antibody responses [<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134287.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In a preclinical study, the whole SIVmac239 proteome was delivered to rhesus macaques (RM) in 5 separate SIV DNA plasmids by IM/EP with or without IL-12 pDNA followed by a boost with a corresponding Ad5-SIV vaccine. SIV DNA+IL-12 by IM/EP increased frequency and breadth across the proteome of Ag-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells and the production of multiple cytokines. There was no significant difference in the overall magnitude of SIV specific antibodies or CD8 T cell responses between groups, however, SIV+IL-12 by IM/EP induced a greater magnitude of SIV specific polyfunctional CD4 T cells than other regimens [<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. After repeated low dose SIVmac239 mucosal challenge, there was a significant log reduction of median SIV peak and set-point viral load, respectively, in RM vaccinated with SIV+IL12 by IM/EP compared to mock immunized controls (p &#x0003c;0.01). In 5 out of 6 infected RM, strong suppression of viremia was observed with intermittent &#x02018;blips&#x02019; in virus replication. In 2 RM, no SIV RNA was detected in tissue and lymph nodes, even after 13 viral challenges. RM immunized without IL12 demonstrated a typical maximum of 1.5 log reduction in virus load [<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>The encouraging results in rhesus macaques warranted the testing of a similar vaccine regimen in humans. We hypothesized that i) adjuvanting HIVMAG with GENEVAX IL-12 would induce immune responses of greater magnitude, breadth and/or duration compared to HIVMAG alone, and ii) IM/EP delivery of cytokine-adjuvanted HIVMAG would induce robust and long lasting HIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ responses and/or immune memory in a majority of vaccine recipients in prime-boost regimens with Ad35-GRIN/Env.</p><p>We report the results from a Phase I, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of pDNA HIVMAG +/- pDNA IL-12 (GENEVAX IL-12) and Ad35-GRIN/Env in five different prime-boost regimens, in which the dosage of IL-12, the number of HIVMAG administrations and the order of the two vaccines varied. This is the first study testing an adjuvanted HIV DNA vaccine given intramuscularly by IM/EP in healthy HIV-uninfected African adults at low-risk of HIV acquisition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Ethics and Regulatory Approval</title><p>This study was approved by all respective local and international Ethics and Research Committees (ERCs), institutional biosafety committees, national regulatory agencies and the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC)/NIH, USA.

Eligible adults were recruited at clinical research centers (CRCs) in Uganda, Kenya and Rwanda using informational seminars. Volunteers were healthy, aged 18&#x02013;50 years, at lower risk for HIV infection with confirmed negative serology for HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection, and willing to use an effective method of contraception. Pregnant or lactating women were not eligible. Volunteers with a clinically significant acute or chronic medical condition and volunteers carrying any electronic stimulation or other implantable device were excluded. Volunteer comprehension of the study was ascertained using an assessment of understanding tool. HIV prevention counseling was offered to all volunteers and HIV risk was assessed at multiple timepoints during the trial. Clinic and safety data collected at the CRCs were directly entered into an internet based data system on site. Immunogenicity data were uploaded to the data coordinating center (DCC, the EMMES Corporation) by the Human Immunology Laboratory (HIL).</p><table-wrap id="pone.0134287.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0134287.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Study Design.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0134287.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0134287.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

Culture volumes were doubled at days 3 and 6 by addition of fresh medium and IL-2. CD4 T cells were infected, at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01, for 3 h with a panel of 8 HIV-1 isolates&#x02014;IIIB (subtype B), ELI (accession number A07108, subtype B), U455 (M62320 subtype A), and 97ZA012 (AF286227, subtype C) (provided by the HIV AIDS reagent repository), CH77 (FJ496000, subtype B), CH106 (NA, subtype B), 247FV2 (FJ496200, subtype C) (provided by George Shaw, University of Birmingham, AL, USA) and CBL4 (subtype D, kindly provided by the National Institutes of Biological Standards and Control, UK). Supernatant p24 content was measured on day 13 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). CD8+ T cell-mediated inhibition was expressed as the log<sub>10</sub> reduction in p24 content of day 13 CD8+ and CD4+ T cell co-cultures, compared with infected CD4+ T cells alone. For clinical trial volunteers, antibody-expanded pre-vaccination CD4+ T cells were used as common targets for HIV-1 infection in co-cultures with pre- and post-vaccination CD8+ T cells. The threshold used for positive inhibition was determined from previous validation studies as reduction in measurable p24 production of &#x0003e;1.5 logs.

Titers were determined by sequential incubation of antigen with serum followed by HRP-labeled anti-human IgG and TMB (3, 59, 5, 59-tetramethyl-benzidine) substrate. After addition of stop solution, the optical density (OD) at 450 nm was measured for 5-fold serially diluted samples starting at 1/100. The titer was calculated as the most dilute serum concentration above the OD cut off of 0.3 and 0.2 respectively for Env and Gag p24 and reported as reciprocal dilution.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Anti-IL-12 Antibody Assay</title><p>Assays were performed by Profectus BioSciences Inc., Tarrytown, NY, USA using serum from baseline and 4 weeks post final dose of HIVMAG in Groups 1&#x02013;5. The IL-12 neutralization assay uses a natural killer (NK) cell line, NK-92MI. The NK-92MI is a human NK cell line that shows a dose dependent secretion of IFN-&#x003b3; in response to hIL-12. Neutralizing antibodies that block hIL-12 biological function would reduce IFN-&#x003b3; secretion by NK-92MI cells. The IFN-&#x003b3; secreted in the culture supernatant was quantified in a sandwich ELISA using commercial reagents and an IL-12 positive control. The lower limit of quantification for this assay was determined to be 8 neutralization units/mL (NU/mL) and titers equal to or less than 8 NU/mL were assigned a value of 4 NU/mL. The cutoff for positive responses (31.5 NU/ml) was calculated as the 97.5<sup>th</sup> percentile of all baseline observations (n = 75). Baseline titers were positive if greater than 31.5 NU/ml, whereas post-vaccination titers were positive if greater than 31.5 NU/ml or greater than twice baseline if the baseline assay was positive.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>Once the sample size of 75 (60 vaccine and 15 placebo) across five arms was determined, the power calculations and detectable effect sizes were based on the sample size.

Participants were also given Ad35 GRIN/Env, as boost or, in one group, as prime before the DNA vaccine. The vaccines and regimens tested were safe and well tolerated, which is consistent with results from other clinical studies testing HIV DNA+IL-12 pDNA and Ad35-GRIN/Env in the US [<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134287.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134287.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic> electroporation was well accepted, also consistent with reports from other clinical trials using the same or a different IM/EP device [<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The pain reported prior to the IM/EP procedure likely reflects anxiety rather than actual pain. No volunteer refused subsequent IM/EP administrations. The majority of participants indicated acceptance of IM/EP vaccination for a pandemic infectious disease such as HIV.</p><p>The vaccines and regimens in this study were immunogenic, producing IFN-&#x003b3; ELISPOT responses in ~80% of all vaccinated individuals, although the magnitude of response to each of the 12 individual peptide pools was relatively modest compared to other Ad35-GRIN-Env prime-boost regimens (unpublished data from IAVI) and Keefer et al [<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. ICS responses assessed in a few representative individuals in Groups 1&#x02013;3 were likewise modest in magnitude, with responses skewed to CD4 after the HIVMAG prime and toward CD8 after the Ad35-GRIN/Env boost. Responses to DNA delivered by IM/EP were surprisingly strong compared to responses reported in other trials for DNA given by simple IM injection [<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Anti-HIV inhibitory capacity is considered to be an important attribute of CD8+ T cells and such activities may help control HIV-viral load during acute and chronic infection particularly in long-term non-progressors [<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In the present trial, viral inhibition activity (VIA) was noted after HIVMAG (x3) in Groups 1&#x02013;3, which has not previously been observed after DNA vaccination with or without EP [<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134287.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. After the Ad35-GRIN/Env boost, VIA magnitude, breadth and response rates were increased significantly compared to the DNA prime; plasmid IL12 did not seem to have an effect, as the responses were similar across Groups 1&#x02013;3, both before and after boosting. Overall, VIA magnitude, response rate and breadth were similar to that seen in other HIV vaccine trials using a similar assay but of lower magnitude than in long-term non-progressors [<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134287.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134287.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. CD4+ cell polyfunctionality, as detected by IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-2 and TNF-&#x003b1; expression was similar across Groups 1&#x02013;3. Overall T cell responses assessed by ELISPOT, ICS and VIA were not enhanced by IL-12 administration. Although there were some trends to indicate a negative effect of IL-12 on immune responses, the differences did not reach statistical significance.</p><p>In two previous clinical trials with HIV DNA vaccines, the use of IM/EP increased response rates considerably and/or had dose sparing effects compared to DNA given by conventional intramuscular injection [<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134287.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Two dosage levels of plasmid IL-12 were selected for this dose-ranging study based on data from previous clinical trials, in which up to 1500&#x003bc;g IL-12 have been tested. Human data on the effect of IL-12 as an adjuvant for HIV DNA vaccines, however, are limited and results have been inconsistent [<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134287.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134287.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134287.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134287.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In our trial the effects of IM/EP on cellular immunogenicity could not be assessed, as there was no group where HIVMAG+/-IL-12 was given by standard IM injection. Overall, these results did not demonstrate an adjuvant effect of plasmid IL-12 at the doses used in this EP/DNA vaccine.</p><p>Reports of the adjuvant effect of IL-12 in preclinical models are also inconsistent, with some effect being shown in some but not other preclinical models. A dose ranging study in mice demonstrated a bell shaped curve for adjuvant activity of IL-12 on T cell responses after a single injection of IL-12 at dosage levels of 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 10.0 and 30.0&#x003bc;g when co-administered with HIV gag DNA at 5 and 25&#x003bc;g/ dose (Egan, M et al unpublished). Studies in non-human primates showed significant increase in cell-mediated and humoral immune responses in the groups that received SIV DNA+IL-12 compared to SIV DNA alone [<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134287.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134287.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134287.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In the preclinical study, which set the stage for this clinical study, there was no significant difference in the overall magnitude of SIV specific antibodies or CD8 T cell responses between groups, however, SIV+IL-12 by IM/EP induced a greater magnitude of SIV specific polyfunctional CD4 T cells than other regimens. After repeated low-dose SIVmac239 mucosal challenge, a significant log reduction of the median SIV set point viral loads was seen in rhesus macaques that received SIV DNA+IL-12 by EP compared to the median set point viral loads in the absence of IL-12 [<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. One study showed that rhesus IL-12 (1.5 mg and 5.0 mg) augmented humoral and cellular immune responses to SIV gag DNA compared to DNA with no IL-12, but there was no difference between the low and high IL-12 dosage level [<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Finally, in clinical studies IL-12 therapy for cancer has shown some clinical benefits in some trials but the potential of IL-12 as an adjuvant or therapeutic has not been fully realized to date [<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134287.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134287.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>Env binding antibodies were not detected after one or more doses of HIVMAG prime, but were detected after Ad35-GRIN/Env prime or boost similar to previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134287.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The lack of antibody responses after DNA vaccination with HIVMAG is similar to the findings from other clinical trials testing HIV DNA+/-IL-12 [<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134287.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, there was some evidence of an anamnestic response for elicitation of antibodies, since the GMT and response rates in Groups 1&#x02013;3 were 2&#x02013;3 times higher than those in group 5 after a single Ad35-GRIN/Env administration. Similar anamnestic effects of DNA for antibody responses have been seen in other studies where a DNA vaccine was followed by an Ad5 boost [<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134287.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>One of the scientific rationales for this study was to see whether DNA prime including plasmid IL-12 increased the quantity and quality of HIV-specific CD4 T cells because these changes appeared to be correlated with increased protection from pathogenic SIVmac239 in the pre-clinical study of rhesus macaques immunized with SIV DNA + IL-12 by IM/EP [<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In this clinical study we were not able to detect improved magnitude of response or polyfunctionality of HIV-specific CD4 in the presence of IL-12. Differences in the SIV DNA and Ad5 constructs, use of an optimized rhesus IL-12 [<xref rid="pone.0134287.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], multiple injections sites (simultaneous injections into each limb), different IM/EP device, different species and other factors in the NHP study may account for this apparent discrepancy in the effect on CD4 cells. It should be noted that we also do not have a clear understanding of the role of EP DNA IL12 and enhanced CD4+ responses on the mechanism of protection in the NHP experiment.</p><p>In summary, HIVMAG DNA vaccine with or without IL-12 in combination with Ad35-GRIN/Env was safe, well tolerated and moderately immunogenic; the regimen induced CD4 and CD8 T cells and antibodies; the CD8 T cells could inhibit HIV replication in autologous CD4 T cells. Synergy between the priming with DNA and boosting with Ad35-GRIN-/ENV were demonstrable for antibody and cell inhibitory responses. Repeated administration by IM/EP was acceptable among African volunteers. Based on the excellent safety profile and volunteer acceptance of the EP procedure in Africa as well as a desire to better understand the effect of EP on immune responses, another study was designed. This study &#x02018;Safety &#x00026; Immunogenicity of HIV Vaccines in Healthy Kenyan Adults (HIV-CORE 004, NCT02099994)&#x02019; is currently ongoing in Nairobi, Kenya.
