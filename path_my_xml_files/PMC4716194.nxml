Average time spent in upper limb activities ranges from 0.9 to 7.9&#x02005;min per therapy session.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Several upper limb treatments are used in clinical practice, with varying success. Some treatments such as constraint-induced movement therapy and mirror box therapy have evidence of benefit<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;12</xref> but success is confined to patients with some active movement in the wrist and hand, and many patients do not. There is evidence to support early initiation of therapeutic interventions after stroke, and strong evidence that intensity of treatment is an important factor in recovery.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;15</xref></p><p>Electrical stimulation (ES) therapy has potential value for those with reduced or no arm movement after stroke. ES delivers a small, harmless current that depolarises a nerve leading to two actions: a contraction of a muscle via a motor nerve; and a sensory signal to the brain and spinal cord by stimulation of the associated sensory nerves. Stimulation of the muscle causes a contraction similar to a naturally produced contraction which could prevent muscle atrophy. The sensory stimulation of the brain and spinal cord can contribute to neuroplasticity<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and reduction of pain.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Neuromuscular ES is a safe and harmless treatment for use in patient groups without the contraindications of uncontrolled epilepsy, pregnancy and those fitted with cardiac pacemakers. Metallic implants, cancerous lesions and risk of brittle bones around the stimulation site or the joint being treated are also contraindications. National clinical guidelines<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> recommend routine use of ES for treating &#x02018;foot drop&#x02019;,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> but there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use in upper limb rehabilitation.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Recently, Rosewilliam <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> recruited 90 patients with no upper limb function 6&#x02005;weeks after stroke and concluded that those who received ES of wrist extensors showed improved wrist extension, strength and grip. Secondary analysis concluded ES prevented the development of pain and deterioration in contractures.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>The ESCAPS study evaluates the feasibility of conducting a multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of early, intensive ES to prevent wrist joint deformities/contractures, weakness and upper limb pain after stroke. Qualitative components will explore barriers and facilitators to protocol adherence and clinical practice implementation.</p><p>The national clinical guidelines for stroke recommend that occupational therapists should aim to &#x02018;re-educate&#x02019; the arm of patients who have reduced arm movement following stroke, by providing repetitive task training. This is inappropriate for many patients with stroke who do not have upper limb mobility. Treatment with ES does not require active movement; therefore, it could benefit patients who have severe to moderate arm function deficits.</p><p>This RCT is the first to study ES of flexors and extensors. Reciprocal stimulation of flexors and extensors will simulate the natural stretching movement and can be more effective in the prevention of contractures than stimulation of extensors alone. Flexor stimulation has been shown to reduce spasticity rather than being a contraindication.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>In order to prevent deconditioning of the forearm muscles, there is a need to initiate treatment within 72&#x02005;h of stroke. Premature discontinuation of therapy may reduce any therapeutic effect. No extended trials have been conducted, so it is important to establish compliance and attrition rates.</p><p>To ensure that the results from the definitive trial are generalisable, cost-effective and implementable, the research-related ES treatment will be delivered by National Health Service (NHS) therapists instead of specialist research therapists. The best strategy for self-management needs to be identified, so that treatment may continue at home after discharge.</p><p>This work will help form the basis for a definitive trial in health economics from a societal perspective. Loss of arm and hand function results in reduction of productivity, having a huge impact on individual patients and society.</p><p>The NHS needs to find effective new ways of managing the upper limb after stroke. This research is important because it addresses the needs of a significant proportion of patients with stroke. The ESCAPS feasibility study will inform the design of a definitive multicentre RCT to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of early ES to the wrist flexors and extensors.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of a RCT that will test the efficacy of delivering early, intensive ES to prevent poststroke complications (such as pain and contractures) to the paretic (weak) upper limb after stroke.</p><p>The objectives of this feasibility study therefore are to determine whether:

The current intensity will be increased to produce an alternating contraction of the flexors and extensors using a flex-hold-extend-hold pattern, ensuring that a pure movement is produced with no ulnar or radial deviation. The skin will be marked with a skin-safe marker pen to show the correct area to place the electrodes for future treatments and the ES device will be locked to the selected settings.

As per national clinical guidelines,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> the application of ES to the upper limb is not standard practice. It is not possible to provide a placebo device without the possibility of it being easily identified as such. One reason is because movement is seen in the upper limb when the ES device is activated; furthermore, participants will be recruited and start treatment while on the hospital ward, so control and intervention participants may be in close proximity on the same wards as each other and would likely notice a difference between the intervention and placebo devices.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Adherence to treatment</title><p>As part of the feasibility study data on adherence to the intervention treatment will be collected using two different methods.

In cases where it is not possible to obtain all the outcome measurement data from the patient or the medical records, for the BI, NEADL, mRS, resource use questionnaire, the researcher will obtain by proxy data from the next of kin. A stroke researcher will visit the participant at their place of discharge to complete the 3-month, 6-month and 12-month follow-up assessments.</p></sec><sec id="s2o"><title>Sample size</title><p>This is a feasibility study and therefore the sample size is determined by the number of participants that is feasible to study within the timescale of the project. Consecutive sampling will be used to recruit 40 participants. This will provide sufficient information to indicate feasibility. Outcome data will be utilised to inform a sample size calculation for the definitive trial by assessing variability and completeness of data.</p></sec><sec id="s2p"><title>Data management</title><p>Case report forms (CRFs) and all measurement data (with the exception of the spasticity and contracture measurement data) will be completed on paper forms. Data will then be entered and stored in a password protected electronic database. The original paper copies of CRFs and all study data will be treated as confidential documents and held securely in accordance with regulations. Participants will each be assigned a unique trial identity code for use on all study documents. All source documents will be filed at the principal investigator's site.</p></sec><sec id="s2q"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data will be statistically summarised/analysed using SPSS, and MathCad will be used to extract measures related to spasticity and contractures. Analyses will cover the following:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Total patients recruited within 72&#x02005;h of stroke event; average length of time post-stroke when patients received first treatment.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Total patients screened, eligible and approached, consented, and excluded after screening.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Total patients who completed the intervention; number who completed 3-month, 6-month and 12-month follow-up assessments.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Total participants receiving ES per protocol (PP); mean, minimum and maximum number of ES treatments received during 3-month intervention period; qualitative patient/carer interview data, and ES machine's memory which records number of sessions and duration.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Total patients unable to give informed consent; number consented by consultee; number of consultees who declined.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Recruitment and attrition rates, number of patients lost to follow-up and reasons.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Quality of health economic data between assessment points especially 6&#x02013;12&#x02005;months regarding completeness. Cross referencing of data against medical records where possible. Sensitivity of the EQ-5D in measuring outcome. Combined cost and outcome analysis to determine potential cost-effectiveness of ES verses usual care.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Thematic analysis will be used to identify themes representative of patient experience of treatment, and the experience of carers with the application of the ES device.</p></list-item></list></p><p>As the sample size is small and a method of minimisation is used, we propose to estimate effect size (using the Cohen's d and the 95% CI) for the main study measures that are interval level data. The OR (and the 95% CI) will be estimated when data are dichotomous. When measures are ordinal, nominal relative risk ratios will be used to present all forms of adverse events.</p><p>In addition to estimating effect size, we will explore the use of the following statistical techniques to analyse our data: The group of patients randomised to receive the active treatment will be compared with the control group for all our primary outcomes variables recorded. Continuous variables that are normally distributed will be analysed using generalised linear modelling techniques. Where repeated measures have been recorded, we will apply generalised estimating equation techniques, considering appropriate correlation structure, with time interaction. For continuous variables, treatment differences will be presented with associated 95% CIs. For all statistical tests p&#x0003c;0.05 (2-sided) will be considered statistically significant.</p><p>No additional secondary analyses (eg, subgroup or adjusted analyses) are planned for this feasibility study.</p><p>For this study, the following definitions of analysis population will be followed:</p><p><italic>All-available-patient population</italic>: All patients who have consented for the study will be used for patient accountability and listings and will include patients who are randomised but who do not receive their ES intervention treatment.</p><p><italic>Intention-to-treat (ITT) population</italic>: All patients who have been randomised and received their ES treatment intervention at baseline and who complete follow-up assessment at 3&#x02005;months, 6&#x02005;months and 12&#x02005;months will be included in an ITT population.</p><p><italic>The PP population</italic>: All patients included in the ITT population, who participate in the study, without major protocol violation.</p><p>Missing values will be imputed by using the last value carried forward. We acknowledge that this method is associated with a risk of bias in patients who are deteriorating.</p></sec><sec id="s2r"><title>Trial status</title><p>The official study start date was 1 April 2015.

The CRN research officer will answer any questions that the participant has concerning study participation.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Obtaining informed consent from participants</title><p>Trained stroke research officers will obtain written informed consent from patients willing to participate in the trial. The informed consent form will be signed and dated by the participant before they enter the trial and before they undergo any interventions (including history taking) related to the study. Patients who are unable to sign their name because the stroke has affected their dominant hand and they are unable to sign a legible signature with their non-dominant hand will be asked to point to a box within the consent form and a witness will sign to state that the patient wished to give informed consent to participate in the study.</p><p>An &#x02018;aphasia friendly&#x02019; version of the information sheets and consent form will be available for those with communication difficulties. Such aphasia friendly information sheets and consent forms have been used in previous stroke trials by the study team.</p><p>Patients who lack the mental capacity to consent to participate in the study will be recruited after consultation with their next of kin or nominated carer. Consultee advice will be obtained from the patient's relative or close friend who would know the patient's wishes. Capacity is a situation-specific assessment and the CRN staff and clinical stroke team have had training in assessing capacity. Those participants who lack capacity will be considered for recruitment to the main feasibility trial only and not participation in the patient and carer interviews.</p><p>Irrespective of patients&#x02019; mental capacity, verbal or gestured agreement will be sought prior to ES treatment, and objections will be respected. If a participant becomes distressed by the ES treatment, it will be stopped.</p><p>Participants who lack capacity to provide informed consent will not be recruited to the patient and carer interview part of the study, but their nominated carer may opt to be interviewed about their experience of supporting someone without capacity to participate in the trial.</p><p>Owing to the early delivery of ES within 72&#x02005;h poststroke, it may be that obtaining informed consent from the patient is not possible due to communication and/or cognitive difficulties. In these circumstances, we will obtain consultee consent. However, if during the intervention period the patient regains their communication and/or cognitive function, we will obtain informed consent from the patient at that time.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Study withdrawal</title><p>It will be explained to the potential participant or their consultee that entry into the study is entirely voluntary and that treatment and care of the participant will not be affected by their decision. Participants or their consultee will be informed that they can withdraw from the study at any given point and that this will not affect their future care. Participants may be withdrawn from the trial either at their own request or at the discretion of the investigator. The participants will be made aware that this will not affect future care. Participants will be made aware (via the information sheet and consent form) that should they withdraw, the data collected to date cannot be erased and may still be used in the final analysis.</p><p>Participants may discontinue their allocated intervention or withdraw from the study for the following reasons:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Withdrawal of consent,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Changes to their health status preventing their continued participation.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Enrolled participants who withdraw and were not yet randomised will be replaced (though the withdrawn participant will keep their trial ID). Participants who withdraw after randomisation will not be replaced.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Data protection and confidentiality</title><p>All trial staff and investigators will endeavour to protect the rights of the trial's participants to privacy and informed consent, and will adhere to the Data Protection Act 1998. The CRF will only collect the minimum required information for the purposes of the trial. CRFs will be held securely in a locked filing cabinet with access limited to the trial staff. Computer held data including the trial database will be held securely on a dedicated web server and will be encrypted and password protected. Participant confidentiality will be ensured by utilising identification code numbers. Individual participant medical information obtained as a result of this study are considered confidential and disclosure to third parties is prohibited.</p><p>Access to the CRFs shall be restricted to those personnel approved by the principal investigator and recorded on the Trial Delegation Log.

The principal investigator (JCF-S) will manage the day-to-day running of the study. The Trial Management Group will meet quarterly throughout the trial to discuss progress, including recruitment, withdrawals, treatment compliance, clinical issues and dissemination plans. As this is a feasibility study, the funder does not require a formal Trial Steering Committee or Data Monitoring Committee. However, an independent Trial steering Consultant will monitor and supervise the progress of the study towards its interim and overall objectives; concentrate of progress of the trial, adherence to the protocol and consideration of new information of relevance to the research question; provide advice on all appropriate aspects of the trial; and agree proposals for substantial protocol amendments. This independent monitor will audit the core trial processes and documents</p><p>Any potential modifications to the protocol will be discussed and agreed by the Trial Management Group, Trial Steering Consultant and the research Sponsor.
