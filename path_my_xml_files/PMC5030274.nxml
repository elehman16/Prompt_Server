These results contribute to the ongoing debate that affect and motivation are interwoven with the cognitive processing of errors. Evidence that the misattribution of negative affect modulates the ERN/Ne is essential for understanding the mechanisms behind ERN/Ne. Therefore, and because of the growing debate on reproducibility of empirical findings, we aimed at replicating the misattribution effects on the ERN/Ne in a go/nogo task. Students were randomly assigned to a misattribution group (<italic>n</italic> = 48) or a control group (<italic>n</italic> = 51). Participants of the misattribution group consumed a beverage said to have side effects that would increase their physiological arousal, so that they could misattribute the negative affect induced by errors to the beverage. Participants of the control group correctly believed that the beverage had no side effects. As Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), we did not observe performance differences between both groups. However, ERN/Ne differences between misattribution and control group could not be replicated, although the statistical power of the replication study was high. Evidence regarding the replication of performance and the non-replication of ERN/Ne findings was confirmed by Bayesian statistics.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>negative affect</kwd><kwd>ERN/Ne</kwd><kwd>placebo</kwd><kwd>go/nogo task</kwd><kwd>performance monitoring</kwd><kwd>misattribution</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001659</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">LE2240/3-1</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">BE2443/6-1</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="8"/><ref-count count="52"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="10688"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Error detection and error processing have been discussed in different theoretical frameworks (Yeung, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) including the mismatch theory (Falkenstein et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>), the conflict-monitoring theory (Botvinick et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Botvinick, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), and the reinforcement-learning theory (Holroyd and Coles, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). The mismatch theory postulates that an enhanced activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) following the commission of an error signals a mismatch between the performed responses and the intended responses. The event-related potential (ERP) of the electroencephalogram (EEG) reflecting this ACC activity is called error negativity (Ne; Falkenstein et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>) or error-related negativity (ERN) and peaks about 30&#x02013;50 ms post-response at frontocentral sites (Gehring et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The conflict-monitoring theory postulates that the ERN/Ne is elicited by a response conflict that occurs when competing response alternatives are activated. Thus, the ERN/Ne signals that an increased cognitive control is required in order to solve the response conflict. The reinforcement-learning theory predicts that an error monitoring mechanism in the basal ganglia signals when events are worse than expected. Within these conceptual frameworks, erroneous responses result in an activation of error-detecting devices.</p><p>Errors have been shown to induce physiological arousal (Gray and McNaughton, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Physiological and anxious arousal refer to body symptoms, including sweating, listening the own heartbeat, or feeling tight (see Gray and McNaughton, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>, p. 290; Moser et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Subsequently, we subsume the affective responses following errors under the term of negative affect or state-anxiety. Research on anxiety has demonstrated that physiological and anxious arousal can reduce an individual&#x02019;s cognitive and motor performance (Arent and Landers, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Barnard et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Eysenck, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>Misattribution of negative affect or state-anxiety has been demonstrated to reduce emotionally aversive responses by allowing participants to explain away their situational worry during error processing (e.g., Reisenzein, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>; Olson, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>). According to Olson (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>), misattribution of state-anxiety occurs when individuals believe that the misattribution source has a more pronounced effect on their state-anxiety than it is actually the case, thus allowing individuals to consider the misattribution source as a plausible source of their state-anxiety. Using a placebo as a misattribution source for state-anxiety and physiological arousal might represent a striking cognitive-motivational manipulation to investigate the mechanism that accounts for the ERN/Ne.</p><p>There is some evidence demonstrating that substances that influence physiological arousal, such as alcohol, but also a placebo, modulate the intensity of error monitoring. Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) showed that placebo-induced misattribution of state-anxiety had an effect on the ERN/Ne. Bartholow et al. (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) demonstrated that alcohol consumption modulated individual differences in negative affect and the ERN/Ne amplitudes. The consumption of alcohol was related to a reduced negative affect and a reduced ERN/Ne. These findings suggest that individuals who drank alcohol have a reduced intensity of error monitoring. These studies also indicate that the ERN/Ne is related to state-like physiological arousal, which is important to elucidate the mechanism relating ERN/Ne and negative affect.</p><p>Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) investigated the modulation of behavior and ERN/Ne in a group that misattributed anxious arousal to a placebo beverage and a control group that did not have the opportunity to misattribute anxious arousal to the placebo beverage. The ERN/Ne was smaller (more positive) for participants who were given the opportunity to misattribute arousal compared to participants who were not given any misattribution cues. However, Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) did not find effects of misattribution on cognitive performance. Moreover, correlations of the ERN/Ne with cognitive performance were observed only for participants who had no opportunity to misattribute their arousal to the placebo beverage. Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) did not find effects of misattribution on cognitive performance, but effects of misattribution on ERN/Ne. Their results suggest that the ERN/Ne can be dissociated from cognitive processes, but not from negative affect (Inzlicht and Al-Khindi, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The results of this study are of special interest, because they challenge the prevailing cognitive interpretation of the ERN/Ne.</p><p>The relevance of negative affect for the ERN/Ne could be derived from the fact that the ERN/Ne indicates ACC activity, which has already been related to negative affect (Shackman et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Moreover, the positive correlation of the ERN/Ne with trait-anxiety, trait-BIS (Amodio et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Aarts and Pourtois, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Moser et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), or personality traits related to negative affect (Heubeck et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>) indicates that the ERN/Ne might be related to negative affect. The integration of negative affect into the cognitive framework resulted in the idea that the ERN/Ne indexes mainly the motivational significance of errors (Hajcak and Foti, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). However, despite evidence on the relation between affect-related traits and ERN/Ne the conceptual interpretations of ERN/Ne functioning focus on cognition. This might be due to the fact that the ERN/Ne has been considered as representing an error signal that triggers conflict-monitoring (Botvinick, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). The study of Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) goes beyond previous studies: negative affect was considered to be an aspect that co-occurs with ERN/Ne and error processing in previous studies. The study of Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) indicates that negative affect does not only co-occur with ERN/Ne, but that negative affect and the correct attribution of negative affect might be a moderator of the link between ERN/Ne and performance. This perspective may stimulate future ERN/Ne research. Thus, it is the moderating role of negative affect for the relation between ERN/Ne and performance revealed by Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) that primarily motivates the present replication study.</p><p>Moreover, the growing scientific debate on reproducibility of empirical findings has shown that empirical findings are reproducible to a limited extent (Yong, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Gawronski et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Open Science Collaboration, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Pecher et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). It has been argued that reproducibility has not been emphasized enough because the focus often lies on innovation (Brandt et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Open Science Collaboration, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and that the publication of studies with non-significant results is especially important when studies with non-significant results had high power (Schimmack, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). It is, of course, of particular interest to replicate innovative results that might change the orientation of future research. The study of Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) is such an innovative study that could originate further theories on ERN/Ne giving a more central role to negative affect (see Bakic et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref> for ERN/Ne and positive affect). We therefore conceive the reproducibility of the results of Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) not only as a contribution to the reproducibility debate, but also as an important issue in ERN/Ne research. Accordingly, we aimed at replicating their findings on cognitive performance and ERN/Ne in a study that has a sufficient statistical power.</p><p>However, we do not expect a single replication study to provide definite evidence in favor or against a specific hypothesis. Stanley and Spence (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) pointed out the importance of a meta-analytic mind-set that takes all reasons for random error into account and that acknowledges that population effects can only be estimated when a large number of studies is available. We agree with this perspective, but we also note that the estimation of population effects by means of meta-analysis is typically plagued by the &#x0201c;apples and oranges&#x0201d; problem. That is, in typical meta-analyses, primary studies are often based on different measures and different research designs so that researchers have to cope with the heterogeneity of primary studies. There are several interesting methods to detect moderators that might explain some of the variability of the effect sizes, but there are rather different recommendations to deal with this problem (Cortina, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Therefore, in order to support the meta-analytic perspective on reproducibility, direct independent replication studies that should ideally be provided by different research groups are necessary. This would reduce the heterogeneity of primary studies and would therefore enhance the precision of future meta-analytic estimations of population effects.</p><p>A further particular interest in a replication of Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) raises from the fact that their main conclusion results from the combination of a statistically significant effect for misattribution of negative affect on ERN/Ne with a non-significant misattribution effect for cognitive performance. This combined result indicates that the ERN/Ne could primarily depend on negative affect. Such combinations of results across different types of dependent variables (ERN/Ne, cognitive performance) with patterns of significant and non-significant effects are generally important for psychological research. However, the non-significance of an effect, i.e., absence of evidence against the null-hypothesis, cannot be quantified within the classical frequentist significance testing (Edwards et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">1963</xref>). In contrast, within the Bayesian framework of statistical testing, quantifications in favor of the null-hypothesis are possible. Since the replication of the non-significant performance effect is as important for the replication of Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) as the replication of the significant ERN/Ne effect, the present replication study should also report Bayesian statistical tests.</p><p>Moreover, it has been shown that the issue of replication can be addressed by means of Bayesian statistics (Verhagen and Wagenmakers, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The Bayesian replication test or Bayes factor&#x02014;proposed by Verhagen and Wagenmakers (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>)&#x02014;combines evidence in favor of replication success with evidence of replication failure into a weighted-likelihood ratio. This allows expressing the replication success in a single statistic, which is impossible with the conventional frequentist approach to significance testing. The replication Bayes factor test is especially useful for the replication of effects that were significant in the original study. However, in the present context, the issue of replication of null-results is also relevant because Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) partly based their interpretation on the null-result for cognitive performance. Therefore, the Bayesian statistic provided by Bayarri and Mayoral (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) is also of interest for the present replication study. Bayarri and Mayoral (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) proposed an equality-of-effect size Bayes factor that allows to test whether the effect size in the replication attempt equals the effect size in the original study. Fortunately, this can also be tested for the null-results that are relevant here. Finally, from the perspective of a meta-analytic mind-set (Stanley and Spence, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), it might also be interesting to test whether there is evidence against the null-hypothesis or not when the original data and the replication data are pooled. A corresponding fixed-effect meta-analysis Bayes factor test has been proposed by Rouder and Morey (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>To summarize, beyond the classical frequentist significance tests, the following Bayes statistics will be reported: for the replication of Inzlicht and Al-Khindi&#x02019;s ERN/Ne result, the focus will be on the replication Bayes factor test provided by Verhagen and Wagenmakers (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) in order to investigate the evidence against a null result. For the non-significant performance effects, the focus will be on the equality-of-effect-size Bayes factor test provided by Bayarri and Mayoral (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). In order to derive conclusions across the original and the current study, the fixed-effect meta-analysis Bayes factor test provided by Rouder and Morey (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) will be reported.</p><p>A further aspect of the current study is that we tried to replicate the original study as it has been published. This implies that we only followed the descriptions reported in the method section of the original study. We did not contact Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) in order to get additional unpublished or &#x0201c;tacit&#x0201d; knowledge about their procedure. In this aspect, we followed Tim Errington, a project manager at the Center for Open Science (Grens, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>): &#x0201c;&#x02018;I would make the argument that you can learn a lot from not contacting the authors,&#x02019; such as whether there&#x02019;s sufficient information in the article to follow a protocol.&#x0201d;</p><p>Some studies indicate that experimental treatment conditions like the misattribution of physiological arousal during error-monitoring or the consumption of alcohol modulate the ERN/Ne (Bartholow et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Inzlicht and Al-Khindi, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). It could therefore be expected that the ERN/Ne amplitude depends on experimental manipulations of affective responses following errors such as state-anxiety or misattribution of physiological arousal. Since the ERN/Ne has been primarily related to cognitive processes and since the study of Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) challenged this perspective, it seems necessary to learn more about the reproducibility of ERN/Ne modulations that are based on affective responses following errors. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether an experimental manipulation of the misattribution of state-anxiety following errors modulates the ERN/Ne. To this end, we aimed at replicating the findings of Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Since Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) showed that the misattribution of state-anxiety reduces the ERN/Ne amplitudes, we expected the ERN/Ne to be reduced for participants in the misattribution compared to the control condition. We also expected that the misattribution of state-anxiety following errors does not affect the cognitive performance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>It is important that the statistical power of a replication study is sufficiently large in order to detect the relevant effects.

According to G * Power (Version 3.1.9.2; Faul et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) a sample of about 76 participants will be necessary in order to achieve a statistical power (1 &#x02212; &#x003b2;) of 0.95 for the detection of an effect of this size in a ANOVA based on two groups.

This setup matches the experiment performed by Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Participants were told that the substance develops its most intense effects about 20 min after participants had drunk the solution. The 20 min were used to place the EEG electrodes. Immediately after drinking the solution and after finishing the task, they filled in the State version of the STAI. Participants were seating about 80 cm from the 20 inch LED flat screen. The experiment was programmed with Presentation<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> software (Version 15.0).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>EEG Recording and Pre-Processing</title><p>EEG was recorded with 64 active scalp electrodes from the ActiveTwo BioSemi (BioSemi, Amsterdam, Netherlands) extended 10/20 system (Chatrian et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>). An electrooculogram (EOG) was recorded from two horizontal electrodes placed beyond the epicanthi of both eyes and one vertical electrode located approximately 1 cm below the right eye. As per BioSemi&#x02019;s design, the ground electrode during acquisition was formed by the Common Mode Sense active electrode and the Driven Right Leg passive electrode. All bioelectric signals were digitalized using ActiView software (BioSemi). The impedances were below 25 k&#x003a9; during the EEG recording. The EEG was sampled at 512 Hz. Offline analysis was performed by using EEGLab v12.0.2.5b based on MATLAB 7.14.0.739 (The MathWorks, 2012). Pre-processing of the EEG data was performed as in Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). All data were filtered with a 0.1 Hz high-pass filter and a 30 Hz low-pass filter (Inzlicht and Al-Khindi, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). No site on the head, including traditional reference sites such as the mastoids or earlobes, can be regarded as being &#x0201c;inactive&#x0201d; (Tucker et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>). As in Luu et al. (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) EEG was therefore re-referenced against the average reference. We performed an Independent Component Analysis (ICA; an automated infomax decomposition) to correct for ocular artifacts. As in Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), further technical and muscle artifacts were rejected when the EEG signal exceeded &#x000b1;75 &#x003bc;V. Epochs were defined as 200 ms before to 400 ms after key press and baseline-corrected by subtracting the average voltage 200&#x02013;50 ms before key press (Inzlicht and Al-Khindi, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Data for these epochs were averaged for each participant separately for correct reactions following go-stimuli and for wrong reactions following nogo-stimuli. Participants (<italic>N</italic> = 99) included into data analysis had 26.14 &#x000b1; 11.28 epochs for wrong reactions and 360.59 &#x000b1; 61.02 epochs for correct reactions (<italic>M</italic> &#x000b1; <italic>SD</italic>). The grand-average of these epochs is presented separately for the misattribution group and the control group in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. We observed a negative deflection of both curves that peaked between 50 ms pre-response to 150 ms post-response. In accordance with Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), we analyzed the ERN/Ne and the Correct-related negativity (CRN). Both ERN/Ne and CRN were defined as the maximum negativity (base-to-peak amplitude, see Inzlicht and Al-Khindi, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, p. 803) within the aforementioned time interval.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Response-locked raw waveform amplitude at Fz, FCz, Cz and Pz following correct (Correct-related negativity, CRN) and incorrect responses (error-related negativity, ERN/Ne) in the total sample (<italic>N</italic> = 99), in the misattribution group (<italic>n</italic> = 48) and in the control group (<italic>n</italic> = 51).</bold> The time interval of the ERN/Ne and CRN components is highlighted.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fnhum-10-00475-g0002"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 22.0 and with R 3.1.0.

Additionally, we conducted two mixed-factor ANOVAs for the cognitive performance data. The ANOVA for the error rates included the factors Error type (two levels: EOC rate vs. EOO rate) and Group (two levels: misattribution vs. control). The ANOVA for the reaction times included the factors Response (two levels: correct go-responses vs. incorrect nogo-responses) and Group (two levels: misattribution vs. control).</p><p>As depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, our data display a much more pronounced ERN/Ne at the FCz position. Therefore and in accordance with Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), we conducted a mixed-factor ANOVA to evaluate the ERPs measured at the FCz electrode. The analysis included the factors Response (two levels: correct go-responses, i.e., CRN, vs. incorrect nogo-responses, i.e., ERN/Ne) and Group (two levels: misattribution and control). We also analyzed the performance and the ERPs in relation with the experimental group. The correlation between the log-transformed number of EOCs and the amplitude difference between ERN/Ne and CRN (dERN/Ne) at the FCz position was calculated by means of the Pearson correlation coefficient separately for the participants in the misattribution group and in the control group. Log-transformation of EOCs was applied for replication purposes (see Inzlicht and Al-Khindi, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, p. 804) and because EOCs usually demonstrate a skewed distribution that deviates at least slightly from normal distribution (Nolan and Heinzen, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Osborne, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). By using log-transformation, skewness of a distribution of statistical data is reduced because the side with fewer values is extended while the side with more values is compressed. After performing log-transformation of EOCs, Pearson correlation of log-transformed EOC and dERN/Ne could be calculated.</p><p>Although Verhagen and Wagenmakers (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) provide a detailed description of Bayes factors, some details of the replication Bayes factor are presented here.

It is a popular objection against conventional Bayes factors that they are overly sensitive to the choice of prior distributions. However, an important advantage of the replication Bayes factor <italic>B</italic><sub>r0</sub> is that it does not require the specification of prior distributions, so that the Bayes factor is not sensitive to an individual choice of prior distributions. Therefore, the objection that is sometimes raised against conventional Bayes factors, is not relevant for <italic>B</italic><sub>r0</sub>. A further advantage of <italic>B</italic><sub>r0</sub> is that it is sensitive to detect replication effects of the same size as observed in the original study. However, if the effect of the original study is not zero and if the effect of the replication study is even stronger than in the original study, it is likely that <italic>B</italic><sub>r0</sub> will indicate support for the replication. Further details on the replication Bayes factor and on other Bayes factors relevant for the evaluation of replication success are given in Verhagen and Wagenmakers (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The replication Bayes factor test is especially useful for the replication of effects that were significant in the original study. However, in the present context, the issue of replication of null-results is also relevant because Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) partly based their interpretation on the null-result for cognitive performance. Therefore, the Bayesian statistic provided by Bayarri and Mayoral (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) is also of interest for the present replication study. Bayarri and Mayoral (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) proposed an equality-of-effect size Bayes factor that allows to test whether the effect size in the replication attempt equals the effect size in the original study, which is given by</p><disp-formula id="E3"><label>(3)</label><mml:math id="M3"><mml:msub><mml:mtext>B</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mn>01</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>&#x000a0;</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#x000a0;</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>orig</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>rep</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>orig</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>rep</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula><p>where <italic>H</italic><sub>0</sub> is the null-hypothesis that the effect sizes are equal and <italic>H</italic><sub>1</sub> is the alternative hypothesis that the effect sizes are unequal. The equality-of-effect size Bayes factor <italic>B</italic><sub>01</sub> is based on the assumption that there is one true effect size, from which the effect size of the original study and the effect size of the replication study deviate with some variance. When this variance is zero, the effect sizes are equal. For the equality-of-effect size Bayes factor the null-hypothesis is indicative of a successful replication. Fortunately, the equality-of-effect sizes can also be tested for the null-results that are relevant here. Finally, from the perspective of a meta-analytic mind-set (Stanley and Spence, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), it might also be interesting to test whether there is evidence against the null-hypothesis or not when the original data and the replication data are pooled. A corresponding fixed-effect meta-analysis Bayes factor test has been proposed by Rouder and Morey (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The fixed-effect meta-analysis Bayes factor is based on the alternative hypothesis <italic>H</italic><sub>1</sub> that there is a true effect size and that the fluctuation of the empirical values <italic>Y</italic><sub>1</sub> to <italic>Y</italic><sub>M</sub> of <italic>M</italic> experiments is only due to sampling error. In the present case, where there is only an original study and a replication study, we have <italic>M</italic> = 2. For this Bayes factor the null hypothesis (<italic>H</italic><sub>1</sub>) is that there is no true effect size, which implies that the variation of the empirical values of the <italic>M</italic> studies is not only due to sampling error. Accordingly, the fixed-effect meta-analysis Bayes factor can be written as</p><disp-formula id="E4"><label>(4)</label><mml:math id="M4"><mml:msub><mml:mtext>B</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>&#x000a0;</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#x000a0;</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#x02026;</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#x02026;</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula><p>Whereas the equality-of-effect size Bayes factor <italic>B</italic><sub>01</sub> tests whether the effect of the replication study equals the effect of the original study, the fixed-effect meta-analysis Bayes <italic>B</italic><sub>10</sub> tests whether a common effect is present or absent in the pooled data. The three Bayes factors computed here do not need an individual specification of <italic>a prior</italic> distribution. Therefore, the results of these three Bayes factors were not sensitive to an individual choice of prior distributions. The Bayes factor tests were calculated by means of the R script referred to in Verhagen and Wagenmakers (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0001"><sup>1</sup></xref>. By using this script, the different statistics (<italic>F, r</italic>) were converted into <italic>t</italic>-values. We follow Jeffreys (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">1961</xref>) in that only Bayes factors smaller than 1/3 and greater than three are considered as providing relevant evidence in favor (&#x0003e;3) or against (&#x0003c;1/3) the hypothesized effect (see also Wetzels et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). However, the Bayes factors do not imply to a single decision in favor or against the interesting hypotheses. In contrast, they provide a quantitative, continuous measure in favor or against support of the null-hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. Thereby, they also allow quantifying evidence in favor of the null-hypothesis. For further exploration of the similarities of the results, means of performance measures reported by Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) were directly compared with the means of performance measures in the present study.

Bayes factor tests were reported in order to provide more conclusive evidence on reproducibility. For the group differences on performance measures, the focus lies on the equality-of-effect-size Bayes factor (Equality <italic>B</italic><sub>01</sub>), since a null-effect has to be replicated here. With respect to the replication statistics, it should be noted that the Equality <italic>B</italic><sub>01</sub> was between 3.32 and 4.34 for all cognitive performance variables, indicating that the replication success for the performance measures is weak in terms of the equality of effect sizes (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).

However, the fixed-effect meta-analysis Bayes factor (Meta <italic>B</italic><sub>10</sub>) is of relevance here, because it indicates evidence against or in favor of the null-hypothesis, when the data of both studies are pooled.

The replication Bayes factor provides clear evidence against the replication of the ERN/Ne effect (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The equality-of-effect-size Bayes factor and the fixed-effect meta-analysis Bayes factor did not provide a clear indication of replication of the ERN/Ne effect. For the CRN, the replication Bayes factor was irrelevant, because a null-effect had to be replicated. The equality of effect size Bayes factor did not provide evidence indicating the similarity of the effect reported in the original study and in the replication study.

Therefore, the non-significant Response &#x000d7; Group interaction for the ERP as well as the non-significant group effect for the ERN/Ne may be due to a missing effect of the experimental manipulation on state-anxiety. In order to investigate the reasons for the non-replication of the ERN/Ne-effect more closely, we performed an additional analysis for those 23 participants of the misattribution group who had an STAI-state score averaged across measurement occasions that was below the overall group mean (<italic>M</italic> = 34.47; <italic>SD</italic> = 5.07). This subgroup might have attributed away their state-anxiety because of the experimental manipulation. It should be noted that the reduced sample size of the misattribution group also reduces the statistical power. However, for two groups with 23 participants the statistical power would have been 0.80 (G*Power, Version 3.1.9.2), which is a rather typical power.

A replication of Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) study was interesting because they presented results indicating that the ERN/Ne can be dissociated from cognitive performance but not from negative affect. Their interpretation was based on a non-significant effect of misattribution on cognitive performance combined with a significant effect of misattribution on ERN/Ne. Their study contributes to the theoretical debate whether the ERN/Ne reflects cognitive or affective aspects of error processing, because the misattribution of negative affect was shown to reduce the magnitude of the ERN/Ne (significant effect), whereas it did not have any effect on cognitive performance (non-significant effect). The pattern of results presented by Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) comprises the interpretation of non-significant effects and can therefore not be optimally evaluated by means of conventional frequentist significance tests. Accordingly, their study was of special interest for a replication by means of Bayesian statistics which was one of the central aims of the present study.</p><p>We investigated whether the experimental manipulation of the misattribution of anxiety-related physiological arousal by means of a placebo beverage leads to the reduced (more positive) ERN/Ne as observed in the original study of Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Unlike Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), we did not find a significant Group &#x000d7; Response interaction and we did not find a Group main effect in the corresponding ANOVA. The replication Bayes factor provides clear evidence against the replication of the ERN/Ne effect and the group mean difference found for the ERN/Ne in the present study was not within the confidence interval of the original study. The equality-of-effect-size Bayes factor and the fixed-effects meta-analysis Bayes factor did not provide clear evidence for or against replication of the misattribution on ERN/Ne. As Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), we did not find a significant effect of misattribution on cognitive performance. However, with respect to the equality-of-effect-size Bayes factor, we found no clear replication success of the null results for the performance measures. Moreover, the fixed-effect meta-analysis Bayes factor provides strong evidence for the null-hypothesis of the EOC, reaction time for correct responses and reaction time for errors. This indicates that no common effect can be assumed across the original and the replication study for the performance measures. Moreover, similar to Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), we observed a significant correlation of dERN/Ne and EOC in the control group and the fixed-effect meta-analysis Bayes factor provides strong evidence for a non-zero effect. However, in contrast to Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) we also found a correlation of dERN/Ne and EOC in the misattribution group and the equality-of-effect-size Bayes factor does not indicate clear evidence in favor or against replication of this correlation. With respect to the correlations of dERN/Ne with EOC, our results only partly match to the results of Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). It seems that different processes emerged in the original and in the replication study. It is difficult to speculate on possible reasons for the rather different results. Since both studies were based on university samples, it is unlikely that differences between the samples are the reason for the different results. It cannot be excluded that sampling error as well as measurement error (unreliability) may have caused some of the differences in the results (Stanley and Spence, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Since we did not find an effect of the misattribution condition on state-anxiety, it is possible that we could not replicate the experimental manipulation and that the missing experimental effect is the reason for the non-replication of the ERN/Ne effect. In order to improve our understanding of the reasons for the non-replication, we performed a <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis for the 23 participants of the misattribution group with a below-average state-anxiety. We assumed that it is more likely that these participants reduced their state-anxiety by means of misattribution. Although the statistical power was reduced when the subsample was included, it was still at an acceptable level of about 0.80. Nevertheless, even when the misattribution subgroup with below-average state-anxiety was included into the ANOVA, the Group main effect was not significant. Again, the replication Bayes factor provided evidence against replication. Moreover, the fixed-effect meta-analysis Bayes factor indicated non-replication of the ERN/Ne effect in the subgroup analysis. Thus, when we analyzed a subsample of participants, in which the misattribution of anxious arousal was more likely to be successfully induced, the ERN/Ne results remained the same. Therefore, the non-replication is not primarily due to the missing misattribution effect on state-anxiety.</p><p>Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) provided a study that was based on a pattern of significant and non-significant results with different types of data (ERP, cognitive performance). Studies that are based on different data types and complex patterns of significant and non-significant results may be especially suitable for the description of the complexities of human behavior. However, the complex patterns of results may also be a challenge for their reproducibility. Reproducibility is meanwhile intensely discussed (Open Science Collaboration, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), but the combination of several data types is also regarded as a central aim of psychological research (Zuckerman, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>). Moreover, interpretations that are also based on the non-significance of some results are interesting in this context, because it is impossible to ascertain their replication status within the classical frequentist approach of statistics. Although we also reported confidence intervals for the mean differences, it should be noted that they are also based on the frequentist approach and cannot be used in order to evaluate the null-hypothesis. Fortunately, some Bayesian statistics have meanwhile been proposed in order to test the reproducibility of results (Bayarri and Mayoral, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Rouder and Morey, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Verhagen and Wagenmakers, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and it is possible to provide evidence in favor or against the null-hypothesis within the Bayesian approach.</p><p>It should also be acknowledged that the interpretation of the dissociation of a non-significant performance effect from a significant ERN/Ne effect in the original study was not without problems. The interpretation of non-significant results from conventional frequentist significance tests needs a very strong statistical power. However, the sample size of the original study was not large (<italic>N</italic> = 40), so that the non-significant performance effect could also be the result of an insufficient statistical power. For example, the effect size of the misattribution effect for EOO was about <italic>d</italic> = 0.26 in the ERP study of Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). With a sample size of <italic>N</italic> = 40 and an alpha level of 0.05 the power to detect a significant effect of this size is close to chance level (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> = 0.51). With such a small power it is impossible to conclude that there was really no effect of the misattribution condition on performance in the original study. Moreover, the fixed-effect meta-analysis Bayes factor did not indicate a true effect across the original study and the replication study for the performance and for the ERN/Ne effect. Therefore, the dissociation of performance and ERN/Ne that has been reported in the original study should be regarded with caution.</p><p>Another issue that may have affected the replication of the ERP results is that the ERN/CRN amplitudes investigated in the original study and in the replication study may have a considerable temporal overlap with other ERP components such as the P3 component. We followed the idea to use the same ERP quantification method in the replication study as in the original study, which was a baseline-to-peak quantification. However, if an overlap with the P3 amplitude has affected the ERN/CRN amplitudes of the original study and in the replication study, the values that have been entered into the Bayes factors were perhaps suboptimal. Thus, it might be interesting to consider principal component analysis as an ERP quantification method that allows for disentangling the ERN/CRN and the P3 amplitudes in further studies. There might be some theoretical reason for further pursuing the investigation of the relevance of negative affect for the ERN/Ne. <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Yeung</xref> (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>, p. 65) argued that &#x0201c;it is more accurate to state that the Ne/ERN reflects an emotional response to the internal representation that an error has occurred&#x0201d;. Moreover, the review of Holroyd and Yeung (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) on hierarchical reinforcement learning illustrates that also cognitive and motivational mechanisms of the ACC are interwoven. Because the ERN/Ne is generated in the ACC, the ERN/Ne is likely to reflect also motivational processes of error processing.</p><p>For an interpretation of the effect of misattribution on the ERN/Ne amplitude, the following effects should be taken into account: the STAI-S scores revealed that all participants were more anxious after the experimental task than before it, suggesting that performing the go-nogo task indeed increased anxiety-related arousal. Moreover, there was no group effect (misattribution vs. control) for the STAI-S scores indicating that the experimental conditions had no effect on the intensity of state-anxiety. Thus, the conditions for a replication of the results found in Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) were not bad. Nevertheless, the non-replication of the misattribution effect on state-anxiety indicates that the induction of misattribution may not have been successful, although we followed the description presented in the method section of the original study. The <italic>post hoc</italic> analyses point into this direction, because the equality-of-effect-size Bayes factor indicated that the ERN/Ne effect was similar to the effect of the original study (although the fixed-effect meta-analysis Bayes factor did not indicate a true ERN/Ne effect across the original study and the replication study in the <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis).</p><p>Thus, although our study followed exactly the manipulation that was described in the original study, it did not support the prediction that the misattribution of negative affect leads to reduced state-anxiety. Moreover, our study did not find that misattribution of negative affect leads to a reduced ERN/Ne. It is possible that the manipulation of misattribution should be improved in order to enhance the reproducibility of the results of the original study. Since we based the replication study only on the information that is available from the original article, we cannot exclude that some unpublished aspects of the manipulation may help to get the interesting effects (Grens, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). However, the fact that Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) found misattribution effects for the ERN/Ne but not for cognitive performance might also be due to the more pronounced sensitivity of ERP data when compared to cognitive performance data (e.g., Moser et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Moser et al. (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) observed anxiety-related differences of the ERN/Ne but not with regard to cognitive performance data. Moser et al. (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) argued in accordance with the processing efficiency theory of Eysenck and Calvo (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>) that more anxious individuals perform usually as well as less anxious individuals. However, more anxious individuals reach this comparable performance because they invest compensatory effort which helps them to overcome negative effects of errors on the performance level. In contrast to Moser et al. (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), we did not observe evidence of the misattribution main effect on ERN/Ne in association with anxiety-related traits (Cano Rodilla et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>Finally, although the null-results for group differences could be replicated for the cognitive performance, it should be noted that the reaction times were significantly shorter in the present study than the reaction times reported by Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). It is therefore possible that the shorter reaction times of the participants point to a different processing strategy in the two samples. Probably, a limitation of the present study was that fast responding was made too salient. Accordingly, to replicate the ERN/Ne results reported in the original study fast responding should not be made too salient in the instruction. Thus, further research based on the experimental paradigm investigated here should focus on the reaction times and on the instructions referring to a reduced relevance of a fast response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We were not able to reproduce the misattribution effects of anxiety-related arousal on ERN/Ne that have been found by Inzlicht and Al-Khindi (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Even in a subsample of the misattribution group with below-average state-anxiety, the ERN/Ne effect of the original study could not be replicated. This indicates that problems with the replication of the ERN/Ne effect may not only be related to the effects of misattribution on state-anxiety. Moreover, we were able to reproduce the non-significant effects of misattribution on CRN and cognitive performance. However, this replication of null results is less clear for relevant Bayes factors. Although we could replicate the correlation of dERN/Ne and EOC in the control group, we also found this correlation in the misattribution group. Since reaction times were significantly shorter in the present study it might be possible that the reproducibility of the ERN/Ne results of the original study depends on the relevance that is given to a fast response in the instruction. In sum, the effects of misattribution are not as strong as should be expected when negative affect following errors is an essential determinant of the ERN/Ne beyond cognition and motivation. However, the expected misattribution effects on the ERN/Ne might be found with other experimental designs, possibly when the level of anxious arousal is controlled for by means of additional procedures.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>CCR: programming of experimental task, data aquisition, involvement in EEG preprosessing and data analysis, wrote initial draft of the manuscript and approved the current version.
