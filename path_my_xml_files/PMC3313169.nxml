Participants were supplemented with 4.5 g&#x000b7;d<sup>-1 </sup>for 2 d, 9 g&#x000b7;d<sup>-1 </sup>for 2 d and 13.5 g&#x000b7;d<sup>-1 </sup>for 6 d. HIE and PLA supplements were identical in appearance and taste before and after mixing with 237 mL of milk. Subjects recorded duration and severity of adverse events in a daily log.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>HIE and PLA had a 100% compliance with the study protocol. 17% (n = 2) of HIE and 25% (n = 3) of PLA reported experiencing at least one adverse event. HIE reported experiencing adverse events for a total of 10 d as compared to 24 d for PLA. In HIE one subject reported experiencing stomach ache and diarrhea for 3 d (severity of 2 on a 10 pt scale) and another subject reported a skin rash lasting 4 d (severity of 6 on a 10 pt scale). In PLA one subject reported experiencing stomach ache and vomiting for 3 d and increased thirst and feeling tired/sleepy for 3 d (severity of 7 and 8, respectively, on a 10 pt scale). Subjects reported a runny nose (n = 3) lasting 1&#x02013;3 days (1&#x02013;5 severity on a 10 pt scale) and a cough (n = 2) lasting 3 d (severity 1&#x02013;5 on a 10 pt scale).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>It was concluded that HIE ingestion was associated with fewer adverse events of similar or lesser severity than PLA. All adverse events experienced by the subjects were minimal and transitory in nature with none requiring medical intervention.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Legacy <italic>for Life</italic>, LLC, Melbourne, FL, for funding this research.</p></sec></back></article>
