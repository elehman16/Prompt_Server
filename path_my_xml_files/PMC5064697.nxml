It has been found to improve Cormack-Lehane (C-L) grading by 2 to 1 grade and possibly aid easier intubation. It provides both a direct laryngoscopic view and a small digital camera view that is displayed on the video screen, in contrast to many previous VLs.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The displayed anatomy is magnified. Recognition of the anatomical structures and anomalies is easier, and manipulation of airway devices is facilitated.</p><p>Nasotracheal intubation (NTI) is often required for head and neck surgeries like tonsillectomies. Direct laryngoscopy with the Macintosh blade, with the use of Magill's forceps to direct endotracheal tube (ETT) into glottic opening, is time-consuming and may lead to trauma to surrounding structures and damage ETT cuff.</p><p>Hence, this study was conducted to assess the intubating conditions, using the conventional Macintosh laryngoscope and the Storz C-MAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> VL during NTI in paediatric patients posted for tonsillectomy surgeries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This prospective randomised study was conducted after obtaining approval from the Institutional Review board (IEC no. VIMS/STD.II/PG/EC/12/2012&#x02013;13). Patients of either sex, aged between 8 and 18 years, belonging to American Society of Anesthesiologists physical Status I, II and Mallampati Grade I, II were included and study was conducted between January 2013 and June 2014. Parents who refused to give consent, patients with significant systemic disease and patients having contraindications for NTI were excluded from the study. A thorough pre-anaesthetic evaluation was conducted including nasal patency using spatula test. The procedure was explained to the patients and written informed consent from parent/guardian was obtained.</p><p>Patients were randomly allocated by computer generated randomisation into two groups of thirty each. Patients in group 1 underwent conventional laryngoscopy using Macintosh direct laryngoscope and group 2 underwent videolaryngoscopy using C-MAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> VL for nasal intubation. The sample size was estimated based on a pilot study carried out in 10 patients where it was found that mean intubation times for the Macintosh group, and the C-MAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group were 55 s and 45 s respectively with standard deviation (SD) of 5 s. Based on these figures and using alpha error = 0.05 and 0.85 power of the study, we got the required sample size of 25 each. Hence, we recruited 30 into each group by increasing the sample size by 5. The investigator who performed the intubation in this study had previously performed about 100 NTI using C-MAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> VL. After connecting the routine pre-induction monitors, baseline values of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean blood pressure (MBP), heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were recorded. All patients were pre-medicated with injection glycopyrrolate 10 &#x003bc;g/kg, injection fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg and injection midazolam 10 &#x003bc;g/kg intravenous (IV). Oxymetazoline nasal drops were instilled into each nostril. All patients were pre-oxygenated for 3 min. Anaesthesia was induced with injection propofol 2 mg/kg IV and neuromuscular blockade achieved with injection vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg. Patients were ventilated with oxygen, nitrous oxide (33:67 ratio) and end-tidal concentration of isoflurane 0.8&#x02013;1.2 as observed on the gas monitor for initial 4 min, followed by ventilation with 100% oxygen for 1 min before intubation. Isoflurane was maintained at this concentration during the rest of study. Preservative free injection lignocaine 1.5 mg/kg IV was administered 90 s before intubation. Five minutes after giving injection vecuronium, ensuring adequate muscle relaxation, lubricated appropriate sized nasotracheal ETT was inserted through the most patent nostril until its tip lay in the oropharynx. Laryngoscopy was then performed using either Macintosh laryngoscope (Blade size 2 or 3) or Storz C-MAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> VL (Macintosh blade size 2 or 3) as per the group and a view of laryngeal opening was obtained. Initially, attempt was made to pass the ETT through the vocal cords without the aid of manoeuvres (M0). If difficulty was encountered, additional external manipulations (M1) such as head flexion, rotation of tube and backwards, upwards, rightwards pressure (BURP) were used.</p><p>In case of failure to intubate using above manoeuvres, cuff of the ETT was inflated with approximately 10 ml of air and the ETT brought into view (M2) (as per study done by Baddoo HK <italic>et al</italic>.).[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Once the tip of ETT was in the glottic opening, cuff was deflated; the ETT was then advanced into the trachea and then cuff was reinflated. If this failed, cuff inflation was assisted with external manipulation (M3). If this technique failed then, cuff was deflated, and Magill's forceps alone (M4) or in combination with BURP (M5) was used to position and guide the tube. The manuoevres were followed in the sequence described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. If there was failure to intubate with all the above-said manoeuvres, oral intubation was performed. Correct placement of ETT was confirmed by auscultation over the chest for bilateral equal air entry and using capnograph.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Sequence of additional manoeuvres used in the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJA-60-732-g001"/></table-wrap><p>During this procedure, HR, SBP, DBP, MBP and SpO<sub>2</sub> were recorded every minute for the initial 5 min after induction of anaesthesia, and thereafter at 5 min intervals for next 15 min. If a decrease in saturation to 90% or lower was observed during nasal intubation then oral intubation was performed. After endotracheal intubation, subsequent anaesthetic management was continued as per the need.</p><p>Parameters noted during the study were: C-L grading, time required for intubation, intubation without any manoeuvre (M0), need for the manoeuvres, type of manoeuvre (M1&#x02013;M5) used, haemodynamic changes, lowest recorded SpO<sub>2</sub> during or immediately after intubation attempt and occurrence of any other complications.</p><p>Duration of NTI was defined as the time taken from the insertion of the ETT through the nostril, till passage of tube through vocal cords by visual confirmation by the intubating anaesthesiologist. Duration of NTI more than 120 s, fall in SpO<sub>2</sub> below 90% during the procedure were considered as failed NTI. Data collected were coded, tabulated, and then analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 20, IBM, Armonk, NY, United States of America) computer package. Mann-Whitney U-test was used for analysing age, sex, C-L grading and for comparing the duration of intubation between both groups.

We found no significant difference in airway assessment using C-L grading in both groups. This can be explained by the fact that both groups of patients were of similar demography and patients with airway difficulties were excluded from the study.</p><p>Duration of NTI was significantly decreased in group 2 in comparison with group 1 patients. C-MAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> VL has slim blade profile and edges are inclined, thus reducing the potential contact area of the blade with the upper incisors.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Thus, it provides extra space for manipulating the tube during intubation. It magnifies airway view and allows supporting staff to optimise their assistance such as applying adequate external manipulation as necessary. The anterior angulation of the blade and placement of the video camera allow the operator to see structures that would be difficult or even impossible to see under direct vision.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Real time recording of video sequences is also possible in this device.</p><p>The majority of patients in group 1 required different manoeuvres as per study protocol. External laryngeal manipulation (M1) was used in more number of patients in group 2 than group 1. This can be explained by the fact that there was requirement of more hand-eye coordination while viewing the glottis on VL monitor and intubating the patient even with experienced anaesthesiologists. A previous study showed that cuff inflation technique (M2) helps to lift ETT from the posterior pharyngeal wall, thus helping to bring it into view and also directs it towards the glottis.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] This technique of cuff inflation has been described for blind nasal intubation in spontaneously breathing patients.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] However, the technique was found to be less useful for successful intubation in this study. Combined use of cuff inflation with external laryngeal manipulation (M3) was not useful in this study.</p><p>Direct laryngoscopy requires elevation of the laryngoscope blade, moves the larynx upwards and elevates the glottis. Thus, lengthens the distance between the glottic orifice and the posterior pharyngeal wall and also makes the nasally introduced tube slide upwards and then downwards in sequence. Thus, it often requires the use of Magill's forceps to align this ETT tip with the glottic inlet and its use may sometimes lead to trauma to surrounding structures, damage to ETT cuff. Magill's forceps alone (M4) and M4 with additional external manipulation (M5) were needed more in group 1 as compared to group 2.</p><p>Similar studies conducted by Kaki <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and Hirabayashi and Seo[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] concluded that VLs needed lesser use of Magill's forceps for NTI. C-MAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> VL helped the supporting staff to assist intubation, using less invasive manoeuvres and thus may prevent trauma to oral cavity, damage to ETT cuff.</p><p>It was also observed that there was a positive correlation between the number of manoeuvres used and the intubation time required in both groups. Patients in group 1 required longer time (2 min) to intubate than group 2 (1.5 min) when the use of additional manoeuvres of the highest level (M5) was required.</p><p>For good glottic view, videolaryngoscopy requires the application of lesser force as compared to direct laryngoscopy to the base of the tongue.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Therefore, videolaryngoscopy is less likely to stimulate pressor-response and induce local tissue injury. In contrast, both groups in our study had similar intubation responses which returned to baseline after 5 min. The difference between both groups preoperatively, before induction and after intubation was statistically insignificant.</p><p>This study was carried out in paediatric patients with normal airway. Hence, findings of this study cannot be extrapolated to adult patients. Further studies are required to know its utility in paediatric patients with difficult airways as well as in adult patients posted for nasal tracheal intubation.</p><p>Limitation of this study was that anaesthesiologist could not be blinded to the type of device being used for NTI. The study was limited to only sixty patients considering intubation time as the primary outcome parameter. Larger number of enrolled cases are required to assess other parameters of the nasotracheal intubating conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Storz C-MAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> VL provided better glottis visualisation as compared to conventional Macintosh direct laryngoscope. Lesser time was required for intubation and there was lesser need for Magill's forceps during NTI. However, requirement of additional external manipulations (M1) was more with the C-MAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> VL group. Thus, C-MAC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> VL improves the nasotracheal intubating conditions and can be superior alternative to Macintosh laryngoscope in clinical practice in paediatric patients.</p><sec
