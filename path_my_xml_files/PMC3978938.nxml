For the purpose, they were asked to sit in an easy and steady posture with the head, neck, and trunk erect. They were instructed to bring the right hand up to the nose and close the left nostril (for RNB) or right nostril (for LNB) with the finger and then breathe through one nostril only. During this unilateral breathing the exhalation and inhalation were of equal duration and without any pause. Breathing was diaphragmatic and slow and controlled with no sense of exertion. For both inspiration and expiration, they were asked to count 1 to 5 in their mind (each count was roughly one second) for each phase, so that each respiratory cycle lasted for about 10 s. Thus, about six breathing cycles occurred during 1 min.

It was reported by us earlier that slow breathing exercise increases vagal tone, which was proposed to be due to increased vagal discharge during prolongation of expiration in slow breathing.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Normally, the heart rate is more during inspiration due to decreased vagal activity and less during expiration due to increased vagal activity, the phenomenon called physiological sinus arrhythmia.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] The mechanisms of increased sympathetic activity in RNB subject and increased vagal activity in LNB subjects have not been properly elucidated in previous studies.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In the yogic system of breathing, the right nostril dominance corresponds to activation of &#x02018;<italic>Pingala</italic>&#x02019;, the subtle energy channel of yoga, which is related to sympathetic arousal; the left nostril dominance to &#x02018;<italic>Ida</italic>&#x02019;, which is the representative of parasympathetic activation.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] The nostril dominance at rest is the natural phenomenon of nasal cycle, which is an ultradian rhythm characterized by alternating patency of the left and right nostrils, with a periodicity of 2-8 h.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] The variation in cognitive functions has been reported to be associated with nostril dominance.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Whereas, yoga one-nostril breathing is the practice of breathing through a particular nostril with other nostril closed,[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] which has been reported to be associated with alteration in autonomic functions.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Nevertheless, the scientific mechanisms of difference in autonomic balance in specific nostril breathing need to be evaluated.</p><p>The SBP, DBP, and MAP were increased in the RNB group and decreased in the LNB group [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>] following 6-week practice of nostril breathing, further suggesting increased sympathetic activity in RNB subjects and decreased sympathetic activity in LNB subjects, as BP control is primarily under the vasoconstrictor tone of sympathetic system.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Moreover, BHR and all BP parameters were significantly correlated with the LF-HF ratio after 6-week nostril breathing practice, indicating that alteration in these CV parameters are associated with change in autonomic tone, as the LF-HF ratio is a sensitive measure of sympathovagal balance.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] As the degree of correlation was more significant in the LNB group compared to that of the RNB group, it appears that autonomic control of CV functions through left nostril breathing is stronger than that of right nostril breathing.</p><p>Significant decrease in rate-pressure product (RPP) in the LNB group subjects following practice of breathing techniques compared to their own pre-practice value and value of control group and RNB group indicates improvement in resting myocardial performance, as RPP is an indirect measure of myocardial work load and myocardial oxygen utilization.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Whereas in the RNB group, the RPP was high indicating that the myocardial work load could be more in subjects practicing RNB. Thus, findings of this study suggests that myocardial performance for the desired cardiac output can be achieved with less oxygen consumption in subjects practicing LNB. Increased resting heart rate and RPP are established markers of CV risks.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Therefore, subjects practicing RNB could be at risk of future CV disease. Nevertheless, decreased heart rate and RPP in the LNB group indicates improvement of cardiac function in these subjects. In addition, bivariate logistic regression analysis of RPP with LF-HF ratio demonstrated higher odds ratio and more significant relationship between these two variables after the practice of nostril breathing in the LNB group compared to that of the RNB group [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. This establishes the direct link of the LF-HF ratio with RPP following practice of nostril breathing. This means, following 6-week practice of nostril breathing, the LF-HF ratio could predict myocardial performance and workload more in the left-nostril group compared to the right-nostril group. In other words, decrease in the LF-HF ratio had direct contribution to decrease in RPP (myocardial stress) in LNB subjects after 6-week practice of breathing exercise. Thus, findings of this study demonstrate improvement of sympathovagal balance with lowering of myocardial workload and oxygen utilization following short-term practice of LNB.</p><p>Findings of this study indicate significant alteration in autonomic functions following unilateral nostril breathing. Persistent unilateral nostril breathing due to nasal obstruction is reported to be associated with a number of chronic disorders that occur due to SVI such as migraine, hyperthyroidism, asthma, and cardiac dysfunctions.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] Therefore, future studies should evaluate if improvement in autonomic functions by specific nostril breathing can alleviate such chronic problems, as established by practice of other forms of yoga.[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] In this study, considerable increase in sympathovagal balance following 6-week practice of slow left nostril breathing indicates the profound effects of this breathing pattern on CV functions. Recently, medical students have been reported to have stress of study due to increased demand of learning in medical curriculum,[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] which affects their health.[<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] CV disorders are associated with sympathovagal imbalance caused by increased level of stress.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] Findings of this study provide evidence that the practice of left nostril breathing may alleviate stress in medical students and reduce their CV risks. Moreover, the students should not be encouraged to practice right nostril breathing as in this study there was increase in sympathetic activity, BP, and RPP in the RNB group.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We acknowledge the contribution of Mrs. Bharathi Balakumar, Technical supervisor, for providing the laboratory technical support.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Malhotra</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>KP</given-names></name><name><surname>Madhu</surname><given-names>SV</given-names></name><name><surname>Tandon</surname><given-names>OP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Role of yoga in modifying certain cardiovascular functions in type 2 diabetic patients</article-title><source>J Assoc Physicians India</source><year>2004</year><volume>52</volume><fpage>203</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15636309</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>RP</given-names></name><name><surname>Gerbarg</surname><given-names>PL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Sudarshan Kriya Yogic breathing in the treatment of stress, anxiety, and depression.
