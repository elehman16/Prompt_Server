PfSPZ Challenge was well tolerated and safe. Eleven of 12 and 10 of 11 subjects, who received 10,000 and 25,000 PfSPZ respectively, developed parasitemia. In 10,000 versus 25,000 PfSPZ groups geometric mean days from injection to Pf positivity by thick blood film was 15.4 versus 13.5 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.023).

However, until now such CHMIs had never been used in Africa.</p><p>There are a number of reasons why CHMI has not been established in Africa. One is that the phase 1 clinical trial facilities and teams necessary to safely and professionally carry out such trials have not been available until recently for such studies. A second reason is that from 1985 to 2010, all CHMI studies in which volunteers were infected with Pf sporozoites were conducted by exposure to the bites of Pf-infected <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes not native to Africa, and produced in high security facilities difficult to establish, run, and maintain in Africa. To address the first limitation, we established a phase 1 clinical trial center at the Ifakara Health Institute (IHI), Bagamoyo, Tanzania. At the same time it became possible to manufacture aseptic, purified, cryopreserved Pf sporozoites (PfSPZ) that are highly infectious, a product called PfSPZ Challenge.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> When young adult Dutch volunteers were injected intradermally (ID) with doses of 2,500, 10,000, or 25,000 PfSPZ (divided into two 50 &#x003bc;L injections), five of six volunteers developed parasitemia in all three groups, and the time from injection of PfSPZ Challenge to detection of parasites by thick blood smear was &#x0223c;13 days in all three groups. Thus, there was infection, but no dose response, presumably because increasing the dose did not increase the numbers of sporozoites that exited the skin, entered the circulation, and invaded hepatocytes.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>To begin the process of understanding how to use PfSPZ Challenge in Africans, we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety and infectivity of ID-administered PfSPZ Challenge in 30 male, highly educated, Tanzanian residents of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, who had had minimal exposure to Pf malaria during the previous 5 years. As a bridge to the Dutch study, one group received the regimen used in one of the Dutch groups; 5,000 PfSPZ in 50 &#x003bc;L were injected ID into the deltoid area of both upper arms for a total of 10,000 PfSPZ.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In a second group we increased the dose to 25,000 PfSPZ, and based on findings in murine model systems, which suggested ways to improve the efficiency of ID injections,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> we divided the total dosage into four injections of 6,250 PfSPZ, each in 10 &#x003bc;L.</p><p>As in Dutch<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and British<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> subjects, PfSPZ Challenge was safe, well tolerated, and infectious in young adult Tanzanian males. In the bridging group the infection rate, but not the pre-patent period, was comparable to that observed for the same dose in young adult Dutch subjects. These findings provide the foundation for using CHMI with PfSPZ Challenge to assess the protective efficacy of antimalarial vaccines and drugs in Africa.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and population.</title><p>This single center, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial was conducted in Bagamoyo, Tanzania between February and August 2012. Thirty healthy male volunteers 20 to 35 years of age were recruited from higher learning institutions in Dar es Salaam. Screening for eligibility took place at the newly established Bagamoyo Clinical Trial Unit (BCTU) of the Ifakara Health Institute (IHI). Volunteers were screened using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria based on clinical examinations and laboratory tests. These included medical history and physical examinations, and standard hematology, biochemistry, malaria, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and C, and sickle cell tests. In addition subjects were screened for &#x003b1;-thalassemia. In the initial screening &#x003b1;-thalassemia trait was an exclusion criterion because of a theoretical concern that these individuals might be less susceptible to Pf infection. As screening progressed it became clear that a substantial proportion of the local population was heterozygous for &#x003b1;-thalassemia and it would be important to include this population in the volunteer pool to understand if the heterozygous condition was more resistant to malaria infection by experimental challenge and pose an obstacle that would need to be addressed in future vaccine studies. Volunteers who indicated that they had not had an episode of documented malaria in the past 5 years were included. They also had malaria thick smears, and any subject who was positive was excluded.</p><sec id="s2a1"><title>Screening for a+ and a<sup>0</sup> &#x003b1;-thalassemia caused by deletions.</title><p>One milliliter (1 mL) of venous blood was collected in EDTA tubes and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.

A blood smear was declared positive when one reader saw two parasites in 0.5 &#x003bc;L of blood and the presence of parasites was independently confirmed by a second reader. The pre-patent period was defined as the period between inoculation of PfSPZ Challenge and appearance of the first positive blood smear.

In the Netherlands, 5 of 6 who received 10,000 and 5 of 6 who received 25,000 PfSPZ ID in two divided 50 &#x003bc;L doses became parasitemic.</p><p>However, the GM pre-patent period for the Tanzanians who received the 10,000 PfSPZ dosage regimen was 15.4 days, and the GM pre-patent period for the Dutch was 12.6 days (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0192, Wilcoxon 2-tailed). There are multiple possible explanations for the prolonged pre-patent period in the Tanzanians. One is that naturally acquired immunity reduced the number of parasites that invaded or fully developed in the liver, thereby reducing the numbers of parasites that were released from the liver and prolonging the pre-patent period. Another possibility is that the replication rate in the blood was reduced as a result of naturally acquired immunity or innate resistance, and that this reduced replication prolonged the pre-patent period. Unfortunately, the variability in the qPCR results did not allow for definitively determining if this was the case, but it appeared that the replication rate was similar to the 11.5-fold replication rate every 48 hours seen in the Dutch volunteers.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Thus, we do not know why the pre-patent period was longer in the Tanzanians. However, because the replication rates seemed to be similar in the Dutch and Tanzanian subjects, we think that there may have been fewer merozoites released from the livers of the Tanzanians.</p><p>Interestingly, the GM pre-patent period in the group that received 25,000 PfSPZ was significantly different (13.5 days) than was the pre-patent period in the group that received 10,000 PfSPZ (15.4 days) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.023). This 2-day difference can only partially be accounted for by increasing the numbers of PfSPZ by 2.5-fold. It is likely that more efficient administration of the PfSPZ contributed to the delay by increasing the number of sites of administration from two to four and decreasing the volume of the injections from 50 to 10 &#x003bc;L, as we have seen in mice.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Hemoglobinopathies, disorders of hemoglobin structure, and production, are one of the most common monogenic disorders in humans. &#x003b1;-thalassemia is a hemoglobinopathy resulting from deletion of one (&#x02212;&#x003b1;) or both (&#x02013;) &#x003b1; genes from chromosome 16. Its wide distribution in populations living in places like Tanzania, where malaria has been or still is present, has been hypothesized to result from protection against severe or lethal malaria.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> This study was not designed (i.e. powered) to be able to assess the differences in infection rates, pre-patent periods, and parasite densities between individuals with and without &#x003b1;-thalassemia trait. Nonetheless, there was no indication of any differences between those carrying this trait and those who did not have it. This finding is consistent with a number of field studies that showed that individuals who were heterozygous or homozygous for &#x003b1;-thalassemia had similar rates of asymptomatic parasitemia and similar manifestations of uncomplicated malaria as non-thalassemic individuals.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>Administration of PfSPZ Challenge was extremely well tolerated. There were no serious adverse events. In fact, the incidence rate of AEs was the same in the control group that received normal saline as it was in the groups that received PfSPZ Challenge (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Tables 5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">7</xref>). Very few of the AEs occurred during the first 5 days after inoculation of PfSPZ Challenge, and thus very few were attributed to the injection of PfSPZ Challenge (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">Table 7</xref>). Most occurred during the period when the volunteers were being diagnosed with Pf parasitemia and being treated. However, even during this period the incidence rate was similar in the control and experimental groups. One of the striking findings was how few symptoms and signs attributable to Pf parasitemia were experienced by the subjects who developed malaria. In the Dutch study 9 of 18 volunteers reported fever, whereas only 2 of 24 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.004, Fisher's exact test, 2-tailed) reported fever in this study. In the Netherlands 5 of 18 had chills, whereas in this study only 1 of 24 had chills (<italic>P</italic> = 0.068).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> We assume this low level of symptoms and signs was attributable to naturally acquired or innate immunity, which ameliorated clinical manifestations.</p><p>A panel of six polymorphic microsatellite loci was successfully used to identify challenge strain (Pf NF54) infections and differentiate them from naturally acquired <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites circulating in Bagamoyo. This technique has been previously shown to be highly effective at differentiating genetic variants of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> within countries and across larger geographic regions.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Here, we show that the assay is also sensitive enough to generate reliable multi-locus genotypes from infected blood with parasite densities as low as five parasites/&#x003bc;L blood. Although microsatellites are useful in identifying the infecting strain, they do not provide information on genetic regions of vaccine-induced selection or escape following heterologous challenge.

This approach may help to pinpoint the genetic regions encoding the key antigens responsible for driving strain-specific immune responses and inform the development of next-generation multivalent whole organism vaccines in the event that efficacy is found to be strain-specific.</p><p>In conclusion, we have established the foundation for using CHMI with PfSPZ Challenge in Africans to establish the efficacy of new interventions against malaria and to study the mechanisms of protection conferred by hemoglobinopathies, glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiencies, and innate and acquired immunity to malaria in settings where malaria is endemic. Improvements in administration, such as direct venous inoculation (DVI) (Mordmueller B, submitted), will soon be used in Bagamoyo in CHMI studies to assess the protective efficacy of the PfSPZ Vaccine<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> in Tanzanians.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="external-data" id="SD3"><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ajtmh.org/content/91/3/471/suppl/DC3">Supplemental Tables.</ext-link></p><media mimetype="application/pdf" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="SD3.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e754" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We thank all volunteers and staff of the Ifakara Health Institute, Bagamoyo Research and Training Centre, Sanaria Inc., and Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute who contributed so much to this project.
