In 2011, the HPTN052 trial demonstrated that initiating ART at a CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count of 350&#x02013;550 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, which is greater than the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count of &#x0003c;350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> recommended in 2010 by World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, had a 96% preventive effect against HIV transmission among HIV-serodiscordant couples in a stable relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C3">3</xref>]. This evidence strengthened the treatment-as-prevention concept, under which providing ART to all HIV-infected patients, regardless of their CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count, might decrease HIV transmission among the general population to such an extent that it would curtail the HIV pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C5">5</xref>]. Results of randomized, controlled trials of treatment as prevention are not expected for several years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C6">6</xref>]. Meanwhile, there are still questions regarding factors that might impact the effect of early ART in the general population and make this effect different from that observed in the very specific group of stable serodiscordant couples.</p><p>Among these factors, the influence of early ART on risky sexual behaviors is one of major concern. In the first years of the highly active ART era, increased risky sexual behaviors associated with ART were reported among high-risk groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C8">8</xref>]. Risk compensation related to decrease in perception of HIV transmission risk and severity of HIV infection may potentially offset the protective effect of early ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C10">10</xref>]. Nevertheless, a recent review of observational studies conducted in developing countries instead suggested a decrease in risky sexual behaviors after ART initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C11">11</xref>]. However, such studies may be subject to confounding. In addition, only a few were prospective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C12">12</xref>], and all were conducted in the context of standard ART initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C13">13</xref>]. Starting ART earlier, while patients are healthy, may influence sexual behaviors differently. Updating results about this issue, especially in the current context of early ART initiation, is thus needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C14">14</xref>].</p><p>Evidence obtained so far has resulted in WHO recommendations of early ART for prevention specifically for the population of serodiscordant couples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C15">15</xref>]. Nevertheless, according to a recent estimation, only less than a third of new HIV transmissions in sub-Saharan Africa occur among these couples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C16">16</xref>]. This suggests that programs solely targeting stable serodiscordant couples may lack the ability to prevent the majority of new infections. Estimating the preventive effect of early ART beyond the population of stable serodiscordant couples is thus of great interest for scaling up effective prevention strategies.</p><p>Relying on data from the ongoing Temprano-ANRS12136 randomized, controlled trial, we aimed to measure the impact of early ART initiation on sexual behaviors and to estimate its protective effect among a West African adult population reporting diverse heterosexual partnership statuses (ie, serodiscordant, seroconcordant, stable, or casual).</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Temprano-ANRS12136 Trial</title><p>Temprano is a multicenter, randomized, open-label superiority trial to assess the benefits and risks of initiating ART earlier than currently recommended by the WHO, concomitantly or not with 6-month isoniazid prophylaxis for tuberculosis. The trial was launched in March 2008 in Abidjan, C&#x000f4;te d'Ivoire, and is still ongoing. The trial protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the Ministry of Health of C&#x000f4;te d'Ivoire and by the institutional review board of the French National Agency for Research on AIDS and Viral Hepatitis (ANRS; Paris, France). The study has been registered on Clinicaltrials.gov (clinical trials identifier NCT00495651).</p><p>Between March 2008 and July 2012, patients attending 9 care centers in Abidjan were included in the trial whenever they provided signed, informed consent; were aged &#x0003e;18 years; had HIV-1 infection or HIV-1/HIV-2 dual infection; had no ongoing active tuberculosis; had no ongoing pregnancy and/or were not breast-feeding; and had a CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count &#x0003c;800 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> and satisfied no criteria for starting ART, according to the most recent WHO guidelines. Participants were randomly assigned to one of 4 arms: 2 &#x0201c;standard ART&#x0201d; arms (arms 1 and 2), in which ART was delayed until patients meet ongoing WHO starting criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C18">18</xref>]; and 2 &#x0201c;early ART&#x0201d; arms (arms 3 and 4), in which ART was initiated immediately on inclusion. In arm 2 and arm 4, participants received 6-month isoniazid prophylaxis for tuberculosis, starting at the 1-month visit and stopping at the 7-month visit. Once included, participants were asked to show up for trial scheduled visits every 3 months. CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count and plasma HIV-1 RNA load (real-time polymerase chain reaction, TaqMan technology; ABI Prism 7000, Applied Biosystems; lower limit of detection, 300 copies/mL) were measured every 6 months. Each participant was to be followed during 30 months. The main outcome of the trial is the occurrence of a new episode of severe morbidity and any event leading to death.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Sociobehavioral Study</title><p>The present sociobehavioral study was nested in the Temprano trial. All participants included in Temprano between 1 January 2009 and 1 September 2011 were eligible for the study. A standardized questionnaire was used to collect information on sexual behaviors. Participants completed this questionnaire face to face at the 12-month visit.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study Outcomes</title><p>Sexual behaviors of interest included sexual activity and multiple partnerships in the past year, as well as characteristics of the last episode of sexual intercourse, including date (occurrence in the past month or the past year), type of partnership (cohabiting or not), and partner's HIV status (unknown, negative, or positive).</p><p>Risky sex at the last episode of sexual intercourse in the past month was defined as an episode of unprotected intercourse with a partner whose HIV status was negative or unknown. Partner's exposure to HIV infection was defined as risky sex at the last episode of sexual intercourse in the past month <italic>plus</italic> a viral load of &#x0003e;300 copies at the time of the intercourse, i.e. measured within a period ranging from 30 days before to 7 days after the date of completion of the sociobehavioral questionnaire.</p><p>For each sexually active participant, the risk of HIV transmission during the last episode of intercourse in the past month was calculated on the basis of the reported partner's HIV status, condom use, and viral load measured at the time of the intercourse. Per-coital-act viral load&#x02013;specific probabilities of transmission were derived from a seroconversion study of HIV-discordant couples in eastern and southern Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C19">19</xref>], using the following formula:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="jit470ueq1"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>p</italic> is the per-coital probability of HIV transmission (J. P. Hughes, personal communication).</p><p>Patients with an undetectable viral load were assigned a null transmission risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C2">2</xref>]. We attributed a 78% transmission risk reduction if condom use was reported, and for female participants we considered each last male sex partner as circumcised (96% of men actually are in C&#x000f4;te d'Ivoire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C20">20</xref>]) and thus used a 53% transmission risk reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C19">19</xref>]. Partners with an unknown HIV status were considered as HIV uninfected. For a partner reported as HIV positive, the transmission risk was set to 0.</p><p>We estimated HIV transmission rates at the last episode of sexual intercourse in the past month for both ART strategies by computing mean values of individual transmission risks, expressed as the number of transmissions per 10 000 sexually active individuals. To estimate transmission rates overall rather than among sexually active persons only, we computed an additional estimate that included participants who were sexually inactive in the past month, attributing to them a null individual transmission risk.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Participants included in the Temprano trial between 1 January 2009 and 1 September 2011 were included in this analysis provided they completed the sociobehavioral questionnaire within 9&#x02013;15 months after enrollment in the Temprano trial. Analyses were conducted on the basis of intention to treat. Sexual behaviors of interest were compared between early ART and standard ART strategies, using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests. The protective effect of the early ART strategy on the HIV transmission risk was based on the ratio of transmission rates.</p><p>To assess the robustness of our estimates, we conducted a range of sensitivity analyses, considering (1) only participants with a baseline CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count of &#x0003e; 350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, (2) only those engaged in a cohabiting serodiscordant relationship, (3) a nonnull transmission probability for those having a viral load of &#x0003c; 300 copies/mm<sup>3</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C21">21</xref>], (4) an alternative data set for viral load&#x02013;specific transmissions probabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C22">22</xref>], (5) an HIV-positivity probability of 0.4 for a sex partner with an unknown serostatus, (6) all participants as having had an HIV-negative partner during the last episode of unprotected sexual intercourse.</p><p>All analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). We computed 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for expected transmission rates and the protective effect of early ART, using bootstrapping (10 000 resampling).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Study Population</title><p>Among the 1172 participants included in the Temprano trial between 1 January 2009 and 1 September 2011, 957 (81.7%) were included in the analyses (standard ART group, 467 patients; early ART group, 490 patients).

By extrapolating this monthly number to the whole period (months 0&#x02013;12), we estimated that early ART could prevent 161 infections/10 000 patients (95% CI, 113&#x02013;212) in their first year of treatment (based on estimated incidence rate of 18.7 infections/10 000 persons-years in the early ART group and 179.0 infections/10 000 person-years in the standard ART group).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, which was nested in an ongoing randomized trial of early ART, patients who initiated ART at high CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts and those who delayed ART initiation until WHO criteria were met declared similar sexual behaviors at 12 months. Early ART was estimated to decrease the risk of HIV transmission to partners by 90%. This estimated risk reduction, which accounted for well-identified determinants of HIV transmission, including viral load, sexual partnership, condom use, and circumcision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C19">19</xref>], was mainly attributable to differences in viral loads between patients receiving early versus standard ART. In contrast with previous studies that demonstrated the protective effect of ART among serodiscordant stable couples, these estimates were derived from a diverse population with a wide range of partnerships and HIV statuses of partners. More than half of our patients were not in a cohabiting relationship, and about two-thirds of those who were sexually active reported that their last partner was HIV negative or had an unknown HIV status.</p><p>The first very original finding of this study involves sexual behaviors among patients receiving early ART, which were comparable to those reported by patients receiving standard ART 12 months after inclusion. The sample size was large enough to allow the detection of a 5% difference (from 5% to 10%) between both ART strategies, with a power of 0.95. Overall proportions of sexual activity in the past year (71%) and no use of protection during the last episode of intercourse (25.4%) were consistent with data previously reported in C&#x000f4;te d'Ivoire for patients treated at late stages of HIV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C25">25</xref>]. To our knowledge, no data on sexual behaviors in the context of early ART have been published to date.</p><p>According to a recent review conducted in developing countries, a decrease in unprotected sex was observed in 16 of 17 observational studies among patients on standard initiated treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C11">11</xref>]. Such a decline in unprotected sex associated with ART may be explained by the multiple medical encounters that treated patients have with the care system, which ensures a high level of prevention counseling and psychosocial support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C26">26</xref>]. Routine contact with the healthcare system is often rare for patients who are not eligible for ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C27">27</xref>]. In our study, participants in the early and standard ART groups had a high frequency of contact with medical care, which may explain comparability in self-reported sexual behaviors. Because data reported in the standard ART initiation context show that sexual behavior changes may occur over a long period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C28">28</xref>], sexual behavior changes in relation to early ART initiation deserve to be further assessed over the long term.</p><p>We used 3 different indicators to estimate HIV transmission risk and its reduction. The first indicator was the proportion of last episodes of sexual intercourse exposing the partner to HIV infection, based on the plasma viral load. This proportion was significantly lower among participants receiving early versus standard ART. Proportions of unprotected episodes of intercourse with serodiscordant partners regardless of viral load were not significantly different between both ART strategies. This suggests that the protective effect of early ART versus a standard strategy principally lies on the biological effect of the treatment on viral replication rather than on a combination of biological and behavioral effect, as suggested by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C11">11</xref>].</p><p>Our second estimate of HIV transmission risk was the expected number of transmissions at the last episode of intercourse in the past month, combining sexual behavior (condom use, partner's HIV status, and circumcision), exact viral loads, and HIV-1 transmission probabilities from the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C19">19</xref>]. This method has been recently used and showed consistent results as compared to a seroconversion study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C29">29</xref>]. On the basis of this method, we estimated a protective effect of 90% for early ART. The magnitude of the protective effect we found was remarkably consistent across populations considered in the analysis, changes in our assumptions, and variations in the parameters (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="JIT470TB4">4</xref>), arguing for the robustness of our estimate. Moreover, this protective effect was close to those estimated in the HPTN052 study (96%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C3">3</xref>] and in a systematic review of prospective studies among discordant couples (91%; 95% CI, 79%&#x02013;96%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C30">30</xref>].</p><p>Third, we assessed the protective effect of early ART by computing the number of infections averted yearly for 10 000 persons after 1 year of treatment, which we estimated between 113 and 212. Those results rely on strong assumptions regarding the frequency of sexual intercourse and the stability over time of the ART preventive effect in the first year of treatment. Despite the uncertainty surrounding these assumptions, our results are quite consistent with those from previous studies. The sensitivity analysis we conducted on the subsample of stable serodiscordant couples allowed us to estimate HIV incidence rates, which were in the same range than those reported by the HPTN052 study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C3">3</xref>]. Moreover, a previous model estimated that providing early ART (at CD4+ T-cell counts of 350&#x02013;500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) to serodiscordant couples might be expected to avert 210 infections per 10 000 person-years of ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C31">31</xref>]. Our estimate of 161 infections averted/10 000 is lower, which is consistent with the fact that our study included a broader population than serodiscordant couples, a substantial portion of whom (ie, those who are sexually inactive and/or engaged in seroconcordant partnerships) do not benefit from the preventive effect of ART.</p><p>Our results were obtained in a population with an early HIV diagnosis who were engaged in a 30-month trial. The sex ratio was unbalanced in favor of women, which reflects both the sex-specific prevalence of HIV infection (6.4% and 2.9%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C20">20</xref>]) and delayed diagnosis among men, who have lower opportunities for early diagnoses than women in C&#x000f4;te d'Ivoire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C32">32</xref>]. Even if participants of the present study potentially constitute a compliant population engaged in a trial offering good care conditions, the proportion of viral suppression achievement in participants receiving early ART 12 months after enrollment (83%) was not dramatically higher than that documented in population-based studies throughout sub-Saharan Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C33">33</xref>]. This suggests that our results are likely to be in the range of figures observed more widely in West Africa.</p><p>Our study has some limitations. First, the present behavioral study was nested in a randomized, controlled clinical trial whose primary objective was to measure individual rather than collective benefits and risks of early ART. Thus, before the implementation of the 2012 WHO guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C15">15</xref>], our results were obtained in the absence of specific information about the preventive effect of ART. The current study may therefore only partially address the issue of risk compensation. Further research questioning risk perception in the context of widely available information about the preventive effect of early ART is needed, both among HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected people.</p><p>Second, the results of this study largely rely on self-reported sexual behaviors, which are potentially subject to social desirability bias. Overreport of condom use could lead to an underestimation of the estimated HIV transmission risks. However, since counseling and follow-up were similar between both ART groups, such a bias is unlikely to be differential and, thus, to have affected our estimate of the preventive effect of early ART.</p><p>Third, estimates of HIV transmission risk were based on the characteristics of the last episode of sexual intercourse. This might have biased the analysis if the frequency of sexual intercourse differed between both groups and/or if there were differences between groups in the extent to which the last episode of sexual intercourse reflected overall sexual behaviors. Such differences are unlikely, though, given that both groups were comparable for various indicators, including sexual activity and multiple partnerships.</p><p>Fourth, differences between ART strategies in the proportion of nonresponses to the month 12 questionnaire might have biased estimations of HIV transmission risk. A lower proportion of participants receiving standard versus early ART completed the questionnaire during the considered window period (ie, between months 9 and 15). Patients who completed the questionnaire outside of this period were mostly individuals randomly assigned to the standard ART group who initiated ART during the first 12 months of follow-up, which rescheduled subsequent visits and questionnaire completions from the date of ART initiation. Compared with other patients receiving standard ART, patients who started treatment before the 12-month visit probably had a higher viral load and, therefore, higher infectiousness during their pre-ART period, followed by a lower viral load and infectiousness after initiating ART. When considering the whole period (ie, from months 0&#x02013;12), excluding these patients may have led to limited bias in the estimates of the transmission risk among patients receiving standard ART and of the protective effect of early ART. In addition, missing the 12-month visit during the window period was more frequent among patients in the early ART group (38 vs 17). In 2011, because of the political crisis faced by C&#x000f4;te d'Ivoire, the Temprano staff anticipated violence in Abidjan and predictable disruption of health services by giving in advance a higher stock of drugs to patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C34">34</xref>]. Thus, treated patients might have delayed their 12-month visit without being necessarily out of treatment.</p><p>Expanding ART coverage has resulted in a decreased HIV infection incidence in South Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C35">35</xref>], but other natural experiments showed limited effect on HIV transmission, especially when risk compensation was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C36">36</xref>]. Community trials have started to formally assess the effect of early ART on HIV infection incidence, but their results will not be released for several years. Meanwhile, our results suggest a strong protective effect of early ART on HIV heterosexual transmission, without any detectable effect on sexual behaviors. This effect was estimated in a population that included substantial proportions of persons out of stable partnership or with a seroconcordant partner. This population was thus more similar to the whole HIV-infected population than in previous studies, restricted to stable serodiscordant couples. The WHO has recently recommended early ART initiation for serodiscordant couples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C15">15</xref>]. The social acceptability and equity of prioritizing access to early ART to this population is questionable, though [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C37">37</xref>]. Recent modeling studies on the contribution of HIV transmissions occurring among stable serodiscordant couples to the global sub-Saharan HIV epidemics demonstrated that prevention interventions targeted solely those couples may have a limited public health impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT470C38">38</xref>]. Our results provide evidence for the public health significance of early ART initiation among a wider segment of the HIV-infected population.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>ANRS 12136 TEMPRANO TRIAL GROUP</title><p><italic>Clinical care in Abidjan, C&#x000f4;te d'Ivoire:</italic> Emmanuel Bissagnene, Serge Eholie (principal investigator), Gustave Nzunetu, Cyprien Rabe, and Sidib&#x000e9; Baba (Service des Maladies Infectieuses et Tropicales); Olivier Ba-Gomis, Henri Chenal, Marcelle Daligou, and Denise Hawerlander (Centre Int&#x000e9;gr&#x000e9; de Recherches Biocliniques d'Abidjan); Lambert Dohoun, Seidou Konate, Albert Minga, and Abo Yao (Centre National de Transfusion Sanguine); Constance Kanga, Koul&#x000e9; Serge, Jonas S&#x000e9;ri, Calixte Gu&#x000e9;hi, and Fassiri Demb&#x000e9;l&#x000e9; (Unit&#x000e9; de Soins Ambulatoires et de Conseil); Eug&#x000e8;ne Messou, Amani Anzian, Joachim Gnokoro, and Patrice Gouess&#x000e9; (Centre de Prise en Charge et de Formation); Madeleine Kadio-Morokro, Alain Kouadio, S&#x000e9;na Gountodji, Ediga Y&#x000e9;dj&#x000e9;dji, and Alexis Amian (La pierre angulaire); Emmanuel Kouam&#x000e9;, Dominique Koua, Solange Amon, Laurent Dja-Beugr&#x000e9;, and Amadou Kouam&#x000e9; (H&#x000f4;pital G&#x000e9;n&#x000e9;ral Abobo Nord); Oy&#x000e9;ounl&#x000e9; Maka&#x000ef;la, Mounkaila Oy&#x000e9;bi, Stanislas Sodenougbo, and Nathalie Mbakop (FSU Anonkoua kout&#x000e9;); and Babatund&#x000e9; Natanael, Babatund&#x000e9; Carolle, Gis&#x000e8;le Bl&#x000e9;ou&#x000e9;, and Mireille Tchoutchedjem (Centre de sant&#x000e9; El Rapha). <italic>Biology:</italic> Matthieu Kabran (bacteriologist), Arlette Emieme (monitor), Andr&#x000e9; Inwoley (immunologist), Herv&#x000e9; Menan (parasitologist), Timoth&#x000e9;e Ouassa (bacteriologist), Thomas-d'Aquin Toni (virologist), and Vincent Yapo (virologist; Centre de Diagnostic et de Recherches sur le SIDA, CHU de Treichville, Abidjan, C&#x000f4;te d'Ivoire); and Marie-Laure Chaix (virologist) and Christine Rouzioux (virologist; Service de Virologie, CHU Necker, Paris, France). <italic>Trial coordination team:</italic> Xavier Anglaret (principal investigator), Christine Danel (coordinator), Raoul Moh (coordinator), Romuald Konan (pharmacist), Anani Badj&#x000e9; (monitor), Jean Baptiste N'takp&#x000e9; (monitor), G&#x000e9;rard Menan Kouam&#x000e9; (monitor), and Franck Bohoussou (data manager; Programme PACCI, Abidjan, C&#x000f4;te d'Ivoire); and Delphine Gabillard (statistician) and J&#x000e9;r&#x000f4;me Le Carrou (monitor; Centre Inserm 897, Bordeaux, France). <italic>Trial steering committee:</italic> Jean-Marie Massumbuko, Emmanuel Bissagnene, G&#x000e9;nevi&#x000e8;ve Ch&#x000ea;ne, Kouao Domoua, Mireille Dosso, Pierre-Marie Girard, Vincent Jarlier, Christian Perronne, Christine Rouzioux, Papa Salif Sow, and Virginie Ettiegne-Traor&#x000e9;. <italic>Trial independent data safety monitoring board:</italic> Fran&#x000e7;ois-Xavier Blanc, Dominique Costagliola, Brigitte Autran, Ogobara Doumbo, Sinata Koula-Shiro, Souleymane Mboup, and Yazdan Yazdanpanah. <italic>ANRS representatives:</italic> Jean-Fran&#x000e7;ois Delfraissy, Brigitte Bazin, Claire Rekacewicz, and G&#x000e9;raldine Colin.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Notes</title><p><bold><italic>Acknowledgments.</italic></bold>&#x02003;We thank all patients who participated in this trial; members of the SMIT, CeDReS, CEPREF, USAC, CIRBA, CNTS, La Pierre Angulaire, H&#x000f4;pital G&#x000e9;n&#x000e9;ral Abobo, Formation Sanitaire Anonkoua Kout&#x000e9;, Centre de sant&#x000e9; El Rapha, the Programme PACCI team, and INSERM U897 teams (Abanou Matthieu, Aman Adou,Anasthasie Yapo, Bombo L&#x000e9;ontine, C&#x000e9;lestin N'chot, Christian Kouadio, Djetouan Hugues, Djobi-Djo Edouard, Goly Jocelyn, Kassi Marie-C&#x000e9;cile, Koffi- N'Dri Aholi, Konan Sylvie, Konat&#x000e9; Mamadou, Kouadio Bertin, Kouam&#x000e9; Martin, Kouadio Victoire, Kouakou-Aboua Adrienne, Kouakou Yao, Kouam&#x000e9; Antoine, Kouam&#x000e9; Ferdinand, Kouam&#x000e9; G&#x000e9;rald, Labibi Georgette, Lokou Benjamin, Moh Jules, N'Dri Marie Julie, Nalourgou Tuo, N'Goran Brou, Nogbout Marie-Pascale, Orne-Gliemann Joanna, Kouadio Cheftin, Ouattara Minata, Oupoh Jos&#x000e9;phine, Sidib&#x000e9; Abdelh, Silou&#x000e9; Bertine, Soro Adidiata, Tchehy Amah-C&#x000e9;cile, Yao Emile, and Yao Juliette), for their valuable contributions; Gilead Sciences, for the donation of Truvada; and Merck Sharp &#x00026; Dohme, for the donation of Stocrin.</p><p><bold><italic>Disclaimer.</italic></bold>&#x02003;The sponsor of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.
