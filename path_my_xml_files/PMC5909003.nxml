after 4 weeks of trunk stabilization exercises performed under expiration and inspiration
conditions. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty subjects were assigned randomly to an expiration
group (n=15) or an inspiration group (n=15). The outcomes measured were magnitude of
muscle activation (rectus abdominis, multifidus, internal oblique and external oblique) in
the bridge position and performance on a trunk muscle endurance test. Paired t-tests were
used to assess the statistical significance of the effects of the trunk stabilization
exercise program within each group. [Results] Comparison of the electromyography activity
of the trunk muscles revealed a significant increase in internal oblique activation in the
inspiration group, and a significant increase in multifidus activation in the expiration
group. Assessment of the endurance of the trunk muscles revealed a significant increase in
both groups. [Conclusion] Our results showed that expiration during trunk stabilization
exercises increased the activity of the multifidus muscle, while inspiration enhanced the
activity of the internal oblique muscle. Different types of respiration seem to
differentially affect trunk muscles during trunk stabilization exercises.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Expiration</kwd><kwd>Inspiration</kwd><kwd>Trunk stabilization exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Trunk-stabilizing exercises using a sling are considered useful for improving muscular
strength and endurance around the abdomen and pelvis, and for increasing stability and
maintaining proper posture of the spine and trunk. As well as being beneficial for healthy
people and athletes, these exercises are also used for rehabilitation and to prevent damage
from exercise in patients with lumbar pain<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In previous studies, the efficacy of trunk
stabilization exercises varied according to breathing method. Lee et al. reported that
internal oblique muscle activity was activated more during trunk stabilization exercises
with expiration than with inspiration<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
However, Son&#x02019;s study reported that balance was improved, and back pain reduced, to a greater
degree after trunk stabilization exercises with inspiration than with expiration<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many studies have highlighted the effects
of expiration and inspiration on trunk muscle activity during trunk-stabilizing exercises,
but few have compared differences in trunk muscle activity according to these two breathing
methods. The purpose of this study was to assess the difference in trunk muscle activity
between an expiration group and an inspiration group over a 4-week trunk-stabilizing
exercise program.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>In total, 30 women were recruited and assigned randomly to two groups (expiration group,
n=15, mean age: 19.9 &#x000b1; 0.2&#x02005;years, mean body mass index (BMI): 20.8 &#x000b1; 2.1&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>;
inspiration group, n=15, mean age: 20.9 &#x000b1; 0.2&#x02005;years, mean BMI: 20.9 &#x000b1; 2.8&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>).
Participants with respiratory and neuro-muscular skeletal diseases, or a history of spinal
surgery were excluded. Subjects was provided informed consent according to the principles of
the Declaration of Helsinki. All procedures were reviewed and approved by the ethics
committee of Silla University (1041449-201511-HR-001). To measure activity of the rectus
abdominis (RA), internal oblique (IO), erector spinae (ES), and multifidus (MF), surface
electromyography (EMG) was used (Myotrace 400; Noraxon Inc., Scottsdale, AZ, USA) and an
analog to digital conversion was performed on the data using the MyoResearch XP Master
software (ver. 1.07; Noraxon). The sampling rate was set at 1,000&#x02005;Hz. A band-pass filter of
20&#x02013;450&#x02005;Hz and notch filter of 60&#x02005;Hz were used. To maintain the electrode distance of Ag/AgCl
at 2&#x02005;cm, the poles were attached parallel to the direction of the muscle fibers. For
normalization of the EMG data, maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) was measured
in the muscles in the manual testing position<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The MVIC was detected after 3&#x02005;s of contraction, and then measured
for 5 s. We used the highest 1-s value among three recordings. Participants practiced for
20&#x02005;s to familiarize themselves with the procedure. The expiration group maintained
expiration by relaxing the diaphragm and activating the abdominal muscles during the trunk
stabilization exercise. The inspiration group maintained inspiration by activating the
diaphragm and relaxing the abdominal muscles during the trunk stabilization exercise. The
exercise program consisted of a revised expert&#x02019;s sling exercise<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Participants performed warm-up exercises (lumbar
relaxation, lumbar extensor stretching, and traction), followed by the main exercises (sling
exercise in supine and prone position), and cool-down exercises (lumbar relaxation, lumbar
extensor stretching, and traction). The participants performed the exercises three times per
week (30&#x02005;min per day) for 4 weeks. Muscle activation when in the bridge posture was
assessed, according to EMG measurements of trunk muscle activity changes, before versus
after the trunk stabilization exercise program. The endurance test consisted of a trunk
flexor and extensor endurance test<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
endurance test of trunk flexor was held trunk flexion in 60&#x000b0; in supine position. The
endurance test of trunk extensor was held trunk extension in parallel to table in prone
position. Each test was stopped when the subject gave up. Data were analyzed with SPSS
software (ver. 20.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). To determine changes in %MVIC of trunk
muscle activity and endurance time before versus after the exercise program, paired t-tests
were performed. To compare changes in trunk muscle activity and endurance between the
groups, before versus after the exercise program, independent t-tests were used. Statistical
significance was set at &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Regarding trunk muscle activity before versus after the trunk stabilization exercise

No significant difference was seen in trunk muscle activity or endurance

increased in the inspiration group for the IO, and in the expiration group for the MF.</p><p>In both groups, activity of the deep muscles, i.e., the IO and MF increased, while that of
the superficial muscles, i.e., the RA and ES, decreased (non-significant), greater activity
of these deep muscles will be helpful for patients who have low back pain. O&#x02019;Sullivan et al.
and Hides et al. reported that trunk stabilization exercises activated the MF and decreased
low back pain<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, Kim et al. reported that in their inspiration group,
exercises performed in various positions increased the activation of the ES, had no effect
on the activation of the RA, and increased the activation of the IO relative to a control
group<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, when trunk
muscle activity was measured during exercises done using a Swiss ball in the supine and
prone postures, RA activity showed an up to 30% increase versus that of the other trunk
muscles<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies examined
temporary muscle activity during trunk stabilization exercises, but the exercises involved
control of the breathing<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, when the
trunk stabilization exercise was carried out in the inspiration group, the activity of the
ES decreased (non-significant) and that of the IO increased. Accordingly, trunk
stabilization exercises are considered to be more effective when done with controlled
inspiration rather than with uncontrolled breathing. Additionally, endurance of flexor and
extensor increased after the trunk stabilization exercises. It is thought that this
endurance increase was due to increased activation of the deep muscles (IO and MF).
Trunk-stabilizing exercises have been shown to increase the endurance of the trunk flexors
and extensors, and to improve balance in the standing posture<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, there is a close connection between deep muscle
strengthening and increased trunk endurance. This study was limited by the participants all
being healthy students, making the results difficult to generalize. If participants had a
sign of spinal instability, the purpose of this study was more supported than healthy
participants because the increased muscle activity would contribute in stabilizing the
spine. Also, the 4-week intervention period was relatively short. The transverse abdominis
muscles are the deepest abdomen muscles that affect trunk stabilization, but they could not
be checked for activation in this study due to the limitations of surface EMG. Future
studies should investigate diaphragm movement and activation of the transverse abdominis
after trunk stabilization exercises performed under different breathing conditions. In
conclusion, our trunk stabilization exercises increased deep muscle activity and endurance.
Also, deep muscle activity increased endurance to a greater degree under the inspiration
versus expiration condition. Thus, different types of respiration seem to differentially
affect trunk muscles during trunk stabilization exercises.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>None</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Dannelly</surname><given-names>BD</given-names></name><name><surname>Otey</surname><given-names>SC</given-names></name><name><surname>Croy</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>The effectiveness of traditional and sling exercise
