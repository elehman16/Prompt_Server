An estimated 140 million prescriptions have been issued for moxifloxacin worldwide, and the drug is included as an effective alternative in guidelines and/or recommendations for each of these indications.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]</p><p>The clinical efficacy of moxifloxacin has been unambiguously demonstrated,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and its safety profile has been analyzed periodically on the basis of pre-marketing studies,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] including populations with risk factors,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] such as the elderly[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and those with hepatic or renal insufficiency.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] These data did not show significantly higher toxicity of moxifloxacin compared with commonly used antibiotics if the contraindications and precautions of use mentioned in the Summary of Product Characteristics[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] are taken into account. Post-marketing studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] have confirmed that moxifloxacin is generally well tolerated in medical practice, without new or unanticipated serious adverse events (SAEs) beyond those already established from controlled clinical studies.</p><p>The safety profile of moxifloxacin has nevertheless been questioned for two main reasons. First, a number of initially promising fluoroquinolones have been withdrawn (e.g. temafloxacin, trovafloxaxin, sparfloxacin, and gatifloxacin[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]) or not approved in Europe (e.g. garenoxacin and gemifloxacin), partly because of toxicity concerns,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] creating suspicion about the whole class. Second, the safety profile of fluoroquinolones has been challenged by the regulatory authorities, triggering (i) for all approved drugs in the US, the inclusion of a &#x02018;black box warning&#x02019; for tendinitis;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and (ii) for moxifloxacin, the issue in European countries of &#x02018;Dear Healthcare Provider&#x02019; letters[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] warning about rare but serious side effects related to hepatotoxicity and severe skin reactions, together with a statement by the European Medicines Agency that &#x0201c;due to safety concerns (hepatic, cardiac [in women and elderly patients], and intestinal problems), moxifloxacin should only be used when other antibiotics cannot be used or have stopped working&#x0201d;,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] with corresponding label changes throughout the European Union.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]</p><p>The current paper presents an in-depth analysis of the safety profile of moxifloxacin, based on the manufacturer&#x02019;s clinical trial database comprising all actively controlled phase II&#x02013;IV clinical trials.

All studies used the oral formulation (400 mg tablets), the 400 mg/250 mL solution for infusion formulation, or a sequence of intravenous and oral formulations. Forty-nine oral studies enrolled patients diagnosed with streptococcal pharyngitis (n = 1), ABS (n = 10), AECB (n = 17), CAP (n = 12), uSSSIs (n = 4), uncomplicated PID (uPID; n = 3), or uncomplicated (n = 3) or complicated (n = 1) urinary tract infection (UTI). Some patients could be enrolled in the same study looking at two different indications &#x02013; for example, ABS and AECB, or AECB and CAP. Fifteen intravenous/oral studies enrolled patients with CAP (n = 7), cSSSIs (n = 3), cIAIs (n = 2), nosocomial pneumonia (n = 2), or lung abscess or aspiration pneumonia (n = 1). Four intravenous-only studies enrolled patients with CAP (n = 2), cIAIs (n = 2), or AECB (n = 1; this study also enrolled patients with CAP).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Patients</title><p>The studies were conducted in Europe, the Americas, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia/Pacific region. Safety-valid patients were defined as those randomized within an actively controlled clinical trial, having received at least one dose of the study drug and having had at least one observation after initial drug intake. The following subgroups of patients with pre-existing risk factors were evaluated: elderly (age &#x02265;65 years); diabetes mellitus (blood glucose level &#x0003e;200 mg/dL at baseline or at least one medical history finding coded to a preferred term [PT] with a primary path in the high-level term [HLT] diabetes [including subtypes]); renal impairment (serum creatinine &#x02265;1.5 mg/dL for women and &#x02265;1.8 mg/dL for men, or calculated creatinine clearance &#x02264;89 mL/min and &#x02264;59 mL/min for patients aged &#x0003c;65 and &#x02265;65 years, respectively); hepatic impairment (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] or aspartate aminotransferase [AST] &#x0003e;3 &#x000d7; the upper limit of normal [ULN]; or alkaline phosphatase [ALP] &#x0003e;2 &#x000d7; ULN; or total bilirubin &#x0003e;2 &#x000d7; ULN and ALT or ALP &#x0003e;1 &#x000d7; ULN); cardiac disorders (at least one medical history finding coded to a cardiac PT in the Bayer MedDRA Query [BMQ] history of cardiac disease); and low body mass index (BMI) [&#x0003c;18 kg/m<sup>2</sup>]. Patients with known contraindications, according to what was known or included in the labeling at the time of enrollment, were excluded from entering the study as per the study protocol design. Conversely, no patient entering a study and receiving one or more doses of moxifloxacin or a comparator was excluded from the analysis, even if found later to be among those who should have been prevented from enrollment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Analyses</title><p>All patients valid for the safety analysis from trials with oral, intravenous, or sequential intravenous/oral moxifloxacin and active comparators that were available in the most recent database (data lock point: March 31, 2010) were included in the analysis. The analysis examined all treatment-emergent events (that is, any event occurring after the first dose of medication until the end of follow-up [typically 10&#x02013;27 days following the last dose]). The planned treatment duration as per the protocols varied from 5 to 21 days according to the indication and/or disease severity, except in one study (treatment duration determined by the investigator).</p><p>An overall analysis of safety data was carried out to estimate differences in incidence rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), adverse drug reactions (ADRs), SAEs, serious ADRs (SADRs), premature discontinuations due to AEs, premature discontinuations due to ADRs, AEs with fatal outcome, and ADRs with fatal outcome. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.meddramsso.com/">http://www.meddramsso.com/</ext-link> [version 13.0]) was used for coding the events. The assessment of causality and seriousness of AEs was made by the study investigators. The incidence rates for events are presented overall, by system organ class (SOC), or by PT within SOC. The analysis was extended by looking specifically for rare events known to be associated with the use of fluoroquinolones, as defined by Standard MedDRA Queries (SMQs)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] and customized BMQs developed by medical and coding experts (see table SDC-I in the Supplemental Digital Content [SDC]; available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://links.adisonline.com/DRZ/A6">http://links.adisonline.com/DRZ/A6</ext-link>). Descriptive statistical methods were used to analyze the demographic and safety data.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] Incidence rates were calculated as crude rates. To compare the risk of a specific AE for moxifloxacin relative to a comparator, relative risk estimates (with corresponding 95% confidence intervals) were calculated by a Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel analysis stratified by study,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] utilizing a constant continuity correction term of 0.1 in case of zero cells. Because of the large number of comparisons (several outcome variables, various study pools, and a large number of subgroups), no detailed assessment or exploration of heterogeneity of relative risks across studies is provided. The analyses presented are exploratory in nature; confirmatory statistics were not carried out.</p><p>For the present reporting, filters were applied to highlight incidence rates and numerical differences between groups. These are explicitly stated in the titles and/or captions of each table or figure. Although somewhat arbitrary, these filters were always set at a low value and were conservative to avoid missing potentially important signals. Highlighted differences were interpreted on the basis of the actual number of patients involved in the comparison. Unless stated otherwise, data are presented overall for the double-blind and the open-label studies, but separate reporting is available in the SDC.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Population and Comparator Antibiotics</title><p><xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="fig">Table I</xref> shows the number of patients valid for the safety analysis who received moxifloxacin (n = 14 981) or comparator treatment (n = 15 023) by the oral, intravenous, or intravenous/oral routes, stratified by study design (double blind or open label). Approximately 75% of patients were enrolled in the double-blind studies.

In the double-blind intravenous population, increased lipase (moxifloxacin 14 [2.4%] versus comparator 18 [3.2%]) and increased GGT (moxifloxacin 13 [2.2%] versus comparator 18 [3.2%]) were the most common ADRs, and only nausea showed a difference in disfavor of moxifloxacin versus comparator (12 [2.0%] versus 3 [0.5%], respectively) according to the double filter. In the open-label oral studies, nausea (moxifloxacin 77 [4.3%] versus comparator 44 [2.2%]) and diarrhea (moxifloxacin 54 [3.0%] versus comparator 141 [6.9%]) were again the most common ADRs across therapy arms, followed by dizziness (moxifloxacin 30 [1.7%] versus comparator 4 [0.2%]), upper abdominal pain (moxifloxacin 23 [1.3%] versus comparator 20 [1.0%]), and vomiting (moxifloxacin 20 [1.1%] versus comparator 14 [0.7%]), all experienced by &#x0003e;1% of patients in the moxifloxacin arm. Application of the double filter to the open-label oral population showed that diarrhea was more frequent with comparators (moxifloxacin 54 [3.0%] versus comparator 141 [6.9%]), whereas dizziness (moxifloxacin 30 [1.7%] versus comparator 4 [0.2%]), rash (moxifloxacin 16 [0.9%] versus comparator 8 [0.4%]), dysgeusia (moxifloxacin 13 [0.7%] versus comparator 2 [&#x0003c;0.1%]), and somnolence (moxifloxacin 10 [0.6%] versus comparator 2 [&#x0003c;0.1%]) were more frequent with moxifloxacin. In the open-label intravenous/oral population, diarrhea was the most common ADR for both moxifloxacin and comparator (61 [4.0%] and 60 [3.8%], respectively).

Such data are usually communicated to regulatory authorities only (as part of registration applications, Periodic Safety Update Reports, and Risk Management Plans) and remain, therefore, largely unknown to the clinician. The benefit of using pooled randomized active-controlled clinical trial data, as has been done here, is that risks associated with the study drug can be directly compared with those of clinically valid comparators. This approach also allows estimation of the incidence of relatively rare effects with a fair degree of certainty. Since the data are from randomized studies, patients should be equally balanced with respect to known as well as unknown factors associated with the outcome variables, making comparisons between treatment groups as fair as possible.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]</p><p>A first key observation is that moxifloxacin does not show a markedly different safety profile compared with comparator therapies. The filters used highlight situations where moxifloxacin caused more untoward effects than the comparator, but either the actual numbers of affected patients were close to those seen with the comparator or the differences were small. For ADRs, there were actually several situations where the comparator showed more untoward effects, especially in the double-blind studies. In the open-label studies, most moxifloxacin ADRs concerned nervous system disorders that are listed in the labeling, which may lead to over-reporting. Concentrating on SADRs, differences in the open-label studies mainly concerned gastrointestinal effects and the need for biological investigations. Here, also, the moxifloxacin labeling lists these effects; no difference in SADRs was seen between moxifloxacin and comparator when considering the double-blind studies. A higher incidence of AEs was also seen in patients receiving the intravenous formulation in double-blind studies. However, this was not seen for ADRs (except for nausea). The other global indicators of toxicity &#x02013; ADRs, treatment discontinuation due to ADRs, or ADRs with fatal outcome &#x02013; showed no clinically meaningful difference in frequency between moxifloxacin and comparator.</p><p>The second key observation is that the incidence of ADRs across the treatment groups was low. This may be explained by at least two factors &#x02013; namely (i) patients with known contraindications were systematically excluded from participation in the studies; and (ii) all patients were closely monitored throughout the observation period, which may have prevented AEs developing into recognizable ADRs. While this could suggest that the patients analyzed do not correspond to those seen in routine clinical practice, excluding patients on the basis of contraindications and following them for occurrence of side effects should be the rule in actual prescribing situations. Excluding patients with risk factors that commonly occur alongside the primary pathology (e.g. CAP, cSSSI) but are not clear contraindications could confound results of large retrospective analyses such as that conducted in the current study. Yet, patients with risk factors were actually included in the studies, consistent with trials conducted during the whole phase II&#x02013;IV development program. The impact of close monitoring of patients considered to be at high risk did not introduce bias to the reporting, since in none of these subgroups was early drug discontinuation reported more frequently (an increased frequency would, indeed, have prompted the investigators&#x02019; intervention to address the corresponding safety concern and to discontinue therapy). Thus, in the context of clinical trials involving about 15 000 patients treated with moxifloxacin, no clear differentiation could be made with respect to tolerance versus the comparators used, either as a group or individually. As all of the comparators were accepted standards of care at the time at which each study was designed, it is reasonable to consider that moxifloxacin has a safety profile that is comparable to that of the comparators.</p><p>The labeling of fluoroquinolones, and of moxifloxacin in particular, includes multiple side effects (e.g. tendon, cardiac, CNS, cutaneous, and hepatic effects, and <italic>C. difficile</italic> infections) that were not seen in substantial frequencies in the current analysis, despite careful investigation. When detected, the incidence of cardiac and hepatic AEs was slightly higher in patients receiving moxifloxacin treatment than in those receiving comparator treatment, but this related only to &#x02018;hepatic function abnormal&#x02019; in oral and &#x02018;cardiac arrest&#x02019; in intravenous studies, respectively. These events were no different in frequency when examining ADRs. The incidences of SADRs related to CNS, cutaneous, cardiac, or hepatic toxicity were similar in moxifloxacin- and comparator-treated patients. Although it has been suggested that patients with pre-existing risk factors or co-morbidities may be at particular risk of experiencing an AE, our data did not reveal any clinically relevant differences compared with the comparators in this context. This holds true not only for comparisons with other fluoroquinolones, but also for comparisons with other antibiotic classes.</p><p>All but one of the studies used in the present analysis had the evaluation of the clinical efficacy of moxifloxacin in the target indications as a primary goal, and the majority of the studies have been published in peer-reviewed journals (see references[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] for recent review papers). Most studies concluded that moxifloxacin was clinically as effective as the comparators or superior to them, which implies that moxifloxacin was not underdosed (all patients received the standard registered dose that has proven to be efficacious in all registered indications to date). This contrasts with some of the comparators (including those proposed as first-line therapies in applicable guidelines), for which higher dosages than those used in the studies pooled for the current analysis are now proposed. For &#x003b2;-lactams[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>] and levofloxacin,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>] this reflects the progressive decrease in bacterial susceptibility over time and the corresponding attempts by clinicians to maintain sufficient treatment efficacy based on pharmacokinetic/dynamic principles and to avoid failures[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] and/or emergence of resistance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]</p><p>As with all meta-analyses, the present study and its conclusions have several limitations. Although we looked at specific risks, we did not reanalyze the original investigators&#x02019; statements or medical assessment of the corresponding cases, nor made any attempt at further adjudication of specific events. No exploration of heterogeneity of results across studies was done, because of the large number of comparisons. Lastly, although a large number of patients were included in the analysis, it may not be sufficient for detecting very rare side effects. These are usually captured from post-marketing spontaneous reports and larger non-interventional studies, but such reports are subject to other limitations relating to the quality of reporting, difficulties in ensuring unbiased data collection, and lack of detailed information on the patient characteristics. Moreover, while the population at risk is known for non-interventional studies, the actual number of exposed persons is difficult to determine for spontaneous reports. Thus, other approaches need to be followed to further define the safety profile of drugs when they are administered in a real-life setting. This has already been carried out for hepatotoxicity using a registry approach to compare telithromycin and several fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] (that study did not reveal significant differences between moxifloxacin and the other fluoroquinolones marketed at that time in this context). It is important to stress that such studies should be applied to comparators as well, in order to correctly define their true safety profile. Centralization and cross-checking of product safety update reports and their publication by independent bodies would also be of significant interest. In the meantime, clinicians will need to rely on analyses such as those presented here for making informed choices on treatment options.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Bayer Pharma AG provided all authors with free access to the moxifloxacin clinical database.
