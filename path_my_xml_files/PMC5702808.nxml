balance, mobility and perceived benefits of rheumatoid arthritis patients (RA) with pain
and foot deformities. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty patients with RA pain and foot
deformity were allocated into two groups: G1: individual exercise program and G2: group
exercise program. The variables analyzed were Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for pain, Berg
Balance Scale (BBS) for balance, Timed Up &#x00026; Go Test (TUG) and Functional Reach (FR)
for mobility, and Foot Health Status Questionnaire (FHSQ-Br) for perceived benefits. Both
exercise programs consisted of functional rehabilitation exercises and self-care guidance
aimed at reducing pain and improving balance and mobility. Intragroup comparisons of
variables between A1 (pre-intervention) and A2 (post-intervention) were performed.
[Results] Patients in both groups were similar in A1 (pre-intervention) in all the
variables analyzed. Comparison between A1 and A2 for each variable showed improvement for
G1 in the NRS, BBS, FR, TUG and in four out of ten domains of FHSQ-Br. G2 showed
improvement in the NRS, BBS and eight out of ten domains of FHSQ-Br. [Conclusion] Both
individual and group programs revealed benefits for patients with RA, however, group
exercise programs showed better perception of benefits.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Exercise therapy</kwd><kwd>Mobility limitation</kwd><kwd>Rheumatoid arthritis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common systemic disease in which foot involvement has been
largely damaged. Synovial hypertrophy and capsular tension generated by hyperplasia,
ligamentous laxity, muscular imbalance and ultimately joint subluxation and dislocation all
play a role in the development of foot deformities in RA. Furthermore, inflammation causes
destruction in the cartilage and pericapsular structures. Due to these changes, the loading
on joints causes different deformities and constitutes a severe disability in the patient&#x02019;s
mobility and functional independence.</p><p>A functional foot must reveal musculoskeletal integrity such as joint alignment and range
of motion, mobility and muscular strength<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Healthy feet are also essential for posture and balance control, as
well as effective propulsion during gait and mobility<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many reports state that
impairment of foot somatosensory information leads to balance instability and produces a
severe negative impact on mobility and in activities of daily living<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Plantar
sensitivity is decreased in patients with RA, reinforcing that RA patients show deficits in
balance and functional activities as a result of alterations of foot functioning<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Despite the significant importance of pharmaceutical intervention, physiotherapy and
training exercises are also meaningful to patients with RA<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, RA patients tend
to avoid physical activity due to their fear of overloading or pain exacerbations<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. There is a need for interventions that support RA patients in
overcoming barriers of pain and foot deformities.</p><p>In our study, we elaborated two programs: one for individual exercise and one for group
exercise. The programs take into consideration that participants are chronic patients with
mobility limitations and foot pain, who rely on public healthcare and who would benefit from
fast and effective programs. Both programs will provide similar exercises and guidelines for
self-care.</p><p>Our objective is to verify the effects of individual and group exercise programs on pain,
balance, mobility and perceived benefits of rheumatoid arthritis patients with pain and foot
deformities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study was conducted in the Divis&#x000e3;o de Fisioterapia do Hospital das C&#x000ed;nicas da Faculdade
de Medicina da Universidade de S&#x000e3;o Paulo. Approval was obtained from Local Ethics Committees
(CAPPESq N&#x000ba; 276/06). Patients were informed about the study, and their written informed
consent was obtained.</p><p>Participants who were admitted in this study were diagnosed with RA, complaining of pain
and foot deformity, with more than five years of disease and classification I&#x02013;III of global
functional status in RA (American Rheumatism Association 1991 revised criteria for RA).
Subjects were excluded if they had a neurological or respiratory pathology, sensorial
systems diseases, previous surgery in lower limbs or trunk, dizziness, cognitive impairments
or other musculoskeletal disorder associated with RA. During the period of the study,
prescription medication could not be changed. If changes in medication were needed, the
participant continued the treatment, however, the patient would be excluded from the
study.</p><p>From the waiting list of RA patients referred to the Physiotherapy Service of the hospital,
the secretary of the service allocated patients into groups G1 and G2 sequentially.</p><p>The study was outlined as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Study outline diagram</p><p>Group 1: Individual exercise program. Group 2: Group exercise program. A1:
Pre-intervention, A2: Post-intervention, 30 days after A1.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-29-1893-g001"/></fig>.</p><p>All measurements were carried out by trained examiners. Measurements of all the variables
were performed for both groups in the pre-intervention period (A1) and post-intervention
period (A2) so that the effect of the treatment could be verified.</p><p>The Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) was applied to pain. Patients were asked about the
intensity of foot pain in the last 24 hours on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst
pain).</p><p>The Berg Balance Scale (BBS)<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> was used
for balance. BBS was developed to measure balance among older people with impairment in
balance function, and it was translated and validated for our language and country. It uses
14 items (graded 0&#x02013;4), and the maximum score is 56 points, where the higher scores denote
better balance performance.</p><p>Mobility was measured with two tests: (i) Functional Reach (FR)<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. FR has been proposed as a clinical measure of dynamic
mobility; it is the measurement of the maximum distance of the outstretched arm at shoulder
height that one can reach without moving his/her feet. (ii) Timed Up &#x00026; Go Test
(TUG)<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The test begins with the
patient sitting in a chair, then standing up, walking three meters, turning around, walking
back, and ending when the patient sits down again. The test is timed in seconds, while the
patient performs the test from the beginning to the end. The time taken to complete the task
is strongly correlated to level of mobility.</p><p>For self-perception of benefits, the questionnaire Foot Health Status Questionnaire
(FHSQ-Br) was applied<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The FHSQ-Br is a
validated tool that measures the level of foot health status in relation to factors
regarding the quality of life and lifestyle. It has been used to investigate the outcome of
foot surgery and foot interventions. After patients completed the questionnaire, the scores
were obtained on a scale from 0 (poorest health) to 100 (best possible health).</p><p>For the applied interventions, exercise programs addressing G1 and G2 were composed of
functional rehabilitation exercises and self-care information. Foot exercises emphasized
alignment, joint mobility and muscular synergy. Balance training was carried out with trunk
control, and mobility in activities of daily living was included. Both programs were applied
in two weekly sessions of 60 minutes each, over four weeks. The programs were composed of
Part A: foot self-care, Part B: foot training, Part C: balance training and Part D: mobility
training. The program was delivered on an individualized basis for G1 and in groups for G2.
For both groups, the sessions comprised exercises of Part A to Part D with progressive
difficulty throughout the treatment.</p><p>In G1, the emphasis and progression of the exercises were applied according to the
patient&#x02019;s performance. The patient was assisted individually under direct supervision of the
physiotherapist.</p><p>In G2, patients received practical training for exercises and orientation on how to perform
them correctly. During the treatment, patients received a handout listing the exercises and
orientations, developed especially to be performed in a home setting. The exercises took
into consideration an easy way of learning and accomplishing the tasks, in addition to
safety during execution so as not to put the patient at excessive risk of pain, falls or
articular overload.</p><p>The programs are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Individual and group exercise program of functional rehabilitation exercises and

as rehabilitation models. Our study addressed exercise programs and orientation of foot self
care and progressive exercise to improve balance and mobility, which was delivered in group
or individualized; exercises programs was planned to be also executed during usual daily
movements for example, going up and down the stairs, sitting down and getting up and
housekeeping activities. Considering physical limitations of this chronic condition the
possibility to practice the exercises in daily movements may be strongly beneficial to RA
patients.</p><p>This study showed improvements in both groups in regards to pain, balance, mobility and
perceived benefits in patients with RA. Individual exercise programs applied to G1 patients
led to significant improvement in the variables related to pain (NRS), balance (BBS),
functional mobility (TUG) and in four out of ten FHSQ-Br domains. Group exercise programs
applied to G2 patients led to significant improvement in the variables related to pain
(NRS), balance (BBS) and in eight out ten FHSQ-Br domains.</p><p>Patients from G1 received similar treatment to those in G2, however, the progression was
applied according to the patient&#x02019;s performance, always under direct and individual
supervision of the physiotherapist. Many researchers believe that a program of balance and
mobility needs to be individually tailored because older people vary considerably in their
physical capacity and health in response to exercise. These authors suggest a list of
strategies to improve balance that can be integrated into the participant&#x02019;s everyday
activities<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In G2, some factors can improve perceived benefits, better perception and acknowledged
improvement. Activities carried out in groups allow higher socialization, entertainment and
contact with people who suffer from the same limitations caused by RA, thus improving
motivation towards exercise practices<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The effectiveness of individual and group exercise therapy for patients with knee or hip
osteoarthritis were shown to be beneficial<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, corroborating with our findings that there is no evidence of the
superiority of one modality (individual or group) over the other. Our study also revealed
that both programs are beneficial to RA patients.</p><p>Another important aspect to consider is that our RA patients, who rely on public
healthcare, often report pain, physical limitation, and financial and transportation burdens
to reach rehabilitation centers. With regard to that, illustrative handouts, including
orientations and a few sessions of physiotherapy, play an important role and can potentially
help to decrease trips to the hospital, to remember medical recommendations and to improve
functional activities<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>About the exercise programs applied in G1 and G2, we believe that interventions for
mobilizing toes and feet articulations were crucial for treating issues of balance,
especially functional mobility. The movements of segments were transferred to functional
movements, such as sitting and getting up, and going up and down the stairs, observed and
oriented to be performed with body alignment and in the correct movement plane and axis.</p><p>In order to maintain feet articulation intact and performing its functions, daily
prevention and feet care are necessary<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
This information has been confirmed through the improvements reported in our study. A manual
therapy is a technique that helps to restore proper functions and movements<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study has some limitations. Considering the chronic conditions and functional
limitations of the patients, these programs can assist the physiotherapist in treatment of
RA patients, however, it is difficult to define the moment in which new motor acquisitions
were already assimilated and learned by patients. Follow-up of this study is necessary in
order to assess the effectiveness of the programs following the end of the intervention.
Finally, our sample was not large enough and it is possible that some differences are
beneath the analysis performed.</p><p>Considering the chronic conditions and functional limitations of the patients, these
programs can assist the physiotherapist in treatment of RA patients, however, it is
difficult to define the moment in which new motor acquisitions were already assimilated and
learned by patients. Follow-up of this study is necessary in order to assess the
effectiveness of the programs following the end of the intervention.</p><p>Exercise programs delivered on an individual basis or in groups are beneficial and can be
used in rehabilitation of patients with RA. Although both groups presented objective
improvements, patients treated in groups showed better perception of the benefits.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We gratefully acknowledge the FAPESP: Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de S&#x000e3;o
