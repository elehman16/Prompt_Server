Patients were enrolled between 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after transplantation and were initiated on TAC + inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor (mycophenolate mofetil [MMF] or mycophenolate sodium [MPS]) &#x000b1; corticosteroids within 30 days of transplantation. Between 90 and 150 days after renal transplantation, patients were randomized (1:1) to transition from TAC to SRL or continue TAC-based therapy for 19 to 21 months. The study was conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, was approved by independent ethics committees at participating centers, and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00895583).</p><p>Eligible patients aged 18 years or older were receiving a primary renal allograft from a living or deceased donor. Patients were excluded if they had multiple organ transplants, active infection, human immunodeficiency virus, or history of malignancy within the previous 3 years (other than basal or squamous cell carcinoma), or were pregnant, breast-feeding, or willing to become pregnant. Before enrollment, patients provided written informed consent.</p><p>At 90 to 150 days posttransplantation, randomization was completed using computer-generated sequences. Select information, including investigator's site number, patient number, and patient&#x02019;s date of birth, were entered by each site into the Clinical Operations Randomization Environment (CORE) II system, which provided a patient randomization number and treatment assignment. Enrolled patients with eGFR less than 40 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> or spot urine protein to creatinine ratio (Up/c) 0.5 or greater within 2 weeks before randomization, Banff grade 2 or higher acute T cell&#x02013;mediated or any acute antibody-mediated rejection any time posttransplantation, more than 1 episode of any acute rejection (biopsy-confirmed or presumed), or any acute rejection within 30 days before randomization could not be randomized. Patients were also excluded from randomization if they had significant laboratory abnormalities in hematologic or metabolic parameters (hematologic: total white blood cell count, &#x0003c;2000/mm<sup>3</sup>; absolute neutrophil count, &#x0003c;1000/mm<sup>3</sup>; or platelet count, &#x0003c;100&#x02009;000/mm<sup>3</sup>; metabolic: fasting triglycerides, &#x0003e;400 mg/dL [&#x0003e;4.5 mmol/L] or fasting total cholesterol, &#x0003e;300 mg/dL [&#x0003e;7.8 mmol/L], regardless of whether or not they were on lipid-lowering therapy).</p><p>Treatment with TAC and an IMPDH inhibitor (MMF or MPS) was initiated within 30 days of transplantation and dosed per the center's standard of care. For management of AEs, temporary discontinuation of TAC and/or IMPDH inhibitor was permitted if they were both reinitiated at least 30 days prerandomization. Inosine-5&#x02032;-monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor was maintained in both treatment groups postrandomization, dose adjustments were permitted. Therapeutic drug monitoring was not performed for IMPDH inhibitors. For patients continuing on TAC, there was no protocol-mandated range for TAC trough concentrations to allow the investigator to maintain patients according to their standard of care. For patients transitioning to SRL from TAC, SRL was initiated within 2 days postrandomization, and dosed per the center's standard of care. Tacrolimus was discontinued within 4 weeks of SRL initiation by an abrupt or a gradual method, per each center's documented standard of care. Target SRL trough levels were 7 to 15 ng/mL through 12 months posttransplantation and 5 to 15 ng/mL thereafter. Corticosteroids were permitted, but not required, to be administered as part of immunosuppression and were dosed per the center's standard of care. Withdrawal of corticosteroid therapy had to be completed at least 30 days before randomization; otherwise, stable treatment (minimum dose equivalent to prednisolone 2.5 mg/d) was maintained throughout the study. Antibody induction was also permitted per the center's standard of care. Although not required in all patients, antibody induction with rabbit antithymocyte globulin or alemtuzumab was required for patients with planned corticosteroid withdrawal. Discontinuation from either SRL or TAC after rejection was performed at the discretion of the investigator.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><p>The primary end point was percentage of patients with 5 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> or greater improvement in eGFR from randomization to 24 months posttransplantation for the on-therapy population.

Posttransplantation diabetes mellitus was defined as any patient without preexisting diabetes who had any of the following after randomization: 30 days or longer of continual (defined &#x0003c;5-day gap between the same medication use) or at least 25 days of nonstop [no gaps] use of any diabetes treatment, fasting glucose &#x02265;126 mg/dL, or nonfasting glucose &#x02265;200 mg/dL. Preexisting diabetes was defined as known medical history of diabetes at transplantation, 30 days or longer of continual use of any diabetes treatment, fasting glucose &#x02265;126 mg/dL, or nonfasting glucose &#x02265;200 mg/dL. All patients underwent a single fasting glucose test in the 2 weeks before randomization.</p><p>Changes in glycemic parameters from baseline (randomization) were assessed through 24 months. Parameters included fasting glucose levels, hemoglobin A1c, fasting insulin concentration, homeostasis model assessment &#x003b2;-cell function, homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance, weight, body mass index, and waist circumference. Glycemic parameters were not assessed if the patient discontinued treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>The on-therapy population comprised all randomized patients, who remained on assigned therapy until they discontinued from assigned therapy, and varied depending on the analysis time point used. For the primary end point analysis, the on-therapy population included all randomized patients who remained on study therapy through 24 months posttransplantation. Every effort was made to complete 24 months of follow-up posttransplantation in patients who discontinued from assigned treatment early (&#x0201c;off-therapy&#x0201d; patients). The intent-to-treat (ITT) population comprised all patients who took at least 1 dose of assigned therapy (TAC or SRL).</p><p>Efficacy end points were performed on the on-therapy and ITT populations; safety was assessed for the ITT population. Efficacy and safety outcomes were compared between groups using analysis of covariance, with treatment as a factor and baseline as a covariate, for continual variables, or Fisher exact test for categoric variables. For change of Up/c from baseline, log-transformation was applied before the analysis of covariance to obtain normally distributed data. Cumulative steroid dose from transplantation to 2 years posttransplantation was compared between groups using Wilcoxon rank-sum test. <italic>P</italic> values (2-sided) less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. For the ITT analysis of GFR, data collected on-therapy or off-therapy were included. Missing GFR was imputed as follows: (1) GFR = 0 after graft loss and (2) last observed value prior to missing carried forward for death (with functioning graft), early termination, or skipped assessment.</p><p>Assuming the percentage of patients with &#x02265;5 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> improvement in eGFR 24 months posttransplantation was 45% in the SRL group and 25% in the TAC group, 256 patients had to be randomized (1:1) to achieve 80% power to detect the difference (2-sided, &#x003b1; = 0.05), with an estimated 30% dropout rate.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Of the 541 patients screened, 256 were randomized, 254 were evaluable for safety (ITT population), and 195 (SRL, n = 86; TAC, n = 109) were evaluable for the primary efficacy analysis (on-therapy population) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

None of the patients with prerandomization acute rejection in either the SRL (n = 11) or TAC (n = 2) group developed BCAR postrandomization. Four patients treated with SRL died due to metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, sudden cardiac death (off-therapy), metastatic uterine cancer, and unknown cause. One patient treated with TAC died due to metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. The fatal cases of squamous cell carcinoma in both groups were not skin cancers (primary cancer site unknown).

In the SRL group, the greatest mean increase in eGFR from baseline was seen at 6 months postrandomization, and the difference versus the TAC group at this time point was significant (2.7 vs 0 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>; <italic>P</italic> = 0.019). Thereafter, the between-group difference diminished.</p><p>The study design was based on historical values for CNI-to-SRL conversion in patients with baseline eGFR greater than 40 mL/min and assumed that, at 24 months, 45% of SRL-treated patients and 25% treated with TAC would have eGFR improvement of 5 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> or greater from baseline, considered the lowest interval for clinically significant improvement.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> However, the primary end point was achieved by a lower percentage of patients than expected in the SRL group (34%) and by a much higher percentage than expected in the TAC group (42%). The reason that fewer than expected SRL-treated patients experienced a sustained improvement in eGFR at 24 months is unknown; however, it is possible that this was influenced by the disproportionate number of SRL patients who experienced rejection during the screening period. Additionally, it is unclear why so many patients who continued on TAC experienced improvement in renal function through 24 months after transplantation. One possibility is that, by excluding patients with eGFR less than 40 mL/min from randomization at 3 to 5 months posttransplantation, the study population was enriched for patients with a lower risk of developing clinically significant CNI-induced nephrotoxicity during the 24-month follow-up.</p><p>From randomization through 24 months posttransplantation, 11 patients (8.4%) in the SRL group and 2 (1.6%) in the TAC group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.020) experienced BCAR. Most rejections in the SRL group occurred within the first 12 months posttransplantation. This is not unexpected given that the risk of rejection in these patients may be higher due to the conversion from one immunosuppressive medication to another. The rate of graft loss, including death, was not significantly different between the groups. Increased incidence of rejection has been observed in other studies of mTOR inhibitors with similar designs.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>Several study limitations deserve mention, including the open-label design. Patients converted to SRL had more study visits during the first month postrandomization, which may have contributed to the increased incidence of AEs reported in this group. Further, a lack of prospective collection of information on risk factors present in this study complicates interpretation of the results. Clinical risk factors for CNI nephrotoxicity include older kidney age, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and genetic polymorphisms in <italic>CYP3A5</italic> and other genes.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Another major limitation of the study is the lack of histologic analysis; biopsies were not required by protocol before conversion or at 24 months and were instead performed at the investigator's discretion. Thus, it is possible that the occurrence of BCAR at 24 months was underestimated in our study, or that patients who experienced postrandomization BCAR may have had subclinical rejection prior to conversion. The presence of donor-specific antibodies may also have influenced renal function outcomes.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> However, development of donor-specific antibodies was not assessed as this laboratory test was not commonly performed at all centers at the time of this study; thus, their impact on risk of rejection in this study remains unknown. Lastly, caution should be taken in extrapolating these results to other populations, especially those at higher immunologic risk.</p><p>Despite these limitations, the findings are in agreement with results from other early conversion studies involving TAC-to-SRL transition. In the Spare-the-Nephron trial, TAC was the CNI used in 80% of patients, and the mean time from transplant to randomization was 113 days.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> After 12 months, the mean change from baseline in measured GFR was greater in patients who switched to SRL, but the change was not different at 24 months. Another recent study examined changes in renal function when patients were switched from TAC to SRL 3 months after renal transplantation.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> These patients were not allowed to undergo conversion to SRL if they had eGFR less than 40 mL, protein-to-creatinine ratio of 0.5 or greater, previous acute rejection Banff IIA or higher or acute rejection within the last 4 weeks, or any wound healing event. At 24 months, no differences were seen in renal function (ie, percent change in eGFR from baseline) or in the severity of chronic sclerosing lesions scores in biopsies. Collectively, these findings differ from the significant improvements in renal function seen in studies of early conversion from CsA to an mTOR inhibitor compared with continued CsA.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Because TAC is associated with better renal function than CsA,<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> differences in eGFR after conversion may be less evident.</p><p>The pattern of TEAEs reported by patients who transitioned to SRL was consistent with the known safety profile of SRL, including dyslipidemia and proteinuria.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Discontinuation from assigned therapy because of AEs was significantly greater in the SRL group (21 %) compared with the TAC group (3%; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), and rejection or suspected rejection was the most common TEAE leading to discontinuation in the SRL treatment arm. As seen in other studies, conversion to SRL was associated with fewer cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin compared with TAC continuation.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> An unexpected safety finding was the number of patients who developed PTDM after transitioning to SRL. However, most patients with PTDM, as defined in this study, did not require treatment with antidiabetes agents. The definition did not consider hemoglobin A1c, a more accurate test in diagnosing diabetes, nor the patients who were prediabetic before randomization. Because the highest incidence was close to randomization, the results are likely to have been different if the definition was instead based on &#x0201c;need for anti-diabetes treatment.&#x0201d; Although PTDM is a well-known adverse effect of CNIs in kidney transplant recipients,<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> the mechanism for the development of PTDM that may occur with the transition from TAC to SRL is unknown. It is possible that undergoing a major change in immunosuppressive therapy may affect glucose metabolism or that the greater cumulative dose of corticosteroids in the SRL group versus the TAC group (5257.5 mg vs 4667.5 mg, respectively) may have contributed to the increased incidence of PTDM.</p><p>Although a therapeutic strategy of early conversion from TAC to SRL maintenance did not improve renal function, there may be some patients who do receive benefit; the challenge is in identifying these patients. Although not proven in this study, others have shown that early conversion to SRL-based immunosuppression may be an appropriate CNI-free strategy for patients with a low immunologic risk, after careful screening at the time of conversion.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>-<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Our findings suggest that measurement of eGFR around 3 months after transplantation is not sufficient to assess risk even in this low-risk population. More stringent strategies, such as biopsies to assess the rate of prior subclinical acute rejections or the presence of anti-HLA donor-specific antibodies, might better assess the risk of nephropathy. The long-term incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin is significantly greater with TAC, which is an important consideration for some patients.</p><p>In conclusion, renal function improvement at 24 months was similar when comparing patients after a planned TAC to SRL transition 3 to 5 months after kidney transplantation with those remaining on TAC. Sirolimus was associated with higher rates of TEAEs, discontinuations attributable to TEAEs, PTDM, and BCAR. Tacrolimus was associated with a higher rate of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The following lead investigators also participated in this study:</p><p>Roberto Gedaly, Lexington, KY; Didier Mandelbrot, Boston, MA; Maria Del Carmen Rial, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Wai Lim, Nedlands, Australia; Bruce Pussell, Sydney, Australia; Beje Thomas, Charleston, SC; Alexander Wiseman Jr, Denver, CO; Mohamed El-Ghoroury, Detroit, MI; George Francos, Philadelphia, PA; Joshua Wolf, Atlanta, GA; Joshua Augustine, Cleveland, OH; Debra Sudan, Durham, NC; Mabel Bodel, Rochester, NY; Qing Ren, Richmond, VA; John Vella, Portland, ME; David Cohen, New York, NY; Kenneth Brayman, Charlottesville, VA; Lorenzo Gallon, Chicago, IL; Edwin Fuller, Chapel Hill, NC; Christopher Marsh, La Jolla, CA; Douglas Norman, Portland, OR; Vanji Karthikeyan, Detroit, MI; Gautham Mogilishetty, Cincinnati, OH; Richard Knight, Houston, TX; Jose Maria Campistol Plana, Barcelona, Spain; Jose Maria Grinyo Boira, Barcelona, Spain; Jose Maria Morales Cerdan, Madrid, Spain; Valter Duro Garcia, Porto Alegre, Brazil; Irene de Lourdes Noronha, Sao Paulo, Brazil; Giacomo Colussi, Milano, Italy; Antonio Secchi, Milano, Italy; Jaime Sanchez Plumed, Valencia, Spain; Juan Carlos Ruiz San Millan, Santander, Spain; Klemens Budde, Berlin, Germany.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1"><p>Published online 3 March 2016.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>M.A.T. is currently affiliated to CSL Behring Biotherapies for Life, Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, King of Prussia, PA.</p><p>This study was sponsored by Pfizer.
