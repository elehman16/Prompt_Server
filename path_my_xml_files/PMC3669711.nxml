Recently, the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology developed new criteria to define poor ovarian response, the so-called Bologna criteria. Although preliminary studies in these patients demonstrated very low pregnancy rates, a recent pilot study has shown promising results in women &#x0003c;40&#x02005;years old fulfilling the criteria, after treatment with corifollitropin &#x003b1; followed by highly purified menotropin (hpHMG) in a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist setting. Corifollitropin &#x003b1; followed by menotropin for poor ovarian responders&#x02019; trial (COMPORT) is a randomised trial aiming to investigate whether this novel protocol is superior to treatment with recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in an antagonist setting for young poor responders.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>COMPORT is a multicentre, open label, phase III randomised trial using a parallel two-arm design. 150 patients &#x0003c;40&#x02005;years old fulfilling the &#x02018;Bologna criteria&#x02019; will be randomised to corifollitropin &#x003b1; followed by hpHMG (group A) or recombinant FSH (group B) in a GnRH antagonist protocol for IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). The primary outcome is the ongoing pregnancy rate (defined as the presence of intrauterine gestational sac with an embryonic pole demonstrating cardiac activity at 9&#x02013;10&#x02005;weeks of gestation). Secondary outcomes are clinical and biochemical pregnancy rates and number of oocytes retrieved. Central randomisation will be performed using a computer-generated list and allocation concealment will be secured with the use of sealed-opaque envelopes. A sample size of 150 women is essential to detect a difference of 19.5% in ongoing pregnancy rates between group A (28%) and group B (8.5%) with a power of 85% and a level of significance at 0.05 using a two-sided Fisher's exact test.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>poor ovarian responders</kwd><kwd>Bologna criteria</kwd><kwd>corifollitropin alfa</kwd><kwd>hpHMG</kwd><kwd>IVF</kwd><kwd>pregnancy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float"><caption><title>Article summary</title></caption><sec><title>Article focus</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Recently, the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) developed new criteria to define women with poor ovarian response after ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilisation (IVF), &#x02018;The Bologna criteria&#x02019;.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Up to date no randomised trial has been published to evaluate the effectiveness of ovarian stimulation protocols in poor ovarian responders according to the new ESHRE definition.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Although poor ovarian responders according to the Bologna criteria have very low pregnancy rates after ovarian stimulation for IVF, recently a pilot study demonstrated that corifollitropin &#x003b1; followed by highly purified menotropin (hpHMG) may result in very promising pregnancy rates.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Key messages</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Corifollitropin &#x003b1; followed by menotropin for poor ovarian responders&#x02019; trial will provide conclusive evidence regarding the superiority of a novel protocol with corifollitropin &#x003b1; followed by hpHMG versus recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone in a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist setting for the treatment of young (&#x0003c;40&#x02005;years old) poor ovarian responders according to the Bologna criteria.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This is the first randomised study to examine the efficacy of two stimulation protocols in poor ovarian responders as described by the newly developed ESHRE definition.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To ensure sufficient power, the study's sample size calculation was based on a previous pilot study with the use of corifollitropin &#x003b1; followed by hpHMG in the antagonist setting.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> Yet, a considerable limitation of all the randomised trials up to date is the lack of a uniform definition to describe poor ovarian responders. Up to 2011, among 47 randomised trials in women with poor ovarian response, 41 different definitions for poor ovarian response were utilized<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>; surprisingly, no more than three trials used the same definition, whereas even trials from the same group of investigators used different definitions among different trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> Thus, it appears that any effort to identify the most optimal treatment for these women seems to be futile, simply due to the lack of a uniform definition to describe women failing to respond to stimulation.</p><p>Recently, the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) developed a new definition in order to select patients suitable for inclusion in future clinical trials as poor ovarian responders, the so-called Bologna criteria.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> However, a limited number of studies has been published to date including patients with poor ovarian response according to the &#x02018;Bologna criteria&#x02019;, whereas no randomised trial is published or ongoing for this population.</p><p>Preliminary reports in &#x02018;Bologna poor responders&#x02019; highlight the limited prospects for these women.

In combination with the existing literature, our previous work indicates that (1) women fulfilling these criteria have very low pregnancy rates, irrespective of age (2) current treatment protocols demonstrate ongoing pregnancy rates that do not exceed 8.5% and (3) corifollitropin &#x003b1; followed by hpHMG might increase ongoing pregnancy rates in young patients (&#x0003c;40&#x02005;years old) fulfilling the criteria. These findings provide a strong rationale for a definitive large randomised controlled trial. The corifollitropin &#x003b1; followed by menotropin for poor ovarian responders&#x02019; trial (COMPORT) study will provide conclusive evidence regarding the superiority or not of this novel protocol with corifollitropin &#x003b1; followed by hpHMG for the treatment of young poor ovarian responders fulfilling the Bologna criteria.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Study design</title><p>The COMPORT is a multicentre, open label, phase III multicentre superiority randomised trial using a parallel group, two-arm design with 1:1 allocation ratio with a primary endpoint ongoing pregnancy rates.

The analysis and reporting of the results of the clinical outcomes will follow the CONSORT guidelines (http://www.consort-statement.org).</p><p>For the primary outcome (ongoing pregnancy rates) and for the other secondary pregnancy outcomes (clinical pregnancy and biochemical pregnancy) results will be analysed by using a two-sided &#x003c7;&#x000b2; test with a level of significance p&#x0003c;0.05. Results will be summarised with a relative risk and 95% CI.</p><p>The mean number of oocytes retrieved will be compared between treatment groups by using parametric (independent t test) or non-parametric (Mann-Whitney test) tests depending on the normality of the distribution of the results with a level of significance p&#x0003c;0.05.</p><p>Other secondary outcomes will be analysed with the use of &#x003c7;&#x000b2; or Fisher exact test if categorical (cycle cancellation due to poor ovarian response, cycles with embryo transfer, number of cycles with frozen supernumerary embryos) or with the use of independent t test or Mann-Whitney test (number and quality of embryos and endocrine parameters (LH, FSH, E2, Progesterone)) during ovarian stimulation. All tests will be two-sided with a level of significance p&#x0003c;0.05. All analyses will be performed in SPSS V.20 Statistical software.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3k"><title>Accounting for missing data</title><p>Efficacy analyses will be carried out per randomised patient.

As a consequence, patients who discontinue will be part of this analysis until they discontinue.</p><p>Missing numbers for subjects who reached a certain stage are not (frequently) expected. Participants who are lost to follow-up before a TVUS assessment will be counted as non-pregnant. For other parameters like oocytes, embryos etc, if missing values occur, then they will not be imputed.</p></sec><sec id="s3l"><title>Data management</title><p>The same extraction form for baseline characteristics, efficacy and safety endpoints will be distributed to each of the participating centres. The leading investigator in each of the recruiting centres will be responsible for the collection of individual patient data, for their accuracy and validity. The principal investigator of the study will have responsibility for the collection of data from each of the participating centres by the end of the study.</p></sec><sec id="s3m"><title>Data monitoring</title><p>Owing to the short duration of the study and the known minimal risks (extremely low chance of ovarian hyperstimulation in this group of patients and use of all medical products in accordance with the summary products characteristics), no need for data monitoring committee has been considered essential. There will be only one analysis by the end of the study. However, the principal investigator will be in contact with the leading investigators of each centre in order to review safety data and monitor the progress of the trial.</p></sec><sec id="s3n"><title>Feasibility of the study</title><p>Poor ovarian responders are women who had numerous unsuccessful IVF/ICSI trials, with an established poor prognosis, who are willing to participate in clinical trials. In our centre, approximately 20 poor ovarian responders are seen in outpatient clinic on weekly basis. Among them, around 40&#x02013;50% (8&#x02013;10 patients) are poor ovarian responders &#x0003c;40&#x02005;years and are women suitable for inclusion in the study. The estimated participation rate is &#x0003e;80% (based on participation in ongoing pilot studies in this population in our centre). However, to secure recruitment and completion of the study within a timeframe of 6&#x02013;12&#x02005;months, two additional centres will enrol patients in the study (all of the recruiting centres have an annual number of fresh IVF/ICSI cycles between 1000 and &#x02013;2500 cycles) suggesting that recruitment is likely to be high. In order to ensure adequate participant enrolment, recruiting doctors from participating centres will prescreen all patients&#x02019; files before their first consultation in order to confirm eligibility.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e181" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-002938.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e182" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-002938.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the study nurses and administrative staff of the co-ordinating centre in UZBrussel: Elsie Nulens, Ellen Van Moer, Patricia Ackermans, Nicky Dooms and Saskia Van Ginderdeuren for their invaluable help for the set up of the current randomised trial.
