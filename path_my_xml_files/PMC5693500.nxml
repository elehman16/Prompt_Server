In 2013, as part of its effort to help address the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) funded a type 2 effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial titled the Substance Abuse Treatment to HIV Care (SAT2HIV) Project.

The first goal was reducing the number of people who become infected with HIV. This goal is paramount given estimates that there are approximately 50,000 new HIV infections each year within the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and that lifetime treatment costs of each new HIV infection are approximately $400,000 (in 2015 dollars) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], suggesting the overall lifetime treatment costs for HIV in the United States increases by approximately $20 billion a year. The second goal was increasing access to care and improving health outcomes for people living with HIV. This goal is important given estimates that 60% of the 1.2 million Americans infected with HIV are not engaged in HIV care and 63% are not prescribed antiretroviral therapy (ART) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], when ART can significantly reduce the risk of developing AIDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and new HIV infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The third goal was reducing HIV-related health disparities and health inequities, which are significant in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. For example, the overall rate of HIV infection for Blacks is eight times the overall rate for [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and approximately 75% of HIV/AIDS cases are among men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, a gender by race disparity exists; the HIV rate for Black men is seven times the rate for White men, and the HIV rate for Black women is 19 times the rate for White women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">In 2013, as part of its effort to help bolster the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) released a multipronged expansion of HIV- and AIDS-related research that included a request for research on the integration of substance use services within HIV/AIDS settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In 2014, NIDA awarded funding for two 5-year projects. One, titled &#x0201c;Implementation to Motivate Physician Response to Opioid Dependence in HIV Settings,&#x0201d; proposed a stepped wedge design to test the effectiveness of a multifaceted implementation strategy in terms of increasing implementation of naloxone and buprenorphine/naloxone within HIV primary care organizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The second, titled &#x0201c;Substance Abuse Treatment to HIV Care&#x0201d; (SAT2HIV), proposed a type 2 effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Aim 1 of the SAT2HIV Project tests the effectiveness of a motivational interviewing-based brief intervention (MIBI) for substance use as an adjunct to usual care within AIDS Service Organizations (ASOs) as part of its multisite MIBI Experiment. Aim 2 of the SAT2HIV Project tests the effectiveness of implementation and sustainment facilitation (ISF) as an adjunct to the Addiction Technology Transfer Center&#x02019;s (ATTC) model for training staff in motivational interviewing as part of its ISF Experiment. The current paper describes the study protocol for the MIBI Experiment, which has been written in accordance with the SPIRIT guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Overview of study objective and design</title><p id="Par23">The SAT2HIV Project&#x02019;s MIBI Experiment was conceptualized in 2013, when research on brief interventions for drug use was regarded as needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and promising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The primary objective of the MIBI Experiment was to test the effectiveness of MIBI as an adjunct to UC for substance use within ASOs (i.e., Aim 1 of the SAT2HIV Project). Consistent with the extant research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], we hypothesized that relative to the UC condition, the MIBI condition would result in significant reductions in primary substance use, substance-related problems, engagement in risky behaviors, as well as in significant increases in receipt of substance use treatment, and ART medication adherence. In terms of design, the MIBI Experiment is a multisite randomized controlled two-group (UC vs. UC&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;MIBI) effectiveness trial whose primary endpoint of interest is primary substance use during the 4-weeks following randomization. Randomization used a 1:1 allocation ratio. An effectiveness trial was selected because our primary interest was whether MIBI would work when used within the real-world conditions of ASOs, which is a design that more directly informs those making decisions about appropriate services to implement in practice settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Since the SAT2HIV Project was funded, research failing to support brief interventions for drug use within primary care settings has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], as has research supporting brief interventions for drug use within HIV primary care settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Building upon the extant research evidence base, the SAT2HIV Project&#x02019;s MIBI Experiment will help advance research on brief interventions for drug use, especially in HIV service settings. Consistent with Aharonovich and colleagues&#x02019; explanation for their positive findings relative to the null findings of others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], we believe the potential for reducing substance use (alcohol and other drug use) may be greater in HIV service settings than in general primary care. To the extent that this is true, addressing substance use within HIV service settings has the potential to have several important public health impacts, including improvements in HIV quality of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], medication adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and viral suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants, interventions, and outcomes</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study setting</title><p id="Par24">The MIBI Experiment is being conducted in community-based ASOs (targeted N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;39) located across the United States. ASOs conduct HIV prevention efforts and provide medical case management services (e.g., retention in care, medication adherence, referral to social services and specialty treatment) to individuals living with HIV/AIDS, including support services for their families and friends. ASOs are distinct from HIV primary care organizations, which as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, provide medical services including prescriptions for ART, CD4 T-lymphocyte testing, and/or HIV viral load testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p id="Par25">Consistent with the intent of effectiveness trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], there were limited eligibility criteria beyond the clinical indication of interest (i.e., comorbid HIV/AIDS and substance use disorder). Specifically, the eligibility criteria for the study were: (1) living with HIV/AIDS, (2) being 18+ years of age, and (3) acknowledging use of at least one substance within the past 28&#x000a0;days and endorsing two or more substance use disorder symptoms during the past 12&#x000a0;months. The only study exclusion criterion was not being able to speak English.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Interventions</title><p id="Par26">
<italic>Usual care.</italic> ASOs rarely systematically screen for or assess substance use as part of their UC process. It is even rarer for ASOs to have adequately trained staff to provide substance use services. Consequently, when individuals with comorbid HIV/AIDS and problematic substance use are identified, many ASOs are only able to offer these individuals a referral to a local substance use treatment organization. Thus, for the current experiment, UC consisted of referral to formal addiction treatment, mutual-help services, or both.</p><p id="Par27">
<italic>Motivational interviewing</italic>-<italic>based brief intervention.</italic> In addition to UC, all eligible and consenting client participants randomized to the UC&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;MIBI condition receive the project&#x02019;s MIBI. MIBI is a single-session 20- to 30-min MIBI delivered by one of the ASO&#x02019;s two trained case-management staff, which we refer to hereafter as BI Staff. The intervention uses a step-by-step format (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Visual illustration of the multi-step motivational interviewing-based brief intervention (MIBI)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13722_2017_95_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par28">Step 1 aims to have BI Staff engage clients and help them focus on a primary substance (i.e., one that caused them the most problems) and its relation to HIV.

Step 2 provides up to three opportunities (Steps 2a&#x02013;2c) for motivational enhancement. In Step 2a, BI Staff summarize clients&#x02019; arguments for and against change and then have the clients identify additional reasons from a checklist for quitting or cutting down substance use. BI Staff ask clients to elaborate on identified reasons and then ask a key question to determine their substance use goal. If clients commit to quitting or cutting back on substance use, BI Staff proceed to Change Planning (Step 3). If clients remain ambivalent about changing substance use, BI Staff move to Step 2b. In Step 2b, BI Staff offer clients personalized feedback about how their use compares with that of others, the annual cost of their use, and how substance use typically affects Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) adherence, morbidity, and mortality among people infected with HIV. BI Staff summarize and emphasize change talk. If clients remain noncommittal, BI Staff use additional motivational enhancement strategies (e.g., importance or confidence ruler technique) to evoke motivation for change (Step 2c).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par30">Step 3 involves developing a change plan to strengthen clients&#x02019; commitment to cut back or quit substance use. BI Staff cover the following elements: steps clients might take, identification of when each step will be used, review of available substance use treatment services, and identification of social supports and obstacles.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par31">Step 4 summarizes the MIBI session. For clients who committed to change and developed a change plan, BI Staff use a contract with clients to summarize the change plan and fortify the clients&#x02019; commitment to it. For clients who remain unsure about changing their substance use, BI Staff seek to &#x0201c;keep the door open&#x0201d; by thanking clients for talking about their substance use and encouraging them to discuss it again at their next visit.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="Par32">Training BI Staff in MIBI includes well-established methods: (1) an ATTC-developed online course on motivational interviewing (1&#x000a0;h per week for 5&#x000a0;weeks; <italic>A Tour of Motivational Interviewing</italic> at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.healtheknowledge.org">www.healtheknowledge.org</ext-link>); (2) an ATTC-run skill-based training workshop (2&#x000a0;days); and (3) ongoing ATTC-led performance review, feedback, and coaching based on ratings of audio recorded MIBI sessions with practice clients. All members of the training team are members of the Motivational Interviewing Network of Trainers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Before implementing MIBI with actual study participants, each BI Staff is required to demonstrate MIBI proficiency (i.e., a score of 4+ [out of 7] on half or more of 10 adherence ratings and on half or more of 10 competence ratings) with at least one practice client. All practice MIBIs are rated by one of the ATTC trainers, with MIBI integrity measured in accordance with the Independent Tape Rater Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Outcomes</title><p id="Par33">Adapted from the Addiction Severity Index, 5th Edition, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] primary outcome measures included: days of primary substance use, number of substance-related problems, times engaging in risky behaviors, days of substance use treatment, and ART medication adherence (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Key weaknesses include (1) the participant sample being limited only to individuals 18&#x000a0;years of age or older who speak English and self-report recent (past 28&#x000a0;days) substance use with indication of a substance use disorder (during the past year) at or above the mild criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], (2) reliance solely on self-reported primary substance use at follow-up as the primary outcome, and (3) a 4&#x02013;week post-randomization follow-up period. Nonetheless, these limitations are outweighed by the project&#x02019;s many strengths.</p><p id="Par61">Key strengths include (1) the randomized controlled trial design; (2) conducting the trial in ASOs; (3) the large number of ASOs; (4) the focus on alcohol and other substance use as opposed to a single substance type; (5) the clinical intervention (i.e., MIBI) being tested as an adjunct to usual care rather than as an alternative to usual care (i.e., usual care only vs. brief intervention only); (6) the high degree of internal validity (e.g., blinding follow-up interviewers to condition assignment, extensive quality assurance procedures); and (7) the high degree of external validity (e.g., minimal exclusion criteria, high level of geographic representativeness of ASOs within the United States, delivery of MIBI by ASO case managers).</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Potential impacts of the MIBI Experiment</title><p id="Par62">Panel A of Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> illustrates the present U.S. performance regarding the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] and the HIV Care Continuum performance measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], as well as that problematic substance use among individuals living with HIV/AIDS reduces the extent to which ASOs and their key services are able to positively impact these key performance measures. Panel B of Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> illustrates the potential impact of providing support for MIBI as an effective adjunct to usual care within ASOs. More specifically, if MIBI is found to be effective, expanding ASOs&#x02019; service continuum to include MIBI for substance use has the potential to help reduce the prevalence of problematic substance use among individuals living with HIV/AIDS, which in turn may increase the extent to which ASOs positively impact key performance measures, such as being linked to care, being engaged in care, being prescribed ART, and achieving viral suppression. However, as indicated by the question marks above each performance measure, future research will be needed to measure changes over time in these performance measures.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Potential impacts of the SAT2HIV Project&#x02019;s MIBI Experiment</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13722_2017_95_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par63">The anticipated positive impacts that may ideally stem from reducing problematic substance use among individuals living with HIV/AIDS are posited to stem from increasing ASOs&#x02019; ability to help individuals engage in HIV care, which is the most significant break point along the U.S. HIV Care Continuum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] and has been found to be negatively impacted by substance use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par64">Comorbid HIV/AIDS and substance use is an issue of great public health relevance given that substance use among people living with HIV/AIDS is associated with several issues including increased psychiatric problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], poorer HIV viral suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], poorer HIV medication adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and increased likelihood of engaging in risk behaviors that result in infection transmission to others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Thus, with an estimated 50% of adults receiving HIV care reporting substance use in the past 12&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], there is a major need to address substance use among people living with HIV/AIDS. The SAT2HIV Project&#x02019;s MIBI Experiment represents the largest randomized controlled trial to date focused on identifying the best methods to improve ASOs&#x02019; ability to address comorbid HIV/AIDS and substance use. Should the effectiveness of MIBI as an adjunct to ASOs&#x02019; usual care be supported, our team will seek to support MIBI dissemination, implementation, and sustainment in as many ASOs as possible. Importantly, such efforts will be informed by the SAT2HIV Project&#x02019;s ISF Experiment (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), which, as previously noted, is testing the effectiveness of a multifaceted implementation strategy as an adjunct to the ATTCs&#x02019; current state-of-the-art training model. Consistent with the intent of effectiveness-implementation hybrid designs, our hope is that our design for the parent SAT2HIV Project (i.e., a type 2 effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial) will minimize the research-to-practice lag that has been found to plague numerous areas of health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec39"><p>
