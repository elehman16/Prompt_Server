To the best of our knowledge, randomized trials that addressed these questions are few and this is the first trial to examine the effect of vitamin interventions on malaria risk in HIV-infected individuals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><p>A randomized controlled trial was conducted in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, from April 1995 until August 2003,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> during which 1078 HIV-infected pregnant women were randomly assigned using a factorial design to receive a daily oral dose of 1 of 4 regimens: placebo, vitamin A alone (30 mg &#x003b2;-carotene with 5000 IU preformed vitamin A), multivitamins without vitamin A (20 mg vitamins B<sub>1</sub>, 20 mg B<sub>2</sub>, 25 mg B<sub>6</sub>, 100 mg niacin, 50 &#x003bc;g B<sub>12</sub>, 500 mg C, 30 mg E, and 800 &#x003bc;g folic acid), or multivitamins with vitamin A at the listed doses. At delivery, women received an additional 200,000 IU oral vitamin A if their assigned regimen included vitamin A, or placebo if otherwise. Participants and study staff were blinded to regimen assignments. During the trial implementation, the Data Safety and Monitoring Board noted a significantly higher risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV among women assigned to vitamin A supplementation,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> whereas multivitamin supplementation reduced the risks of fetal loss, low birth weight, and severe prematurity.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>Thus, the protocol was modified to provide multivitamin supplements for the duration of pregnancy to all participants who subsequently became pregnant during the study (starting after May 1998), and to exclude vitamin A supplements during pregnancy (from September 2000) until the trial concluded. As we wanted to understand the effects of multivitamin supplementation, and vitamin A supplementation, on malaria, we decided a priori to restrict analyses to contributed person-time that had been unaffected by the protocol modifications. These analyses therefore include time from enrollment to just before the start of a second pregnancy during the study (314 women had a second pregnancy), or until the study end, loss to follow-up, or death&#x02014;whichever occurred first&#x02014;if no second pregnancy occurred [median (interquartile range) length of follow-up for women with only 1 pregnancy during the study, 41.0 (8.6&#x02013;75.3) months].</p><p>During pregnancy, all women received 120 mg ferrous iron and 5 mg folate daily and weekly malaria prophylaxis (500 mg chloroquine phosphate) in accordance with standard prenatal care in Tanzania at the time. Malaria is endemic in Dar es Salaam, with year round stable transmission. Iron&#x02013;folate supplements and prophylactic chloroquine were discontinued when pregnancy ended. Women diagnosed with malaria were treated according to the Tanzanian standard of care. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) was unavailable in Tanzania during the study period; most study participants were in the early clinical stages of HIV infection<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and did not qualify for ART at baseline.</p><p>During monthly clinic visits, study nurses evaluated women for symptoms and history of illnesses, while study physicians conducted physical examinations, made presumptive diagnoses, and requested investigations when indicated. Routine blood smears were universally performed at baseline, the first postnatal visit, and every 12 months, while women suspected to have malaria at monthly visits had additional blood films at their physicians' discretion. Thick and thin films stained with 5% Giemsa solution were examined microscopically by 2 laboratory technologists for the presence of asexual <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, <italic>P. malariae</italic>, <italic>P. vivax</italic>, or <italic>P. ovale</italic> parasites. Discordant reports were resolved by a senior laboratory technologist.

We also examined intervention effects on the first new episode of &#x02265;10,000 parasites per microliter. Presumptive clinical malaria was defined as having either physician-diagnosed malaria (diagnosis of malaria made by study physicians after considering symptoms and clinical examination findings), nurse-diagnosed malaria (reports of recent high-grade fever with associated chills, rigors, and sweating and/or axillary temperatures of 37.5&#x000b0;C or higher recorded by study nurses), or both.

Cox proportional hazards regression models,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> with months since randomization as the time scale, were used to estimate the effects of treatment on time to first malaria episodes. We examined the effects of multivitamins without vitamin A, vitamin A alone, and multivitamins with vitamin A, compared with placebo, on the risk of outcomes and tested for the interaction of multivitamins with vitamin A using a likelihood ratio test. As there was no significant interaction between multivitamins and vitamin A supplementation in relation to the risk of malaria, the intervention groups were collapsed to increase statistical power; multivitamin supplementation was compared with no multivitamins, and vitamin A was compared with no vitamin A (interaction test <italic>P</italic> values were 0.59 in relation to risk of any parasitemia and 0.24 in relation to risk of presumptive clinical malaria). We also explored the possibility of modification of the multivitamin effects by the following factors: gravidity (primigravida or multigravida), season (rainy or dry season), pregnancy status (pregnant versus no longer pregnant), time since delivery (&#x02264;3 versus &#x0003e;3 months), baseline WHO HIV disease stage<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> (stage 1, 2, or 3), and baseline CD4 T-cell count (&#x0003c;200, 200 to &#x0003c;350, &#x02265;350 cells/&#x003bc;L).</p><p>All analyses used SAS software version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The Human Subjects Committee of the Harvard School of Public Health and the Research and Publications Committee of Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences gave institutional review board approval for the randomized trial; women provided informed consent for participation in the trial.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Of the 1078 trial participants, 1050 were eligible for this study, contributing a total of 27,551 months of follow-up.

We also found increased risk of developing any malaria parasitemia for women receiving multivitamin supplementation. The effects were similar regardless of pregnancy status, number of previous pregnancies, season, and WHO HIV disease stage. Vitamin A supplementation, however, did not change women's risks of presumptive clinical malaria or malaria parasitemia.</p><p>Our study suggests that multivitamin supplementation could have prevented clinical malaria episodes, as presumptive diagnoses of clinical malaria were less frequent among HIV-infected women assigned to multivitamins. Multivitamin supplementation was previously found to result in significant reduction in mortality, increased CD4 T-cell counts, and reduced plasma viral load among these women.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Other studies have also found vitamin supplementation to be associated with prolonged AIDS-free survival. The use of vitamin B supplements by HIV-infected individuals was associated with delayed progression to AIDS and delayed mortality in South Africa,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and improved survival in the United States.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> A randomized controlled trial in Thailand found that multiple micronutrient supplements (vitamins B complex, A, C, E, D, K, and minerals) lowered mortality rates among HIV-infected individuals who were severely immunosuppressed, when compared with placebo,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> whereas a trial involving 49 HIV-infected individuals reported a trend towards reduced viral loads for those assigned to vitamins C and E compared with placebo.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> A recent randomized controlled trial in Botswana also found that a supplement comprising vitamins B complex, C, E, and selenium had morbidity-reducing effects among 878 HIV-infected ART-naive adults.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> However, although we found multivitamin supplementation to protect against clinical malaria, symptoms diagnosed as clinical malaria could also have been caused by infections other than malaria, in which case, the protective multivitamin effects we observed would have resulted from a reduced incidence of HIV-related infections, and not necessarily reductions in clinical malaria incidence.</p><p>CD4 T cells play a role in the development of acquired immunity against malaria,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and the multivitamin-induced improvements in immune function could have resulted in reduced rates of clinical disease. However, it is possible that other infectious conditions were misidentified as malaria among these HIV-infected women&#x02014;presumptive diagnoses relied on symptoms and signs that could have non-malaria causes in HIV-infected individuals.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Although our study is the first randomized trial to examine the relationship of vitamin supplementation with malaria incidence in HIV-infected women, the offspring of our study participants were investigated for malaria incidence during the first 2 years of life.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Relative to children of placebo recipients, children whose mothers received multivitamins alone had significantly reduced clinical malaria rates (71% reduction in malaria incidence) and children whose mothers received both multivitamins and vitamin A had lower rates of high malaria parasitemia defined as &#x02265;5000 parasites per microliter (a 2%&#x02013;33% reduction in incidence), although main effects of multivitamins were not statistically significant for both outcomes. These children were indirectly exposed to maternal supplements, and protection against malaria observed among children could have been because women who received multivitamin supplements had better health outcomes, which may have improved their capacity to care for their children. For example, children with healthier mothers may have been more likely to access malaria-prevention measures like insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), as access required travel to ITN distribution points.</p><p>Multivitamin supplementation increased women's risks of malaria parasitemia in this study. Several components of the multivitamin supplement may have encouraged malaria parasite growth, especially after women stopped receiving malaria prophylaxis because their pregnancies ended. Increased iron levels after the absorption-enhancing influence of vitamin C in the human gut<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> could have increased parasite growth<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02014;the iron absorption hypothesis is supported by previous findings that multivitamins improved hemoglobin concentrations of study participants.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The antioxidant functions of vitamins C and E could have reduced parasite susceptibility to oxidative stressors,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and folic acid could have contributed to DNA synthesis in parasites capable of using exogenous folate.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Our finding of increased malaria parasitemia among recipients of multivitamin supplementation is consistent with findings from another randomized trial, which reported a tendency toward increased malaria parasite densities among children who received a supplement containing thiamine, riboflavin, vitamin C, and iron (our multivitamin supplement included these micronutrients, excepting iron) compared with the placebo,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> although the elevation in malaria parasitemia seen in that study may have been because the intervention included iron.</p><p>Supplementation with vitamin A did not significantly alter malaria incidence in our study. This is in contrast with the results of the vitamin A supplementation trial in children that found supplementation significantly reduced <italic>P. falciparum</italic> clinical episodes.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Earlier vitamin A supplementation trials found no beneficial effects on <italic>P. falciparum</italic> density, probable malaria illness, or malaria-associated mortality.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p><p>Our study is a randomized controlled trial, in which study participants and staff were unaware of intervention assignments, thus could not alter their behavior in favor of any study regimen. The factorial design enabled us to separately examine multivitamin and vitamin A effects, as well as the interactions between the two. However, misclassification of febrile episodes as clinical malaria outcomes may have occurred during the study. Additionally, the infrequency of routine blood film samples may have reduced our ability to detect some episodes of asymptomatic parasitemia. The potential for outcome misclassification is complicated by the fact that malaria parasitemia may be unaccompanied by symptoms in endemic areas<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> and that clinical malaria can be associated with undetectable parasitemia, for instance when parasites are sequestered in internal organs.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>This study addresses health problems impacting millions globally, since malaria and HIV co-infection occur in many countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> HIV infection increases the risk of malaria.

While 52 countries affected by malaria are on track to reduce their malaria incidence by 75%, in keeping with World Health Assembly and Roll Back Malaria targets for 2015, these countries account for only 4% of global malaria cases.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Our findings are especially generalizable to countries where ART is provided only to individuals with advanced HIV infection. Although some countries are adopting lifelong coverage of ART for all HIV-infected pregnant women regardless of disease severity (option B+),<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> other countries continue to recommend lifelong ART only for those with advanced disease, and provide ART prophylaxis to pregnant women with less severe disease, to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV during the prenatal and perinatal periods (option A).<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> As was previously reported, multivitamin supplementation during pregnancy and in the postpartum period is beneficial for HIV-infected women, reducing HIV disease progression<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and improving the hematologic status of women and their offspring.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Multivitamin supplementation also improves pregnancy outcomes of HIV-infected women, reducing the risks of fetal death, low birth weight, and severe preterm birth,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> as well as reducing the incidence of clinical malaria<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> among their offspring. Multivitamin supplements costing as little as a few cents per person per day could benefit those who are ineligible for ART, by slowing HIV progression and reducing complications, possibly including malaria. Malaria-prevention measures, including vector control methods and use of ITNs, are recommended by the WHO for all individuals at risk of malaria.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Further research is needed on the effects of multivitamin supplementation in the context of adequate ART. Also, studies that isolate the effects of individual vitamins would improve our understanding of causal mechanisms. Daily use of multivitamin supplements by HIV-infected women in our study improved clinical outcomes, including reducing symptomatic malaria infections. The clinical significance of increased malaria parasitemia warrants additional research, but in light of evidence to date, multivitamin supplementation is appropriate as part of an integrated approach to the care of HIV-infected individuals that includes malaria-prevention measures.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to thank the women who participated in the study, without them the study could not occur.
