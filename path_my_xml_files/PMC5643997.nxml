Composite laminate veneer is preferred because it provides less invasive and more conservative treatment for correction unaesthetic tooth forms, to mask tooth discolorations, and to restore fractured anterior teeth.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] However, marginal discoloration, microleakage, wear, and marginal fractures are common problem of composite restorations, and this situation causes reducing the esthetic result over time.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>One of the widely used techniques for restoring of teeth in clinic is direct preparation. No or minimal tooth preparation, better marginal adaptation, easy intraoral polishing, inexpensive, and no need for an additional adhesive cementing system, easy to repair are some advantages of direct laminate veneers. However, low resistance to fractures and wear, and discoloration are the main disadvantages of this technique.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The use of indirect polymerization technique is a possible method of minimizing of this disadvantages.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Indirect laminate veneers have high resistance against fractures and discoloration compared to direct laminate veneer restoration. Main disadvantages of indirect laminate veneer restorations are higher cost, long chair time, and the necessity of using an adhesive cementing system.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Microleakage is the major problem in clinical dentistry and may predispose a tooth the discoloration, postoperative sensitivity, recurrent caries, and pulpal inflammation.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Poor adaptation between the tooth structure and the restorative material is the main cause of microleakage. Volume changes occurring by the oral thermal factors will cause a gap formation and microleakage.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Different test methods available to detect microleakage include direct visual examination, and microscopic examination, scanning electron microscopic examination, neutron activation analysis, using air pressure, an electrochemical methodology, and measuring bacteria penetration.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] However, dye penetration technique is widely preferred method due to easy manipulation, easy analysis of the results and no need for expensive instrumentation.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The purpose of this <italic>in vitro</italic> study was to evaluate the influence of different polymerization techniques and different laminate preparations techniques on the microleakage of composite laminate veneers.

Diamond depth cut burs (M834-016, M834-021, Axis, Teksas, USA) were used to scribe horizontal depth cut grooves on the labial surface for minimal preparations of approximately 0.3 mm in the cervical third and 0.5 mm in the middle and incisal third. All of the grooves were connected with a diamond rotary cutting instrument (H284K-016). The surface was prepared with retouch bur.

After storage for 24 h in distilled water, all specimens were thermocycled by immersion in two water tanks (cold, warm) with temperatures of 5&#x000b0;C and 55&#x000b0;C. The tooth surface was coated with nail varnish to within 1 mm of the laminate veneer margins, then immersed in 5% basic fuchsine solution for 24 h. After that, the samples were rinsed under tap water, and nail varnish was removed by polishing disks. Dye extraction method was used for microleakage evaluation. 1 ml % 65 nitric acid solution was added in experimental tubes. Following that all specimens were immersed in experimental tubes for 3 days to let basic fuchsine within laminates dentin interface diluted in nitric acid. The tubes were centrifuged 14,000 rpm for 5 min, and after that, 100 &#x003bc;L of the supernatant from each was transferred to a plate. The dye absorption was determined by an automatic spectrophotometer at 600 nm wavelength. The results of the spectrophotometer indicate the light absorption of the basic fuchsine in the laminate-tooth interface which is actually showing the microleakage of the restoration.</p><p>Data were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey honest significant difference test.

Composite laminate veneers have gained considerable importance to provide increasing esthetic demand and offer a treatment option for a patient with minimal preparation. Prevention of microleakage is very important factor for the longevity of restoration. Obtained data from this study showed that preparation techniques and polymerization techniques demonstrated different effect on microleakage of composite laminate veneers.</p><p>Non-effective seal at restoration margins may cause to marginal staining, postoperative sensitivity, and recurrent caries as a result of bacterial penetration.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Marginal integrity is the most important criteria for evaluating a restoration's success.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Different test methods have been used for years to understand fluid flow and marginal integrity of composites cohesive and adhesive natures <italic>in vitro</italic>. In general, dye penetration has been considered as the most frequently used method. However, subjectivity of readings is the limitations of these test methods.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In this present study, dye extraction method was used, and the volume of penetrated dye was measured as a quantitative using a spectrophotometer.</p><p>Polymerization shrinkage, nonretentive tooth preparation, weak cement, malocclusion, excessive forces of mastication affect the microleakage.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Indirect restorations are expected to show better marginal integrity. Poor marginal integrity can appear due to polymerization shrinkage or removal of the luting cement. In indirect restorations, the composite resin is polymerized before placement for prevention of polymerization shrinkage.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] However, the type of luting agent and its mechanical properties have a significant effect on microleakage.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The thickness of resin luting agent is the another risk factor. Thicker luting agent may occur crack and leakage as a result of a poorly fitting veneer.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In this present study, comparing the results of dye extraction, indirect polymerization technique was showed significant difference only in Group 1. In the other groups, indirect and direct techniques showed same values. It may be explained by properties of luting agent. Aschenbrenner <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] detected small marginal cement deterioration with microscopic analysis after removal of excess cement with a hand instrument. This situation may cause dye entry to gap formation. Gerdolle <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] reported in their study that due to the difference in thermal expansion between luting agent and tooth, the thermal cycling of a restoration between high and low temperatures may cause deterioration of the bond between the luting agent and tooth.</p><p>Tooth preparation is known as one of the most critical steps in the use of laminate veneers. In the literature, widely accepted designs are the window preparation, feather preparation, bevel preparation, and the incisal overlap preparation.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Pini <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] reported that the preparation design should allow an optimum marginal adaptation of the final laminate veneer restoration. The incisal preparation design is the controversial subject in the literature.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Some authors recommend an incisal overlap preparation as the standard procedure for laminate veneers,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] while others do not.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Window preparation design protect natural enamel over the incisal edge. However, incisal finish line can be difficult to hide.</p><p>Preparation depth is desirable to remain within enamel. Dentin tends to expose in the cervical and proximal area because the enamel is thinnest in this areas.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In bonded restorations, the enamel margins are less susceptible to leakage than dentinal margins, because of resin-based restorative materials bond well with acid-etched enamel.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] In recent studies reported that laminate preparation where located in aprismatic enamel or dentin cause mikroleakage at the cervical margin and the microleakage at cervical margin was greater than at the incisal margin.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] 0.5 mm tissue reduction in cervical region is associated with dentinal exposure and this situation may increase the risk of lost marginal seal.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Therefore, in this study all margins of laminate preparation were placed in enamel. Depth cut burs were used for prevention of over preparation, and all preparation finish line were located 1.0 mm close the gingival margin. Hekimoglu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] reported in their study, and the window preparation type was more effective in terms of prevention of microleakage than the overlapped type laminates. In another study concluded that the incisal overlap design showed more microleakage when compared with the window preparation. This can be attributed to the shrinkage of materials and leading to marginal gap formation at the linguoincisal edge.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In this present study, window type preparation was showed lower microleakage value in Subgroup C.</p><p>Concerning the limitations of this study, the cemented composite laminate veneers were not exposed to mechanical cycling, and all groups exposed only thermocycling in the laboratory. As this might not replicate the actual situations present in routine clinical practice, further studies are recommended.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Based on the findings of this <italic>in vitro</italic> study, the following conclusions were drawn:</p><p>
