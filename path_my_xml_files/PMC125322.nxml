Of those patients who survive to hospital discharge, little is known regarding their physical functioning (ability to conduct activities of daily life such as walking around), psychologic functioning (mental well-being), and social functioning (communication and relationships with others) after sepsis. Because 'quality of life' (QoL) describes or characterizes what the patient has experienced as a result of sepsis care, it is a useful and important supplement to traditional physiologic or biologic measures of health status; that is, assessments of effectiveness need to include wider measures of benefits to patients, and particularly those that measure the impact from the patient's point of view. A relevant therapeutic benefit may also be in restoring the patient's ability to function on a daily basis, to socialize, and to be alert. In fact, a long-term focus on QoL in clinical trial evaluations was among the recommendations of a recent sepsis international advisory group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>This report presents the results of an evaluation of QoL among sepsis survivors, done as part of the phase III multicenter KyberSept trial. To the best of our knowledge, limited information on the effects of sepsis treatment on QoL has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The report focuses on the effects of antithrombin (AT) III therapy related to physical, mental, and social functioning of patients who were randomly assigned to either high-dose intravenous treatment with Kybernin P<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Aventis Behring, Marburg, Germany; a plasma-derived AT III concentrate, 30,000 IU over 4 days) or placebo during up to 90 days of follow up. In the trial, overall survival tended to favor AT III over placebo after 90 days of follow up, although the differences were nominal. However, the AT III group that did not receive concomitant heparin exhibited a nominally statistically significant survival advantage over placebo at 90 days of follow-up. The purpose of this investigation was to establish whether these trends also held for the subjective effects of AT III in severe sepsis. It concludes that AT III treatment is effective in improving long-term patient QoL, and that future outcome research studies of severe sepsis should follow up patients throughout their hospital stay and after discharge.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec><title>Quality of life instruments</title><p>There are a number of important conceptual and methodologic issues in assessing QoL in people who are critically ill, not least of which is the question of how it should be defined. Recent attempts to define QoL have resulted in the development of a functional definition that is measurable, evaluable over time, and readily applied to patients over a wide range of illness severity. Most attempts incorporate the domains of physical, psychologic/cognitive, and social functioning. Each of these domains can be measured in two dimensions: objective assessments of functioning or health status; and more subjective perceptions of general health. The patient's subjective experience translates that objective assessment into the actual QoL experienced. Thus, where the term 'QoL' is used in the present study, it refers to a composite of objective functional impairment and subjective perceptions and expectations. The instruments chosen for the study were designed to reflect this.</p><p>QoL gives information on what medical care has achieved for the patient, but severe sepsis is a difficult area in which to obtain such information. Normally, QoL data should be obtained directly from the patient. Unfortunately, patients hospitalized with severe sepsis may be unable to complete a QoL measure or it may be too burdensome. Rather than lose information on patients, the physician investigator was used as a proxy respondent.</p><p>Two instruments were used to cover the objective and subjective dimensions. The objective component in the study was measured using the Karnofsky performance scale. The Karnofsky scale emphasizes physical performance and dependency; it is a descriptive, ordinal scale that ranges from 100 (good health) to 0 (dead). Trial investigators assigned percentages based on physical performance (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The Karnofsky scale is designed to assess independent functioning and appears to have substantial validity as an indicator of overall physical status. The validity and reliability of the scale have been shown in several populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Karnofsky performance scale: objective assessment of physical performance and dependency</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Investigator assigned percentage</td><td align="left">Features</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">100%</td><td align="left">Normal; no complaints and no evidence of disease</td></tr><tr><td align="left">90%</td><td align="left">Able to carry on normal activities; minor signs or symptoms of disease</td></tr><tr><td align="left">80%</td><td align="left">Normal activities but with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease</td></tr><tr><td align="left">70%</td><td align="left">Cares for self, but is unable to carry on normal activities or to do active work</td></tr><tr><td align="left">60%</td><td align="left">Requires occasional assistance, but is able to care for most needs</td></tr><tr><td align="left">50%</td><td align="left">Requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care</td></tr><tr><td align="left">40%</td><td align="left">Disabled; requires special care and assistance</td></tr><tr><td align="left">30%</td><td align="left">Severely disabled; hospitalization is indicated but death is not imminent</td></tr><tr><td align="left">20%</td><td align="left">Hospitalization necessary, very sick, active supportive treatment necessary</td></tr><tr><td align="left">10%</td><td align="left">Moribund; fatal processes progressing rapidly</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The subjective component of the trial was measured with multiple items using a visual analog scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. A visual analog scale is a line with defined end-points on which investigators indicate a patient's health state. Thus, the investigator placed a mark along a 100 mm line that best described his or her assessment of the patient with the domain in question. There were six domains (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The scales ranged from 0 (worst health status) to 100 (best health status). The visual analog scale has been used in several studies of QoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Reliability estimates for visual analog scaling items range from 0.40 to 0.95 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and these estimates compare favorably with those for other scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Visual analog scale: subjective assessment of physical performance and dependency</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Domain</td><td align="left">Definition</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Mobility</td><td align="left">How would you rate this patient's mobility today?</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Physical activity</td><td align="left">How would you rate this patient's physical activity today?</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Communications/speech</td><td align="left">How would you rate this patient's communication/speech today?</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Alertness</td><td align="left">How would you rate this patient's level of alertness today?</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Energy</td><td align="left">How would you rate this patient's energy level today?</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Overall quality of life</td><td align="left">How would you rate this patient's overall quality of life today?</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The six domains of the first visual analog scale and the Karnofsky score are hereafter referred to as 'attributes'.</p></sec><sec><title>The clinical trial</title><p>The KyberSept trial was a large, international, phase III clinical trial that enrolled 2314 patients who were evaluable for efficacy and safety in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design in order to determine the role of high-dose AT III in patients with severe sepsis. Patients randomly assigned to the AT III group received a total of 30,000 IU plasma-derived ATIII (Kybernin P<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) administered as a loading dose of 6000 IU given over 30 min, followed by a continuous infusion of 6000 IU/day for 4 days. The study protocol permitted investigators to prescribe unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin for venous thrombosis prophylaxis (&#x02264; 10,000 IU/day subcutaneous) and heparin flushes for vascular catheter potency (&#x02264; 2 IU/kg body weight per hour intravenous).</p><p>In the trial, the all-cause mortality rate at 28 days was almost identical between the placebo group and the group that received AT III (38.7% versus 39.9%; not significant). At the 90-day time point, the AT III group had a nominally lower mortality than did the placebo group (46.4% versus 48.5%). Among the 680 patients in the trial who did not receive heparin concomitantly, there was a statistically significant difference between the AT III and placebo groups. In this subgroup, mortality at 90 days in the AT III subgroup was 44.9%, versus 52.5% in the placebo subgroup (<italic>P</italic><sub>nominal</sub> = 0.03). A complete description of that study and results are reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>The Karnofsky scale and visual analog scales were both administered by physician investigators when patients enrolled in the trial (referred to as 'baseline'); during the trial at 28 days, 56 days and 90 days after enrollment; and at discharge from the hospital (if it occurred other than at one of those three intervals). For example, if a patient survived and was discharged at day60, there would be four assessments (i.e. baseline and days 28, 56, and 60). The primary outcome was change in attribute scores until 90 days after patients were assigned to either treatment or placebo. For this analysis, two patient populations were used. The smaller population was the group remaining in the hospital 90 days from baseline &#x02013; the 'in-hospital survivors'. The larger population comprised all survivors at 90 days, or at the time point closest to 90 days. This group is labeled the 'all-survivors' group. It includes the in-hospital group. In cases in which there was no patient response at 90 days because they had been discharged, the data from the last assessment but before 90 days were used. This method is equivalent to using the last observation carried forward.</p><p>The last observation carried forward method uses the last observed value for that case, and it therefore assumes that the outcome remains constant at the last observed value after discharge. Otherwise stated, it is assumed that QoL in sepsis patients is stable on average for the short time period between discharge and 90 days. It is not possible to conclude firmly that the change in QoL between discharge and 90 days was small and unbiased. However, the fact that the hospital discharge curve between AT III and placebo was almost identical provides evidence that the comparison between treatment groups should be unbiased. Moreover, the physician investigator, the patient, and the family were blinded to the treatment assignment (placebo versus AT III) throughout the duration of the clinical trial.</p><p>The secondary outcome was change in the attribute scores at 28, 56, and 90 days after assignment to treatment or placebo. That outcome measure was used in order to compare relative changes between AT III and placebo groups at the 28-day, 56-day, and 90-day assessments.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis</title><sec><title>Patient characteristics</title><p>Mean, standard deviation, and range values (for age) and percentages for relevant patient characteristics (at enrollment and administration of heparin) are reported.

The results of the study indicate that, over a 90-day period, survivors of severe sepsis receiving AT III experienced substantial and statistically significant improvements as compared with placebo in several attributes of QoL. These results held for both all-survivors and in-hospital survivors populations. The comparative advantage in QoL for AT III was also maintained from 28 to 56, and 90 days. After 90 days, the study also found an advantage with AT III for some attributes in patients who did not receive heparin concomitantly.</p><p>The improvements identified in the study should be interpreted in terms of statistical and clinical significance. Clinical significance deals with the applied value of the change in everyday life. Unfortunately, as with most other QoL instruments, there is not yet a clear standard for 'minimal clinically important differences'. However, improvements by approximately 20% in the in-hospital group of AT III sepsis patients after 90 days in communication/speech and level of alertness probably represent meaningful improvements in many patients.</p><p>Another limitation of the present study is the fact that investigators were proxy respondents, rather than patients responding themselves. Like many studies of QoL in critical care settings, physicians were assumed to be sufficiently close to patients to provide valid and reliable data. Although this was not substantiated empirically, there is usually moderate agreement between patients and proxies, although lower levels of agreement have been found in psychosocial functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Combined with previous findings in 90-day mortality for those without concomitant administration of heparin, this multinational study demonstrates that AT III is associated with meaningful improvements in health for many sepsis patients over an extended 3-month follow-up period. In this subgroup, the clinical improvements over a long time period in patients in the AT III group were complemented by improvements in QoL in many patients, particularly in terms of social and psychologic functioning. Although no significant reduction in 90-day mortality was found for the overall population, a nominal advantage in mortality for the AT III group combined with a generally improved QoL profile in the survivors of this group suggests a possible long-term benefit from AT III. Future studies of critically ill patients with severe sepsis or other conditions should include long-term follow up of patients throughout hospitalization and after hospital discharge. In sepsis, long-term follow up appears to provide more meaningful outcome data for patients, families, and society than do standard 28-day, all-cause mortality statistics.</p></sec><sec><title>Key messages</title><p>&#x000b7; In the present study, clinical improvements over an extended time period with AT III were complemented by improvements in QoL, particularly in social andpsychologic functioning, in a predefined subgroup of patients who did not receive heparin.</p><p>&#x000b7; Combined with previous research on 90-day mortality, the study suggests that AT III may confer long-term benefit in sepsis patients.</p><p>&#x000b7; Among the 'all survivors' group of patients, communication and speech, level of alertness, and energy level exhibited the greatest gains at 90 days.</p><p>&#x000b7; In most cases, significant differences in patient QoL scores at 90 days after hospital admission were also found at the 28-day and 56-day assessments.</p><p>&#x000b7; Future studies in patients with severe sepsis should include long-term follow up throughout hospitalization and after hospital discharge.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Dale Rublee, Heinz-Otto Keinecke, and Sigrid Knaub are employees of Aventis Behring, the latter also owning Aventis stock options.
