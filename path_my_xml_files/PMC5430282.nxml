swaying saddle on chronic lower back pain. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty-three normal
adults (university students) with chronic lower back pain were randomly recruited. The
flexibility and strength of muscles were measured before and after an 8-week intervention.
Belly-bike, an ergometer with a swaying saddle, was used. The duration of intervention was
30 minutes a day, 3 times a week. To measure the level of pain, visual analogue scale
(VAS) and Korean Oswestry Disability Index were used. In addition, flexibility tests such
as straight leg raising and forward reaching test in the long sitting posture were used to
confirm back muscle shortness. Activations of the erector spinae muscle, gluteus medius
muscle, rectus femoris muscle, and vastus lateralis muscle were also measured by
electromyography before and after the intervention. Electromyography of muscles around the
pelvis was performed and functional tests were conducted. [Results] The flexibility and
strength of the muscles significantly increased post-intervention. Functional test scores
for the forward reaching test and straight leg raising test significantly improved in the
Belly-bike group. [Conclusion] The results show that exercise using the Belly-bike could
be effective in reducing lower back pain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Lower back pain</kwd><kwd>Belly-dance</kwd><kwd>Ergometer</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Lower back pain is the most common disease in the modern society. It is diagnosed as
chronic pain when the pain lasts for more than 12 weeks<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There is a consistent relationship between chronic lower back pain and other complications.
People with lower back pain have a higher psychologically stress level than those
without<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many studies have reported that lower back pain is secondary to problems of related to
muscles<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to Janda&#x02019;s lower
crossed syndrome (LCS), the crossed couple of force causes pelvic problems between the trunk
and lower limbs. In addition, abnormalities of muscles such as pelvic flexors, knee
extensor, and abdominal extensor could occur in the posterior tilt of pelvis<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The muscle involved iliopsoas muscle,
rectus femoris muscle, hamstrings muscle, erector spinae muscle, rectus abdominis muscle,
transversus abdominis muscle, obliques muscle, gluteus medius muscle, vastus lateralis
muscle and vastus medialis muscle.</p><p>Weak muscle endurance of the abdominal extensor is strongly related to chronic lower back
pain. In particular, multifidus, the core muscle, has an attachment point on the segmental
unit of the lumbar vertebrae, which prevents pain by providing stability of the
segments<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, Nadler reported that the gluteus muscle becomes weak
in patients with lower back pain or impaired lower limb; this weakness can cause
inactivation of the pelvic flexors, rectus femoris, and hamstring muscles, resulting in
dynamic problems. As a result, weakness of gluteus muscles could necessitate treatment of
lower back pain<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A functional decrease such as weakness of muscles and ligaments around the spine occurs due
to the lack of exercise, which is the main risk factor for lower back pain. Muscle weakness
causes functional disorder or pain, leading to disruption in activities of daily living and
occupational activities. Furthermore, it can cause abnormal posture, resulting in anxiety
symptoms and recurring pain<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, the risk of impairments can be reduced by core exercise and stretching exercise
involving the hamstring and flexor muscles around the hip. Similarly, the purpose of
exercises for lower back pain is to increase muscle strength, muscle endurance, and
flexibility<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In general, many interventions have been used such as fitness training, yoga, and belly
dancing to increase back muscle strength. Belly dancing has been reported to improve the
muscles around the spine and pelvis and help in the correction of abnormal posture,
especially among other interventions<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although many studies have reported that
belly dancing has positive effects on functions of the back muscles, there are many
controversial opinions. Furthermore, many therapists believe that belly dancing is not
affordable when compared with other exercises, because of the associated high cost and
time<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. For this reason, Belly-bike&#x02014;an ergometer equipped with a swaying
saddle and offers the belly dance function&#x02014;was developed in Korea so that many people could
easily perform belly dance and ergometer at the same time. Belly-bike is believed to provide
the effects of belly dance and health ergometer and should be affordable for most people who
have lower back pain.</p><p>Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Belly-bike for muscle
strengthening and eliminating lower back pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty-three university students with chronic lower back pain were randomly recruited in

which is called Belly-bike, on lower back pain. For assessment, we used the VAS score and
KODI for the level of pain, straight leg raising and forward reaching tests for muscle
flexibility, and EMG for muscle activation.</p><p>Regarding muscle flexibility, there were significant improvements in the Belly-bike group
after the intervention, and these can be attributed to the belly dance function of the
Belly-bike. A previous study reported that belly dance could improve the diverse functions
of muscle. Srhoj reported that belly dance performance improved muscle flexibility and
integrated coordination<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The vibration
and sway movement during belly dance changed muscle coordination, leading to correction of
muscle imbalance. Our study finding is in line with that of Srhoj&#x02019;s study results.
Furthermore, it is reported that aerobic exercises like belly dance and cycle exercises
could improve muscle strength, endurance, and flexibility<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Increased muscle strength and length would correct muscle
imbalance, resulting in improved flexibility.</p><p>In EMG measurements, statistically significant changes were noted in two muscles&#x02014;rectus
femoris and vastus lateralis&#x02014;but not in the erector spinae and gluteus medius. Previous
studies reported that the weakness of pelvic flexors could cause weakness of the back
muscles such as erector spinae, resulting in muscle imbalance around the pelvis<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Janda reported that this imbalance could
cause lower back pain; he added that once flexor muscles are improved, muscle imbalance
would be corrected and lower back pain would be relieved. To increase muscle strength in
flexors, strengthening exercise and aerobic exercise such as squad, sit-to-stand, walking,
and cycle exercise are mainly recommended these days. Among them, cycle exercise is believed
to have effects of strengthening and aerobic training at the same time. Many previous
studies reported that cycle exercise provides repetitive and intermittent resistance, which
is effective in increasing muscle strength. The results of this study are in line with those
studies.</p><p>The scores of VAS and KODI were significantly decreased in the Belly-bike group after the
intervention. It is reported in many previous studies that lower back pain occurs because of
abnormal muscle balance around the pelvis and abdomen. Indeed, every subject in this study
who suffered from lower back pain had imbalance between back muscles and lower extremity
muscles. After the intervention with the Belly-bike, activation of the rectus femoris and
flexibility of the hamstring muscles were increased. This possibly corrected the muscle
imbalance around the pelvis, resulting in pain relief.</p><p>There are some limitations in this study. First, follow-up tests were not conducted, and
second, all subjects were university students, not varying in age. For these reasons, the
results of this study may not be generalized. Therefore, more studies with a design
compensating for these limitations are needed in the future.</p><p>The results of this study showed that exercise using Belly-bike could be effective in
reducing lower back pain. Many clinicians try to provide their patients with more affordable
and easy ways to reduce pain. Based on this study&#x02019;s findings, it is believed that Belly-bike
is a potential effective approach for the treatment of patients with lower back pain, as it
increases muscle strength and flexibility and corrects muscle imbalance. Although the effect
of findings is controversial among researchers, this study and further studies may deliver
the evidence for this approach to be accepted in the clinical field and home
environment.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Rozenberg</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group>:
