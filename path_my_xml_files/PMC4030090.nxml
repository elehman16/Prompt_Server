The National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management Education defines DSME as &#x0201c;the ongoing process of facilitating the knowledge, skill, and ability necessary for prediabetes and diabetes self-care,&#x0201d; and DSMS consists of &#x0201c;activities that assist the person with prediabetes or diabetes in implementing and sustaining the behaviors needed to manage his or her condition on an ongoing basis beyond or outside of formal self-management training&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>DSME programs have been evaluated extensively (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Yet, to date there is little evidence to guide subsequent DSMS efforts to maintain gains from DSME, especially in low-resource health care systems. Without ongoing DSMS, improvements achieved from DSME programs are short-lived (6 months or less) (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). This is especially the case for low-income ethnic and racial minorities in resource-poor settings such as inner-city communities where adults with diabetes face multiple challenges to self-management (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Federally qualified health centers serving these communities lack resources to maintain professionally staffed care-management programs that can provide between-clinic visit outreach to patients who have completed short-term DSME programs. Thus, in the face of resource constraints, it is critically important to develop and evaluate low-cost, flexible, and sustainable DSMS approaches that do not rely on health care professionals to maintain gains achieved through DSME.</p><p>Intervention studies of DSMS have assessed delivery modalities including group-based support sessions, periodic educational reinforcement, telephone outreach, peer support groups, internet-based discussion boards, and automated telephone reminders (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). These programs have recruited a variety of DSMS interventionists including certified diabetes educators, psychologists, dietitians, care coordinators, physicians, health educators, and peers. To our knowledge, however, there are no published studies comparing two different models of ongoing DSMS delivered by nonprofessionals. Moreover, those few studies that have compared professional staff such as Certified Diabetes Educators and peer supporters have not examined long-term DSMS beyond 6 months (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Accordingly, we compared a peer leader (PL) DSMS intervention with a community health worker (CHW) DSMS intervention as two possible approaches to maintain over a 12-month period health-related gains achieved through Journey to Health (JTH), an evidence-based, CHW-led, 6-month DSME program (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In our prior trials, including one randomized controlled trial (RCT), JTH has been found to significantly improve short-term glycemic control compared with usual care (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research Design and Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Setting and Identification of Patients</title><p>This study was approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board and was developed and implemented using community-based participatory research principles (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). It was conducted in partnership with the Community Health and Social Services (CHASS) Center, Inc., a federally qualified community health center located in Southwest Detroit, and the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH) Detroit partnership, a coalition of community organizations, academic institutions, and health care systems working to improve diabetes outcomes and care in east and southwest Detroit. Approximately 70% of residents of southwest Detroit are Latino of Mexican origin with an annual median household income of 27,248&#x02013;31,097 USD (depending on zip code) and high rates of diabetes and obesity (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>From November 2009 to July 2011, we identified participants from a computer-generated list of potentially eligible patients who were receiving medical care at CHASS with physician-diagnosed type 2 diabetes, were at least 21 years old, had a regular health care provider, and self-identified as Latino. We excluded individuals who had physical limitations preventing participation, terminal health conditions, serious psychiatric illness, and self-reported excessive alcohol or illicit drug use.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Recruitment and Randomization of the PL Versus CHW Telephone Outreach Study</title><p>The patients in this study represent a subsample of patients recruited for an RCT that continued recruitment beyond the time period of this substudy. That study compared outcomes between a larger group of participants receiving the 6-month JTH program and an arm that received enhanced usual care.</p><p>We contacted potentially eligible patients by telephone and screened for eligibility via phone or in the clinic. Eligible patients were invited to a group information session in which they were told that if they were randomized to the 6-month DSME, at the end of the DSME they would be offered either a CHW or a peer-led maintenance program over 12 months. Those interested in participating signed informed consent documents and enrolled in the study. Participants completed a baseline survey, and their HbA<sub>1c</sub>, lipid panel, blood pressure (BP), height, weight, BMI, and waist circumference were measured. Participants were then randomized to one of two arms for the purpose of this substudy: <italic>1</italic>) a 6-month CHW-led JTH Program followed by 12 months of the peer support intervention or <italic>2</italic>) the 6-month CHW-led JTH program followed by 12 months of monthly CHW telephone outreach.</p><p>Random sequence generation and treatment group assignment were determined centrally just prior to the initial session. Sequence was concealed until interventions were assigned. Patients, research staff, and care managers were blinded to randomization results until completion of baseline assessments. Data assessors remained blinded to group assignment throughout the study. Participants received a stipend of 40 USD upon completion of each of the baseline, 6-month, 12-month, and 18-month assessments.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>PLs</title><p>The PLs were volunteers and received only a modest stipend to defray costs of participation (e.g., transportation, child care). To be eligible for the study, PL candidates had to <italic>1</italic>) have diabetes, <italic>2</italic>) be a resident of the southwest Detroit community, <italic>3</italic>) be &#x02265;21 years old, <italic>4</italic>) be bilingual in Spanish and English, <italic>5</italic>) be a graduate of JTH, <italic>6</italic>) have transportation to attend training, and <italic>7</italic>) be willing to commit to 3 months of training. Eligible PL candidates underwent a 46-h training program over 12 weeks (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The training consisted of three main components: review of basic diabetes information; communication, facilitation, and behavior modification skills; and practice applying skills in experiential learning scenarios. Specifically, PL candidates were trained to help patients build motivation for making lifestyle changes, use basic motivational interviewing skills (e.g., active listening and making reflections), apply empowerment-based facilitation strategies, set goals, develop action plans, and problem solve. To graduate successfully, candidates had to meet the pre-established competency criteria for four domains: diabetes knowledge, active listening, empowerment-based facilitation, and self-efficacy.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>CHWs</title><p>The CHWs had an average of 6 years&#x02019; experience leading DSME at CHASS. They were all employees of the health clinic and received a salary. They all came from southwest Detroit, had a high school diploma or GED, and were fluent in Spanish and of Latino origin. There was no requirement for them to have diabetes. They had completed 160 h of community outreach training and 80 h of diabetes education, home visit experiences, human subjects tutorial; had training in behavior modification strategies, JTH curriculum, cultural competency, motivational interviewing techniques, and community-based participatory research; and had basic computer and internet skills.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Description of Intervention</title><sec id="s8"><title>DSME Program</title><p>Both PL and CHW groups participated in the 6-month JTH program (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) delivered by CHWs trained in patient-empowerment approaches (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) and motivational interviewing (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). JTH consisted of three components: eleven 2-h culturally tailored interactive group self-management classes, two home visits (60 min in length) per month to help patients set and follow up on specific self-care goals (action plans), and one visit with the participant and his or her primary care provider. This 6-month program in our prior RCT among adults with diabetes at CHASS led to mean decreases of 0.8% HbA<sub>1c</sub> compared with a 0.0% point drop among participants in the usual-care group (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s9"><title>PL DSMS</title><p>Adapted from the Lifelong Management program of Tang et al. (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), the PL intervention (delivered largely in Spanish) was designed to provide patients with ongoing emotional and behavioral support by PLs through group-based sessions and follow-up telephone contacts. Group-based DSMS sessions were offered weekly, with participants encouraged to attend sessions as often as needed. Based on patient-empowerment principles (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), discussion topics were driven by patients&#x02019; self-identified priorities, questions, and concerns. The PLs did seek to complete at each session the following five tasks: discuss recent self-management challenges, share feelings about these challenges and other aspects of living with diabetes, engage in group-based problem solving, address questions about diabetes and its care, and set self-management goals. The PLs helped participants set goals using the five-step goal-setting model, which includes: <italic>1</italic>) exploring a participant-identified problem, <italic>2</italic>) discussing the emotional impact of the problem, <italic>3</italic>) selecting a self-management goal, <italic>4</italic>) developing an action plan, and <italic>5</italic>) executing and evaluating the action plan (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). PLs also provided support to participants by discussing psychosocial concerns, identifying facilitators and barriers to behavior change, taking inventory of support sources, and developing strategies to navigate the health care system.</p><p>To ensure regular contact with each participant, PLs made a telephone support call to any participant who had not attended a DSMS session over three consecutive weeks. During the telephone support calls, PLs facilitated a conversation that closely mirrored support activities conducted in the group setting.</p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>CHW DSMS</title><p>Similar to the PL intervention, the CHW support is also based on empowerment principles and involved monthly telephone outreach initiated by a CHW over a period of 12 months. The monthly calls were structured around the five-step behavioral goal-setting model described above. During this call, CHWs also offered emotional support and helped participants understand how to effectively use the health care resources available to them. CHWs and participants were also encouraged to exchange email communication when needed.</p></sec><sec id="s11"><title>Outcomes and Measurements</title><p>The primary clinical outcome was HbA<sub>1c</sub>, as measured with a Bayer DCA 2000+ Analyzer (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). This assay has a test coefficient of variation &#x0003c;5% as required by the National Diabetes Data Group. Secondary clinical outcomes included a lipid panel (total cholesterol, LDL, and HDL), BP, BMI, and waist circumference. To measure lipids, we used the Cholestech LDX (Cholestech Corp., Hayward, CA) point-of-care machine (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), which has been found to meet National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines for measuring total cholesterol (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Systolic and diastolic BP were taken with two readings on a Welch Allyn Speidel &#x00026; Keller sphygmomanometer; the average readings were used in the analysis. All clients were weighed on an EverWeigh lithium digital scale. Heights and waist circumference were measured by the same technician at each time point. We used weight and height measurements to calculate BMI as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. Waist circumference was measured using the Tech-Med model cat. no. 4414 measuring tape and was measured at the umbilical waist.</p><p>All other measures were administered orally in patients&#x02019; preferred language (English or Spanish). We assessed diabetes-related distress using the Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS), a 17-item instrument that assesses emotional distress and functioning specific to living with diabetes, with higher scores indicating higher levels of distress (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). We assessed diabetes-specific social support with an adapted version of the Diabetes Support Scale, a six-item instrument that assesses patient-perceived social support as it relates to meeting emotional needs, seeking advice, and obtaining information, with higher scores indicating more support (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s12"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The sample size was estimated for longitudinal analysis with a linear mixed model to detect a difference of 0.6%, or 6.6 mmol/mol, in HbA<sub>1c</sub> change between groups with 80% power and a two-sided &#x003b1; of 0.05. Although the UK Prospective Diabetes Study found that a 0.5%, or 5.5 mmol/mol, mean difference in HbA<sub>1c</sub> translates into a 2.8% absolute risk reduction in diabetes events over a 10-year period (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), for recruitment concerns, our study was powered to detect a difference of 0.6%, or 6.6 mmol/mol. The power calculation was based on an SD of 1.75%, or 19.1 mmol/mol, and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.5 for repeated measures over time on the same individual (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>For our analyses of our primary outcome of HbA<sub>1c</sub>, we examined <italic>1</italic>) whether within-group HbA<sub>1c</sub> gains achieved after 6 months of the JTH program were sustained at 18 months after receipt of their assigned DSMS intervention and <italic>2</italic>) whether there were differences in HbA<sub>1c</sub> between the two groups at 18 months. Success of either arm in maintaining gains is indicated when <italic>P</italic> values &#x0003c; 0.05 are observed between baseline and follow-up time points, indicating that improvements in HbA<sub>1c</sub> at month 6 were sustained at months 12 and 18. Secondary outcomes included sustained improvement at 18 months of changes between baseline and 6 months in cardiovascular disease risk factors, including total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, BP, BMI, and waist circumference, and the self-reported psychosocial measures.</p><p>All analyses were intention to treat. All continuous measures, except diabetes duration, were compared between the PL intervention and the CHW telephone outreach intervention with the Student <italic>t</italic> test. Diabetes duration was analyzed with the log-rank test . To check for differences between groups in categorical variables, the Fisher exact test was used if the expected count in any cell was under 5; Pearson &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was used for all other categorical variables.</p><p>All longitudinal outcomes, except the DDS, were analyzed by using a linear mixed model, except for the DDS, which was analyzed using a generalized estimating equation. Both the generalized estimating equation and linear mixed model allow for correlation among observations on the same person and enable participants to be included in the analysis if they had data at one or more time points (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). All models were adjusted for time (6, 12, and 18 months), study group, a time &#x000d7; study group interaction, and the baseline value. For all outcomes, the &#x0201c;intervention effect&#x0201d; was estimated as a contrast between the changes from baseline to follow-up between the two intervention groups.</p></sec><sec id="s13"><title>Treatment of Missing Data</title><p>We also conducted sensitivity analyses that included variables for diabetes, cholesterol, and blood pressure medication intensification to ensure that intervention effects were not principally due to medication intensification.

No significant differences in mean or percentage contacts were found between the PL and CHW groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s25"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Among this sample of low-income, predominantly Spanish-speaking adults with diabetes who receive care at a federally qualified health center, both the PL and CHW interventions were effective in sustaining achieved HbA<sub>1c</sub> improvements from a 6-month CHW-led DSME program up to and including 12-month follow-up. At 18-month follow-up, the groups diverged as the PL group sustained improvement in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, while the CHW group did not. However, it should be noted that there were no significant between-group differences in the amount of improvement observed between the groups.</p><p>Unlike the CHW group, the PL group sustained statistically and clinically significant improvements in HbA<sub>1c</sub> and BP to 18 months. By design, the PL intervention of weekly face-to-face group sessions supplemented by telephone support calls offers greater intensity and frequency of support to participants than the CHW intervention of monthly telephone support calls supplemented by emails. Therefore, any advantages in long-term health maintenance by the PL group should be interpreted with caution. However, since there was no difference in the mean number of PL participant and CHW participant contacts, these findings cannot be attributed to a treatment dosage effect. It is possible that the PL intervention outperformed the CHW telephone intervention because participants felt a closer connection and greater identification with PLs who also live with the challenges of having diabetes. This question should be explored in future studies.</p><p>As originally designed, the core support mechanism of the PL intervention was intended to be weekly group support sessions. Although regular logs were not kept, the PLs all reported having substantially more telephone support contact with participants than group-based face-to-face contact. While we expected variations in preferred communication modality across participants, we did not predict that the originally designed group intervention would essentially transform into a telephone outreach intervention. Upon further investigation, we learned that it required great effort for some patients to attend sessions (e.g., taking two different bus lines to reach the clinic). Other participants had other priorities (e.g., child care, employment) that took precedence over attending a weekly peer-led session. Consistent with these reports, in a qualitative study of 37 Latino adults with personal or familial experience with diabetes, Baig et al. (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) found lack of time a major deterrent to attending regular group-based, peer-led self-management interventions. Consequently, we did not actually test two different delivery modalities as the primary support mechanism, as both interventions consisted of telephone outreach. Notwithstanding, we were still able to compare two similar interventions delivered by two different types of interventionists (PL vs. CHW) who were not formal health care professionals.</p><p>To date, all RCTs investigating CHW-led diabetes self-management interventions targeting the Latino community have focused on comparing CHWs with usual care (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), CHWs with CHWs using different interventions (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), CHWs versus attention control (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), and CHWs versus wait-list usual care (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The current study is the first to use a rigorously designed RCT to compare the effectiveness of two different types of nonprofessional delivery models in sustaining diabetes-related health outcomes. That both interventions produced positive clinical and psychosocial outcomes has important implications for health systems in low-resource settings. It should be noted that not all Latino communities find a peer support model culturally acceptable. However, with respect to the current study, the majority of participants agreed that having a PL was important (81%) and that the PLs played a critical role in the intervention (100%).</p><p>Like other studies using nonprofessional delivery models (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), we did not include a formal cost-effectiveness analysis. The few CHW-led interventions that have examined cost-related variables have reported favorable results (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). While not comprehensive, we did document some basic data that allows us to compare the relative labor-related costs of the PL and CHW interventions. PLs in this study received a small stipend for training and intervention delivery (annual stipend of ~1,000 USD), while the CHWs were salaried employees receiving benefits (annual salary ~29,120 USD). Compared with CHWs, training PLs to provide ongoing DSMS might thus result in substantial cost savings, especially in settings in which CHWs are not already employed. For communities that do not have the financial resources to even hire CHWs, recruiting and training PLs could be a viable evidence-based option.</p><p>Some limitations need mentioning. First, as noted, in the absence of a formal cost-effectiveness analysis we cannot demonstrate any cost savings or quality-adjusted life-years associated with the two interventions. Second, given that the PL and CHW interventions were designed to offer different treatment intensity levels, comparing the two interventions may not have been equitable. Fortunately, our analysis of mean number of participant-reported contacts revealed that intervention dosage was similar for both groups. Third, our follow-up rate of 59% was low compared with the 63&#x02013;93% range reported in other studies targeting the Latino community (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). However, this 18-month intervention was lengthier (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) and used a stricter definition for &#x0201c;dropouts&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) than some other studies. While we used effective retention strategies such as requesting contact information from multiple friends or family members and accommodating participants&#x02019; availability for assessments, we were not able to use more costly methods such as providing paid taxis, conducting assessments at participants&#x02019; homes, or hiring staff dedicated exclusively to addressing participant retention. Clearly, for very low-income, non&#x02013;English speaking populations, future research needs to explore more effective and sustainable yet low-cost approaches to keeping participants engaged.</p><p>In conclusion, among these low-income inner-city Latino adults with diabetes, both PL-led and CHW-led DSMS models resulted in maintenance of gains achieved in an evidence-based DSME program. The sustained improvements in HbA<sub>1c</sub> that we observed are equivalent to those achieved in more resource-intensive health professional&#x02013;led care management programs<bold>.</bold> This is encouraging news to health care centers in low-resource settings facing significant financial constraints. It suggests that to promote long-term ongoing diabetes self-management efforts, we may need only to look toward individuals in our own communities as valuable sources for self-management support.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
