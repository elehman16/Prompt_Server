Antenatal care (ANC) is the entry point into the healthcare system for most women, so it is important to understand how ANC affects aspects of women&#x02019;s sense of control over their pregnancy. We compare pregnancy-related empowerment for women randomly assigned to the standard of care versus CenteringPregnancy-based group ANC (intervention) in two sub-Saharan countries, Malawi and Tanzania.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Pregnant women in Malawi (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;112) and Tanzania (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;110) were recruited into a pilot study and randomized to individual ANC or group ANC. Retention at late pregnancy was 81% in Malawi and 95% in Tanzania. In both countries, individual ANC, termed focused antenatal care (FANC), is the standard of care. FANC recommends four ANC visits plus a 6-week post-birth visit and is implemented following the country's standard of care. In group ANC, each contact included self- and midwife-assessments in group space and 90&#x000a0;minutes of interactive health promotion. The number of contacts was the same for both study conditions. We measured pregnancy-related empowerment in late pregnancy using the Pregnancy-Related Empowerment Scale (PRES). Independent samples <italic>t</italic>-tests and multiple linear regressions were employed to assess whether group ANC led to higher PRES scores than individual ANC and to investigate other sociodemographic factors related to pregnancy-related empowerment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">In Malawi, women in group ANC had higher PRES scores than those in individual ANC. Type of care was a significant predictor of PRES and explained 67% of the variation. This was not so in Tanzania; PRES scores were similar for both types of care. Predictive models including sociodemographic variables showed religion as a potential moderator of treatment effect in Tanzania. Muslim women in group ANC had a higher mean PRES score than those in individual ANC; a difference not observed among Christian women.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Group ANC empowers pregnant women in some contexts. More research is needed to identify the ways that models of ANC can affect pregnancy-related empowerment in addition to perinatal outcomes globally.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12884-017-1493-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par11">Empowerment is a complex multidimensional concept that can be broadly defined as the ability of individuals or groups &#x0201c;<italic>to improve capacities, to critically analyze situations and to take actions to improve those situations</italic>&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In sub-Saharan Africa, women&#x02019;s overall empowerment has been positively associated with the utilization of maternal health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], use of contraception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], improved infant feeding practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and reductions in infant mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Given the positive associations between general empowerment and maternal-child health, it is important to consider women&#x02019;s empowerment as it relates to health and healthcare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Health-related empowerment is a construct that was developed to examine ways that healthcare setting factors relate to clients&#x02019; perceived control over health-related decisions and behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, most health-related empowerment research has focused on chronic health conditions, such as mental health, diabetes, cancers, and disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], with less focus on women&#x02019;s health-related empowerment, especially in low-resource settings.</p><p id="Par13">Since maternal and child health services comprise women&#x02019;s primary contact with the healthcare system in sub-Saharan Africa, it is important to understand how the delivery of these services reflects women&#x02019;s values and sense of control over their own health. Pregnancy and antenatal care (ANC) are often the entry into the cascade of maternal and child health services, including prevention of maternal-to-child transmission of HIV, labor and delivery, postnatal services, contraception, and well-child care. During pregnancy, most women are essentially healthy and able to actively engage in their own healthcare. Women who report being empowered should be able to increase uptake of healthy behaviors, such as completing the recommended number of ANC or postnatal contacts. However, little is known about women&#x02019;s empowerment during pregnancy or the factors that foster pregnancy-related empowerment.</p><p id="Par14">Most countries in sub-Saharan Africa follow the World Health Organization&#x02019;s recommendations and have adopted a four-contact model termed focused antenatal care (FANC) as the standard of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. FANC was designed to offer high-quality, intensive, and woman-centered ANC visits, now referred to as contacts, indicating the importance of an active connection between women and her provider [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, acute health worker shortages and underfunding prevent FANC from being implemented as intended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Properly conducting FANC should take 45&#x000a0;minutes for the first contact and 35 for follow-up contacts. However, an observational study in Tanzania documented that the average first contact lasted 12&#x000a0;minutes and follow-up contacts lasted only 7&#x000a0;minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Moreover, health workers did not provide all recommended services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and were often disrespectful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Perhaps reflecting the poor quality of services, many women do not complete the recommended number of contacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">To address some of these gaps, our team adapted and piloted a model of group ANC based on CenteringPregnancy&#x000ae; (CP) for use in the two sub-Saharan African countries where our team had prior research experience, Malawi and Tanzania [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. CP integrates three important dimensions of woman-centered care, namely healthcare in group space, interactive learning, and community building [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Its efficacy has been well documented in the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In CP, the same group of 8&#x02013;12 women meet with the same providers in 2-hour ANC contacts throughout pregnancy. One provider can serve 12 clients in 120&#x000a0;minutes. This is similar to the length of observed individual FANC contacts, but group contacts provide each woman with up to 90&#x000a0;minutes of interactive discussions.</p><p id="Par16">To examine the impact of individual ANC versus group ANC on women&#x02019;s empowerment during pregnancy, we needed a measure of pregnancy-related empowerment. At present, only one scale exists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The Pregnancy-Related Empowerment Scale (PRES) evaluates the quality of communication and connectedness pregnant women feel with their care providers and peers, their participation in decision-making, and their capacity to recognize and engage in pregnancy-related healthy behaviors. The PRES builds upon the concept of health-related empowerment and integrates social theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], feminist theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], and Bandura&#x02019;s theory of self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The PRES was validated as a tool to measure empowerment among low-income pregnant African American and Hispanic women in the U.S., but it has not been used in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p id="Par17">The purpose of this paper was to compare pregnancy-related empowerment, as measured by PRES scores, for women who attended individual ANC and CP-based group ANC at clinics in Malawi and Tanzania. We expected women in group ANC to have higher PRES scores because group care builds self-care skills, and offers continuity of care, more health promotion, and more contact time with providers and other women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. For each country, we examined the relationship between type of ANC and PRES scores, controlling for eight sociodemographic factors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p id="Par18">This two-arm randomized controlled pilot study compared PRES scores for those assigned to individual ANC or CP-based group ANC (group ANC) at sites in rural Malawi and urban Tanzania.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Setting and sample</title><p id="Par19">Malawi and Tanzania are both low-income countries with high rates of maternal and infant mortality, but Malawi is substantially poorer and a larger proportion of its population is rural [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The study site located in central Malawi offered group ANC at two clinics, one located at a rural hospital and the other a rural health centre. The Tanzanian site included one clinic located in the city center of Dar es Salaam.</p><p id="Par20">Between August and November of 2014, pregnant women who were 20&#x02013;24 weeks pregnant, over age 16 and capable of completing study procedures were recruited and assessed for eligibility to participate. ANC midwives informed pregnant women that a research project was being conducted and, if the women were interested, the midwife escorted them to a private space in the clinic where research staff provided further information about the study. A total of 223 pregnant women were assessed for eligibility and 218 women provided consent. Baseline surveys, translated to Chichewa (Malawi) and Swahili (Tanzania), were administered to women using a touch screen computer and customized Computer-Assisted Personal Interview software developed at Tufts University [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. After completing the baseline survey, a research assistant brought a basket filled with envelopes with equal numbers of assignments (1:1 ratio) to each study condition into the room. Women chose and opened one sealed envelope. Study condition assignment was concealed to research staff and women until the envelope was opened and the enclosed card was read aloud.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study conditions</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Individual ANC (standard of care)</title><p id="Par21">Women enrolled in individual ANC received FANC, the standard of practice in both countries. Women arriving to the antenatal clinic are served on a first come, first served basis. At some point in the day as women wait for services, they are assembled in the waiting area so that a midwife can deliver a health lecture on a predetermined topic. Where available, women complete laboratory tests and are encouraged to get an HIV test. Women have a one-on-one physical assessment and discussion with a midwife in a private room. The midwife (or an assistant) weighs her and takes and records her vitals. The expected number of ANC contacts is four and she may or may not see the same midwife over the course of the four contacts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Group ANC (intervention)</title><p id="Par22">For women enrolled in group ANC, the same midwife and co-facilitator provide 2&#x000a0;hours of care, education, and support for 12 women at each of the scheduled group ANC contacts. In Tanzania, women first go to the lab for services and then go to the group space. In Malawi, women do not routinely receive lab services, so they go directly to the group space upon arrival. In addition to socializing with group members, women participate in self-care activities by measuring and recording their own weight and vital signs. Each woman then has a 3- to 5-minute private meeting with the midwife in a corner of the group space. They discuss her health data and personal problems and the midwife conducts a physical assessment. If further examination is needed it is usually provided after the session ends. If a woman expresses a general concern or problem, the midwife will suggest that this be shared and discussed with the entire group either by the woman or by the midwife. After individual assessments are complete, the midwife and co-facilitator join the circle of women and facilitate interactive discussions using pre-arranged activities. Each session is appropriate for gestational age, but the discussion is fluid; women can bring up additional topics and the time allotted can change by degree of engagement.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Measures</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Dependent variable</title><p id="Par23">The PRES is a 16-item Likert-type scale used to assess women&#x02019;s sense of control over their pregnancy-related health and healthcare. Responses for each item ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree); the scale has a maximum score of 64. Scale development and content validity, as well as reliability for a sample of pregnant women in the USA, are described by Klima et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Independent variables</title><p id="Par24">Type of care (individual ANC or group ANC), was the primary independent variable for this study. Both Malawi and Tanzania administer ANC following FANC guidelines.</p><p id="Par25">Based on established associations with pregnancy experiences and outcomes, we examined several sociodemographic factors. Age was divided into three groups (&#x0003c;20, 20&#x02013;34, 35+) since adolescents and older mothers have different risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Other variables included gravidity (primigravida or multigravida), religion (Muslim or Christian), and four indicators of socioeconomic status. Education was categorized into three categories (less than primary school, primary school completion, and more than primary school). We also looked at whether the woman said she was a subsistence farmer, indicative of a more rural lifestyle. We assessed extreme poverty using a single question regarding food insecurity &#x02013; whether the woman had experienced lack of food or money to buy food in the past four weeks. To obtain some sense of the other end of the economic spectrum in terms of disposable income, we constructed an 10-item assets index that reflected how many of these items were owned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Procedure</title><p id="Par26">Prior to data collection we received approvals from three institutional review boards &#x02013; the University of Illinois at Chicago, the College of Medicine Research and Ethics Committee in Malawi, and the National Institute for Medical Research in Tanzania. We also received approval from the Ministries of Health and administrators at participating sites. We recruited participants, obtained informed consent and conducted the baseline survey. Women either attended individual ANC or group ANC throughout their pregnancy. The late pregnancy interview and PRES tool were scheduled to take place after the woman&#x02019;s fourth ANC contact (between 32 and 38&#x000a0;weeks). When possible, the project manager made reminder phone calls. This strategy worked well in Tanzania, where over 95% of women had access to a cell phone, but was less successful in Malawi, where only 34% had access to a phone. Another strategy was meeting women at the clinic. For women in group ANC, the country project managers knew when the last group contact was scheduled, and thus made arrangements for the interviewers to be present at the clinic on those days. All interviews were conducted using the same in-person interview procedures for both individual and group participants. Extensive training of interviewers and use of the Computer-Assisted Personal Interview minimized potential interviewer bias.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Analyses</title><p id="Par27">Analyses were conducted separately for Malawi and Tanzania because baseline characteristics were significantly different for the two countries. We examined baseline sociodemographic factors of the study participants by study condition. Independent samples <italic>t</italic>-tests and Wilcoxon rank sums tests were employed to assess if mean PRES scores differed by study condition. In addition, we investigated sociodemographic factors to identify additional characteristics associated with pregnancy-related empowerment using model selection that maximized adjusted R-squared considering all subsets of predictors. Among the models selected, we tested moderation of treatment effect by the other variables in the models using two-way interaction terms.</p><p id="Par28">In our primary analyses, participants with missing data were excluded through list-wise deletion.

</p><p id="Par35">In Tanzania, the predictive model included type of care, religion, and gravidity. We examined two-way interactions of type of care with the other variables, retaining the marginally significant type of care by religion interaction. This model shows that Muslim women had lower empowerment than Christian women, except when receiving group care, in which case their empowerment level was similar to Christian women. In addition, though not statistically significant, group care and having a previous pregnancy were associated with greater pregnancy-related empowerment controlling for all variables in the model. This model predicted only 7% of the variability in PRES scores in Tanzania. Due to the findings of this predictive model, we examined the type of care effect on PRES stratified by religion using Wilcoxon rank sums two-sample tests. Muslim women in group ANC had higher mean PRES compared to individual care (mean (SD) group ANC, 51.3 (7.3); individual ANC, 47.1 (3.5); Wilcoxon&#x02009;=&#x02009;421.5, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0153) whereas group and individual care were not significantly different among Christian women (group ANC, 51.7(7.0); individual ANC, 52.2 (7.4); Wilcoxon&#x02009;=&#x02009;651.0, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.9921).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par36">To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use the PRES outside of the USA. For each country, the scale had good&#x000a0;internal consistency reliability (&#x003b1;&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.95).</p><p id="Par37">CP-based group ANC is designed to provide continuity of care, build self-care skills, and ensure the forming of connections with providers as well as other pregnant women in the group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Community building occurs as women and providers get to know one another and explore shared experiences. Therefore, we expected that participation in group ANC would result in higher levels of pregnancy-related empowerment.</p><p id="Par38">This expectation was only partially confirmed in this study. Group ANC was strongly related to higher pregnancy-related empowerment in Malawi. In Tanzania, overall pregnancy-related empowerment did not differ by type of care. However, among Muslim women, group ANC was associated with significantly higher pregnancy-related empowerment, but type of care was not associated with pregnancy-related empowerment among Christian women.</p><p id="Par39">Given our small sample and the lack of both urban and rural sites in each country, identification of possible factors contributing to these country differences is speculative. One factor that needs more exploration is whether women in urban settings have access to a wider range of opportunities and are, in general, more empowered prior to pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. However, if this were the case, group ANC should have the same effect for all urban women. Instead, Muslim women in Tanzania had slightly higher PRES scores if they were in group ANC. Muslim women in this sample were younger and reported more food insecurity, suggesting that they are socioeconomically disadvantaged compared to Christian women in this sa&#x0feff;mple. Lower levels of empowerment in health-related decision-making among Muslims have been reported in other African countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. These findings are also congruent with USA studies showing that CP group ANC had greater benefits among more marginalized groups of women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">A second possible factor may be related to perception of quality of care. Group ANC may not have as great an effect on pregnancy-related empowerment in clinics where individual care is perceived as high quality. The site in Dar es Salaam has a reputation for being one of the better government facilities in the city and serves a population of emp&#x0feff;loyed women. Since women make decisions about health services based on perceived quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], the women who chose to come to this clinic may have already had higher pregnancy-related empowerment.</p><p id="Par41">A third factor may be related to the length of group sessions. Women in group ANC in Malawi received nearly twice as much contact time per session as women in Tanzania, where sessions lasted approximately 2&#x000a0;hours. In Malawi, the facilitators implemented the model with flexibility and allowed sessions to continue until all issues were discussed. Although this made the sessions longer than intended, the longer sessions may have contributed to greater pregnancy-related empowerment. In the context of four recommended antenatal contacts in both countries, ANC clients might benefit from the additional discussion time, either as longer sessions or more contacts, especially since the number of ANC contacts is considerably higher in most high-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Recently, the World Health Organization has reevaluated ANC recommendations and supports increasing the total number of contacts to eight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The issue of the optimal number of ANC contacts and total contact time during pregnancy certainly requires additional research.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par42">A major limitation of this pilot was the lack of comparable urban and rural sites in both countries. We had initially planned to have four sites, one rural and one urban in each country; however, funding constraints forced us to limit the study. We felt it was important to examine whether group ANC could be implemented successfully in both rural and urban settings. Large urban metropolises, such as Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, offer many unique challenges. We also wanted to examine whether group ANC could work in settings with severely limited resources for both the health system and pregnant women. The substantially greater national poverty in Malawi made it an ideal setting for the study. This design provided strong evidence regarding the robustness of the CP-based ANC model in two very different settings. Because of our design choices, we are unable to disentangle the urban-rural and country differences. A larger randomized controlled study will allow for exploration of these issues.</p><p id="Par43">A second limitation is that we only collected PRES data once in pregnancy. Because the PRES focused on ANC experiences, it was not appropriate to ask these questions at baseline. However, measurement of pregnancy-related empowerment at multiple time points in pregnancy would allow examination of whether PRES changes over the course of pregnancy and whether these changes are related to type of care.</p><p id="Par44">Finally, differences between groups due to attrition bias are another potential limitation. However, the two approaches we used to examine the impact of missing data suggested that it had minimal effect on the results of this study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusion and implications</title><p id="Par45">This study provides evidence that ANC models affect pregnancy-related empowerment in some contexts. These pilot results indicate that, in a rural setting in Malawi where poverty is high, a CP-based group ANC model was associated with higher levels of pregnancy empowerment. However, in an urban setting in Tanzania, the same group ANC model was only related to higher pregnancy-related empowerment among Muslim women.</p><p id="Par46">Education, socioeconomic status, parity, and partner status minimally related to pregnancy-related empowerment in this study. These results suggest that pregnancy-related empowerment is a distinct psychosocial phenomenon that does not simply mirror common sociodemographic factors. Moreover, changing the ANC model of care can have an impact on pregnancy-related empowerment in some contexts.</p><p id="Par47">Pregnancy-related empowerment is important in sub-Saharan Africa, where low quality ANC and severe health worker shortages contribute to poor maternal and infant outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. CP-based group ANC is a promising model to address these challenges and to increase pregnancy-related empowerment for some&#x000a0;women. More research is needed to identify the ways that models of ANC can affect feelings of empowerment and perinatal outcomes for pregnant women globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Open peer review</title><p id="Par48">Peer review reports for this article are available in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec18"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par55">
