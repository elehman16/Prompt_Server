In the recent past, the herb has attained much commercial significance, both in domestic and international markets. However, limited clinical data is available to establish its traditional claims. The present study was aimed at evaluating the effect of the water soluble extract of CB root tubers on semen and testosterone in healthy adult males. The research was designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, trial upon the volunteers registered from the outpatient department (OPD) with age ranging from 20 to 40 years. Water extracts of CB and placebo was administered in the patients of groups A and B, for 12 weeks, in two divided doses of 500 mg. Assessment was done based upon Semen (Volume, Liquefaction Time, Sperm Count, Sperm motility) and Serum Testosterone levels parameters. Highly significant improvement was noted in the above parameters after administration of CB extract in comparison to Placebo. Hence it was concluded that the trial drug was effective in improving male sexual health.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Chlorophytum borivilianum</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Shweta Musali</italic></kwd><kwd>semen</kwd><kwd>testosterone</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Vajikarana</italic> has remained one of the major healthcare segments from yore, because this is said to enhance not only sexual performance, but also improves the quality of the off-springs.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The segment has become more important in the recent past, because the changing lifestyle is taking a toll on the status of male sexual health in the global population. The incidence of infertility, erectile dysfunction, subnormal desire and performance in sexual intercourse are increasing alarmingly.</p><p>Approximately 15-20 percent of all cohabiting couples are infertile. Up to 50 percent of these cases belong to male infertility, which means that nearly 7.5 to 10 percent of all men in the reproductive age group are infertile. Erectile dysfunction is said to afflict as much as 10 percent of the male population.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Conventional medicine has discovered few chemicals in this segment, but these agents are associated with many unwanted and serious adverse effects. Therefore, traditional medicines like Ayurveda and Chinese medicines have been the mainstay in this segment. However, owing to the associated hype and mystic, the activities of genuine herbs are subjected to criticism due to lack of scientific validation. The answer to this pessimism lies in the appropriate scientific evaluation of the genuine herbs improving male sexual health.</p><p><italic>Chlorophytum borivilianum</italic> (CB) or <italic>Shweta Mushalee</italic>, popularly known as <italic>Safed Musli</italic> is an important herb in the Ayurvedic Materia Medica.

Owing to its marked clinical results, CB is being promoted as herbal Viagra. Experimental studies reaffirm its role in sexual behavior, spermatogenic activity,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] immunomodulatory activity,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] anti-stress and anti-oxidant activities.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Clinical trials also confirm its positive impact on sexual behavior, sperm count, and so on.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>The present study was designed to assess the effect of CB on the semen and testosterone of healthy male adult volunteers in the age group of 20 to 40 years.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Objective</title><p>To assess the effect of the water extract of <italic>Chlorophytum borivilianum</italic> root tubers on semen and testosterone in healthy adult males.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study design</title><p>A randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Study population</title><p>The study population was made up of apparently healthy and consenting male volunteers between 20 to 40 years of age, registered at the OPD of NIA, Jaipur.

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-5"><title>Discussion</title><p><italic>C. borivilianum</italic> is a popular drug, and its root tubers are used for improving male sexual health. The water extract of the plant has shown similar activity and has been found to be safe. The study aims to reaffirm the traditional claim that the extract of this plant improves male sexual health, by assessing its effect on semen and testosterone, which are the nearest equivalents of <italic>Shukradhatu</italic>.</p><p>The treated group showed a statistically highly significant improvement in all the assessed parameters of semen, whereas, the placebo group showed no significant improvement in these parameters. The treated group showed statistically significant improvement in serum testosterone, but in a lesser degree in comparison to the semen parameters.</p><p>The most significant changes were seen in the semen volume and sperm count, in comparison to sperm motility, indicating the greater selective role of the trial drug in these two parameters. The trial drug contains saponin and stigmasterol, which are hypothesized to stimulate the process of spermatogenesis and the mucilage present in the trial drug is supposed to have a role in increasing the volume of semen.</p><p>The trial drug did not exert such a significant effect on the serum testosterone level of the volunteers, although the improvements were better than in the placebo group. This could be due to the presence of normal levels of serum testosterone in almost all volunteers, leaving very little scope for improvement. Another trial involving subjects with diminished serum testosterone might clarify its activity, because <italic>C. borivilianum</italic> contains stigmasterol which hypothetically should have an effect on testosterone.</p><p>The absence of any adverse drug reactions (ADRs) suggests that <italic>C. borivilianum</italic> is a well-tolerated medicine in the trial dose and can be used for a longer duration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The findings of the study prompt the authors to suggest that, Water extract of <italic>Chlorophytum borivilianum</italic> improves the quantity and quality of semen in a statistically significant manner in healthy male adults between 20 to 40 years of age, in comparison to the placebo, when used for 12 weeks, in a dose of 500 mg b.i.d. Water extract of <italic>Chlorophytum borivilianum</italic> does improve the serum testosterone level in a majority of volunteers in a trial dose, in comparison to the placebo, but a statistically significant effect was not observed. No volunteer developed any ADR, confirming its safety for human use. Therefore, the study corroborates the traditional claim that <italic>Chlorophytum borivilianum</italic> is a Shukraldravya, as it improves the semen and testosterone, the commonly accepted equivalents of <italic>Shukradhatu</italic>.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Agnivesha</surname></name><name><surname>Charaka</surname></name><name><surname>Dridhabala</surname></name></person-group><article-title>Chikitsa sthana, 1st Chapter, 1st pada, 9-10th Verse with Ayurveda Dipika commentary of Chakrapani Dutta, Pt.
