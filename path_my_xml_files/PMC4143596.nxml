Studies with methylphenidate modified release long acting (MPH-LA) in children have reported the need for treatment optimization for improved outcomes. We report the results from a post hoc analysis of a 5-week dose optimization phase from a large randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter 40-week study (9-week double-blind dose confirmation phase, 5-week open-label dose optimization phase, and 26-week double-blind maintenance of effect phase).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Patients entering the open-label dose optimization phase initiated treatment with MPH-LA 20&#x000a0;mg/day; up/down titrated to their optimal dose (at which there was balance between control of symptoms and side effects) of 40, 60, or 80&#x000a0;mg/day in increments of 20&#x000a0;mg/week by week 12 or 13.

While studies conducted in children and adolescents with stimulants report a dose&#x02013;response relationship, in adults such a dose&#x02013;response relationship has not been clearly established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Moreover, studies conducted in children also report that treatment optimization with individual dose titration and careful monitoring of adverse events (AEs) provides improvement in ADHD symptoms and a good tolerability profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. For the treatment of adults with ADHD, the European consensus statement recommends individual dose adjustment based on response and tolerability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Methylphenidate modified release long acting (MPH-LA) is a modified-release formulation of methylphenidate, designed to deliver a bimodal release of the drug so as to mimic a &#x02018;twice-a-day&#x02019; dosing regimen. It uses the Spheroidal Oral Drug Absorption System (SODAS) technology comprising 50&#x000a0;% immediate-release formulation and 50&#x000a0;% extended-release beads. In a 40-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study using this formulation, comprising three phases [a double-blind dose confirmation phase (9&#x000a0;weeks), open-label dose optimization phase (5&#x000a0;weeks), and double-blind maintenance of effect phase (6&#x000a0;months)], MPH-LA, used at a fixed dose of 40&#x02013;80&#x000a0;mg/day in adults with ADHD in the 9-week dose confirmation phase, controlled symptoms as well as decreased functional impairment.</p><p>NICE guidelines recommend individual, patient-tailored titration of the dose of methylphenidate so as to achieve optimal treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Therefore, the open-label dose optimization phase was conducted to determine the optimal dose of MPH-LA, such that during the double-blind maintenance of effect phase patients could receive their optimal dose or placebo and be analyzed for the maintenance of effect of MPH-LA. Thus, it was of interest to study whether all three doses (40, 60, and 80&#x000a0;mg) are optimal in the management of ADHD patients. There was no dose&#x02013;response relationship observed between the fixed doses used and the response rate during the dose confirmation phase. Moreover, all three doses used were well-tolerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The main objective of this post hoc analysis of the 5-week open-label dose optimization phase was to evaluate the optimal MPH-LA dose to which patients respond with minimal AEs. It was also of interest to see whether patients who received a particular dose (40, 60, or 80&#x000a0;mg/day) in the 9-week randomized phase continued on the same dose as optimal therapy during the open-label phase.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design and Treatment</title><p>The detailed methodology has been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and is briefly summarized here. This study was conducted at 67 sites in nine countries and designed in accordance with the guidelines issued by the European Medical Agency (EMA) (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/431734/2008) with respect to investigation of medicinal products for ADHD treatment. The protocol (NCT01259492) was in line with the Declaration of Helsinki and ethical approval was obtained before the start of the study.</p><p>This was a 40-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, international, multicenter efficacy and safety study of MPH-LA for the treatment of adult patients with ADHD. Both male and female patients (18&#x02013;60&#x000a0;years) with all types of ADHD according to <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>, fourth edition (DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria (and a confirmed childhood onset) and a DSM-IV ADHD Rating Scale (DSM-IV ADHD&#x000a0;RS) total score of &#x02265;30 at screening and baseline were included in the study. The study design consisted of three treatment phases (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), as follows: (1) A 9-week double-blind dose confirmation phase, in which all eligible patients (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;725) were randomized (1:1:1:1) to once-daily MPH-LA 40, 60, 80&#x000a0;mg/day, or placebo (3-week titration, 6-week fixed dose). Treatment was initiated at a dose of 20&#x000a0;mg/day and increased at weekly intervals in increments of 20&#x000a0;mg/day until the assigned dose of 40&#x000a0;mg, 60&#x000a0;mg, or 80&#x000a0;mg was reached. Following the 3-week titration period, patients received their allocated dose for a period of 6&#x000a0;weeks. (2) A 5-week open-label dose optimization phase, in which all patients, including those treated with placebo in the dose confirmation phase, received MPH-LA. (3) A 6-month double-blind maintenance of effect phase, in which patients were re-randomized in a 3:1 ratio either to their optimal dose of MPH-LA (40, 60, or 80&#x000a0;mg/day) or placebo to evaluate the maintenance effect of MPH-LA in adults with ADHD. During this 6-month withdrawal period, patients with &#x02265;30&#x000a0;% worsening from baseline of this maintenance of effect phase and &#x0003c;30&#x000a0;% remaining improvement from the dose confirmation phase baseline on the DSM-IV ADHD RS were required to discontinue the study due to a lack of therapeutic effect.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Study design including the three study phases and extension study: double-blind dose confirmation phase, open-label dose optimization phase, double-blind maintenance of effect phase, and the long-term safety extension.

Optimal dose was defined as the dose considered by the investigator as achieving an optimal balance between control of symptoms and AEs that was maintained for a period of at least 1&#x000a0;week prior to the last week (Week&#x000a0;14 of the study) of this phase.</p><p>In the open-label dose optimization phase, the dose of MPH-LA was re-titrated on an individual basis for all patients. All patients, including those on placebo during the dose confirmation phase, received MPH-LA starting at 20&#x000a0;mg/day, which was increased at weekly intervals in increments of 20&#x000a0;mg/day until each patient&#x02019;s optimal dose (40, 60, or 80&#x000a0;mg) was reached. Patients were allowed to down-titrate the dose by 20&#x000a0;mg/day on Week 12 or 13 of the study at the discretion of the investigator. At the last visit, all responders, defined as patients with &#x02265;30&#x000a0;% improvement on the DSM-IV ADHD&#x000a0;RS compared to the baseline score at the start of the dose confirmation phase, entered the double-blind maintenance of effect phase.</p><p>Non-responders to MPH-LA during the optimization phase, defined as &#x0003c;30&#x000a0;% improvement in DSM-IV ADHD&#x000a0;RS compared to the baseline of the dose confirmation phase, were discontinued from the study and treated at the discretion of the investigator.</p><p>Subjects with a prior history of poor response, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to stimulants were excluded from the study. Other exclusion criteria included presence of pre-existing cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or any other psychiatric disorder requiring medical intervention/therapy; pregnancy; seizures; recent alcohol or drug abuse; patients with a &#x02265;30&#x000a0;% improvement in DSM-IV ADHD&#x000a0;RS total score at baseline relative to that at screening; and patients on other investigational drugs at the time of enrollment or within 30&#x000a0;days or five half-lives of enrollment (whichever was longer).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Compliance with Ethics and Guidelines</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board at each participating center and the study was conducted in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice, the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975, as revised in 2000 and 2008, and other applicable local regulations. Written informed consent was provided by all patients before enrollment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Assessments</title><p>The primary objective of the open-label dose optimization phase was to assess the optimal dose needed for the management of ADHD. Safety assessments included monitoring of all AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) during each week (10, 11, 12, 13, and 14) of this phase. Clinical laboratory parameters and cardiac safety parameters were also monitored. All data were summarized based on the treatment assigned in the dose confirmation phase.</p><p>The efficacy measures included the evaluation of both symptomatic and functional domains on various scales, including the DSM-IV ADHD&#x000a0;RS, Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), Clinical Global Impression&#x02013;Improvement (CGI-I), and Clinical Global Impression&#x02013;Severity (CGI-S). DSM-IV ADHD&#x000a0;RS (total score ranging from 0 to 54) is among the most widely used DSM-based clinician-rated scales and was used to assess ADHD symptoms. The frequency of each symptom for the prior week was recorded by the clinician. SDS (total score ranging from 0 to 30) is a patient self-rating scale used to assess work, social, and family life impairment due to his/her symptoms. Patients were asked to indicate the extent to which their regular activities were affected in the past week on a scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely). Both DSM-IV ADHD&#x000a0;RS and SDS total scores were evaluated as the change from dose confirmation phase baseline to the end of open-label dose optimization phase (14&#x000a0;weeks in total). The CGI-I scale was employed to assess the overall change of illness relative to the baseline for dose confirmation phase. The scale consists of seven ratings ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Improvement on the CGI-I scale reported in this study was defined as a visit rating of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved). The CGI-S was employed to assess the current illness state of the patient. The CGI-S scale also consists of seven ratings ranging from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients). Both the CGI-I and CGI-S are clinician rated and were evaluated as the proportion of patients with improvement from dose confirmation phase baseline to the end of open-label dose optimization phase.</p><p>DSM-IV ADHD&#x000a0;RS and CGI-I measurements were recorded every week during the open-label dose optimization phase, while SDS and CGI-S measurements were recorded at the end (Week&#x000a0;9) of the dose confirmation phase and the end (Week 14) of the open-label dose optimization phase.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Efficacy data were summarized for all randomized patients who took at least one dose of study medication (full analysis set) during the open-label dose optimization phase and reported by treatment received during the dose confirmation phase. Missing post-baseline scores were imputed based on last observation carried forward (LOCF). No inferential efficacy analyses were performed during this phase. Safety data were summarized for all MPH-LA-treated patients during the open-label dose optimization phase.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Patient Disposition</title><p>The patient disposition of the full study has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Of a total of 863 adult patients (18&#x02013;60&#x000a0;years) that were screened, 725 patients entered the dose confirmation phase and were randomized to receive once daily dose of MPH-LA 40&#x000a0;mg (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;181), 60&#x000a0;mg (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;182), 80&#x000a0;mg (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;181), or placebo (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;181). Of these, 584 (80.6&#x000a0;%) patients completed this phase and entered the open-label dose optimization phase. A total of 489 patients completed the open-label dose optimization phase and entered the maintenance of effect phase. During this maintenance of effect phase, as described previously, patients with a lack of therapeutic effect (&#x02265;30&#x000a0;% worsening from baseline of maintenance of effect phase in this phase and &#x0003c;30&#x000a0;% remaining improvement from dose confirmation phase baseline on the DSM-IV ADHD&#x000a0;RS) were required to discontinue from the study. Thus, overall, 235 patients completed the maintenance of effect phase, marking the end of the full 40-week study period. Patients who did not respond to MPH-LA during the open-label dose optimization phase were not allowed to enter the maintenance of effect phase.</p><p>Among the 95 patients who discontinued from the open-label dose optimization phase, unsatisfactory therapeutic effect was the most common reason, reported in 40 patients, followed by AEs (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;22), withdrawal of consent (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;20), lost to follow-up (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10), and protocol deviation (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3).

Furthermore, our data indicates that short-term pre-treatment with a certain dose of MPH-LA does not predict the dose level in an open-label optimization setting. By the end of the open-label dose optimization phase, which allowed titration to each patient&#x02019;s individual optimal dose, of the total 489 patients (83.7&#x000a0;%) who completed this phase (and entered the maintenance of effect phase), the number of patients who reached an optimal dose of 40, 60, or 80&#x000a0;mg/day was similar. This indicates that all three dose levels of MPH-LA are necessary in a real-life clinical setting, so as to optimally treat adult patients with ADHD. It is also of interest to note that in each of the randomized patients receiving MPH-LA 40, 60, or 80&#x000a0;mg/day in the 9-week dose confirmation phase, only one-third of patients in each group required the same dose at the end of the 5-week dose optimization phase. The remainder of the patients needed either a higher or lower optimal dose.</p><p>These data also indicate that MPH-LA will allow flexible dosing to individualize the dose based on patient need. Our study findings are comparable with those reported by Adler et al. using a flexible dose range of osmotic-release oral system (OROS) methylphenidate (36&#x02013;108&#x000a0;mg/day), wherein adult ADHD patients initiating therapy at 36&#x000a0;mg/day with weekly increments of 18&#x000a0;mg/day showed good safety and tolerability outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In their study, the protocol was designed to reach the minimal effective dose rather than optimizing the dose. In the current study, as opposed to the Adler et al. study, MPH-LA was titrated to an optimal dose balancing efficacy with safety.</p><p>The overall incidence of AEs observed in the open-label dose optimization phase in the current study was 65.2&#x000a0;% and the most common AEs reported were headache, decreased appetite, dry mouth, nasopharyngitis, nausea, and insomnia. Use of immediate-release formulations of stimulants including methylphenidate are associated with rebound symptoms upon wearing off [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In our study, the formulation used was a long-acting modified-release capsule designed to deliver a bimodal release of the drug to mimic a twice a day dosing regimen. Sudden reduction in the dose of MPH-LA from 40, 60, or 80&#x000a0;mg to 20&#x000a0;mg was not associated with rebound symptoms. The safety and tolerability observed in this study are similar to those reported in children and are consistent with the known effects of methylphenidate or other stimulant medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Although the current phase of the study was not designed to evaluate efficacy of MPH-LA, patients continued to show improvement in ADHD symptom control and reduction in functional impairment as measured by DSM-IV ADHD&#x000a0;RS and SDS. Furthermore, in both the clinician-rated scales, CGI-I and CGI-S, a higher proportion of patients showed improvement than in observations during the dose confirmation phase. These results are consistent with other short-term dose optimization studies evaluating efficacy of methylphenidate in adults with ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The present study is of particular interest as improved symptomatic effects were observed upon dose optimization, and clinical optimization of dosing did not depend on the prior fixed MPH-LA dose in the initial phase.</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>Limitations</title><p>A limitation was that the open-label dose optimization phase of the study was not designed to evaluate the efficacy of the optimal dose of MPH-LA. The protocol using increments of 20&#x000a0;mg/day to achieve optimal dose of 40, 60, or 80&#x000a0;mg/day by Week&#x000a0;13 or 14 (Week&#x000a0;4 and 5 of the open-label dose optimization phase) required maintenance of the optimal dose in an individual patient only for 1&#x000a0;week prior to Week&#x000a0;14. Thus, it was unable to measure the efficacy parameters by optimal dose obtained at the end of this phase, and data shown are by treatment received in the dose confirmation phase.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Research in Context</title><p>Although studies in a pediatric population report consistent response rates of 70&#x02013;80&#x000a0;% (if swapping non-responders to another stimulant, the response rate was increased up to 90&#x000a0;%), there is considerable variation in response rates to methylphenidate in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Thus, many guidelines recommend the &#x02018;start low and go slow&#x02019; approach (e.g., NICE guidelines; European Consensus) or individually adjusted optimization based on response and tolerability. In the present study, we used the same strategy of optimal dosing in individual patients to identify the safe dose that was effective.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In clinical practice, dose individualization with methylphenidate is necessary to achieve the optimal balance of efficacy and safety. The present study confirms that a dose range of 40&#x02013;80&#x000a0;mg/day of MPH-LA was necessary to effectively individualize/optimize patient treatment for adult ADHD by achieving appropriate symptom control and reduction in functional impairment. All the three MPH-LA doses (40, 60, and 80&#x000a0;mg) were well-tolerated by adult ADHD patients in this study.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was sponsored by Novartis Pharma AG.
