The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of MIPS (NO-Shotgun&#x000ae;) pre-loaded 4&#x000a0;weeks prior to a single-bout of downhill running (DHR) on hsC-Reactive Protein (hsCRP), interleukin (IL)-6, creatine kinase (CK), muscle soreness, lower limb circumferences and performance.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>Trained female runners (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8; 29&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.9&#x000a0;years) (VO<sub>2max</sub>: &#x02265; 50&#x000a0;ml<sup>-1</sup>.kg<sup>-1</sup>.min<sup>-1</sup>, midfollicular phase (7-11 days post-menses) were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner into two groups: MIPS (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4) ingested one serving of NO Shotgun daily for 28&#x000a0;days prior to DHR and 30&#x000a0;min prior to all post-testing visits; Control (CON) (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4) consumed an isocaloric maltodextrin placebo in an identical manner to MIPS. hsCRP, IL-6, CK, perceived soreness, limb circumferences, and performance measures (flexibility, squat jump peak power) were tested on 5 occasions; immediately before (PRE), immediately post-DHR, 24, 48 and 72&#x000a0;h post-DHR.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were main effects of time for CK (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05), pain pressure threshold (right tibialis anterior (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.010), right biceps femoris (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01), and left iliotibial band (ITB) (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05) across all time points), and maximum squat jump power (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04).

This leads to increased muscle soreness, decreased muscle strength, increased concentration of plasma muscle enzymes, and decreased range of motion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], for several days post exercise, and further promotes an unbalanced ratio of protein breakdown to protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A level of muscle discomfort related to the exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD), otherwise known as delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), increases until subsiding five to seven days post-exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Downhill running (DHR) is commonly used to induce muscle damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], as it involves greater eccentric contraction of the knee extensors, leading to more tissue damage, compared with level or uphill running [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Although similar decrements associated with EIMD have been reported in both males and females, it has been documented that females are susceptible to longer periods of recovery when compared to males; however, reasons for this are unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, contrary to this, estrogen appears to have a protective effect with regards to DOMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], as it has been reported that estrogen results in significant decreases in serum creatine kinase (CK) activities post-exercise or post-injury when compare to men or a placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It has therefore been hypothesized that several of the sex-related differences are attributed to the female sex hormone 17&#x003b2;-estradiol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]; such that estrogen has been reported to possess the ability to enhance skeletal muscle growth, gene expression, metabolism, contraction characteristics, and maintain muscle mass.</p><p>Numerous studies have examined the effects of nutritional supplementation interventions to reduce the effects of EIMD by increasing the net protein balance within skeletal muscle. These studies have included supplementation with whey protein isolate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs: leucine, isoleucine, and valine) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], protein hydrolysates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], leucine only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], creatine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]; increasing anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activity through tart cherry juice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], blueberry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and caffeine ingestion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], as well as enhancing recovery through the consumption of chocolate milk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] to name a few. The majority of studies investigating the ergogenic effects of nutritional supplementation on exercise performance and recovery have primarily focused on males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, there are a few studies that examined female rats and other animals, and female humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies have investigated the effects of a multi-ingredient performance supplement (MIPS; NO Shotgun&#x000ae;) following a single bout of DHR in trained males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] as well as in resistance trained males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, there is little known about the effects of this MIPS on the reduction of muscle damage and repair after EIMD from DHR in endurance-trained female athletes. We hypothesized that 4&#x000a0;weeks of pre-loading with a MIPS prior to a single bout of DHR would decrease perceived soreness and circumferences, enhance flexibility, and improve biochemical markers of muscle damage and inflammation (i.e. CK, IL-6 and CRP), and improve squat jump performance when compared to an isocaloric placebo (CON) in endurance-trained female runners for up to 72&#x000a0;h post-DHR.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>All procedures were carried out in the Human Performance Laboratory situated at the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) Discipline of Biokinetics, Exercise and Leisure Sciences following approval from the UKZN Biomedical Research Ethics Committee (Ethics Approval Number: BFC033/13).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Eight healthy female endurance-trained runners (maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2max</sub>)&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;50&#x000a0;mL<sup>-1</sup>.kg<sup>-1</sup>.min<sup>-1</sup>, average 32&#x000a0;km.wk<sup>-1</sup> of running), aged 18-40 years, across all ethnic groups from Durban, KwaZulu Natal, South Africa and the surrounding areas were recruited to participate in this study (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Participants were excluded if they had any existing diseases and/or musculoskeletal disorders, history of leg injury or any other medical condition that would be exacerbated by a single bout of DHR, or the regular use of any anti-inflammatory drugs, and suffering from allergies. Participants were requested to discontinue the use of any other dietary or ergogenic supplementation and were asked to complete a washout period of four weeks prior to participation in the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] with the exception of a multivitamin without known ergogenic enhancers (one participant reported using a multi-vitamin, however, no other supplement use was reported).

After baseline testing, subjects were randomly assigned to either a MIPS group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4) or an isocaloric flavour-matched placebo control (CON) group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4). The MIPS group was required to consume one serving (21&#x000a0;g) of a multi-ingredient sports supplement (NO-Shotgun&#x000ae;, Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Davie, FL) containing ~72 kcals; 18&#x000a0;g protein; 9.7&#x000a0;g protein hydrolysate matrix including BCAAs; 8.06&#x000a0;g muscle volumizing and 3.17&#x000a0;g power/speed/strength and endurance matrix that includes multiple forms of creatine and beta alanine; 376&#x000a0;mg of Redline&#x000ae; Energy matrix including caffeine; once a day for four weeks prior to the DHR. The CON group was required to consume an isocaloric, flavour-matched placebo beverage (maltodextrin, 28&#x000a0;g) once a day for four weeks prior to the DHR. All participants received their supplement in identical commercially labelled containers after baseline testing. Subjects consumed either MIPS or CON 30&#x000a0;min prior to exercise on reported training days, or first thing in the morning on all non-training and recovery days.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Experimental design</title><p>Participants reported to the laboratory on 7 different occasions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The first visit included initial screening for inclusion of the participants, including VO<sub>2max</sub> determination, and completion of written consent to participate in the study. An incremental treadmill running protocol was employed to determine VO<sub>2max</sub> using a motor driven treadmill (h/p/cosmos Cosmed&#x02122; T150). Expired air was measured breath-by-breath indirect calorimetry using a metabolic measurement system (Cortex MetaLyzer&#x000ae; 3B, Cortex Biophysik, GmbH). Prior to the beginning of each test, the gas analyzer was calibrated using ambient air and a gas of a known composition containing 20.9% oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and 4% carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). The turbine flowmeter was calibrated using a 3-L syringe. Heart rate (HR) was monitored using a Polar&#x02122; Heart Rate Monitor (Accurex 2, Finland). Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and HR were measured every minute. The initial velocity and inclination were set at 8.0&#x000a0;km.hr<sup>-1</sup> and 3%, respectively, for 5&#x000a0;min as a warm-up. The velocity and inclination then increased in increments of 1&#x000a0;km.hr<sup>-1</sup> and 1% every minute until a speed of 12&#x000a0;km.hr<sup>-1</sup> was reached, with the incline continuing to increase until exhaustion. The test was considered to be a maximal test under two conditions: one being if the participants oxygen uptake plateaued for more than two stages (2&#x000a0;min intervals) while intensity continued to increase, and the other being that participants exhibit two of the following secondary criteria: RPE&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;19, respiratory exchange ratio (RER)&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1.1, or a heart rate within 10 beats&#x02219;min<sup>-1</sup> of the theoretical age-predicted maximum HR (220-age) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The second visit was no later than one week from the initial visit and was used for baseline testing. Baseline testing included all measures indicated below. Upon completion of baseline testing the participants were given instructions on supplementation and instructed to maintain their normal dietary and training patterns for the next 28&#x000a0;days during supplementation. Participants were required to complete questionnaires regarding nutritional status and a medical history, physical activity, and menstrual history. While training logs were not kept, verbal verification was obtained to confirm that participants did not alter their training schedule. Approximately 3&#x000a0;weeks from baseline testing participants returned to the laboratory under the same pretesting conditions as baseline to perform a VO<sub>2max</sub> test to determine their intensity (75% of VO<sub>2max</sub>) during the DHR. This visit was further used to familiarize the participants to the treadmill. The visits were all scheduled during the morning hours (0500&#x000a0;h &#x02013; 0800&#x000a0;h) in order to control the variables being tested.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study timeline.

</p><p>A 15&#x000a0;mL venous blood sample was collected and perceived muscle soreness, pain pressure threshold/tissue tenderness, squat jump performance, circumferences, and flexibility were measured, at the 5 different laboratory visits: baseline (28&#x000a0;days before DHR), immediately before DHR, Immediately post DHR, and 24, 48 and 72&#x000a0;h post-DHR. Following the blood draws, muscle soreness and tissue tenderness measurements were taken, participants were required to complete a warm-up walk for a duration of five minutes at 4.8&#x000a0;km.hr<sup>-1</sup> on a motorized treadmill, prior to any performance measurements. The DHR was performed on visit 4 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

All measurements were taken without shoes and any excess clothing and accessories. Body composition was measured non-invasively using the sum of 7 skinfold measurements (triceps, chest, mid-axillary, subscapular, supra-iliac, abdominal, and thigh), all taken by the same technician, that were used to calculate body fat percentage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>Blood (15&#x000a0;mL) was collected via venipuncture of the antecubital vein at pre, immediately post-, 24, 48 and 72&#x000a0;h post-DHR.

Aliquots of 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L each were then transferred into microtubes and immediately frozen at -80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for later batch analysis. Blood samples were sent to a commercial pathology laboratory for analysis of serum markers of muscle damage and inflammation (CK, IL-6, hsCRP). CK and hsCRP were analyzed using Roche/Hitachi cobas c 311, cobas c 501/502 analyzers (Roche Diagnostics GmbH). IL-6 was analyzed using the Access IL-6 assay (Beckman Coulter, Inc.).</p><p>Circumferences of the lower limbs were measured to determine the volume changes in the thigh as an indirect marker of edema. A standard centimetre marked tape measure was utilized to measure changes in muscle girth. The participants were measured at the followings areas: 10 and 15&#x000a0;cm above the superior pole of the patellae, on the quadriceps muscle, as well as along the midline of the calf muscle 15&#x000a0;cm from the joint margin of the knee, and hamstring circumference was measured at the midline from the ischial tuberosity to the lateral epicondyle of the tibia. Perceived muscle soreness of the lower body was measured using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Participants were requested to rate the level of soreness experienced in the anterior thigh of their left leg by drawing an &#x0201c;X&#x0201d; across a continuum line extending from 0&#x000a0;cm (no soreness) to 10&#x000a0;cm (extreme soreness). To quantify the pressure pain threshold or tissue tenderness of the lower limbs and gluteal muscles, an algometer (Wegner Force Ten &#x02122;, Wegner Instruments, Greenwich, CT) was used with an application of at 1&#x000a0;kg.cm<sup>-2</sup>.sec<sup>-1</sup> of pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].

Furthermore, it appears that although pain was experienced in the hamstrings, the flexibility of the hamstrings was not significantly compromised due to the DHR-protocol, as DHR results in greater damage to the knee extensor muscles in comparison to level running [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Supplementation with NO-Shotgun&#x000ae; did not elicit significant improvements in hamstring flexibility in comparison to an isocaloric placebo.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Biochemical markers of muscle damage and inflammation</title><p>Our findings of elevated markers of muscle damage (CK and IL-6) following eccentric exercise support previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Although variability in the response of muscle damage indicators (e.g. CK, IL-6) to eccentric exercise still persists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], the simultaneous elevations in subsequent pain experienced (DOMS ratings) by participants suggests that the two (CK and IL-6 with DOMS) are linked, as demonstrated by Byrne et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Our findings certainly support this relationship, as both increases in mean perceived muscle soreness (VAS) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) and reductions in pressure pain threshold exhibited similar trends as was found with the serum CK<sub>Log</sub> levels (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). VAS and serum CK<sub>Log</sub> both showed peak increases at 24&#x000a0;h post-DHR, whilst the pressure pain threshold reached peak decrement at the same time point. Ormsbee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] indicated a significant time effect for CK following a single-bout of DHR in male athletes after supplementation with NO-Shotgun&#x000ae;. Our findings are consistent with these. Additionally, mean serum IL-6 levels increased post DHR, peaking immediately post and remaining elevated up to 72&#x000a0;h post (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), however these findings were not significant. The findings of this study agree with others examining the effects of eccentrically-induced CK response to supplementation with whey protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], BCAAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], leucine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], creatine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], but not others showing a reduction in CK as a result of creatine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] or BCAA supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p><p>The mean response of hsCRP to the DHR showed a slight increase, with a significant decrease occurring between 24 (15.73% of baseline) and 48&#x000a0;h post-DHR (-5.44% of baseline), following which hsCRP levels increased beyond baseline (37.10% of baseline) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Interestingly, although not significantly so, hsCRP continued to decrease below baseline in the MIPS group, experiencing a peak decline at 72&#x000a0;h post-DHR (-38.89% of baseline, moderate ES), while the CON group remained above baseline at all time points following the DHR with a moderate effect size at 72&#x000a0;h post-DHR). Similar findings were noted by Tara et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] following supplementation with whey protein (89.3&#x000a0;g protein, 1.1&#x000a0;g fat, and 3.6&#x000a0;g CHO per 100&#x000a0;g), in which the group supplementing with whey protein experienced greater decreases in CRP compared to those supplementing with soy protein (83.3&#x000a0;g protein, 4.2&#x000a0;g fat, &#x0003c;2.1&#x000a0;g CHO, 175&#x000a0;mg isoflavones per 100&#x000a0;g). Previous studies have noted attenuation of CRP levels in response to regular exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], while increases in CRP have been noted in response to acute exercise protocols. Increases in CRP immediately post- and 24&#x000a0;h post-marathon have been evident in endurance trained males and females, with CRP levels returning to baseline two to six days post-marathon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Several studies have suggested that the increase in CRP values is stimulated by the increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, which stimulates hepatic CRP stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. However, Michigan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] have indicated that the type of exercise and training may result in varied effects on CRP. Our findings do not support the notion that an increase in IL-6 increases the hsCRP response to EIMD. As is evident in Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, IL-6 peaked immediately post-DHR and hsCRP peaked 72&#x000a0;h post-DHR. Although it would appear that the MIPS did attenuate hsCRP response to the DHR, however, not significantly so, in comparison to an isocaloric placebo. These findings should be examined further in future research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Limitations</title><p>Low statistical power because of the modest sample size in the present study (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8) played a role in limiting the significance of the statistical comparisons conducted. A post hoc power analysis revealed that on the basis of the mean, between-groups comparison effect sizes observed in the present study (d&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.1), an n of approximately 9 participants in each group was needed to obtain statistical power at the recommended .80 level. The strict inclusion criteria as well as performance of the DHR during the correct phase of the menstrual cycle and supplementation with a &#x0201c;muscle boosting&#x0201d; supplement, made recruitment for participants difficult. Although hormone levels were not tested to establish the phase of the menstrual cycle, verbal verification was obtained from the participants, and all participants were tested as close to the mid-follicular phase (7-11 days after menses) of the menstrual cycle as possible. This may have influenced the results obtained, as not all participants would have had similar levels of estrogen. Additionally, due to the small sample size, it was difficult to control for the use of contraceptives (oral, transdermal patch, vaginal ring), which would have impacted on the hormone levels and, as such, the time of testing; however during the testing period, participants did not report using any form of contraceptives. Furthermore, the indirect markers of muscle damage used in the present study may have been restricted with regards to their sensitivity to identify specific responses to the DHR and the effects of MIPS. It has been suggested that voluntary eccentric muscle actions do not result in muscle damage and inflammation, but rather provide evidence for myofibrillar remodelling and adaptation. Therefore, the use of an unbiased method to determine the degree of muscle adaptation is an important methodological concern to consider for future research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Although the sample size was small, it provided useful information for the planning of future larger studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study are in accordance with others reporting increases in perceived muscle soreness, CK and IL-6, and decreases in pressure pain thresholds, squat jump performance, and hamstring flexibility following strenuous DHR exercise. The use of a propriety blend MIPS did not have an effect on markers of muscle damage, perceived soreness or performance compared to an isocaloric placebo, however, it may have attenuated the inflammatory response at 72&#x000a0;h post-DHR. Although numerous studies have documented results in attenuation of markers of muscle damage, perceived soreness, and improved performance with supplementation, other studies using protein, BCAAs, creatine and leucine have reported similar findings to ours. A key difference between our study and those supplementing with MIPS is that this study used endurance-trained female athletes compared to that of trained or recreationally active males in similar studies. However, the responses experienced in this study are similar to those using male participants, possibly indicating that the perceived muscle soreness, muscle damage markers and recovery following a single-bout of DHR do not vary between well trained males and females in terms of the responses to muscle damaging exercise.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank all participants who volunteered their time and contributing to this project.
