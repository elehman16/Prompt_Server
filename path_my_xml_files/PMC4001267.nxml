Though a thorough control of the working length (WL) may decrease the risk, but nevertheless extrusion of any debris may potentially cause post-operative complications such as flare-ups,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] which are characterized by pain, swelling causing unscheduled visits of the patients resulting in interappointment emergency.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>At present, all preparation techniques and instruments are associated with extrusion of debris, even when the preparation is maintained short of the apical terminus and manual instrumentation happens to produce greater extrusion when compared to engine driven rotary preparation.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The studies so far have proven that none of the various techniques and instruments can clean and shape the root canal system without producing some apically extruded debris (AED).[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] However, it has been proved that various instrumentation techniques have been associated with different amounts of AED.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>ProTaper&#x02122; (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) system exhibits progressively variable tapers of each instrument that develop a &#x0201c;progressive preparation&#x0201d; in both the vertical and horizontal directions. The ProTaper&#x02122; cross-sectional design mimics that of a reamer, with three machined cutting edges and convex core.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Hyflex&#x02122; CM nickel-titanium (NiTi) Files (Coltene-Whaledent, Allstetten, Switzerland) is produced by an innovative methodology (patent pending) which uses a unique process that controls the material's memory (a complex heating and cooling treatment). The cross-sectional design of Hyflex&#x02122; files is very much similar to EndoSequence.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>WaveOne&#x02122; (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland), the recently introduced single-file NiTi system is claimed to complete root canal preparation with only one instrument in reciprocating motion with adequate size and taper. These files are made of a special NiTi alloy called M-Wire that is created by an innovative thermal treatment process.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] It is available in sizes of 21.06, 25.08 and 40.08 and these are used in a reciprocal motion that requires a special automated devices.</p><p>As AED generates an acute inflammatory reaction in the periapical tissues, it is considered as an important parameter to assess the efficacy of an instrumentation technique or instrument design during root canal preparation.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The aim of this study was to compare the amount of AED during preparation of straight root canals in extracted human teeth using WaveOne&#x02122; compared with the rotary full-sequence HyFlex&#x02122; CM and ProTaper&#x02122;.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>In this study, 60 freshly extracted human mandibular premolar teeth that were sacrificed for orthodontic and periodontal purpose were used. The inclusion criteria was the single rooted mandibular premolar teeth with single root canal and apical foramen with root curvature between 0&#x000b0; and 10&#x000b0;. Radiographs were taken both mesiodistally and buccolingually to assess internal resorption, root canal calcification and curvature of the root canals. The degree of root curvature was calculated from the buccolingual radiographs by using the method of Schneider.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Teeth with signs of crack, internal and external resorption, root caries, canal calcifications and open apices were excluded from the study. The selected teeth were randomly assigned into 3 experimental groups (Groups 1-3) with 20 teeth in each group.</p><p>The debris and soft-tissue remnants were cleaned from external root surface and then stored in phosphate-buffered saline solution. To maintain similar tooth lengths, all teeth were measured and the crowns were sectioned with a high-speed bur under copious water spray until equal lengths were obtained. Access cavity preparation was done in each tooth and all external tooth surfaces were covered with 2 layers of nail polish except for 1 mm around the apical foramen.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] A 15 K-file (Mani, Tochigi, Japan) was used to determine the WL until it was visible at apical foramen. The WL was re-established by subtracting 1 mm from this measurement.</p><p>The debris collection apparatus was made according to the design described by Myers and Montgomery.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Eppendrof tubes were taken and weighed by electronic microbalance (Single Pan K-Roy analytical balance, K Roy and Co, Kolkata, India). Each individual tooth was held in a preweighed eppendorf tube which was fixed inside a glass vial through rubber plug. It was seen that no possible contact was made between the tube and the glass vial. The tube was vented with a 25 gauge needle to equalize the pressure inside and outside.</p><p>All instruments were set into permanent rotation with a 6:1 reduction using X-SMART Plus&#x02122; endo motor (Dentsply, Maillefer). For each file, the individual torque limit and rotational speed programmed in the file library of the motor were used, whereas Wave-One&#x02122; was used in a reciprocating working motion generated by the motor. All the preparations were made by a single operator. The preparation sequences is as follows:</p><p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Group 1: ProTaper&#x02122; instruments were used according to the manufacturer's instructions by a gentle in-and-out motion in the recommended sequence up to F4 (40.06) till the WL.

</p><p>The extruded debris and irrigant during preparation were collected in eppendrof tube. A total volume of 7 mL of distilled water was used in each root canal for irrigation. The irrigation needle (NaviTip 31ga; Ultradent, South Jordan, UT) was placed short of WL or slightly coronal to the point where resistance was encountered.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>After canal preparation, the eppendorf tube was removed from the glass vial. Then the tooth was separated from the tube and the root apex was washed off with 1 ml of distilled water that was collected in the same tube. All the eppendorf tubes were then incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 15 days to allow the evaporation of moisture before weighing the dry debris. For each eppendorf tube three consecutive measurements were taken on an electronic microbalance and the mean measurement for each tube was considered to be its weight. The weight of extruded debris in each tube was calculated by subtracting pre experiment weight of the tube from the weight of tube with dried debris. The mean weight of extruded debris was calculated for each group. The data were statistically analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science<sup>&#x0037e;</sup> 16 (SPSS, version 16; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance and post hoc Student-Newman-Keuls test at a significance level of <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The mean AED weight and standard deviation of the three experimental groups is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

However, no statistical significant difference was obtained between WaveOne&#x02122; and ProTaper&#x02122; (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>A major objective of root canal therapy is to obtain a clean root canal system. Debris such as dentine chips, necrotic pulp tissue, microorganisms and irrigants may be extruded into the periradicular tissue during canal instrumentation which leads to endodontic flare-up. Apical extrusion of infected debris to the periradicular tissues is possibly one of the principle cause of this post-operative pain.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Many factors affect the amount of extruded debris such as the instrumentation technique, instrument type and size, preparation endpoint and irrigation solution.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The main objective of the present investigation was to determine the apical extrusion of dentine debris as a result of canal shaping by different rotary systems.</p><p>As per the results obtained, extrusion of debris apically occurred independent of the type of instrument used. The reciprocating single-file system showed significantly more debris extrusion compared with both the full-sequence rotary NiTi instruments (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The obtained differences may be caused by the preparation technique and/or the cross-sectional designs of the instruments.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Hyflex CM&#x02122; files have a cross-sectional design very similar to EndoSequence.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The cutting profile of each Hyflex CM&#x02122; file facilitates penetration in the canal and presents a root canal shape corresponding with the original anatomy. A study by B&#x000fc;rklein <italic>et al.</italic> found that there was more debris in the apical part of the canals after canal preparation with WaveOne and ProTaper instruments as they are characterized by three cutting edges with radial lands to support the blades and a relatively small chip space.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] ProTaper&#x02122; and WaveOne&#x02122; are characterized by a triangular or modified triangular cross-section resulting in a lower cutting efficiency and smaller chip space.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] This design may enhance debris transportation toward the apex when used in combination with a reciprocal motion. Contrarily, in continuous rotation may improve coronal transportation of dentin chips and debris by acting like a screw conveyor.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>In this present study, the canal WL was 1 mm short of the apical foramen. Myers and Montgomery[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] clearly showed that a WL 1 mm short of canal length contributed to significantly less debris extrusion. A certain degree of caution must be taken when these results are transferred to the clinical situation because of the zero back pressure used in this study design, gravity may have carried the irrigant out of the canal. This is a known drawback of <italic>in vitro</italic> designs with no periapical resistance. It has been suggested that using floral foam may simulate resistance of periapical tissues.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] However, foam may absorb some irrigant and debris when used as a barrier and therefore, no attempt has been made in this present study to simulate periapical resistance. Bidistilled water was used as an irrigant in this study to avoid any possible weight increase due to NaOCl crystal formation. The tubes were stored in an incubator in order to evaporate the moisture and weigh the dry debris.</p><p>Myers and Montgomery suggested a reassessment of the apical dentinal plug because of the potential benefits of reducing the amount of AED and irrigants and the prevention of over instrumentation in combination with extrusion of filling materials.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] A study has shown that establishing apical patency in mesiobuccal roots of maxillary molars resulted in apical extrusion of sodium hypochlorite in 100% of the specimens.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] A similar study has shown that maintaining apical patency was associated with less AED when compared with teeth in which the constriction remained intact.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Ruiz-Hubard <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] found that extrusion of debris apically was less using a crown-down pressure less technique in curved and straight canals when compared with the step-back technique. Zarrabi <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] compared ProFile, RaCe and Flex Master rotary instruments with the step-back technique using manual files and reported that the step-back technique extruded greater amounts of debris than the rotary instruments. Ghivari <italic>et al.</italic> found that step-back technique extruded a greater quantity of debris and irrigant in comparison to the other hand and rotary Ni-Ti systems.-[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Garlapati <italic>et al.</italic> showed that K3 rotary instruments using crown down technique extruded less number of bacteria.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Earlier studies have shown that manual instrumentation produced significantly more debris than the rotary NiTi techniques and the balanced-force technique.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] It was observed that rotation during instrumentation, with both the rotary and balanced-force techniques, tend to pull dentinal debris into the flutes of the file and direct it toward the coronal aspect of the canal. In case of engine-driven instruments early flaring of the coronal part of the preparation may improve instrument control during preparation of the apical third of the canal. The rotary motion tends to direct debris toward the orifice, avoiding its compaction in the root canal.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>De-Deus <italic>et al.</italic> in their study have reported no difference in debris extrusion between conventional ProTaper Universal technique and single-file ProTaper F2 used in reciprocating movement.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] However, the results of this present study are in agreement with previous studies by B&#x000fc;rklein and Schafer[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] which showed reciprocating single-file systems extruded more debris compared with the full-sequence rotary NiTi instruments.</p><p>In the present study, the Group 3 (WaveOne&#x02122;) has shown more extrusion of debris compared with Group 1 (ProTaper&#x02122;) followed by Group 2 (Hyflex CM&#x02122;) suggesting that reciprocation motion might cause more apical extrusion compared with continuous motion during root canal preparation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Under the conditions of this study, Waveone was associated with more debris extrusion compared with ProTaper and Hyflex suggesting that reciprocating single-file system extruded more debris than continuous full sequence rotary NiTi instruments.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Seltzer</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Naidorf</surname><given-names>IJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Flare-ups in endodontics: I.
