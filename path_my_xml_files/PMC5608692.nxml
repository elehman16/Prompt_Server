The Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology Breast Cancer Weight Loss trial, also known as A011401, is testing the impact of a telephone-based weight loss program on invasive disease-free survival in 3136 women with a body mass index &#x02265;27&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> who have recently been diagnosed with stage II-III, HER-2 negative breast cancer. Secondary outcomes of the trial include the impact of the weight loss intervention on overall survival, body weight, physical activity, dietary intakes, incidence of comorbidities, serum biomarkers and patient reported outcomes. Participants are randomized 1:1 to a 2-year, telephone-based weight loss intervention or to an education control group. The intervention is delivered through 42 telephone calls, delivered by health coaches based at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Calls are supplemented by an intervention workbook, as well as a number of tools to help facilitate weight loss. Intervention goals include loss of 10% of baseline body weight, achieved through caloric restriction and increased physical activity. This large-scale study testing the impact of purposeful weight loss after cancer diagnosis on the risk of breast cancer recurrence and mortality has the potential to make weight loss programs a standard part of breast cancer treatment.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background and study rationale</title><p id="Par2">Growing evidence suggests that obesity is associated with increased risk of recurrence and mortality in women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> Chan et al. published a recent meta-analysis of 82 studies evaluating the relationship between body weight and breast cancer outcomes, encompassing 213,075 women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> A 35% increase in breast cancer-related mortality and 41% increase in overall mortality was demonstrated in women who were obese at the time of breast cancer diagnosis as compared to women who were of normal weight.

Two randomized trials that tested the impact of dietary modification on disease-free survival in women with early-stage breast cancer shed some light on this issue. The Women&#x02019;s Interventional Nutrition Study (WINS) randomized 2400 breast cancer patients to a low-fat dietary intervention or usual care control group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> Intervention participants experienced on average a 2.7&#x02009;kg (3.7%) weight loss over 5 years and a 24% reduction in breast cancer recurrence as compared to control participants.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Summary</title><p id="Par6">Despite observational data supporting a relationship between weight and breast cancer prognosis, as well as translational work providing a biologic rationale for this relationship, there is little information regarding the impact of weight loss upon the risk of recurrence and mortality in women with early-stage breast cancer. Given that weight is a modifiable factor, further research is needed to determine if weight loss could be an effective strategy to improve prognosis in overweight and obese women with breast cancer. This manuscript describes the design of the Randomized Phase III Trial Evaluating the Role of Weight Loss in Adjuvant Treatment of Overweight and Obese Women with Early Breast Cancer (A011401). The trial, also known as the Breast Cancer Weight Loss (BWEL) study, is designed to test the impact of a telephone-based weight loss intervention on rates of breast cancer recurrence in women with early-stage breast cancer who have a body mass index (BMI) of at least 27&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study development</title><p id="Par7">The concept for A011401 was developed through a coordinated effort of the NCI Clinical Trials Cooperative Groups (now NCTN/NCORP groups) in a process facilitated by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). A Clinical Trials Planning Meeting that included representatives from all of the U.S. National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) groups, NIH staff focused on weight loss, patient advocates, and external experts in weight loss, exercise physiology, nutrition science, behavioral medicine and biostatistics, was convened in February 2014 by the NCI. Meeting attendees reviewed the evidence linking obesity to breast cancer outcomes, as well as data demonstrating the feasibility of implementing a large-scale weight loss trial in breast cancer patients, and concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support the development of a randomized trial testing the impact of weight loss on disease-free and overall survival (OS) in overweight and obese women with early-stage breast cancer.</p><p id="Par8">Following the planning meeting, a writing group was formed that included representatives of each of the NCTN groups, patient advocates and experts in weight loss, exercise and nutrition. Through a process that took several months, a concept was drafted and feedback was collected from writing group members and the Breast Cancer Committees of the NCTN groups. A number of considerations shaped final study design. For example, competing considerations influenced eligibility criteria and sample size. Given the many known benefits of weight loss in terms of general health, there was a desire to ensure that the study would be powered to detect even a relatively modest benefit of the lifestyle intervention. At the same time, the complexity and cost of administering a lifestyle intervention to a large group of breast cancer survivors led to the need to keep the sample size as small as possible. Thus, in order to provide enough power to evaluate the primary endpoint with a manageable sample size, eligibility was restricted to patients with stage II and III disease. Additionally, in order to enroll a large enough population of women with stage II&#x02013;III disease who were representative of the broad racial, ethnic, geographic and socioeconomic diversity of breast cancer patients, it was necessary to utilize a lifestyle intervention that could be delivered to patients enrolled through a large number of centers, leading to the development of a telephone-based weight loss program for the trial.</p><p id="Par9">The concept developed by the writing groups was approved by the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (Alliance). The final concept was approved by NCI and finally by the Breast Cancer Steering Committee in April 2015. The study protocol was approved by the Clinical Trials Evaluation Program (CTEP) and subsequently by the NCI Adult Central Institutional Review Board. The study is being conducted in accordance with all relevant protocols.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par10">The primary objective of the BWEL trial is to test the impact of a telephone-based weight loss intervention on invasive disease-free survival (IDFS), an aggregate endpoint that includes locoregional and distant breast cancer recurrence, contralateral invasive breast cancer, new primary non-breast cancer, and death from any cause.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>

Patients are randomized 1:1 within stratification factors: menopausal status (premenopausal vs. postmenopausal), hormone receptor status of the tumor (ER and/or PR positive vs. ER and PR negative), and race/ethnicity (African American vs. Hispanic vs. Other).</p><p id="Par28">The primary objective of this trial is to compare the effect of the telephone-based intervention vs. a health educational control on IDFS. The total sample size is 3136 patients.

Accounting for an accrual period of 4 years, 4 years of additional follow-up, interim analysis plans for IDFS, and a constant hazard of loss-to-follow-up in the ITT population of 5% by 4 years due to withdrawn consent or other reasons, requires a total sample size of 3136 patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Study monitoring and interim analysis</title><p id="Par31">Statistical analyses will be conducted by the Alliance Statistics and Data Center.

The DSMB will also consider the evidence regarding safety, i.e., adverse events and the feasibility of completing the trial. In addition, two formal interim analyses are planned: (1) to determine whether the effectiveness of the intervention induces sufficient weight change, as measured by change in BMI after 12 months, and (2) to evaluate clinical benefit in terms of IDFS in a group sequential design.</p><sec id="Sec20"><title>Interim analysis for weight change</title><p id="Par32">An analysis for futility to achieve weight loss will be conducted when 25% of the study population has reached the 12-month evaluation point.
