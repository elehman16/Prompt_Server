Diet and lifestyle directly influence the health status of a population, and rates of T2D continue to increase with the global trend toward a greater prevalence of obesity and reduced physical activity.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Major risk factors for T2D have also been found to induce local or systemic low-grade chronic inflammation. Systemic inflammation is independently associated with insulin resistance, as supported by studies conducted in adults<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and adolescents.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Chronic low-grade inflammation has been hypothesized as an underlying pathophysiological mechanism linking obesity to T2D.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) &#x003b1; is a potent cytokine produced by adipose tissue that induces the production of interleukin-6 (IL-6).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Plasma levels of TNF are persistently elevated in patients with obesity or T2D, and the role of TNF in promoting insulin resistance is mediated by an increase in adipocyte lipolysis.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Because TNF is the first step in the inflammatory cascade, it is not surprising that plasma levels of IL-6 are high in patients with obesity or T2D. Similarly, IL-6 concentrations also correlate with insulin resistance in humans.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> One of the most important effects of IL-6 is that it controls hepatic C reactive protein (CRP) production. CRP is a key inflammatory marker in humans, and is positively associated with degree of obesity, and fasting glucose and insulin levels.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Oxidative stress is caused by an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant molecules. Both endogenous and exogenous compounds play a role as antioxidants in living organisms to keep reactive species and free radicals down to physiological levels. Oxidative stress and inflammation together play a crucial part in the development of many chronic diseases such as obesity, T2D, and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, imbalances in ROS, free radicals, and antioxidants have been highlighted as major mechanisms underlying obesity-related comorbidities.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Altering nutrition may be an important means of reducing oxidative stress, since composition of the diet has been shown to strongly affect the body's antioxidant capacity.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Blood antioxidant potential (BAP) provides a reliable measurement of the antioxidant barrier power to oxidation.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Under physiological conditions during the feeding-fasting cycle, a non-specific and intermittently low-grade inflammatory response occurs in the metabolic tissues (adipose, muscular, and hepatic), which determines a transient increase in serum inflammatory cytokines like CRP, IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1;. This increase reaches its peak during the postprandial phase and then decreases gradually during the following 2&#x02005;h.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>The inflammatory response is amplified by high consumption of red meat, processed meat, refined grains, simple carbohydrates, high-fat dairy products, and low intake of fiber and antioxidants. Obesity and diabetes can develop due to the resulting metabolic overload, creating a block between immune and metabolic functions (insulin/insulin growth factor-1).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Dietary intervention, which is probably the key determinant of the balance that influences the overall inflammatory hallmark, represents a valid method of assessing the role of diet in the prevention of chronic inflammation.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The assessment of whole dietary patterns has become instrumental in nutritional epidemiology. Taking into account that nutrients or foods are rarely eaten in isolation, dietary patterns must consider synergistic or antagonistic biochemical interactions among nutrients as well as different food sources of the same nutrient.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>During the past two decades, evidence from prospective observational studies and clinical trials has converged to support the importance of individual nutrients, foods, and dietary patterns in the prevention and management of inflammation. A systematic review investigating dietary patterns and changes in biomarkers of inflammation showed some evidence to support the hypothesis that so called &#x02018;Western-like&#x02019; or meat-based patterns are positively associated with low-grade inflammation, and that vegetable-based and fruit-based patterns appeared to be inversely related to inflammatory biomarkers<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>; this was particularly well supported by intervention studies investigating the Mediterranean diet.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>A cross-sectional study of 902 women with T2D from the Nurses&#x02019; Health Study reported that consumption of a diet high in dietary fiber was associated with higher plasma levels of adiponectin than diets low in fiber; adiponectin is a molecule with anti-inflammatory properties that protects against diabetes and atherosclerosis.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In two additional cross-sectional studies, plasma levels of CRP were negatively related to total fiber intake both in healthy adult participants,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and in patients with diabetes, hypertension, or obesity (from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey).<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> These associations persisted when variables were adjusted for other confounding dietary and non-dietary factors.</p><p>The Ma-Pi 2 macrobiotic diet is a low-fat, high-fiber, high-complex carbohydrate, mainly vegetarian diet conceived by Mario Pianesi. As recently demonstrated by our group in the first randomized trial that assessed the effects of the Ma-Pi 2 diet versus the standard nutritional recommendations for T2D (MADIAB trial), patients consuming the Ma-Pi 2 diet experienced statistically significant improvements in terms of reduced fasting blood glucose (FBG), postprandial blood glucose (PPBG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin resistance, and greater weight loss, compared with patients receiving the control diet, despite both diets having the same energy content.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> However, the potential of this diet for reducing markers of inflammation requires additional investigation.</p><p>The present study is a post hoc analysis of the MADIAB trial,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and aims to evaluate the effect of the two dietary strategies on inflammatory markers, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and BAP among patients with T2D.</p><sec id="s1"><title>Research design and methods</title><sec id="s1a"><title>Participants</title><p>Full details of the MADIAB trial have been reported previously.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In summary, the MADIAB trial<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> was a 21-day randomized controlled open-label study in which 56 participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive the Ma-Pi 2 macrobiotic diet or a control diet based on dietary guidelines for T2D.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The inclusion criteria were overweight or obese (body mass index (BMI) 27&#x02013;45&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) males and females, aged 40&#x02013;75&#x02005;years, with a diagnosis of T2D at least 1&#x02005;year prior to the start of the trial, and management with dietary intervention or oral hypoglycemic drugs, or both, for 6&#x02005;months prior to study entry.</p><p>The primary outcomes of this study were the percentage change in FBG and PPBG levels from baseline to the 21st day of treatment in the Ma-Pi 2 group compared with the control group. Secondary outcomes included percentage change from baseline in plasma concentrations of HbA1c, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, LDL/HDL ratio, percentage change of insulin resistance, body weight, BMI, waist and hip circumference, and number of patients who achieved target values of FBG &#x02264;110&#x02005;mg/dL and PPBG &#x02264;140&#x02005;mg/dL.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>Throughout the trial, participants stayed at two different hotels according to the type of diet they were randomized to; the hotels were localized in the same geographic area.</p><p>Patients were recruited from the Endocrinology and Diabetes Department at University Campus Bio-Medico in Rome.</p><p>The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Campus Bio-Medico of Rome (11/13 PAR ComEt CBM) and registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ISRCTN.org">http://www.ISRCTN.org</ext-link> (ISRCTN10467793). All of the participants provided written informed consent for participation in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki. This work was performed in accordance with the CONSORT 2010 guidelines,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and follow-up visits were conducted fortnightly.</p><p>Anthropometric measurements were assessed and blood samples for biochemical parameters, inflammation markers and antioxidant potential of plasma taken at the beginning and end of the 3-week study period. Blood samples were obtained for all participants in both groups. Food record data were also available for all participants in the study. During the intervention period, participants were asked not to alter their exercise habits, and physical activity was assessed daily using a pedometer (Tri-axial activity monitor XL-18/XL-18 CN-AND A&#x00026;D Medical, California, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Diets</title><p>The experimental diets contained different levels of protein (12% total caloric value (TCV) in the Ma-Pi 2 diet vs 18% TCV in the control diet) and dietary fiber (29&#x02005;g/1000&#x02005;kcal in the Ma-Pi 2 diet vs 21&#x02005;g/1000&#x02005;kcal in the control diet). The rest of the macronutrients were distributed as follows: 73% TCV from carbohydrates plus 15% TCV from fats in the Ma-Pi 2 diet and 49% TCV from carbohydrates plus 32% TCV from fats in the control diet.</p><p>The Ma-Pi 2 diet consisted of whole grains, vegetables, and legumes. Beicha tea (roasted green tea) represented the main source of liquids. The control diet was adapted to the Mediterranean culinary style. The diets were isocaloric but differed in nutrient composition, as described above. For both groups, energy intake was restricted by limiting calories to 1900 and 1700 kcal/day for males and females, respectively. Further information on the diets and how compliance was maintained is available in the primary MADIAB manuscript<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and online supplementary file 1. Dietary adherence was defined as absence of any transgression from the assigned diet. Participants who attended the meal sessions for fewer than 20 out of the 21&#x02005;days were considered non-adherent.</p><p>Diet compositions were determined with the use of M&#x000e8;taDieta software, using the Italian Food Composition Tables edited by the National Institute for Food and Nutrition Research (INRAN), which has been described previously.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Anthropometric and biochemical assessments</title><p>Anthropometric measurements, including body weight and waist and hip circumference, were assessed at baseline and at the end of the intervention using a digital scale accurate to 0.1&#x02005;kg and in accordance with validated protocols.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> BMI was calculated as the body weight divided by the squared height (kg/m<sup>2</sup>).</p><p>Insulin sensitivity in the fasting state was assessed with homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) and calculated with the following formula: fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L)&#x000d7;fasting serum insulin (&#x000b5;U/mL) divided by 25, as described by Matthews <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> high HOMA scores denote low insulin sensitivity (insulin resistance). Assays for fasting serum insulin and plasma glucose levels were performed by the central laboratory (University Campus Bio-Medico, Rome).

Serum concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; were determined in duplicate using a highly sensitive, quantitative sandwich enzyme assay (Quantikine HS, R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA). The lower limit of detection was 0.7&#x02005;pg/mL for both.</p><p>The BAP was measured using a commercial kit (Diacron, Grosseto, Italy). The BAP test provides an estimate of the global antioxidant capacity of blood plasma, measured as its reducing potential against ferric ions. Briefly, a 10&#x02005;&#x003bc;L serum sample is added to a solution of ferric chloride and thiocyanate derivate, and the intensity of any resulting absorbance change is proportional to the ability of plasma to reduce ferric ions.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Photometric reading was employed to assess the absorbance change at 593&#x02005;nm.

Quantitative variables were summarized using percentiles (median and IQR).

Absolute and percentage frequencies were used for qualitative variables and the Fisher exact test was applied for group comparisons.</p><p>A bivariate analysis was performed to compare changes in inflammatory markers between the Ma-Pi 2 diet group and the control group, considering the absolute differences between values at basal (T0) and after 21&#x02005;days of diet (T21) for TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6, and the percent changes between T0 and T21 for CRP, BAP, and IGF-1. When the 95% CIs of the median difference (absolute or percent) did not include zero, the change was considered significantly different from zero. Results were graphically represented by means of box-plots.</p><p>A linear quantile regression analysis was performed to estimate the effect of the diet (Ma-Pi 2 vs control as explanatory variable) on the median absolute or percent change occurring in each measured variable (dependent variables), between T0 and T21.

There is an ample body of evidence suggesting that dietary components may modulate inflammatory and oxidative process,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> thereby potentially influencing diabetes risk. Epidemiological and clinical evidence concerning diet and inflammation have established that diets high in refined starches, sugar, saturated and trans-fatty acids, poor in natural antioxidants and fiber from fruits, vegetable, and whole grains cause excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> T2D appears to be associated with a state of oxidative stress, and an increased intake of antioxidants either from diet or supplements has been shown to have a beneficial influence on markers of T2D and cardiovascular outcomes.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>The macrobiotic Ma-Pi 2 diet is rich in complex carbohydrates, whole grains (brown rice, millet, barley), cooked and raw seasonal vegetables (onion, carrot, parsley, chicory, radish, and savoy cabbage), legumes (chickpeas, adzuki beans, lentils, black beans), seaweed, soy sauces, sesame seed, unrefined sea salt, with no added fat or protein from animal sources (including milk and dairy products), and no added sugars. These dietary components were chosen as they have characteristics that may help to achieve optimal glucose control, lower insulin requirement, prolong the time of glucose absorption, increase insulin sensitivity, improve body weight control, and reduce inflammation and oxidative stress.</p><p>The higher dietary fiber content in the Ma-Pi 2 diet compared with the control diet probably contributed to the majority of the weight loss, and improved insulin resistance and glucose response in this group. Observational studies suggest that high intakes of <italic>fiber and fiber-rich wholegrain foods</italic> are independently associated with a reduced risk of obesity.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The Massachusetts Hispanic Elders Study reported that a greater frequency of fruit and vegetable intake was associated with lower CRP levels.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Ajani <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> studied National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999&#x02013;2000 data and observed that dietary fiber intake was inversely associated with serum CRP levels. In non-diabetic participants from the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerotic Study, Festa <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> found significant associations for both insulin resistance and fasting glucose with CRP levels. Whole grains have been recommended over refined grains for the prevention of T2D; a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies found that high whole grain intake was associated with a reduction in the risk of developing T2D.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Vegetable protein intake was the only source of protein in the Ma-Pi 2 diet and may have contributed to the reduction in CRP concentration and the major reduction in IGF-1 levels. Jenkins <italic>et al</italic> postulated the anti-inflammatory effects of a dietary portfolio treatment in hyperlipidemic adults, wherein a combination of <italic>soy proteins</italic>, viscous fiber, plant sterols, and almonds lowered CRP levels, similar to the statin-treated group.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Green tea, the main source of liquids in the Ma-Pi 2 diet, was found to be beneficial in reducing fasting glucose and HbA1c in a meta-analysis of 17 randomized controlled trials.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Green tea contains a group of antioxidant flavonoids. The legumes used in the Ma-Pi 2 diet are particularly rich in phenolic compounds. There is growing evidence that plant-derived polyphenol intake attenuates fasting hyperglycemia and postprandial glycemic response, and improves acute insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. Dietary polyphenols have gained considerable attention over the past decade because of their potential to modulate the production and activity of inflammatory molecules in humans, decrease plasma levels of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6, suppress CRP levels, and improve endothelial function in patients with T2D.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>Our findings are limited by the relatively small sample size and short intervention period. However, the current results have an important translational value. To our knowledge, this is the first controlled interventional study to evaluate the effects of the macrobiotic Ma-Pi 2 diet on inflammatory status, although these post hoc analysis findings are suitable only for hypothesis-generating activities. Further study is required in a larger patient population to confirm these positive short-term results and to elucidate whether these initial improvements in inflammatory markers are maintained over the longer term.</p><p>In summary, this post hoc analysis found that both the Ma-Pi 2 macrobiotic diet and a standard recommended diet for T2D were found to produce significant reductions in CRP and TNF-&#x003b1; plasma concentration. Of note, after 21&#x02005;days, participants in the Ma-Pi 2 diet group improved significantly their BAP levels and they had significantly reduced IGF-1 levels compared with the control diet group. We propose that this effect is due to the higher fiber and antioxidant content of Ma-Pi 2. The Ma-Pi 2 diet provides a safe strategy to potentially improve insulin resistance, and to reduce inflammation and the associated cardiovascular risk.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> AS conducted the study, recruited participants, collected data and wrote the manuscript.
