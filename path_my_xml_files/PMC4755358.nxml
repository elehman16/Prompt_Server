Additionally, women were excluded if they reported any condition known to affect bone (eg, hyperparathyroidism and bone cancer) or were taking any medication known to affect bone (eg, glucocorticoids, heparin, warfarin, cyclosporine, cancer chemotherapy, and thyroid hormone).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Study Procedures</title><p>The enrollment visit was conducted within 14 days of initiation of study treatment in VOICE. Subsequent MTN-003B study visits occurred every 24 weeks during study treatment until the end of active treatment and 24 and 48 weeks after discontinuation of active treatment. At the enrollment visit, demographics, contraceptive, and lactation history were obtained by self-report using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. The following evaluations were completed at each study visit: updated medical history including contraceptive use, pregnancy testing, height and weight, and physical assessment for malnutrition. Dietary assessment using an abbreviated food frequency questionnaire tailored to calcium-rich foods available at the sites, and physical activity estimation using the International Physical Activity Questionnaires short form (August 2002; available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ipaq.ki.se">www.ipaq.ki.se</ext-link>)<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> were completed at every study visit. Physical activity was categorized as low, medium, or high according to the International Physical Activity Questionnaire algorithm. Site staff provided nutritional counseling and/or calcium supplementation for participants with T-score or Z-score less than &#x02212;2.0 SD at study entry or at any study follow-up visit.

The primary analysis assessed changes in BMD from baseline to 48 weeks of follow-up between each oral active treatment arm (oral TDF, oral FTC/TDF) and the oral placebo arm. Participants were included in the primary analysis when a BMD measure was available at both baseline and the 48-week visit. Participants were excluded from the analysis if HIV-1 seroconversion occurred before the 48-week visit, or if the 48-week visit occurred after January 2, 2012 for participants in the oral TDF arm. This date, January 2, 2012, was chosen for censoring to allow final DXA scan data collection up to 13 weeks after the date that participants began coming off oral TDF because of VOICE Data Safety Monitoring Board recommendation (October 3, 2011). When comparing the oral TDF and oral placebo arms, we limit both arms to BMD measurements from 48-week DXA scans that occurred on or before January 2, 2012. When the active arms are combined for comparison with the oral placebo arm, all arms are censored to include DXA scans that occurred on or before January 2, 2012.</p><p>Student t-test was used to compare the mean percentage change in TH and total spine BMD from baseline to 48 weeks on study between each active oral treatment arm and the oral placebo arm in the primary analysis. The proportion of participants in each arm with at least a 3% decrease in BMD observed at any time in follow-up was compared using a Fisher exact test.</p><p>The analysis was repeated to evaluate change in BMD among participants in active arms with detectable plasma tenofovir (greater than the lower limit of detection) in 75%&#x02013;100% of quarterly plasma samples compared with change in BMD among participants in the placebo arm. Because of this subsetting, the presumed benefit of randomization may be lost. For <italic>t</italic> tests found to be statistically significant, a regression model was used to adjust for potential confounders such as country, age, baseline body mass index (BMI), baseline physical activity level, baseline contraceptive use [depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), other], and history of ever breastfeeding at baseline.</p><p>A secondary analysis was performed using the Student <italic>t</italic> test to compare mean percentage change in BMD of total spine and TH from the end of active study product use to 48 weeks after study product discontinuation between each oral active treatment arm and the oral placebo arm.</p><p>This study was designed based on an expected standard deviation of 4.5% for the percentage change in BMD from baseline to week 48, and a sample size of 100 women per arm would allow the detection of a difference as small as 2.1% with 90% power and type I error rate of 5%.

At the LS, net change was &#x02212;1.0 to &#x02212;1.4% and hip net change was &#x02212;0.7 to &#x02212;0.9%.</p><p>Our study findings are consistent with earlier studies of the impact of TDF used for PrEP on BMD in various populations. In the Centers for Disease Control MSM PrEP study conducted among HIV-negative men in San Francisco,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> a 0.8% net decline at the TH was observed in TDF (compared with placebo) with no significant differences for spine BMD. The lack of impact of TDF at the spine may be related to differences in the study population (all male, mostly white) or the sample size for this study. In the iPrEX study<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> of FTC/TDF in a diverse population of HIV-seronegative men and transgendered women, small but statistically significant net decreases in BMD from baseline in both hip and spine were observed in participants taking FTC/TDF compared with placebo.</p><p>The TDF2 study conducted in Botswana<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> evaluated effects of FTC/TDF on bone among heterosexual men and women (N = 68, 30 women). The net decrease in BMD from baseline to month 30 was of &#x02212;1.62% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0002) at the spine and &#x02212;1.51% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.003) at the hip in the FTC/TDF group when compared with placebo. In our subset of women with detectable tenofovir in most samples, we show similar results with clear evidence of an effect of TDF taking into account baseline factors including contraceptive method.</p><p>We observed a rebound in bone density after stopping FTC/TDF and TDF. The increase in BMD was significantly greater in the active arm participants compared with placebo at 48 weeks after stopping study medication. The difference between the active and placebo arms was evident among the entire population, not only the adherent subset, indicating some impact of TDF on bone even with suboptimal adherence. This reversible effect of TDF on bone has been observed in HIV-positive populations as evidenced by improvement in bone density after switch from TDF to an alternate antiretroviral agent.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The recently published iPrEX study also showed partial reversal of bone loss in the spine for FTC/TDF recipients compared with placebo 24 weeks after discontinuation of PrEP. In our study, we observed continued net increases in bone density at both the spine and hip in the period from 24 to 48 weeks after the end of active treatment, suggesting that longer follow-up is needed to fully assess the trajectory of bone changes. The reversibility of the bone effects of TDF is of particular concern for PrEP use in young adults, especially young women, who have not achieved peak bone mass and who would be eligible for PrEP for many years because of ongoing high risk of HIV acquisition.</p><p>MTN-003B is the largest study of bone density changes with TDF-based PrEP in women. Our results are limited by overall low adherence to TDF and FTC/TDF in the parent study&#x02014;VOICE<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and this likely affected the results of the primary analysis. We used plasma tenofovir levels to define a subset with good adherence to more clearly identify drug effects on bone. After considering differences in populations and study design, the impact of TDF-based PrEP on bone has been remarkably similar across studies to date.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Additionally, our study was affected by stoppage of the TDF arm in VOICE earlier than expected because of futility. Because of this, the active treatment component was shortened, which led to reduction of follow-up time in the analyses of the combined oral active arms.</p><p>Our study has several strengths including the large sample size and excellent retention, resulting in adequate power to determine the impact of TDF on bone in HIV-negative African women. The DXA scans for our study were conducted according to international standards with centralized review of each scan by an independent group and high-quality control. Finally, our study evaluated reversibility of the bone effects of TDF used for PrEP in healthy HIV-negative sub-Saharan women. Our results demonstrating that BMD increased after stopping TDF are very encouraging, but additional longitudinal studies are needed to determine the impact of longer exposures to TDF-containing PrEP among all populations, including daily and intermittent use strategies.</p><p>In conclusion, TDF use resulted in a small but significant decrease in BMD in HIV-negative premenopausal African women, and more importantly, the observed decrease in BMD was reversible. Demonstration projects and PrEP roll-out programs may provide the opportunity for further assessment of the impact of TDF/FTC on bone density.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors acknowledge Karen Patterson and Edward Livant for their dedication in quality control of the DXA data.
