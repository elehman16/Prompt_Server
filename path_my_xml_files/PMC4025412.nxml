Skin cleansing prior to surgical incision is a simple and effective method to prevent wound complications however, the question of which agent is superior for surgical skin antisepsis is unresolved.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This cluster randomised controlled trial aims to compare the incidence of superficial wound complications in patients undergoing elective prosthetic hip or knee replacement surgery receiving surgical skin antisepsis with either: 0.5% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) in 70% alcohol or 10% povidone in 70% alcohol. The trial will be conducted at an Australian tertiary, university affiliated hospital over a 3-year period involving 750 participants. Participants will be drawn from the surgical waiting list. Consent for this study will be &#x02018;opt-out&#x02019; consent. On a given day, all eligible participants will have skin preparation either with 0.5% chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol or 10% povidone iodine in 70% alcohol. The primary outcome is superficial wound complications (comprised of superficial incisional surgical site infections (SSI) and/or prolonged wound ooze) in the first 30&#x02005;days following prosthetic joint replacement surgery. Secondary outcomes will include the incidence of wound complications according to the joint replaced, assessment of the causative agents of SSI and cost-effectiveness analysis. The primary analysis is an intention-to-treat analysis including all participants who undergo randomisation and will be performed at the individual level taking into account the clustering effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study design and protocol was reviewed and approved by the St Vincent's Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC-A 016/14 10/3/2014).

<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The three main agents commonly used for surgical skin antisepsis are chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG), iodophors or alcohol.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Alcohol is frequently combined with CHG or iodophors to optimise the activity of the surgical skin antisepsis.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>

This study demonstrated a reduction in SSI with the use of CHG plus alcohol compared to povidone iodine. However, this study did not include a comparator arm with povidone iodine combined with alcohol therefore it is difficult to attribute the observed difference to chlorhexidine or alcohol (or both in combination).<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Authors from a Cochrane Review concluded &#x0201c;there was insufficient evidence from randomised trials to support or refute the use of one antiseptic over another&#x0201d; and called for further research.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Similar conclusions have been drawn in other systematic reviews and meta-analyses.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>

It represents high volume, high-cost surgery in which SWC can have a devastating effect. In 2012, 90&#x02005;000 Australian patients underwent prosthetic joint surgery, representing an increase of 40% over the previous 10&#x02005;years and this is expected to double again by 2020.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Our pilot data have shown that SWC occurred in 9% of patients undergoing prosthetic hip and knee replacement surgery and 30% required re-admission to acute care hospital for management of the wound complication. Furthermore there was a 92% increased risk of subsequent prosthetic joint infection in patients with SWC. In multivariate analysis of risk factors for SWC, we showed that surgical skin antisepsis with 0.5% CHG in 70% alcohol was associated with a 60% increased risk of SWC compared with 10% povidone iodine (1% available iodine) in 70% alcohol. The association was particularly marked in the prosthetic hip replacement cohort with an 80% increased risk of SWC.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The aim of this cluster randomised controlled trial is to compare the incidence of SWC in all patients undergoing elective prosthetic hip or knee replacement surgery receiving surgical skin antisepsis with either 0.5% CHG in 70% alcohol or 10% povidone iodine (with 1% available iodine) in 70% alcohol.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study centre</title><p>St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne (SVHM) is a Victorian State Centre for joint replacement surgery and a leading academic orthopaedic department with a major focus on prosthetic joint surgery. The SVHM Department of Orthopaedics pursues a major research interest in predictors of outcomes after prosthetic joint surgery and maintains a comprehensive database of all lower limb primary arthroplasties performed since 1998. Extensive follow-up data to 12&#x02005;years are also captured; the SVHM arthroplasty registry has a minimum of 12&#x02005;months of follow-up data for 98% of patients undergoing prosthetic hip and knee replacement surgery.

The study population will be drawn from patients on the waiting list for elective hip and knee replacement surgery at SVHM. Following procedural consent of the patient by the treating orthopaedic surgeon for the planned surgery (hip or knee joint replacement), the patient is placed on the Surgical Waiting List. Once a participant is placed on the waiting list, they will be sent the Patient Information Statement for Opt-Out Consent, which will detail the problem of SWC and the nature of the study. In addition the Patient Information Statement for Opt-Out Consent will explain the process to &#x02018;opt-out&#x02019; of the study. The Project Research Officer will review the Patient Administration System demographic page to identify any participants with a primary language other than English. If such participant is identified, they will be sent the Patient Information Statement for Opt-Out Consent translated to their primary language by a certified translation service, in addition to the English version. The participants will be given a number of options to contact the Project Research Officer to opt-out, including phone, email and mailing address. In addition, patients may request to opt-out of the study at the time of presentation to the pre-admission clinic or on the day of surgery.</p><p>After the Patient Information Statement for Opt-Out Consent is sent to the participant, the Project Research Officer will review the medical record and any potential participant with a documented allergy to either study agent; will be excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Randomisation</title><p>In the opt-out approach, willingness to participate is presumed unless the participant communicates a choice not to participate in the research by the day of surgery. In this cluster randomised controlled trial, the unit of randomisation is the day of surgery. On a given day, all eligible participants will have skin preparation either with (A) 0.5% chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol or (B) 10% povidone iodine (1% available iodine) in 70% alcohol. Each cluster will be randomly assigned in a ratio of 1:1. Randomisation will be performed by a computer-generated random assignment sequence by a statistician and opaque, numbered, tamperproof envelopes containing assignment will be prepared in advance. In addition, the research team involved in the assessment or treatment of patients will have no role in the assignment process. The patients will be blinded to treatment allocation. We recognise that blinding of the operating surgeons to the assigned preventative strategy is not feasible given the different appearance of the CHG and povidone iodine; however, the operating surgeons will be blinded to the allocation until the day of surgery. In addition, the Project Research Officer will be blinded and data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>All patients undergoing prosthetic hip or knee total joint replacement surgery at SVHM.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Patients &#x0003c;18&#x02005;years of age.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients with a documented allergy to chlorhexidine, alcohol or iodophors.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients with a primary language other than English for which certified translation services for that specific language are not available.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients undergoing arthroplasty surgery for traumatic fractured neck of femur.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients undergoing insertion of a tumour endoprosthesis for bone and soft tissue tumours.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Treatment protocol</title><p>Surgical skin antisepsis will be applied in a consistent manner for both study arms (A and B) and will be consistent with international guidelines.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
