Patients with ASA III and IV, those with infection at the site of epidural injection, coagulopathy or bleeding disorders, severely hypovolemic patients, those with raised intracranial pressure, sepsis, preexisting neurological deficit, demyelinating disorder, or severe spinal deformities were excluded from this study.</p><p>Sample size of thirty in each group was calculated based on available reference studies, within 95% confidence limit and 80% of power. Patients were randomized by computer-generated randomization charts into two study groups, Group B (<italic>n</italic> = 30) received 0.125% bupivacaine with 1 ug/ml fentanyl and Group R (<italic>n</italic> = 30) received 0.125% ropivacaine with 1 ug/ml fentanyl postoperatively. Both groups were comparable with respect to their demographic data.</p><p>Baseline blood pressure, pulse rate, and SpO<sub>2</sub> were recorded. Adequate preloading (500 ml) was done with 18-gauge intravenous cannula. Patients received injection glycopyrrolate (0.004 mg/kg) and injection ranitidine (1 mg/kg) intravenously as premedication. Thereafter, an epidural catheter was inserted at the lumbar level (L1&#x02013;L2 or L2&#x02013;L3). The space was checked by loss of resistance technique and confirmed by the meniscus sign. Epidural test dose was given with 3 ml 2% adrenalized lignocaine. The absence of tingling numbness in the lower limbs and tachycardia was confirmed after 5&#x02013;7 cm of catheter was placed in the epidural space. After fixation of catheter, patients were made supine and free injection of saline through the catheter was checked. Patients were premedicated with injection fentanyl 2 ug/kg and injection midazolam 0.02 mg/kg. Patients were preoxygenated with 100% O<sub>2</sub> for 3 min. General anesthesia was given with injection propofol 2 mg/kg mixed with injection xylocard 20 mg intravenously. Suitable relaxant was given to facilitate tracheal intubation after confirming ventilation. Anesthesia was maintained with O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, and propofol or isoflurane. Muscle paralysis was maintained with injection vecuronium bromide intravenously.</p><p>Group B patients received 0.25% bupivacaine with 1 ug/ml fentanyl 8 ml bolus after induction of general anesthesia. After 1 h of bolus, the patient received continuous epidural infusion of 0.25% bupivacaine with 1 ug/ml fentanyl at the rate 6 ml/h intraoperatively. The rate of infusion was adjusted as per the hemodynamic parameters of the patient. Group R patients received ropivacaine instead of bupivacaine. The pulse rate, blood pressure, central venous pressure, SpO<sub>2</sub>, and EtCO<sub>2</sub> were monitored intraoperatively. Infusion was stopped at closure which was approximately 30&#x02013;45 min before reversal. All patients were reversed with 0.008 mg/kg glycopyrrolate and 0.06 mg/kg neostigmine.</p><p>Postoperatively, patients were shifted to recovery room. Patient's hemodynamic stability was confirmed, and visual analog scale (VAS) score and Bromage score were noted before initiation of respective epidural local anesthetic infusion. Group B received continuous epidural infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine with 1 ug/ml fentanyl at the rate 6 ml/h. Group R received 0.125% ropivacaine instead of bupivacaine. The rate of infusion was increased or decreased as per the hemodynamic parameters and VAS score of the patient. Hemodynamic parameters, visual analog scale (0-10), level of sensory block (assessed by pinprick), and level of motor block (based on Bromage scale: 0 - able to move hip, knee, ankle, and toes [0% block], 1 - just able to flex knee but still full flexion of ankles possible [33%] [partial], 2 - unable to flex knees but flexion of ankles possible [66%] [acceptable], and 3 - unable to move knees and ankle [100%] [complete block]) were monitored for 24 h postoperatively and need for rescue analgesia, side effects, and interventions if any were noted. Whenever the VAS score was more than 3, the rate of infusion was stepped up in a graded manner by 2 ml/h up to 10 ml/h. If not relieved after 10 ml/h, rescue analgesia was given in the form of injection tramadol 50 mg intravenously. No other form of sedative or analgesia was permitted except rescue analgesia. In case of occurrence of motor block the infusion was stopped temporarily till the Bromage score was 0.</p><p>The findings were analyzed statistically using Chi-square test and Student's <italic>t</italic>-tests using SPSS version 12 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL).

In the recent years, there has been an increasing amount of research over newer local anesthetic ropivacaine which is considered to be less toxic and safer than bupivacaine with similar pharmacodynamic properties.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Ropivacaine is a long-acting, enantiomerically pure (S-enantiomer) amide local anesthetic with a high pKa (ionization constant), and low lipid solubility which blocks nerve fibers involved in pain transmission (A delta and C fibers) more than those controlling motor function (A-beta fibers). Thus, it is similar to bupivacaine with regard to pain relief but has less propensity to cause motor blockade at low concentrations.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Furthermore, the duration of motor block is shorter with ropivacaine. The drug is less cardiotoxic than equal concentrations of bupivacaine and has a much higher threshold for CNS toxicity than bupivacaine.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Before the actual project, a pilot study was done to determine the optimum concentration of local anesthetic to be administered in our patient population. Considering the efficacy and relative lack of side effects, 0.125% drug (bupivacaine and ropivacaine) was considered optimum and hence selected for the study.</p><p>Virmani <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that continuous infusion as compared to intermittent boluses provided better pain relief at rest, on movement and provided sustained degree of analgesia.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Wheatley <italic>et al</italic>. analyzed four studies and reported that the group that received a combination of local anesthetic and lipophilic opioid as a continuous epidural infusion had much better dynamic relief as compared to groups that received either drug alone.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>We decided to add opioids as it reduces the requirement of local anesthetic and the subsequent complications and enhances the analgesia.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] A lipophilic opioid such as fentanyl is preferred as it gets rapidly absorbed in the spinal cord and nearby vessels. Therefore, there is rapid decrease in the cerebrospinal fluid concentration and reduced cephalad spread.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Thus, there is decreased risk of delayed respiratory depression.</p><p>Hemodynamic parameters remained stable in both the groups in the postoperative period. However, four patients in the bupivacaine group developed hypotension, of which two patients required temporary withholding of infusion. Only one patient in the ropivacaine group developed hypotension (systolic blood pressure &#x0003c;90 mmHg).[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] This hypotension was mild and responded to intravenous fluid. Thus, when used in the said concentrations, both the drugs were found to be safe and had a similar effect on the patient's heart rate and blood pressure.</p><p>This trend of hemodynamic parameters was similar to that observed by Akifumi <italic>et al</italic>., Pouzeratte <italic>et al</italic>., and Finucane <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>The mean oxygen saturation in the postoperative period was 99% in both the groups. One patient in the ropivacaine group developed saturation &#x0003c;90% 16 h after surgery. He had to be intubated and ventilated mechanically. A lipophilic opioid such as fentanyl is less likely to cause respiratory depression. It is more common with hydrophilic opioids such as morphine, which are capable of cephalad migration. Subarachnoid or intravenous migration of the epidural catheter can also result in respiratory depression. Furthermore, with continuous infusion, there is increase in protein binding (&#x003b1;1-acid glycoprotein) and decreased clearance of the drug.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In addition, the poor general condition and extensive surgery can also contribute toward respiratory insufficiency.</p><p>In our study, the mean quantity of drug required in the postoperative period in ropivacaine group was more than in bupivacaine group as against Korula <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] However, the difference between them was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.102). Higher doses of ropivacaine as compared to bupivacaine are generally required to elicit equivalent analgesic effects.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Bupivacaine is said to be 40% more potent than ropivacaine.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Mean VAS score during the postoperative period at 0 min was similar in the two Groups. It decreased steadily with the progression of infusion. This is similar to the findings reported in earlier studies.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>The essence of good postoperative analgesia using a local anesthetic lies in pain relief without loss of motor power. This is important to allow physiotherapy, facilitate early mobilization, and prevent deep vein thrombosis.</p><p>The degree of motor block was calculated according to Bromage scale. Out of thirty patients in each group, 2 (6.6%) patients in the ropivacaine group and 7 (23.3%) patients in the bupivacaine group developed motor block. In the ropivacaine group, one patient had Bromage score of 2 at 0 min, probably as a result of continued effect of 0.25% ropivacaine received intraoperatively that led to the partial motor block in the lower limb. The infusion was stopped temporarily, and motor power was allowed to revert according to the protocol. The score improved to Bromage 1 by 30 min and 0 by 90 min. In the second patient, the score had reached a value of more than 2 by 16 h. The infusion was stopped. He also developed respiratory depression at this time and was intubated and mechanically ventilated. This could probably be due to fentanyl in the infusion over 20 h causing respiratory depression in an elderly patient.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>There is a greater degree of separation between motor and sensory blockade with ropivacaine. This can be due to it being less lipophilic than bupivacaine and is less likely to block large myelinated nerve fibers.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] However, the motor block so developed is usually not incapacitating and does not hamper the patient's mobilization in bed or physiotherapy. Brodner <italic>et al</italic>. reported bromage of &#x0003e;0 only in the bupivacaine group.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Furthermore, ability to mobilize was better in the ropivacaine group. J&#x000f8;rgensen <italic>et al</italic>. observed that 7% of patients in ropivacaine group and 15% in bupivacaine group had motor blockade.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Berti <italic>et al</italic>. and Paddalwar <italic>et al</italic>. also had similar findings.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Proportion of cases with a sensory level of T6&#x02013;T10 was significantly more in bupivacaine group as compared to ropivacaine group till the end of 24 h (<italic>P</italic> = 0.003) though their VAS scores were comparable. Surgical pain is related to traction and dissection which amounts to visceral pain. However, what we assessed by pinprick was somatic pain and not visceral pain.</p><p>Studies by Casati <italic>et al</italic>., Pouzeratte <italic>et al</italic>., J&#x000f8;rgensen <italic>et al</italic>., and Surabathuni <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the need for rescue analgesia was more in the ropivacaine group than the bupivacaine group.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] However, in our study four patients (13.3%) in each group required rescue analgesia.</p><p>The complications or the side effects of continuous epidural infusion of the local anesthetics and the opioids could be due to the technical complications involved in the insertion of the epidural catheter such as trauma, bloody tap, or injury to the nerve root. The side effects could also occur due to the effect of the drugs causing autonomic blockade and hemodynamic disturbance or effect of intravascular absorption of the drug reaching toxic levels. We did not have any of the above complications related to the procedure.</p><p>In our study, the most common side effect was motor block (7 in Group B as against 2 in Group R) followed by hypotension (4 in Group B vs. 1 in Group R) and use of rescue analgesia (4 in each group). No other complications such as nausea, urinary retention, and convulsions were found in our study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both ropivacaine and
