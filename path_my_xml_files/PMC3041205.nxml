Furthermore, lower doses do not achieve 24-h insulin coverage in all individuals (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), and there remains some within-subject variability in the metabolic effect impeding optimal insulin titration. These limitations, together with a lack in postprandial insulin coverage, may partly explain why a large proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes fail to reach and maintain recommended A1C targets (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) considered to minimize the risk for microvascular complications (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>To provide more optimal basal insulin coverage, insulin degludec (IDeg), a new-generation ultra-long-acting basal insulin, was developed. Primarily as a result of the formation of soluble multihexamers at the injection site, IDeg has a smooth and stable pharmacokinetic profile at steady state (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) that gives rise to a considerably longer action profile than current basal insulin formulations (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) as well as lower within-subject variability (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>IDeg can be coformulated with insulin aspart (IAsp) (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) resulting, for the first time, in a soluble preparation comprising two different insulin analogs (IDegAsp: 70% v/v IDeg as basal insulin and 30% v/v IAsp as prandial insulin). By providing both basal and rapid-acting insulin analogs in one injection, IDegAsp could be an attractive alternative to the common strategy of initiating insulin therapy with basal insulin only on top of oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs). Indeed, for many patients, simultaneously targeting fasting and postmeal plasma glucose could be a more suitable approach to achieving and sustaining optimal glycemic control (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>In this exploratory, clinical proof-of-concept trial, we compared the safety and efficacy of IDegAsp with insulin glargine (IGlar), both given once-daily in combination with metformin in insulin-na&#x000ef;ve subjects with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on OAD therapy. To establish the optimal ratio of IDeg to IAsp, an alternative formulation of IDegAsp (AF) containing a higher percentage of IAsp (45%) was also evaluated.</p><sec id="s5"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty-two sites in five European countries (France, Germany, Norway, Romania, and Spain) participated in this phase 2, open-label, randomized, controlled 16-week trial.

The reduction in A1C was slightly (nonsignificantly) greater with IDegAsp (estimated mean treatment difference [IDegAsp-IGlar]: &#x02212;0.11 [95% CI &#x02212;0.41 to 0.19]) but confirmatory trials are needed to establish potential treatment differences. Nevertheless, the observation that &#x0223c;50% of subjects achieved an A1C target of &#x0003c;7.0% with IDegAsp, and that rates of hypoglycemia were similar to IGlar despite greater reductions in 2-h postdinner plasma glucose increment, is promising and warrants further investigation in larger, longer-term trials.</p><p>In principle, initiation of insulin therapy with a coformulation of two distinct insulin analogs, such as IDegAsp, has the potential to combine the simplicity of one insulin injection with the advantages of the more physiological profiles of both prandial and basal insulin analogs. Insulin regimens with prandial components have been shown to achieve lower A1C levels than basal insulin alone, but at the expense of higher rates of hypoglycemia and greater weight gain (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Until now, it has not been feasible to combine rapid-acting prandial insulin analogs with a long-acting basal analog in one injection. This might be convenient not only for insulin initiation but also for intensification of insulin therapy because many patients will require prandial insulin on top of basal insulin therapy (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Indeed, by addressing both prandial and basal insulin needs from the outset, glycemic control is expected to be achieved in more subjects and sustained for longer, thereby delaying the need to intensify treatment with additional injections. Therefore, it should be tested in adequately powered studies whether or not the benefits previously seen with basal and rapid-acting insulin analogs (e.g., better postprandial glucose control, less [nocturnal] hypoglycemia) can be achieved through the early introduction of and long-term treatment with a coformulation such as IDegAsp. It is important, though, to choose the right proportions of rapid-acting and basal insulin; in this trial we also tested a formulation of IDegAsp containing a higher proportion of IAsp (45%). This AF was associated with a twofold higher rate of confirmed, mostly nocturnal, hypoglycemia and, consequently, fewer subjects achieved A1C targets without hypoglycemia in the last 4 weeks of treatment. In view of these findings, the clinical development of the AF has been discontinued.</p><p>In contrast to AF, the overall safety profile of IDegAsp was comparable to IGlar: no relevant changes in safety assessments occurred, hypoglycemia rates were low (only one nocturnal hypoglycemic event was reported for IDegAsp), and no increases in mean body weight were observed. With respect to efficacy, IDegAsp provided markedly better postdinner plasma glucose control than IGlar (at a similarly low level of nocturnal hypoglycemia). However, this did not translate into improved overall glycemic control; at end of trial, no apparent difference in A1C was found between treatments. It cannot be ruled out that the period of time when postdinner plasma glucose levels differed between treatments was of too short a duration to translate into a significant reduction in A1C, but it should be noted that the lack of an A1C difference is in accordance with early trials with other novel insulin preparations. In fact, initial studies with short-acting insulin analogs did not show a superior effect on A1C lowering compared with human insulin despite lower postprandial glucose levels, and it was not before basal insulin therapy was optimized that beneficial effects on A1C and/or hypoglycemia were observed (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Because this was the first trial of IDegAsp in a clinical setting, a relatively conservative titration algorithm was used, which resulted in &#x0223c;50% of subjects in each treatment arm achieving the FPG target after 16 weeks of treatment. It therefore seems conceivable that a more intense titration algorithm, over a longer time period, may lead to greater glucose and A1C improvements with IDegAsp. In addition, it is possible that glycemic control could have been further optimized by tailoring the dosing of IDegAsp to coincide with the meal inducing the largest postprandial glucose excursion (in the present trial, mean postmeal glucose excursions at baseline were greatest after breakfast). It is noteworthy that similar glycemic control was achieved with lower doses of IDegAsp, although this needs to be confirmed in larger studies. The design of ongoing phase 3 trials with IDegAsp will take many of the limitations of the current trial into account: more intense treatment algorithms will be applied so that more subjects are anticipated to reach titration targets. This is not expected to lead to higher rates of hypoglycemia than in this study because dosing of IDegAsp will be targeted to the most appropriate meal of the day rather than fixed to a certain meal.</p><p>Despite the limitations of this proof-of-concept study with a small sample size, a relatively short treatment duration and an open study design, it did show IDegAsp to be a promising treatment option for initiating (and potentially intensifying) insulin therapy in subjects with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with OADs. IDegAsp was safe and well tolerated, providing comparable overall glycemic control to IGlar with lower doses and with the additional benefit of postdinner plasma glucose control that did not result in an increased risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia.</p></sec>
