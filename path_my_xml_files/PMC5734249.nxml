Our institution has developed a standardised, manual-based, supported self-management programme: Self-Management Programme of Activity Coping and Education (SPACE for COPD(C)). SPACE was previously piloted on a 1-2-1 basis, delivered by researchers, to individuals with COPD. Discussions with stakeholders highlighted considerable interest in delivering the SPACE for COPD(C) intervention as a group-based self-management programme facilitated by healthcare professionals (HCPs) in primary care settings. The study aims are to explore the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy for the intervention to be delivered and supported by HCPs and to examine whether group-based delivery of SPACE for COPD(C), with sustained support, improves patient outcomes following the SPACE for COPD(C) intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A prospective, multi-site, single-blinded randomised controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted, with follow-up at 6 and 9 months. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the control group (usual care) or intervention group (a six-session, group-based SPACE for COPD(C)self-management programme delivered over 5 months). The primary outcome is change in COPD assessment test at 6&#x02009;months.</p><p>A discussion session will be conducted with HCPs who deliver the intervention to discuss and gain insight into any potential facilitators/barriers to implementing the intervention in practice. Furthermore, we will conduct semi-structured focus groups with intervention participants to understand feasibility and acceptability.

This study explores a group-based supported self-management programme for individuals with COPD.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This is a pragmatic trial where the study intervention (a group-based self-management support intervention for people with COPD) will be delivered and supported by healthcare professionals in community settings. The study has been designed to align with how the intervention might be delivered in routine clinical practice.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Our follow-up period is 3 months post-intervention. Unfortunately, due to funding constraints, we are unable to carry out a longer&#x000a0;term follow-up.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#x000a0;(COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide and is associated with considerable disability, impaired quality of life and high utilisation of healthcare resources.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Symptoms and manifestations of the disease can be modified by adopting appropriate health behaviours including, but not limited to, exercise, physical activity, smoking cessation, anxiety management, breathing control, medication adherence and exacerbation management.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Acknowledging the importance of the role of the patient in adopting these behaviours, there has been a shift in attitude from a traditional paternalistic model of care towards a more collaborative approach for chronic disease management. The National Health Service (NHS) Five Year Forward View&#x02019;s aim is for the NHS to become better at helping people to manage their own health by staying healthy, making informed choices of treatment, managing conditions and avoiding complications.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Inevitably, the patient is predominantly responsible for administering their own care and making choices about health behaviours that will affect their outcomes. Self-management support aims to inform and support patients in making these choices. National and international guidelines for the management of COPD suggest that self-management support should be provided for people with COPD, though at present evidence for how and when that support should be delivered is less robust.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</p><p>Reports in the literature describe programmes that have targeted interventions for patients who have been hospitalised with a COPD-related admission, often with the primary ambition of reducing future admissions.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> These studies have had little impact on readmission. Arguably, the offer of supported self-management should be offered earlier in the disease trajectory. Other COPD self-management programmes beyond the UK have been described in a stable population. Although the models of care delivered are quite heterogeneous,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> with some programmes providing up to 2&#x02009;years of weekly supervised exercise training and education.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 6&#x02013;8</xref> The infrastructure and resources required to provide such comprehensive support means they are unlikely to be deliverable to the breadth of the COPD population in the UK. In order to address this, we previously developed and tested a new self-management programme that offered a &#x02018;light touch&#x02019; approach so that it could be provided on a larger scale.</p><p>A Self-Management Programme of Activity Coping and Education&#x02014;SPACE for COPD(C)&#x02014;aims to support people with COPD in managing day-to-day tasks, minimise symptom burden, provoke health enhancing behaviour change and enhance emotional well-being. The programme is structured around the SPACE for COPD(C) manual, which combines both generic self-management skills and disease-specific tasks. Pilot testing assessed the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention to patients,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and a fully powered randomised controlled trial assessed the efficacy of the intervention in primary care,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> powered for change in symptom burden measured by the self-reported Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ-SR) dyspnoea domain at 6&#x02009;months. In these studies, the SPACE for&#x000a0;COPD(C) manual was introduced to patients during an initial consultation with a healthcare professional&#x000a0;(HCP) (using motivational interviewing techniques), followed by two telephone calls during the subsequent 6&#x02009;weeks. Secondary outcomes included other domains of the CRQ-SR, shuttle walking tests, disease knowledge, anxiety, depression, self-efficacy, smoking status and healthcare utilisation measured at baseline, 6&#x02009;weeks and 6&#x02009;months follow-up. Results demonstrated significant short-term improvements in CRQ-SR dyspnoea, anxiety, fatigue and emotion scores, exercise performance and disease knowledge. At 6&#x02009;months, anxiety, exercise performance and smoking status outcomes remained significantly different between the intervention group and the usual care group, though there was no between-group difference in change in CRQ-SR dyspnoea.</p><p>Implementation focused work carried out following these studies with HCPs in primary care and local Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs), demonstrated considerable interest in delivering the SPACE for COPD(C) intervention as a group-based intervention rather than on a one-to-one basis. The most common theoretical rationale underpinning delivery of group-based self-management support interventions is Social Cognitive Theory/Social Learning Theory.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> Bandura&#x02019;s (1977, 1997) social learning theory posits that behaviour is influenced by beliefs about one&#x02019;s ability to perform a particular behaviour (self-efficacy expectations), beliefs about the effectiveness of the behaviour (eg, the advantages and disadvantages of performing this behaviour; outcome expectations) and learning through social observation (including social norms, social support or pressure and the behaviours of others). Peer support and use of other patients as role models are approaches grounded in this theory and directly applicable to group-based self-management support interventions.</p><p>Delivery of SPACE for COPD(C) as a group-based intervention allows for several face-to-face contacts between patients and HCPs over a number of sessions. These contacts could be spread out further across a longer period, which may be more successful in maintaining behaviour change. Furthermore, having earlier sessions closer together in time allows group cohesion to take place, an important factor in optimising group dynamics.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</p><p>The SPACE for COPD(C) intervention has also previously been delivered by a member of the research team rather than by existing clinical services. If the group-based intervention were to be implemented in primary care following the current study, importance would be placed on delivery by HCPs in a format that is feasible and acceptable to HCPs, health service providers and to patients. Understanding how this intervention can be delivered within existing health services and identifying key barriers and facilitators to its implementation is an important next step in the development of this complex intervention.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Aims and objectives of the study</title><p>This study aims to:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Examine whether group-based delivery of SPACE for COPD(C), with sustained support, improves patient outcomes following the intervention compared with a control group;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Explore feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of the intervention to be delivered and supported by HCPs.

The aim of the SPACE for COPD(C) programme is to support people with COPD in managing day-to-day tasks, minimise symptom burden, provoke health enhancing behaviour change and enhance emotional well-being. The programme is structured around the SPACE for COPD(C) manual, which combines both generic self-management skills and disease-specific tasks. The programme is facilitated by two trained HCPs (eg, physiotherapists, respiratory specialist nurses, occupational therapists&#x000a0;and health psychologists) to groups of up to 10 participants and delivered through six 2-hour sessions, over a 5-month period. These sessions will be held at community venues, at times and locations to suit participants of the group to increase retention.

Participants will be familiar with one another (which can help facilitate discussion or the ability to challenge each other comfortably) as they have attended multiple group sessions together. Purposive sampling will be employed to recruit intervention participants. Audio-recorded focus group discussions (approximately 60&#x02009;min) will be conducted face-to-face between each participant group, an experienced interviewer and an observer/note-taker. Focus groups will be carried out at the end of the last group session for participant ease, as discussed with study patient representatives.

Opportunities to improve self-management skills should be embedded in a pulmonary rehabilitation programme.
