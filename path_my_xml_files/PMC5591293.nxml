The ENKL cases in stage I&#x02013;IV during 2000 to 2015 were collected from two medical centers (group A, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;192), and were randomly divided into the group B (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;155) and C (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;37). Although the significant factors identified by the univariate analysis differed between the group A and B, the multivariate Cox regression indicated the same factors. C-index of the model was slightly better than Yang&#x02019;s, but its integrated Brier score (IBS) was obviously lower than Yang&#x02019;s both in the group A and B. Additionally, minimal depth of random survival forest (RSF) classifier confirmed that the prognostic ability of hemoglobin was better than age both in the group A and B. In the calibration of the nomogram, the predicted 3-year or 5-year OS of our nomogram well agreed with the corresponding actual OS. In conclusion, Hemoglobin is a prognostic factor for nasal ENKL patients in stage I - IV, and integrating it into a validated prognostic nomogram, whose generalization error is the smallest among the evaluated models, can be used to predict the patients&#x02019; outcome.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Nasal extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKL) is a rare subset of lymphomas, and is relatively prevalent in Asia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.

Before any treatment, patient information included history taking, physical and laboratory examinations, and results of computerized tomography. Hemoglobin levels were classified into lower or higher than 120&#x02009;g/L. To minimize migrations of staging techniques through a time-span of 15 years, only computerized tomography series of PET/CT scans were used to stage and evaluate the diseases (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;17). Our protocol was approved by the ethics committee at SCHI and FAHAMU.</p><p id="Par6">Because tumor heterogeneity affects the robustness of predictors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, some re-sampling approaches are used to ensure our model can be applied in other cohorts of patients. Using SPSS software (version 10.01), 20% of all recruited patients (group A) were randomized into the group C, and the rest was as the group B. Both the group A and B were used to develop prognostic model for guaranteeing its repeatability. And then, the group B and C were used to validate the model for assuring its reliability. The approach was similar to the external validation procedure, i.e. the developed model (from group B) was validated in another cohort of patients (group C).</p><p id="Par7">Additionally, using the bootstrap method, a 10 fold cross-validation was used to test the generalization ability of the model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The patients (group A and B) were equally and randomly divided into10 subsets. And then, the model was repeatedly trained and validated 10 times. Each time, the pooled data of 9 subsets were used to train the model, which was validated in the retained subset subsequently. The average error across 10 rounds (integrated Brier score, IBS) could estimate the error in generalizing the model in an independent dataset, and a lower IBS indicated a better model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">According to the paradigm of the two hospitals, CT was the first-line treatment, and only the poor responders would receive RT. After the publication of the study by Li <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> in 2006, more patients received RT than before; however, RT was still not the first-line treatment.

And then, the multivariate Cox regression was used to select the qualified factors against OS from the significant ones.

Although, among the evaluated models, ours just slightly improves C-index, its generalization error is the smallest.</p><p id="Par25">Classified as a kind of lymphoma, nasal ENKL shared some prognostic factors with other lymphomas, such as IPI and LDH level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Previously, using multivariate Cox regression, several studies tried to relate hemoglobin to the prognosis of the patients.

In the univariate analysis, the factor of hemoglobin was significant against progression free survival (P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.034), but not significant against OS (P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.057). In a cohort of 321 patients, Wang <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> found that hemoglobin, ECOG PS, age, LDH and Ann Arbor stage were significant factors for both progression free survival and OS, but they did not validate the results in another group of patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

Furthermore, the classifier can provide indicators, such as minimal depth, to evaluate the prognostic ability of each factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.

Furthermore, as indicated by the IBS of 10 fold cross-validation, the generalization error of our model was the smallest among the evaluated models, especially was obviously better than Yang&#x02019;s. It should be noted that, for the comparison of models, we re-regressed Yang&#x02019;s model, which differed from its origin in the scoring points of factors.
