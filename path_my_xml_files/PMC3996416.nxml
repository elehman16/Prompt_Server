direction and velocity, as well as frequent body contact. Ice hockey games are 60 minutes in
duration and consist of three 20-minute periods. The typical player plays for 15 to 20
minutes; however, star players could have 30 to 35 minutes of ice time<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. All activity in ice hockey occurs on ice, and so some tests
for ice hockey players also need to be performed on ice. In spite of these necessaries,
little data exist on systemic training programs and proper test methods to improve skating
abilities in ice hockey players so far. Skating ability is one of the most important factors
for ice hockey players. Therefore, ice hockey players, compared with other athletes, are
required to continuously improve their levels of fitness and require systemic and organized
training programs that help them improve their skills.</p><p>Recently, the use of complex training as a method of combining weight and plyometric
exercises during the same training session is growing in popularity<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Verkhoshansky<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> introduced the term complex training, which describes a &#x0201c;complex of
exercises for the development of reactive ability is fulfilled in a background of heightened
excitability of the central nervous system, brought about by preliminary fulfillment of
exercise requiring great power.&#x0201d; Despite the fact that questions remain about the potential
effectiveness and development and implementation of this type of training, results of recent
studies are useful in guiding practitioners in the development and implementation of complex
training programs<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The proper combination
of plyometric training and weight training is thought to be useful for developing athletic
power. Complex training alternates biomechanically similar high-load weight-training
exercises with plyometric exercises, set for set, in the same workout<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. An example of complex
training would include performing a set of squats followed by a set of jump squats<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Chu<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested that high-intensity
weight training can improve the excitability of the motor nerve and that this provides the
best condition for plyometric training that follows immediately after. Plyometrics may be
defined as &#x0201c;jumping exercises that involve a rapid deceleration of body mass followed
immediately by rapid acceleration of that body mass in an opposing direction&#x0201d;<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Weight training facilitates concentric
performance to a greater extent, whereas plyometric training emphasizes the eccentric
component and rate of force development<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, effective complex training workouts rely on a succession
of successful marriages of a resistance (weight) training exercise and a plyometric training
exercise<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The purpose of this study was
to evaluate the effects of complex training on skating abilities of ice hockey players using
the 5 time 18 meters shuttle, t-test, Rink dash 5 times, and Line drill before, during, and
after training.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Sahmyook University (SUCB

the center of the center circle. The player starts when he hears a whistle being blown.
First, he skates to the center line and stops. Second, he steps forward, turn to the left,
and skates to the end of the center circle. Third, he aligns his feet, turns to the right,
and then skates to the end of the circle and stops. Fourth, he steps forward, turns to the
right, and skates to the middle of the center circle and stops. Fifth, he skates backwards
to the blue line. The T-test tests both the ability to rapidly change direction and the
agility of ice hockey players.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p> Rink dash five times on ice</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-26-533-g003"/></fig>, rink dash 5 times is performed by skating from one side of the rink to the other,

T-test, rink dash 5 times, and line drill. To evaluate skating abilities, all subjects
completed the tests before (0 week), during (6 weeks), and after training (12 weeks). Each
test was measured with 1/100-sec, accuracy by using a stopwatch. All tests were measured
twice, and the better record of two was selected for each test. All subjects took a rest of
10&#x02005;min between tests. The intensity of all tests was measured by checking the subject&#x02019;s
pulse over the carotid artery for 10 seconds. Then their heart rate was evaluated by
multiplying the number by 6. Maximal heart rate was calculated by subtracting the subjects
age from 220, and all subjects were asked to exert their maximum effort and maintain their
maximal heart rate during every test.</p><p>The data analysis of this study was performed by using the IBM PC SAS package (Release 6.12
Windows), and the mean and standard deviation for each measurement item were calculated in
each group. The interaction effects were examined between group and time variation by
two-way repeated measures ANOVA. We used block design ANOVA to compare values from before,
during, and after training with respect to the overall training effects in players. Duncan&#x02019;s
Multiple Range test was used for Post-hoc analysis if significant differences existed. P
values of &#x0003c;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 5.</label><caption><title> Results of skating ability tests</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Test</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Before (sec)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">During (sec)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">After (sec)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02206; (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">5 times 18&#x02005;m shuttle***</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36.73&#x000b1;1.20</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36.97&#x000b1;1.09</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">37.47&#x000b1;1.44</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.01</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Training<sup>###</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40.36&#x000b1;1.84</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">38.28&#x000b1;1.14</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36.80&#x000b1;0.87</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;8.82</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">t-test***</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.42&#x000b1;0.61</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.70&#x000b1;0.42</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.69&#x000b1;0.38</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.87</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Training <sup>###</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.51&#x000b1;0.78</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.21&#x000b1;0.43</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.53&#x000b1;0.43</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;17.20</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Rink dash 5 times***</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">86.59&#x000b1;2.47</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">86.68&#x000b1;1.95</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">86.62&#x000b1;2.02</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.03</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Training <sup>###</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">92.76&#x000b1;4.44</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">88.33&#x000b1;2.17</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">86.64&#x000b1;2.10</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;6.60</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Line drill</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control <sup>###</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">53.04&#x000b1;1.26</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">51.46&#x000b1;1.73</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">49.11&#x000b1;2.09</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;7.41</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Training <sup>###</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">55.79&#x000b1;1.66</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">51.50&#x000b1;1.38</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50.56&#x000b1;3.67</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;9.37</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are expressed as means &#x000b1; SD. ** p&#x0003c; 0.01 (group); *** p&#x0003c; 0.001 (group);

with other methods of training<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The rationale for this study was based on the hypothesis that skating abilities, which are
related to the real performance on ice, in ice hockey players are influenced by a complex
training program intervention off the ice for 12 weeks. Findings of the present study
support this hypothesis.</p><p>Evans et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> examined the complex
training effect of combined bench press and medicine ball throws and demonstrated improved
plyometric performance in the complex condition with 10 college-age males. The subjects
performed a seated medicine ball put before and four minutes after performing a bench press
with a 5RM load. The results indicated a significant increase in medicine ball put distance
of 31.4&#x02005;cm (no standard deviation available) following the 5 RM bench press compared with
the medicine ball put distance before the bench press<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The researchers also reported a strong correlation between
improvement in medicine ball put distance and 5 RM bench press strength<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, the T group performed a medicine
ball chest pass after performing a bench press, and the results demonstrated improvement of
skating abilities in ice hockey players. Although many training studies have also been
conducted to examine the effectiveness of complex training, few studies have been conducted
to examine the effectiveness of complex training with sport-specific training in ice hockey
players.</p><p>Another training study examined the effects of a three-week complex training program with
seven division I college female basketball players<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The data from this investigation show that the complex training
program was effective in eliciting statistically significant improvement in speed in the
300-meter shuttle<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Ebben &#x00026;
Watts<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> suggest that the complex training
program design must consider important variables such as exercise selection, load, and rest
between sets. For example, recent research suggests that three to four minutes of rest
between the weight training and plyometric training portions of complex training may be
optimal<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many ice hockey coaches are teaching players with their own training methods and are also
applying their own methods of measurements to them. Unfortunately, systemic training
programs for ice hockey players have so far been insufficient. Everybody is keenly aware of
the need for systemic training programs based on scientific theories as well as methods of
measurement to improve skating abilities in ice hockey players. Therefore, complex training
programs are recommended for ice hockey players based on the present study. In addition,
developing speed should be emphasized in training programs to improve the overall
performance of ice hockey players. Future studies should examine the effects of more
systemic training programs on on-ice performance in ice hockey players.</p><p>In conclusion, continuous complex training, including on-ice skating training, produced a
significant improvement in the skating abilities of ice hockey players. This improvement is
suggested to be due to improved speed resulting from the complex training program
intervention.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by a Sahmyook University Research Grant.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Montgomery</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Physiology of ice hockey</article-title>. <source>Sports
