The current study was an additional study to investigate the value of neurofilament (NfH) and other biomarkers in predicting prognosis and/or response to treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>SPMS patients who attended the NHNN or the Royal Free Hospital, UK, eligible for inclusion were invited to participate in the biomarker study. Primary outcome was whether lamotrigine would significantly reduce detectable serum NfH at 0-12, 12&#x02013;24 and 0&#x02013;24 months compared to placebo. Other serum/plasma and CSF biomarkers were also explored.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Treatment effect by comparing absolute changes in NfH between the lamotrigine and placebo group showed no difference, however based on serum lamotrigine adherence there was significant decline in NfH (NfH 12&#x02013;24 months p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.043, Nfh 0&#x02013;24 months p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.023). Serum NfH correlated with disability: walking times, 9-HPT (non-dominant hand), PASAT, z-score, MSIS-29 (psychological) and EDSS and MRI cerebral atrophy and MTR. Other biomarkers explored in this study were not found to be significantly associated, aside from that of plasma osteopontin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The relations between NfH and clinical scores of disability and MRI measures of atrophy and disease burden support NfH being a potential surrogate endpoint complementing MRI in neuroprotective trials and sample sizes for such trials are presented here. We did not observe a reduction in NfH levels between the Lamotrigine and placebo arms, however, the reduction in serum NfH levels based on lamotrigine adherence points to a possible neuroprotective effect of lamotrigine on axonal degeneration.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by National MS Society (USA) under the Promise 2010 initiative and the MS Society of Great Britain and Northern Ireland as part of exploratory analysis for the UK MS Clinical Trial Network.

Differences in the distribution of changes between lamotrigine and placebo and lamotrigine adherent and non-adherent groups were determined by Kruskal-Wallis test. A comparison of subjects getting better (reduction in NfH, NOx and GFAP levels, and a rise in BDNF and NGF levels) were determined by Chi-square test. To assess the relationships between the serum biomarkers and the clinical and MRI measures the levels were categorised. For NfH and GFAP three categories were defined: absent (below assay detection), and above and below the median of the detectable concentrations. For NOx, BDNF and NGF four categories were defined bounded approximately by the quartiles of each biomarker's distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0070019.s002">Table S1</xref>). Generalised linear models were used to assess the relationships between the categorised biomarkers and clinical and MRI measures. For each clinical and MRI measure, least squares means for each level of the biomarkers were obtained from the generalised linear model. These means and their confidence levels were tabulated and presented graphically. Walking times and 9-HPT times were log transformed as their distributions were more symmetrical on a log scale. Time to event analyses were conducted on walking times and 9-HPT times, in which uncompleted tests were treated as censored observations at 300 s. Survival curves of walking times and 9-HPT times were produced. T1 and T2 lesion volumes were also log transformed prior to analyses. All other clinical and MRI measures were analysed in their original units.</p><p>Screening for relationships between the 31 biomarkers in CSF and associated blood samples and clinical and MRI parameters were carried out by tabulating the rank correlations between every pair of variables. If a rank correlation suggested a statistically significant relationship (p&#x0003c;0.05), it was examined in further detail. Most serum immune markers were present in only few samples and we therefore constructed single flag variable indicating the presence of any serum immune biomarker.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Treatment effect by comparing differences in NfH, NOx, GFAP, BDNF and NGF values between the lamotrigine and placebo groups</title><p>A summary table of serum biomarker values is in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0070019.s002">Table S1</xref>.

The primary hypothesis that lamotrigine will significantly reduce the proportion of cases with detectable NfH in sera at 12 and 24 months relative to baseline, compared to placebo was not evident in the intention to treat group, although the true effect of Lamotrigine may have been diluted by the low levels of compliance (40&#x02013;50% non-adherence based on return of tablets and serum lamotrigine concentrations). Per protocol analysis based on serum and tablet adherence was therefore also performed, which also tested the pure pharmaceutical effect of the treatment. There was significant reduction in serum NfH of subjects with detectable serum lamotrigine between 12&#x02013;24 m and 0&#x02013;24 m, suggesting a possible neuroprotective effect on axons by lamotrigine. The delay in the reduction of NfH by 12 months implies a lead-lag effect between taking the drug and neuroprotection. Lim <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="pone.0070019-Lim1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> demonstrated that elevation in NfH between 0&#x02013;3 weeks was predictive of poor clinical outcome at week 8. We did not see a difference in serum biomarker levels based on intention to treat analysis, nor did we note a difference based on tablet returns; apart from NfH levels between 0&#x02013;24 m when comparing percentage of subjects &#x0201c;getting better&#x0201d; on lamotrigine. Using tablet returns as a way of assessing treatment compliance is prone to errors in judgment as demonstrated, whilst serum drug levels are probably the closest way to reliably assessing compliance. The original reports of this trial based on MRI cerebral volumes did not support a neuroprotective effect of lamotrigine, but this may have been confounded by fluctuations in parenchymal water content from sodium channel blockade, as indicated by partial improvement upon treatment discontinuation <xref rid="pone.0070019-Kapoor1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>NfH was a strong predictor of ambulation and disability based on MSFC and EDSS, supporting the use of NfH as a surrogate measure of disability. This is confirmed by the time-to-event modelling for completion of the timed 25-foot walk. Interestingly, performance in the 9-HPT and its relationship with NfH levels was found predominantly in the non-dominant hand which may be related to the loss in manual dexterity that may be more obvious with the non-dominant hand as the test is normally performed faster using the dominant hand <xref rid="pone.0070019-Koyama1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Others have also shown that high NfH levels correlate with poor visual outcome <xref rid="pone.0070019-Pasol1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070019-Petzold4" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Neuropsychological test scores from the PASAT and MSIS-29 appeared to be also responsive to changes in NfH, with patients with higher NfH having lower PASAT scores and higher MSIS-29 psychological scores, possibly related to the significant neurodegenerative changes observed in grey matter disease <xref rid="pone.0070019-Vercellino1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> or in relation to EDSS deterioration, respectively; McGuigan <italic>et al</italic>. found that MSIS-29 increased with EDSS deterioration <xref rid="pone.0070019-McGuigan1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>NfH correlated well with all MRI-derived measures except for conventional T1 and T2 volumes. MRICCV and MTR were both lowered in patients with higher NfH, supporting earlier associations of NfH with clinical measures and connecting progressive brain atrophy in SPMS to NfH release and a reduction in cerebral volumes (MRICCV) and global disease burden (MTR). Our observed lack of correlation between spinal cord area and NfH levels may have been partly confounded by the lack of sensitivity of spinal cord MR imaging to axonal disease <xref rid="pone.0070019-Bergers1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>Based on the parameters obtained for NfH we have estimated the sample sizes that future studies would need to detect changes in the proportion of patients with detectable NfH. In this study 80% of samples had detectable NfH and we calculated the sample sizes required to detect differences between this and 50, 55, 60, 65 and 70% in a comparator group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070019-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0070019-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0070019.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Power curves for determining sample size for changes percentage change in NfH levels.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0070019.g004"/></fig><p>We also analysed serum NOx, GFAP, BDNF and NGF, but found significant association was between walking times or 9-HPT times. However, MRI central cerebral volumes highly correlated with NOx and GFAP as expected since inflammation and oedema may increase brain volume. Cheriyan J <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="pone.0070019-Cheriyan1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> noted transient increases in brain volume during periods of MRI gadolinium activity. Unexpectedly, high BDNF and NGF were associated with lower MRI CCV and higher T1 and T2 volumes, whilst BDNF levels in the highest quartile were associated with lower MTR means. This can be interpreted as either reactive neuroplasticity with upregulation of neurotrophins following injury, or as markers of inflammation, as both have been shown to play a regulatory role in inflammation <xref rid="pone.0070019-Moalem1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Similarly, patients with higher BDNF, but not NGF levels were found to have lower PASAT scores. More work is needed in order to better understand the functional and clinical implications of these findings.</p><p>Of the 31 paired CSF/serum/plasma biomarkers studied, no clear trends emerged from the analyses aside from plasma osteopontin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0070019.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Higher levels of osteopontin have previously been associated with greater disability, and our analysis supports this with subjects exhibiting z-scores below average on the MSFC, as well as reduced MRICCV and grey matter MTR values <xref rid="pone.0070019-Comabella1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The lack of association with the other biomarkers is most likely secondary to the low statistical power. Correction for multiple comparisons was not performed at this stage as the work is exploratory in nature and positive findings should be tested in future prospective studies. However, as a collaborative study with John Hopkins University the CSF samples were analysed using mass spectrometry based on serum drug adherence <xref rid="pone.0070019-Jia1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, which revealed a significant reduction in 11 protein biomarkers, including neurofilament.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this study failed to show any benefit of lamotrigine in the prevention of axonal breakdown by lowering NfH levels compared to the placebo arm. A further subgroup analysis based on lamotrigine adherence, however, suggests that it may have a beneficial effect on axonal protection and it would be premature to abandon this hypothesis in entirety. We have demonstrated that NfH is very good surrogate marker of neurodegeneration and correlates well with clinical and MRI biomarkers of progression. The sample size calculations provided in this paper should pave the way for neuroprotection trials using serum NfH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0070019.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
