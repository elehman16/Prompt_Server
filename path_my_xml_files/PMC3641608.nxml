Randomisation was to either clinically driven monitoring or routine laboratory and clinical monitoring for toxicity (haematology and biochemistry) and efficacy (CD4 cell counts; non-inferiority monitoring randomisation); and simultaneously to standard three-drug or to four-drug induction first-line ART, in three groups: three-drug treatment (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI], lamivudine, abacavir; group A) versus four-drug induction (NNRTI, lamivudine, abacavir, zidovudine; groups B and C), decreasing after week 36 to three-drug NNRTI, lamivudine, plus abacavir (group B) or lamivudine, abacavir, plus zidovudine (group C; superiority ART-strategy randomisation). For patients assigned to routine laboratory monitoring, results were returned every 12 weeks to clinicians; for clinically driven monitoring, toxicity results were only returned for requested clinical reasons or if grade 4. Children switched to second-line ART for WHO stage 3 or 4 events or (routine laboratory monitoring only) age-dependent WHO CD4 criteria. Randomisation used computer-generated sequentially numbered tables incorporated securely within the database. Primary efficacy endpoints were new WHO stage 4 events or death for monitoring and change in CD4 percentage at 72 and 144 weeks for ART-strategy randomisations; the co-primary toxicity endpoint was grade 3 or 4 adverse events. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered, ISRCTN24791884.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>1206 children were randomly assigned to clinically driven (n=606) versus routine laboratory monitoring (n=600), and groups A (n=397), B (n=404), and C (n=405). 47 (8%) children on clinically driven monitoring versus 39 (7%) on routine laboratory monitoring had a new WHO stage 4 event or died (hazard ratio [HR] 1&#x000b7;13, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;73&#x02013;1&#x000b7;73, p=0&#x000b7;59; non-inferiority criterion met).

Children with acute infections, on drugs contraindicated with ART, unlikely to adhere or to attend regularly, with laboratory abnormalities contraindicating ART, pregnant or breastfeeding, or perinatally exposed to ART (if &#x0003c;6 months old) were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to clinically driven monitoring versus routine laboratory plus clinical monitoring for toxicity (haematology and biochemistry) and efficacy (CD4). Children were also randomly assigned (1:1:1) in a factorial design to three approaches for first-line ART: open-label lamivudine, abacavir, plus NNRTI continuously (group A, control); induction-maintenance with four-drug lamivudine, abacavir, NNRTI, plus zidovudine for 36 weeks, then lamivudine, abacavir, plus NNRTI (group B); or induction-maintenance with lamivudine, abacavir, NNRTI, plus zidovudine for 36 weeks, then lamivudine, abacavir, plus zidovudine (group C). HLA testing was not done. HIV viral loads were done retrospectively on stored samples. The hypothesis was that clinically driven monitoring would result in similar outcomes to routine laboratory monitoring (non-inferiority) and that four-drug induction-maintenance would have greater efficacy than would standard three-drug ART. The NNRTI (nevirapine or efavirenz) was chosen by clinicians according to local availability and age. Caregivers gave written informed consent; older children (8&#x02013;17 years) aware of their HIV status also gave assent or consent following national guidelines.

We found that NNRTI-based regimens, including WHO-recommended NRTIs, can be delivered safely across childhood without routine toxicity monitoring. Toxicity substitutions were infrequent, as previously reported;<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> most were because of asymptomatic haematology results in children on zidovudine. Interestingly, grade 3 and 4 and grade 4 anaemias occurred similarly across groups receiving and not receiving zidovudine, both short and long term, suggesting that anaemia in children on ART is most likely caused by chronic HIV infection rather than antiretroviral drugs. Therefore, routine haemoglobin monitoring is likely unnecessary, even in children on zidovudine, and continuation of zidovudine without substitution (as occurred in clinically driven monitoring group C children) is unlikely to result in harm. Further, lack of haemoglobin testing before initiation of ART should not prevent zidovudine use, since haemoglobin values increased after ART initiation. Crucially, we observed no evidence of interaction between monitoring and ART strategies on any toxicity outcome. We previously reported very few possible hypersensitivity reactions to abacavir (four [&#x0003c;1%] in 1206 patients<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref>) or difficulties managing abacavir plus nevirapine together in African children.</p><p>Importantly for programme planners, first-line drug substitutions occurred as often for tuberculosis as for adverse events. Tuberculosis was also by far the most common WHO stage 3 or 4 event. One advantage of the four-drug induction regimen was the ability to simply drop nevirapine in children starting rifampicin. The ongoing tuberculosis incidence illustrates the potential usefulness of three-NRTI regimens in children, with 91% randomly assigned to group C still receiving maintenance with lamivudine, abacavir, and zidovudine after median 4 years. Tuberculosis remains particularly difficult to manage in children younger than 3 years who cannot take efavirenz, because rifampicin coadministration significantly reduces nevirapine<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> and lopinavir concentrations.

Viral load suppression was similar to standard NNRTI-based ART at 48 weeks for children moving to maintenance three-NRTI at 36 weeks. However, viral load suppression was significantly lower at 144 weeks, suggesting that long-term three-NRTI treatment would not be advisable (even after four-drug induction). Importantly, there was no evidence of immunological or clinical harm from roughly 15% lower viral load suppression long-term with three NRTIs; if anything this group had fewer clinical events, similar to previous randomised adult data.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> These findings provide reassurance that a three-NRTI regimen is safe for children on ART when they need antituberculosis co-treatment.</p><p>Overall, there was no evidence that clinically driven monitoring was inferior to routine laboratory monitoring in terms of disease progression or mortality. However, we found interactions with time on ART, disease progression or death being somewhat lower in the clinically driven monitoring group in the first year. Chance seems the most likely explanation, because management was similar with no child switching to second-line during the first year in both groups. The only other possible explanation is that receiving CD4, biochemistry, and haematology results was actually harmful for children (eg, resulting in clinicians failing to undertake proper clinical evaluations), which seems implausible. From the second year, our results are qualitatively similar to those of the DART trial, with small but significant clinical event excesses in clinically driven monitoring. However, event rates were substantially lower than in DART, so the excess remained within the non-inferiority margin; also fewer children switched to second-line ART with similar proportions in both groups. Unlike DART, there was no evidence of excess switching with very low CD4 in clinically driven monitoring. Whereas switches in routine laboratory monitoring were predominantly triggered by falling CD4, in clinically driven monitoring most switches were for failure to thrive, which might be a more sensitive indicator of first-line CD4 failure than in adults and could be used where CD4 monitoring is unavailable. Unnecessary switching at high CD4 did occur, as in DART, but in very few children (six on clinically driven monitoring and none on routine monitoring switched with CD4 greater than 25%). Other paediatric studies in which routine CD4 and viral load monitoring were used have also reported fairly low rates of switching from first-line NNRTI-based ART over 5&#x02013;6 years (eg, 8% of 2570 Ugandan children;<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> 22% in the PENPACT-1 trial<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref>).</p><p>As expected and previously reported, most deaths were soon after starting ART in children with lowest pre-ART CD4 or weight for age.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> Irrespective of monitoring strategy, 5-year survival was remarkably high (96%, compared with 88% in DART), emphasising the importance of good clinical care, and availability of continuous ART and concomitant treatments. Loss to follow-up was only 2&#x000b7;7%, providing confidence that results are robust. We also observed no differences between clinically driven and routine laboratory monitoring in CD4 or viral load responses. The only difference between monitoring strategies was in serious adverse events, due to an excess of clinical malaria admissions to hospital in clinically driven monitoring. One limitation is that the trial allocation was of necessity open; lack of knowledge of CD4 in a child on clinically driven monitoring presenting with fever could have influenced decisions about hospital admission, given the plausible differential diagnosis of bacteraemia.<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref></p><p>Data for viral load from the 78% of children with results suggest that initiation of ART with four drugs might significantly improve early viral load suppression, consistent with greater early CD4 responses, particularly in those with very low pre-ART CD4. By design all children moved to three drugs at 36 weeks, in view of the possible toxicity and costs of four-drug regimens in the long term. Since toxicity differences were restricted to asymptomatic laboratory results with no effect on ART management, results hint that a longer-term four-drug, three NRTIs plus one NNRTI regimen might have continued to provide viral load and CD4 benefits, although this might not have translated into clinical benefit. However, viral load suppression with two NRTIs plus an NNRTI was fairly high, with 83% of children receiving an NNRTI with abacavir plus lamivudine throughout achieving less than 400 copies per mL long term, irrespective of monitoring strategy, so further gains from a fourth drug might be less plausible.</p><p>Viral load suppression was similar to other trials in which viral load monitoring was done routinely (eg, 82% &#x0003c;400 copies per mL after median 5 years on two NRTIs plus an NNRTI or a protease inhibitor;<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> 85% of infants &#x0003c;400 copies per mL after median 5 years on two NRTI plsu lopinavir or ritonavir (A Violari, personal communication); 85% and 75% of children &#x0003c;3 years &#x0003c;400 copies per mL after 48 weeks on two NRTI plus lopinavir or ritonavir, or nevirapine, respectively<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref>).

In PENPACT-1, lamivudine and NNRTI resistance occurred with low-level viral load failure,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> so the consequences of delaying switch on these regimens until CD4 failure might be small; the 3-year PHPT trial in adults, which randomly assigned patients to routine CD4 with or without viral load monitoring, found no additional benefit from viral load, although patients in both groups of this trial had high viral load suppression.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref></p><p>Although open allocation was an unavoidable limitation of the monitoring randomisation and was not undertaken for the ART-strategy randomisation, the endpoint review committee adjudicated endpoints masked to randomisation. In a survey at ARROW exit, only four (1%) of 561 participants on clinically driven monitoring reported having CD4 testing done privately; clinicians remained masked. One possible criticism is that all ARROW centres had laboratories; however, the only way our results would not generalise to centres with lower-quality clinical care would be if these health-care workers were able to act more appropriately on routine laboratory results than in centres with high-quality care. This scenario seems unlikely since substantial CD4 variability and complexity around toxicity test interpretation mean that simple rules for acting on routine test results are unlikely ever to be optimum. Rather, clinicians providing the best clinical care are plausibly also best able to interpret and act on routine laboratory results. Thus although the overall risks of WHO events or death might be higher under poorer clinical care, differences in outcomes between routine and clinically driven laboratory monitoring would be likely, if anything, to be even smaller than observed in ARROW. Of note, we found no evidence that small benefits from CD4 monitoring varied by pre-ART CD4 or percentage, suggesting our results are robust to changes in ART initiation thresholds.</p><p>Toxicity monitoring has no benefit and costs money; it cannot therefore be cost-effective. This fact should reinforce WHO guidelines that routine toxicity tests are not required for paediatric ART provision, as for adults. Formal cost-effectiveness analysis is ongoing: given reduced efficacy of CD4 monitoring compared with DART, CD4 monitoring every 12 weeks is unlikely to be cost-effective in children overall (P Revill, personal communication), although it might have some potential to pick up earlier failure in older children or adolescents concealing adherence challenges. Cost-effectiveness analysis and systematic review is also planned to compare the induction-maintenance ART strategy with NNRTI and protease inhibitor-based first-line ART, including sensitivity analyses to account for increased efficacy but greater cost of abacavir versus zidovudine.</p><p>In conclusion, ARROW results should send a strong message to African ART programmes to accelerate ART rollout to children since this process currently lags woefully behind adults.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> The key finding is that ART provides enormous benefits to children and can be delivered safely with good-quality clinical care and without routine toxicity monitoring. For children initiating ART with severe immune suppression, addition of a fourth drug improves short-term immunological and virological responses; whether continuing a four-drug regimen longer-term would be advantageous remains unclear. However, ARROW results support short-term use of three-drug NRTI regimens during antituberculosis treatment in children already on ART. Simple point-of-care CD4 tests might have a future role, at least to confirm clinical need to switch to second-line ART, as in DART.<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> In children, monitoring of weight gain should be emphasised as an important additional clinical aid for identification of first-line failure. Laboratory tests remain important for assessment of ART eligibility and for diagnosis and management of intercurrent infections. Mentoring of health-care workers to foster quality clinical care and reassurance that children do very well without laboratory monitoring of ART should energise faster and further scale-up of ART rollout for children with HIV in Africa.</p><p><boxed-text id="cetextbox10"><p>Correspondence to: Prof Diana M Gibb, MRC Clinical Trials Unit, London WC2B 6NH, UK, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="mailto:dmg@ctu.mrc.ac.uk" id="interref1">dmg@ctu.mrc.ac.uk</ext-link></p></boxed-text></p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gilks</surname><given-names>CF</given-names></name><name><surname>Crowley</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Ekpini</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The WHO public-health approach to antiretroviral treatment against HIV in resource-limited settings</article-title><source>Lancet</source><volume>368</volume><year>2006</year><fpage>505</fpage><lpage>510</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16890837</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="other" id="sbref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation</collab></person-group><article-title>Financing global health 2011: continued growth as MDG deadline approaches</article-title><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.healthmetricsandevaluation.org/publications/policy-report/financing-global-health-2011-continued-growth-mdg-deadline-approaches" id="interref2">http://www.healthmetricsandevaluation.org/publications/policy-report/financing-global-health-2011-continued-growth-mdg-deadline-approaches</ext-link><comment>(accessed Oct 25, 2012).</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sbref3"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>UNAIDS</collab></person-group><source>World AIDS Day report 2012</source><year>2012</year><publisher-name>UNAIDS</publisher-name><publisher-loc>Geneva</publisher-loc></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other" id="ceotherref1">Abongomera G, Namata H, Nkhata M, et al.

The trial was done in Uganda by AK, PMug, PN-N, SB-K, VM, PMun, PMus, RK, and CT, and in Zimbabwe by KN, MB-D, TV, and AJP; and coordinated in the UK by DMG, MT, BN-J, JC, and ASW. ASW and ADC wrote the trial analysis plan, which all authors then reviewed; and ADC did the analyses. All authors contributed to interpretation of the data.

CD4 monitoring provided a small but significant reduction in disease progression or death after the second year on ART in children, as in adults. However, unlike adults, CD4 and viral load responses were very similar irrespective of CD4 versus clinical monitoring. Monitoring weight-gain appeared a sensitive indicator of first-line CD4 failure, and drug changes occurred as often for concurrent tuberculosis as for adverse events. Four-drug ART with an NNRTI plus three NRTIs provided superior short-term virological suppression and CD4 responses, but these benefits were not sustained during maintenance three-drug ART. However, 83% of children in ARROW had viral load less than 400 copies per mL with abacavir, lamivudine, and a NNRTI for 3&#x000b7;7 years, irrespective of age, supporting previously reported superiority of abacavir over zidovudine.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Three-NRTI long-term maintenance was clinically and immunologically similar to NNRTI-based ART, and would be useful during tuberculosis cotreatment. Results support an integrated approach to treatment of adults and children in treatment rollout. Cost and feasibility (eg, through point-of-care tests) of provision of CD4 monitoring are future challenges.</p></boxed-text></floats-group></article>
