Excessive and frequent anxiety can impair functioning. Anxiety can be defined as an uncomfortable emotional state in which one perceives danger, feels powerless, and experiences tension in preparing for an expected danger.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Spielberger defines it as the subjective feeling of tension, apprehension, nervousness, and worry, associated with an arousal of the autonomic nervous system.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] In whichever way it is defined, the central characteristic of anxiety is worry, and it is clear that anxiety has a negative effect on all aspects, such as, social, personal, and academic performance.</p><p>Psychologists have distinguished several categories of anxiety such as <italic>trait, state</italic>, and <italic>situation-specific</italic> anxiety. Trait anxiety is an aspect of personality and a more permanent disposition to be anxious. It is chronic and pervasive across situations and is not triggered by specific events,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] while state anxiety can be conceptualized as a response to a particular anxiety-provoking stimulus,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] in other words it has a clear trigger. State anxiety is experienced at a particular moment in time, as a response to a definite situation. More recently the term situation-specific anxiety has been used to emphasize the persistent and multifaceted nature of some anxieties.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] It is usually aroused at specific situations, such as public speaking anxiety.</p><p>Test anxiety, which is also the central idea of the present article, is defined by Spielberger and Sarason (1989) as a situation-specific trait that refers to the anxiety states and worry conditions that are experienced during an examination.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Test anxiety, then, is a debilitating experience of anxiety during the preparation for a test or during the test itself.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>The origin of test anxiety</title><p>As mentioned by Jing (2007), research on test anxiety has identified three models that explain the origin of test anxiety.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] In the first model the problem lies not in taking the test, but in preparing for the test. According to this model, which is identified as the learning-deficit model, students with high test anxiety tend to have or use inadequate learning or study skills, while preparing for their examination.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] The second model is termed as the interference model. This model postulates that during the test, students with test anxiety focus on task-irrelevant stimuli, which negatively affect the performance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] This interference can be classified into physical distraction, and inappropriate cognition. Sweaty palms and muscle tension, and stating &#x0201c;I am stupid, I won&#x02019;t pass&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;others are finishing before me,&#x0201d; are examples of physical distraction and inappropriate cognition. The third model of test anxiety includes people who think they have prepared adequately for a test, but in reality have not. These people question their abilities after the test, which creates anxiety during the next <italic>test</italic>. Whatever the origin of test anxiety, the teachers&#x02019; observation, students&#x02019; experience, and research results indicate that test anxiety affects the learning (e.g., foreign/second language) process negatively, which is explained in the next part.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>The effects of test anxiety</title><p>Academic performance can be affected by a plethora of variables. Test anxiety is one of those variables, which in general, is expected to have a negative effect on the performance. Researchers[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] have shown that test anxiety is negatively correlated with academic performance. Vogel and Collins (2008) have stated that the administration of quizzes arouses anxiety, which interferes with the performance; hence, planned quizzes are a better substitute, which lead to higher grades.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] The researchers believe that with planned quizzes, the participants will be able to study, which could counteract their anxiety level and bring it down to a more productive state.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] MacIntyre and Gardner (1991) have stated that test anxiety not only has a negative correlation with the language learning success, but it has also been positively correlated with low self-confidence.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Low performance in speaking and writing tasks in the target language, poor language proficiency test performance, low grades in language classes, and in general low cognitive functioning, are all effects of test anxiety. Research gives proof of how anxiety can impact students in a very real and debilitating manner.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Yoga breathing exercises for energy and tranquility</title><p>Clinical studies support that yoga postures, mediation, and controlled breathing practices can alleviate stress and anxiety.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Health experts have illustrated that after two months of practicing <italic>pranayama</italic> 56 medical students had reduced stress levels, as was evident by a decrease in total stress score, which was highly significant, at the start of the study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] In another research the level of anxiety of the senior citizens (60- to 70-year-old retired persons) decreased after three months of practicing <italic>pranayama</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] From literature it appears that practicing <italic>pranayama</italic> can reduce stress and anxiety in different groups.</p><p>The simple breathing techniques of <italic>Pranayama</italic> could offer agitated students concrete steps to calm themselves.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Considering the problems caused by test anxiety in the context of the positive effects of <italic>pranayama</italic>, this study intends to answer the following research questions:</p><p>

They were selected based on the availability/convenience method. They were from two different disciplines of social science and Persian literature. The four intact groups were randomly selected as control and experimental groups. In all, there were two control (<italic>N</italic> = 49) and two experimental (<italic>N</italic> = 58) groups. Their age ranged from 29 to 43 years with the average of 27.91 and SD = 6.23. Within the sample, 32% (<italic>N</italic> = 35) of the participants were male and 67% (<italic>N</italic> = 72) were female.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Instruments</title><p>In this study, two instruments were utilized for data collection. The Sarason Anxiety Scale[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] was used to measure the participants&#x02019; test anxiety, both at the beginning of the semester and at the end before the final examination. This questionnaire included 37 yes/no questions along with some demographic questions eliciting information such as, age, gender, and field of study added by the researcher. To eliminate misunderstanding, the translation of the questionnaire was given to the students. The reliability of the test, calculated by Cronbach alpha, was .79.</p><p>The second instrument was the final foreign language achievement <italic>test</italic> prepared by the researcher, based on the materials covered during the term and the major of the participants. The test was conducted at the end of the academic year to measure the achievement of the students.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Procedure</title><p>The Sarason's test anxiety was given to the students in the first session. The first session explained yoga, its benefit, and the art of breathing or <italic>pranayama</italic>. The practical method of <italic>pranayama</italic> started from the second session in the class. The procedure was as follows:</p><p>In each session before the teaching phase (before starting the regular classes in the college), the teacher asked the students to sit quietly for one minute in their own places in the class. She asked the students to breathe deeply and easily. Meanwhile she also requested them to think that they were going to receive energy to the body and mind to become healthier, to become robust and strong. She asked them to think that they were going to throw all the impurities of the mind and the body through exhaling and think that they were going to have fresh and pure energy by inhaling fresh <italic>Prana</italic>, the breath fully filled with life, strength, positivism and energy. During this breathing technique the participants were asked to chant positive mantras such as, I can, I am able to do, I am successful, I am the best in the world, and so on. Then, with eyes closed, back erect, and mind relaxed, <italic>pranayama</italic> was started. It had three phases,</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><bold>Phase 1: Slow inhale</bold>, by taking a deep breath as deep as possible, very slowly and steadily, without hurrying up. The students were asked to visualize that the mind was taking energy into their body.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Phase 2: Hold</bold>, by holding the breath as long as each student feels comfortable. During this time, the students were advised to think that the <italic>prana</italic> or energetic breath that they had taken in was cleansing the whole body from the top of the brain to the tip of leg. They were asked to imagine that the air was moving all over their body and cleansing all the organs and mind.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Phase 3: Slow exhale</bold>, wherein the teacher asked the students to exhale slowly. The exhaling period was longer than the inhaling period. When exhaling, the students were asked to imagine that all the impurities of the body and mind were cleaned by letting the breath out of the body.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>The above practices were repeated for one full semester. The duration of the practice was, however, different &#x02013; devoting one to three minutes for each phase of practice in the beginning of the semester to 10 minutes at the end of the semester. In the final examination session, the first anxiety test was given to the students, followed by the foreign language test. The papers were corrected and the data was submitted to the SPSS software, for results and analysis.</p><p>For the control group no breathing practices were administered before the teaching phase (before starting the regular classes in the college).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Data analysis</title><p>To perform data analysis, the statistical package (SPSS) and the excel document were used.

Also, the percentage of medium test anxiety participants was higher in the experimental group (60 vs. 40%). Furthermore, due to practicing pranayama, 33% of the participants of the experimental group fell in the high test anxiety category, while this percent was nearly twice for the control group (66.7%).

Some students experience some level of stress when anticipating or taking an examination. A little nervousness is observed to help motivate the students; however, if the stress is too intense, it can affect the concentration during performance of the examination.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>The first research question revealed that the level of test anxiety decreased at higher grades. In other words 33.3% of the participants in the experimental group had high test anxiety, while 66.7% of the participants in the control group had test anxiety, which was twice more than the experimental group. This meant that the practice of <italic>pranayama</italic> could reduce and control test anxiety.</p><p>From the second research question, it was seen that there was a significant difference between the test anxiety of the control and experimental groups. From the mean it was clear that the test anxiety of the experimental group was less than that of their counterpart.</p><p>Similarly there was a significant difference between the test anxiety of the males in the control and experimental groups, as well as females in the control and experimental groups; it was in favor of the experimental group.</p><p>The fourth research question dealt with language test performance. The result indicated that there was a significant difference in the test performance of the control and experimental groups. Due to practicing <italic>pranayama</italic>, the performance of the experimental group was higher when compared to the control group. The related literature on test anxiety in foreign language learning indicated that there were some factors that had an influence on student's reactions to language tests. These were, perceptions of test validity, time limit, test technique, test format, length, testing environment, and clarity of test instruction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>Finally, in this study it was revealed that there was a negative relationship between test anxiety and test performance. In other words, the higher the test anxiety, the lower the test performance. From the first three research questions, the positive effect of practicing <italic>pranayama</italic> in lowering test anxiety has been seen. This can be justified by understanding the basic philosophy of doing <italic>pranayama</italic>. The purpose of yoga breathing exercise is to supply the body with oxygen and cleanse it of carbon dioxide and other toxins. Oxygen in blood is vital for:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Assimilating the food we eat for fulfilling the body's various needs, like rebuilding tissues and supplying energy.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Stimulating the functioning of the endocrine glands.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Providing energy for functioning of the brain, nerves, heart, and other vital organs.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Distribution of vital energy throughout the body.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>But most people are unaware of the fact that the loss of energy/<italic>prana</italic> that is often felt in body is mostly due to incorrect breathing. Generally, one may be utilizing only a small portion of lung capacity. This inadequate supply of oxygen results in improper waste disposal from the body. The body functions are slowed down and the cells/tissues fail to regenerate themselves due to lack of sufficient energy. With <italic>pranayama</italic> practice one can increase the intake of oxygen up to five times. This means that one can get rid of five times of carbon dioxide out of the body. Students could imagine the improvement in the health and reducing anxiety by doing <italic>pranayama</italic>.</p><p>Affective factors can also have a strong influence on foreign language learning. As stated in[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>], a helpful way of conceptualizing that influence is to regard affect as a filter through which the foreign language input has to pass, before it is acquired. When the feeling of the learner is positive, we may say that he / she is more open to input. His / her filter is clean and language passes easily through it.</p><p>A learner with a negative feeling, in this case test anxiety, will on the other hand be close to the input. This notion is called Krashen's input theory.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] In this study, better performance of the experimental group and negative correlation of test performance with anxiety were shown in the fourth and fifth research questions, respectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The significance of the <italic>pranayama</italic> technique mentioned in this study, is that it is readily available to everyone, every minute of every day. For students in anxious situations such as in-class tests, standardized examinations, final examinations, oral presentations, and so on, knowing this technique can be the difference between success and failure. For a nervous student or anyone who knows too well how anxiety manifests itself in the body and mind, the knowledge that something as simple as breathing differently can produce a different physical and mental response is quiet powerful.
