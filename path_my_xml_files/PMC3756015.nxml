As such, a value of 1.0 indicates an ability to downregulate the relevant cell-surface molecule (CD4 or HLA) to a level comparable to that of the control, whereas values of &#x0003e;1.0 or &#x0003c;1.0 indicate downregulation activities higher or lower than that of SF2, respectively. We observed excellent correlation between duplicate measurements (Spearman's r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.85; p&#x0003c;0.0001 and r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.86, p&#x0003c;0.0001 for CD4 and HLA downregulation, respectively). Nef clones from tenofovir gel (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;28) and placebo (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;45) participants displayed no significant difference in Western blot band intensity compared to actin-normalized control SF2 Nef (median [IQR] 0.76 [0.64&#x02013;0.86] and 0.79 [0.63&#x02013;0.92], respectively, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.5). Similarly, no relationship was observed between Nef Western blot band intensity and CD4 (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.03, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.8) or HLA (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.1, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.3) downregulation functions. CD4 downregulation activity was comparable between Nef clones obtained from 1% tenofovir gel and placebo participants (median [IQR] 0.93 [0.73&#x02013;0.99] and 0.96 [0.89&#x02013;0.99], respectively, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071758-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). However, we observed a trend towards lower HLA class I downregulation function in Nef clones from tenofovir gel participants compared to those who received placebo (median [IQR] 0.73 [0.63&#x02013;0.84] and 0.77 [0.69&#x02013;0.90], respectively, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.06) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071758-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). We conducted a sensitivity analysis on the entire Nef dataset (including the six samples with low expression/function), which yielded similar results (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.2 and p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.06 for CD4 and HLA downregulation, respectively, not shown). Overall, when the function of all Nef sequences was assessed together, we observed a significant correlation between Nef-mediated CD4 and HLA downregulation activities (Spearman's r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.3, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.007, not shown).</p><p>Finally, we evaluated potential relationships between <italic>gag-protease</italic> and <italic>nef</italic> gene functions and the clinical status of study participants. No correlations were observed between Gag-Protease replication capacity and the ability of Nef to downregulate either CD4 or HLA when data from the trial arms were analyzed separately or together (not shown). Among the 76 participants for whom HIV-1 clinical measurements were available at 12 months post-infection, a modest yet statistically significant correlation was observed between baseline Gag-Protease replication capacity and viral load at 12 months (Spearman's r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.2, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071758-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), but no such association was observed with CD4+ cell counts at 12 months post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071758-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, no relationship was observed between baseline Nef-mediated CD4 or HLA downregulation function and plasma viral load (Spearman's r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.7 and r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.1, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.4, respectively, not shown), or CD4 count (Spearman's r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.1, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.3; and r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.09, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.5, respectively, not shown) at 12 months post-infection.</p><fig id="pone-0071758-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0071758.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Association between baseline Gag-Protease replication capacity and HIV-1 clinical parameters at 12-months post-infection.</title><p>A modest correlation was observed between early Gag-Protease-mediated replication capacity and plasma viral load (Spearman, r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.2, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05; Panel A), but not CD4+ cell count (Spearman, r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.1, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.4; Panel B), at 12 months post-infection.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0071758.g004"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>To examine the possibility that transmitted/early HIV-1 strains with altered function could be inadvertently selected by antiretroviral-based microbicide prophylaxis, we assessed plasma RNA <italic>gag-protease</italic> and <italic>nef</italic> sequence and function for the earliest available time points (median 5 weeks following estimated date of infection) from participants who acquired infection during the CAPRISA 004 1% tenofovir gel microbicide trial <xref rid="pone.0071758-AbdoolKarim1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.
