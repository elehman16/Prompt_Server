Several of these interventions have been tested for effectiveness, but few studies have explored patient perspectives of such interventions. Exploring patient perspectives enhances the understanding of how an intervention works or why it does not. We therefore studied perceptions regarding an mHealth adherence intervention within the HIVIND trial in South India.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The study was conducted at three clinics in South India. The intervention comprised an automated interactive voice response (IVR) call and a pictorial short messaging service (SMS), each delivered weekly. Sixteen purposively selected participants from the intervention arm in the HIVIND trial were interviewed. All participants had completed at least 84 weeks since enrollment in the trial. Perceptions on the usefulness and perceived benefits and risks of receiving the intervention were sought. The interviews were transcribed and analysed using the framework approach to qualitative data analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Despite varying perceptions of the intervention, most participants found it useful. The intervention was perceived as a sign of &#x02018;care&#x02019; from the clinic. The IVR call was preferred to the SMS reminder. Two-way communication was preferred to automated calls. Participants also perceived a risk of unintentional disclosure of their HIV status and stigma thereof via the intervention and took initiatives to mitigate this risk. Targeting reminders at those with poor adherence and those in need of social support was suggested.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>mHealth adherence interventions go beyond their intended role to provide a sense of care and support to the recipient. Although automated interventions are impersonal, they could be a solution for scale up. Interventions that engage both the recipient and the healthcare provider have greater potential for success. Personalising mHealth interventions could mitigate the risk of stigma and promote their uptake.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ISRCTN79261738.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>QUALITATIVE RESEARCH</kwd><kwd>PUBLIC HEALTH</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This is the first qualitative study in the Indian context designed within a randomised controlled trial that investigates participant perceptions regarding an mHealth adherence support intervention for antiretroviral therapy.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Qualitative research alongside clinical trials contextualises interventions and facilitates the development of interventions that are effective.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The framework approach used in the analysis is poised between inductive and deductive approaches and encourages the analysis of the respondents&#x02019; perceptions, in light of the researchers&#x02019; experiences.</p></list-item><list-item><p>As the HIVIND trial was ongoing at the time of the interviews, the adherence status of the participants was unknown to the interviewer.

It is key to the success of ART, as optimal adherence defers treatment failure and death in HIV-infected individuals. One of the barriers to adherence is forgetfulness. Several adherence support interventions have been developed to target forgetfulness such as pillboxes, electronic reminders<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and mobile phone reminders. These interventions are posited within the Behavior Learning Theory (BLT) framework where they are considered as external cues that support medication adherence.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>The recently concluded HIVIND randomised controlled trial (RCT) in South India was the first RCT that explored the effect of an mHealth intervention on ART adherence in the Indian context.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The intervention tested in the HIVIND trial comprised an automated interactive voice response (IVR) call and a neutral picture short messaging service (SMS).</p><p>Qualitative studies can aid the understanding of the effects of an intervention and the possible pathways through which these effects (or lack of) may be mediated.

The HIVIND trial was a parallel group open-label trial that studied the effect of mobile phone reminders on adherence to ART and time to first-line ART failure in treatment na&#x000ef;ve people living with HIV (PLHIV) in South India. The RCT had three recruitment sites in South India, that is, (1) St. John's Medical College Hospital, Bangalore, a private tertiary-level non-profit healthcare facility, providing care and treatment to approximately 3000 PLHIV/AIDS through a public&#x02013;private partnership in Karnataka State; (2) KR Hospital, Mysore, a public tertiary-level teaching healthcare facility, providing care and treatment to approximately 10&#x02005;000 PLHIV in Karnataka State and (3) YRG Care, Chennai, a private healthcare facility, providing care and treatment to approximately 18&#x02005;000 PLHIV in Tamil Nadu State.</p><p>HIV care and treatment in India are provided at no cost or minimal cost to PLHIV through a network of public, private and public&#x02013;private healthcare facilities. All PLHIV registered within this HIV care network receive counselling support, basic investigations such as CD4 count, treatment and monthly follow-up care. Treatment is initiated at CD4 counts &#x0003c;350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>Further, PLHIV receive adherence counselling at treatment initiation, and at monthly pill refill visits. The elements of this counselling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015007574F1">figure 1</xref>) are in line with the Social Cognitive Theory for behaviour change. According to the existing system, counsellors assess patients&#x02019; knowledge regarding their health and educate them based on their knowledge gap. Counselling fosters self-efficacy by engendering the belief that one can independently address adherence-related issues and help identify external systems (antecedents) suitable to support adherence.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015007574F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Adherence counselling to support antiretroviral treatment provided to patients in line with Social Cognitive Theory.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2015007574f01"/></fig><p><italic>The HIVIND Trial</italic><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>: The trial tested an mHealth ART adherence support intervention in 631 outpatients aged 18&#x02013;60&#x02005;years.

Some participants perceived the concern of the healthcare provider along with social and emotional support. The IVR call was preferred over the SMS reminder, and participants felt they needed a more engaging call. Participants feared HIV-related stigma, and therefore took steps to reduce the risk of unintended disclosure of their HIV status, via the intervention.</p><p>mHealth interventions are designed to improve adherence by targeting forgetfulness, a common barrier to treatment adherence.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Hence, our intervention may be placed within the context of the behaviour learning theory (BLT) framework (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015007574F3">figure 3</xref>).<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The participants in our study desired to stay healthy. This need, an internal antecedent in the BLT framework, probably encouraged them to take medicines. Further, the reminders provided via mobile phones served as an external antecedent. However, studies have shown that external reminders used in isolation may not be able to improve adherence.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Effective adherence support interventions need family or peer support, counselling and daily treatment support reflecting their complexity.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015007574F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>The mHealth antiretroviral treatment (ART) support intervention in the context of the Behavior Learning Theory.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2015007574f03"/></fig><p>Participants also reported feeling the &#x02018;concern&#x02019; of their healthcare providers towards their health, more so with the voice calls than with the SMSs. Reports of mHealth interventions providing support and making the recipient feel valued were also observed in Kenya.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> These interventions, however, involved a component of personal interaction via the phone unlike our automated intervention. A study from British Columbia that used text messages in a tuberculosis clinic reported that participants felt supported and cared for by their healthcare provider.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Another study from Peru-related mobile phone reminders to an &#x02018;angel&#x02019; and a &#x02018;friend&#x02019; giving the intervention an anthropomorphic character.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Similar reports are available from an mHealth smoking cessation trial in the UK.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>Despite feeling the concern of the healthcare provider, the participants expressed the need for two-way communication. Engaging beneficiaries in communication improves the efficacy of mHealth interventions.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Two-way communication involving text messages was found to open communication channels and address unmet needs of PLHIV in the Cameroon Mobile Phone SMS (CAMPS) trial. Expressing gratitude, requesting counselling, financial support and advice regarding medication side effects&#x02014;reasons for using two-way communication in the CAMPS trial&#x02014;were also mirrored in our study.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Although the content of communication was identified during the design phase in three mHealth trials from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), none explored the need for interaction.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Further, though the WelTel and CAMPS trials provided an opportunity for personal interaction with the healthcare provider, only the WelTel trial was successful.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The other Kenyan trial was successful even though the intervention was completely automated.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The lack of interaction is therefore unlikely to be a major reason for the negative trial results in our study.</p><p>Considering the prevalent literacy levels in our setting, we chose to incorporate a neutral picture SMS in the intervention. Elsewhere, text messages were preferred to other forms of communication as they were considered to provide greater confidentiality.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Studies from SSA report high acceptability of text messaging for adherence support, generating awareness regarding HIV infection and communicating laboratory results in HIV-infected individuals.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> None of these studies compared the acceptability of text messages to voice calls. However, another study from South Africa reported nearly equal preference for voice calls and text messages as a mode of communication by a healthcare provider.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> A study involving PMTCT indicated that text messages were preferred for brief communications and voice calls for longer, more interactive conversations.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The lower English language literacy in our context in comparison to some of these study contexts could have resulted in the preference for voice calls over text messages. It would be of value to identify the preferred mode of communication and incorporate it into the intervention design. Verbal communication has the potential to overcome the literacy barrier for text messaging, and could be used in low-middle income contexts such as ours. The combined effect of education and text messaging in improving adherence, and the literacy barrier to the use of text messages, reflect the need for alternatives such as voice calls and picture messages for adherence support.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></p><p>The intervention in our study was designed subsequent to a survey that used a semistructured interview schedule. One in three participants in the survey indicated a strong preference for voice calls. However, the survey did not explore the preferred content of communication or the extent of its interactiveness. Qualitative exploration of participant perceptions while piloting the HIVIND trial intervention could have helped identify and address issues before the trial commenced. Also, those who participated in our study were exposed to the intervention for approximately 2&#x02005;years. First-hand experience with the intervention probably enabled participants to identify more &#x02018;negatives&#x02019; regarding the SMS reminder than were perceived by potential trial participants.</p><p>A fear of stigma from an unintended disclosure of their HIV status from the intervention was felt despite the intervention's neutral content, personalised timing and non-verbal interactive communication. Non-verbal communications within the IVR call probably engendered curiosity in those witnessing the call and a fear of HIV status disclosure in the participants. Stigma has been documented as a significant problem for persons living with HIV in the Indian setting.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> This fear-induced participants to keep their phones with them on the days that they received the call. They also preferred the reminders weekly as they could keep the phone with themselves for the day. As in other studies, participants in our study also preferred not receiving the calls in public.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p><p>Literature on stigma associated with mHealth interventions in HIV infection is largely in the context of text messages. Requests to code content that prevented disclosure of HIV status and minimised stigma were observed in the development phase of the CAMPS intervention.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Stigma as a barrier to mHealth adherence support was identified in the design phase of the WelTel trial.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> In our study, the fear of stigma was less pronounced with the SMS reminders than with the IVR calls, probably because the SMS reminders were less popular and went unnoticed more often. As in other studies, participants in our study also resorted to deleting of text messages due to fear of unintended disclosure of HIV status.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The perceived risk of unintended disclosure of HIV status due to others viewing participants&#x02019; text messages was also reported from China, SSA and Peru.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>

<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Researchers should weigh the benefits against the risk of engendering the fear of stigma from mHealth interventions in sensitive health conditions like HIV infection.

Although interactive communication may engage patients for longer durations, it needs to be balanced against the resources needed for intervention scale up.</p><p>Sensitivity to the disease and sociocultural contexts, given the possibility of stigma if sensitive information were intercepted, is needed. Targeting those with poor adherence, as suggested by participants in our study, could improve the efficacy of mHealth interventions.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Furthermore, qualitative assessments prior to and during a trial can help develop and contextualise such interventions<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> These considerations could be extrapolated onto chronic non-communicable disease and tuberculosis.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></p><p><italic>Methodological issues:</italic> The study sample was purposive and representative of the participants in the HIVIND trial, enabling the transferability of results.

Hence, we were unable to relate the experiences of the participants to their adherence within the trial.</p></sec><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusion</title><p>mHealth adherence interventions go beyond their intended role to provide a sense of care and support to the recipient. Although automated interventions are impersonal, they could be the solution for scale up. The utility of conserving sparse healthcare resources by automating interventions should be weighed against the effectiveness of a more engaging intervention involving two-way communication. Multicomponent interventions personalised on the basis of timing, content, duration and adherence levels could be more engaging and acceptable to beneficiaries, and mitigate the risk of stigma. Most of all, mHealth interventions should be developed through extensive behavioural research and tested for effectiveness prior to incorporating them within healthcare systems.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the medical officers and staff at the three study sites and their ART centres, that is, St. John's Medical College, Bangalore; KR Hospital, Mysore; YRG Care, Chennai for support.
