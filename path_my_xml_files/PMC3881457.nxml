back pain (CLBP) patients on anticipatory postural control and cerebral cortex potential.
[Subjects and Methods] Twenty patients whose low back pain had continued for more than 12
weeks were selected and assigned to a control group (n=10) to which ordinary physical
therapy was applied and an experimental group (n=10) to which kinesio tape was applied.
Anticipatory postural control was evaluated using electromyography, and movement-related
cortical potential (MRCP) was assessed using electroencephalography. Clinical evaluation
was performed using a visual analogue scale and the Oswestry disability index. [Results]
According to the analysis results for anticipatory postural control, there were
significant decreases in the transversus abdominis (TrA) muscle and the external oblique
muscle in both groups. Among them, the TrA of the experimental group exhibited the
greatest differences. According to the results of a between-group comparison, there was
significant difference in the TrA between the two groups. There was also a significant
decrease in the MRCP of both groups. In particular, changes in the movement monitoring
potential (MMP) of the experimental group were greatest at Fz, C3, Cz, and C4. According
to the between-group comparison, there were significant differences in MMP at F3, C3, and
Cz. Both groups saw VAS and ODI significantly decrease. Among them, the ODI of the
experimental group underwent the greatest change. [Conclusion] Kinesio tape applied to
CLBP patients reduced their pain and positively affected their anticipatory postural
control and MRCP.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Chronic low back pain</kwd><kwd>Kinesio taping</kwd><kwd>Movement related cortical potential</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Low back pain is a common problem that more than 80% of people experience at least once in

proprioception occur, which results in diverse problems such as somatic disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Brumagne et al. noted that changes in

anticipatory postural adjustment, supplementary and primary motor areas are included<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The MRCP can be used to analyze the
cerebral cortex activity of the primary and supplementary motor areas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is the record of the brain potential extracted from
EEG in relation to voluntary movements<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.
To date, no research has been done to examine the changes in brain waves after application
of tape to lumbar pain patients. Accordingly, this study intends to look at changes in
anticipatory postural control and cerebral cortex potential according to the application of
kinesio taping.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>This study was performed with 20 chronic low back pain patients (CLBP) who had
participated in a low back pain class and whose pain had continued for more than three
months. The criteria for inclusion in this study were as follows: those whose low back
pain had continued for more than 12 weeks; those who had not undergone lumbar region
surgery as a result of orthopedic problems; those who did not have a structural
malformation or other musculoskeletal disease; those whose skin was not sensitive to
tapes; those who had not conducted exercises using the muscles of the lumbar spinal area
for the past three months; those who had not experienced taping treatment before; those
whose VAS and ODI scores were 6 or higher; and those who did not take adrenocortical
hormone or pain alleviation medication. All of the subjects voluntarily consented to
participate in this study. Data collection was initiated after approval was obtained from
the Dongshin University Hospital Institutional Review Board. The general characteristics

to a control group and an experimental group. The two groups received ordinary pain
therapy. For ordinary physical therapy, a hot pack (20 minutes), ultrasound
(1.5&#x02005;W/cm<sup>2</sup>, five minutes, Jireh Medical, Korea), and transcutaneous
electrical nerve stimulation (4 pps, 15 minutes, Hanawoo Medical, Korea) were applied to
the L1&#x02013;2 and L4&#x02013;5 areas for 40 minutes each time, three times per week, for a total of
twelve weeks. Placebo tape was applied to the control group, and kinesio tape was applied
to the experimental group. The same therapist conducted the kinesio taping, and tape with
tension in the evaluated direction was applied. As the tape (5&#x02005;cm wide and 5&#x02005;cm thick), a
waterproof, porous, and adhesive product was used. The experimental group used the kinesio
tape in a sitting position. Four blue &#x0201c;I&#x0201d; strips were stretched and overlappingly attached
to the lumber area with the maximum pain in a star shape<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the control group, one inelastic &#x0201c;I&#x0201d; strip was attached
transversely to the lumber area with the maximum pain. The two groups were instructed to
leave the tapes attached in situ until the next intervention.</p><p>Regarding anticipatory postural adjustment, the anticipatory muscle contraction
initiation time of the trunk according to upper extremity movement was examined. For the
measurement of the muscle contraction initiation time, a surface EMG (BTS Pocket EMG, BTS
S. P. A., Milan, Italy) was used.</p><p>The electrodes were attached to the deltoid anterior (DA), the transversus abdominis
(TrA), the External Oblique (EO) of the nondominant side. The subjects sat comfortably in
a chair and placed their arms beside their trunk, side by side. They then raised their
nondominant hand, and returned it to the starting point as fast as possible when the
signal sounded for 1 second. With the DA as the standard, the preceding contraction was
expressed as a minus value, and the next contraction was expressed as a plus value. The
sample collection rate was 1,000&#x02005;Hz, and filtering was 20 to 500&#x02005;Hz.</p><p>Changes in cerebral cortex potential were measured using a QEEG-8 (LEX3208, Laxtha Inc.,
Korea). Based on the international 10&#x02013;20 system, the active electrodes were attached to
the F3, Fz, F4, C3, Cz, and C4 areas of the cerebral cortex. The ground electrode and the
reference electrodes (A1, A2) were attached to the mastoids. The subjects&#x02019; postures and
motions were the same as those during anticipatory postural control. With the initiation
of electromyography DA signals that started with the motions as the standard, MRCP was
divided into readiness potential (RP), &#x02212;600&#x02005;ms to &#x02212;500&#x02005;ms, motor potential (MP) at &#x02212;100&#x02005;ms
to 0&#x02005;ms, and movement monitoring potential (MMP) at 0&#x02005;ms to 1&#x02005;s; the maximum values of
each section were recorded<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Brain
wave signals prior to the attachment of the tape and 12 weeks after the attachment of the
tape were measured. In order to prevent eye blinking and movement of pupillae, a mark was
made 2&#x02005;m to the front of the subjects, and the subjects were instructed to look at the
marked point. The sampling rate for data collection was set at 256&#x02005;Hz, and the band-pass
filter was analyzed at 4 to 50&#x02005;Hz. For the clinical evaluation of pain, a visual analogue
scale was used<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the functional
performance evaluation of ordinary life, the ODI was used<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 12.0 for Windows. Changes within each group
after taping were analyzed using a paired t-test. Changes between the groups were analyzed
using an independent t-test. The statistical significance level was set at &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>According to the analysis of changes in muscle contraction initiation time related to

flexibility of the trunk are reduced, limiting one&#x02019;s range of motion. As a result, low back
pain patients&#x02019; levels of participation in everyday and social activities decrease, and their
quality of life is thus reduced<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Swift movement of the extremities triggers postural sway of the whole body. At this point,
postural sway is adjusted by anticipatory activation of postural control muscles by the
basal ganglia, the supplementary motor area, and the primary motor area in the opposite side
of agonists and by providing agonist contraction timing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. This response, which is planned in advance in the central nervous
system, is called anticipatory postural adjustment. However, chronic low back pain patients
have problems with anticipatory postural control due to changes in their muscle coordination
adjustment and neural transmission resulting from pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, Wand et al. observed that CLBP patients underwent
cerebral cortical changes due to pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Accordingly, using the muscle contraction initiation time of the trunk, MRCP activity of the
cerebral cortex, and clinical evaluation (VAS and ODI), this study examined how the
application of kinesio tape affected CLBP patients&#x02019; anticipatory postural adjustments and
movement-related MRCP.</p><p>Muscle contraction initiation time consists of premotor reaction time, which is the stage
prior to muscle contraction in EMG after stimuli have been provided, and motor reaction
time, which is the period of time from when a muscle contracts to the time point when actual
joint movement occurs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study,
kinesio tape was applied, and anticipatory postural adjustments in the trunk muscles (TrA
and EO) were examined. Both groups experienced TrA and EO contraction after deltoid muscle
contraction. In an experiment using normal subjects, Hodges et al. noted that trunk muscle
contraction always preceded movements of the extremities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, in this study, trunk muscle contraction occurred after
movements of the extremities. This result is consistent with those of Urquhart et al., who
reported that when CLBP patients moved their extremities, their trunk muscles were not
activated compared with those of normal subjects and that CLBP patients experienced a delay
in postural adjustment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition,
when compared between before and after the experiment, the groups&#x02019; muscle contraction
initiation times significantly decreased. In particular, the experimental group&#x02019;s TrA muscle
contraction initiation time change was larger than that of the control group. This suggests
that CLBP patients&#x02019; trunk muscle initiation time was delayed by more than in ordinary
subjects, but after kinesio taping, the trunk muscle contraction response time in these
patients improved.</p><p>The area related to MRCP is associated with the primary motor area (M1) and the
supplementary motor area (SMA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
order to examine cerebral cortical activity as a result of applying kinesio tape, this study
investigated MRCP. In the control group, the RP and MMP activities at Fz and Cz and MP
activity at Fz, Cz, and C4 were significantly decreased. In the experimental group, the RP
activity at Fz and Cz; MP activity at F3, Fz, F4, C3 and Cz and MMP activity at F3, Fz, F4,
C3, Cz, and C4 were significantly decreased. In particular, the experimental group&#x02019;s MMP
activity most greatly decreased. When comparing the two groups, the experimental group&#x02019;s MMP
activity decreased by significantly more than the control group&#x02019;s MMP activity. This result
showed that the MRCP of CLBP patients decreased after the application of kinesio tape.
Jacobs et al. compared the MRCP of CLBP patients and normal subjects and reported that MRCP
activity increased more in CLBP patients than in normal subjects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. David et al. measured MRCP that appeared in movements
that were made for the first time and in experienced movements and reported that MRCP
activity was lower in experienced movements<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. In other words, kinesio tape that was applied to CLBP patients
continuously provided feedback to the cerebrum and reduced MRCP activity.</p><p>The two groups exhibited significantly different changes in VAS and ODI. This result
suggests that application of physical therapy and kinesio tape reduces pain and affects
functional performance capabilities. In particular, the experimental group&#x02019;s VAS
significantly decreased. This result can be explained by the fact that kinesio taping
increases the circulation of blood and lymphatic fluid and continuously stimulates the
neurological system, reducing pain and positively affecting ODI, which is a functional
evaluation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Skin adhesion of kinesio tape is believed to cause information to be sent to the cerebrum
that results in continuous contraction of muscle and to create stable muscle tension by
repetitively causing muscle contraction and relaxation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. It also increases the space between the skin and the muscles,
reducing pressure, and increases lymphatic circulation, decreasing pain, and thereby
improving muscle function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>According to the results of this study, the CLBP patients experienced an imbalance in
anticipatory postural adjustment together with pain and MRCP overactivity, and due to such
problems, their functional movements were negatively affected. The application of kinesio
tape reduces pain in CLBP patients, and such reduced pain positively affects their
anticipatory postural adjustment. In addition, the repetitive feedback formation of the
cerebrum through the taping triggers a decrease in MRCP, positively influencing functional
movements.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>O&#x02019;Sullivan</surname><given-names>PB</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Lumbar segmental instabiliy: clinical presentation and
