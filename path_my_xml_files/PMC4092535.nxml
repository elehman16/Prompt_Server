degradation products, both of which have deleterious effects on platelet function. We
designed a study to compare the effects of a high dose of aprotinin (A), tranexamic acid
(TA) and no treatment (P) on blood loss, transfusion of blood products, fibrinolysis and
platelet function during and after heart surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>After IRB approval, 60 consecutive consenting patients undergoing combined aortic valve
replacement surgery with CABG were studied. They were randomized to either: high-dose A
(280 mg loading dose, 70 mg/hour infusion rate and 280 mg in the prime) (<italic>n </italic>=
20), TA (100 mg/kg loading dose, 1 mg/kg/hour infusion rate) (<italic>n </italic>= 20), or
saline (<italic>n </italic>= 20). The effect of A and TA on some markers for the activation of
thrombin formation and fibrinolysis was studied (D-dimer, plasminogen,
&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-anti-plasmin,antithrombin and glycocalicin, a fragment of the
platelet-membrane GPIb). Sampling was at induction (t1), at the start and end of CPB
(t2, t3), and at 1, 4 and 24 hours after CPB (t4, t5, t6). ANOVA for repeated
measurements was applied for statistical comparisons between groups. <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c;
0.05 was considered significant. Data are expressed as mean values &#x000b1; SEM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Study groups did not differ with regard to demographic data and type of operation. Blood
loss and chest tube drainage was significantly less in the A and TA groups as compared
with the P group at all time points and was accompanied with the use of less blood
products, volume replacement and higher hemoglobin levels. The duration of the surgical
post-CPB period was significantly shorter in the A and TA groups (55 &#x000b1; 18, 71
&#x000b1; 19 and 84 &#x000b1; 26 min, respectively). There was no difference in platelet count
between groups. There were no re-explorations for postoperative bleeding. Inhibition of
fibrinolysis was significant with both antifibrinolytic drugs (D-dimers 578 &#x000b1; 81,
550 &#x000b1; 105 and 3603 &#x000b1; 440 &#x003bc;g/ml at t4). During and after the operation,
the D-dimers were much higher in the placebo group. &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-antiplasmin
levels were higher in the A group compared with the TA and P groups. This effect was
present until 24 hours after CPB. TA had no effect on this parameter. Plasminogen levels
were lower in the TA group at t4, t5 and t6. TA patients more often received additional
boluses of heparin to maintain ACT &#x0003e; 480 s during bypass (15/20 patients versus 9/20 and
8/20 patients in the A and P groups, respectively). aPTT values were significantly
prolonged at the end of CPB in the A group. Antithrombin values were significantly
higher in the A group at t3, t4 and t5. Glycocalicin values were slightly higher in the
TA group during bypass.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>TA can inhibit fibrinolytic activity by blocking plasmin(ogen) activity measured as the
D-dimer level, but seems to have no influence on neutralization of plasmin by
&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-antiplasmin. Both A and TA effectively suppress the appearance of
markers of fibrinolysis as compared with placebo. The results also suggest that the
antifibrinolytic effects of TA and A can reduce blood loss in patients undergoing
extensive CPB surgery.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="other"><source>Ann Thorac Surg</source><year>2001</year><volume>10</volume><fpage>1821</fpage><lpage>1831</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0003-4975(01)03211-8</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><mixed-citation publication-type="other"><source>Ann Thorac Surg</source><year>1998</year><volume>10</volume><fpage>712</fpage><lpage>718</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0003-4975(97)01345-3</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9527200</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><mixed-citation publication-type="other"><source>J Cardiovasc Anesth</source><year>1998</year><volume>10</volume><fpage>642</fpage><lpage>646</lpage></mixed-citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>
