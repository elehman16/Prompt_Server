One hundred and thirty-one pregnant women in Labor Ward were selected by convenience sampling.

The study data were gathered using demographic information form, and assessed with Faces Anxiety Scale (FAS). For participants belonging to the experimental group, pressure was applied to the Spleen 6 acupoint for 30 min, and for those with only light touch was applied to the Spleen 6 acupoint for 30 min.

Today, various medical and nonmedical methods are used to reduce labor pain.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] There are considerable advantages to the use of nonmedical pain management techniques, such as few side effects for mother and fetus and lack of interference with labor process.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Acupressure, as a noninvasive method, eliminates imbalance in vital energy, removes pain, reduces muscle tension, improves blood circulation and vital activities, and decreases the anxiety symptoms [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and is one of the popular complementary therapies which is believed to improve psychological and general health.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Manual stimulation of acupuncture points has been shown to increase the production of serotonin and endorphin as well as improve the regulation of serum cortisol. Changes in these hormones may reduce anxiety.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] One study indicated that acupressure at specific points could reduce preoperative anxiety.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] A clinical trial to evaluate the effect of pressure on Bladder 32 (BL32) acupoint on women's anxiety during labor showed that acupressure at the BL32 point reduced the mother's anxiety.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In another study, the results showed increased level of anxiety in both groups but the amount of increase was lower in the pressure group than the touching group and the difference was significant.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In another study there was no significant difference in drug consumption between pressure and touching groups.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Furthermore, Suzuki and Tobe performed a study on pregnant woman and revealed the effectiveness of acupressure in reduction of pregnancy-related anxiety and previous depression.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The reduction of anxiety might be due to the effectiveness of the intervention, self-hypnosis, or even the feeling of security resulting from the presence of the researcher as one of the healthcare staff.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Given that, good evidence on the effectiveness of acupressure on psycho-social aspects of health is limited.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Only few studies about the effect of acupressure on anxiety and analgesic consumption during labor have been done on three groups. As a result, more studies are needed to establish safe and effective pain-relieving strategies to increase the comfort levels of pregnant women during labor, as labor pain is one of the most difficult experiences in a woman's life. Thus, the goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of acupressure on anxiety level and sedative and analgesics consumption in three groups of women during labor in Iran.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A randomized, controlled, single-blind clinical trial was conducted at Maryam Hospital, Tehran, Iran, registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (ID: IRCT138812193527N1) and designed as a single-blind clinical trial with random allocation of population that consisted of 18&#x02013;35-year-old women who had been referred to the Labor Ward for delivery. Sampling, as available, was done among all pregnant women who were admitted to the Labor Ward. The inclusion criteria were having singleton pregnancy, being mother's first or second delivery, term pregnancy, vaginal delivery, a cervical dilatation of 3&#x02013;5 cm, and having a normal pattern of contractions repeated every 5 min or less for 20 s or more. Patients were excluded if they have any sign of fetal distress, use psychotherapeutics, or presence of any medical or obstetrical problems.</p><p>To confirm the accuracy of the acupoint location, Acuhealth TENS Pro 900 (Acuhealth Pty, Stepney, South Australia) was used. This device produces a different sound at acupoints because they have a lower electric resistance than their surrounding area. Once the point was located, the intervention was performed according to the study conducted by Lee et al.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] using simple sample equation, with power of 80% and standard deviation of 1.0. Based on a similar study by Lee et al.,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] at least 41 participants were needed in each group. Initially, 172 participants were randomly selected. Due to limitations in space in the labor room, if the sampling of different groups was performed on the same day, the subjects would become aware of the used method, and thus, the placebo effect would be lost. Therefore, the randomization was performed in terms of time (fortnightly), at the beginning of each two-week period, and one of the groups was selected randomly. Based on the exclusion criteria, 41 patients were excluded during or after the study; 21, 5, and 15 individuals were excluded from the pressure, touch, and conventional care groups, respectively. Ultimately, 131 participants, consisting of 41 subjects in the experimental group (pressure group), 41 in the control group 1 (touch group), and 49 in the control group 2 (routine care group), were studied. The process of the participants' allocation is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. The control group 1, with the application of touch at Spleen 6 acupoint (SP6), was designed to eliminate the stress factor (the researcher's presence). Initially, the SP6 was examined to rule out any burns, eczema, and excessive edema. Subsequently, vital signs, color of tongue, uterine contractions, and vaginal examination were noted.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The process of the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJNMR-23-87-g001"/></fig><p>During the 30-min intervention, pressure group and touch group, respectively, received pressure and light touch at SP6 on both legs simultaneously accompanied with instructions on deep breathing and relaxation. In the experimental group, pressure was applied through the rotational motion of the hand (the energy distributing method) at SP6 as follows. Pressure was applied for 2 min in a way that a pleasant feeling of pain would be experienced by the subject. The applied pressure was to an extent kept the degree of paleness of the nail at a constant level and that the subject was pleased. Subsequently, regardless of contractions, 1 min of pressure followed by 1 min of rest was applied intermittently until the pressure time equaled an overall 30 min. It took 1 h to perform this technique every time. The same technique was applied in the touch group with the application of touch instead of pressure at SP6. Given the approximate average of 24 min needed for the meridian energy-flow cycle in the body, a pressure time of 30 min was determined to guarantee a complete circulation in the body.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Furthermore, as the minimum pressure time was 1 min, pressure was initially applied for 2 min to guarantee that a complete cycle of pressure time was covered at every attempt. All subjects in both pressure and touch groups were in a left lateral position to prevent a sudden fall in blood pressure. To control the bias effect of analgesics, no analgesics were used before or during the intervention and the amount of sedative and analgesics consumption during labor was measured. The level of anxiety, according to a study conducted by Lee et al., was measured using the Faces Anxiety Scale (FAS) before and after 30 min of cessation of the intervention.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The evaluation time of anxiety in the routine care group was also considered in order to match the other groups on admission, 1 h, and 1.5 h from the beginning of sampling. The type of delivery, newborn weight, and Apgar score were recorded in the questionnaire.</p><p>The collected data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 16 and descriptive statistics. The Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used for the analysis of the categorical variables, and Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test was used for the following continuous variables: anxiety, age, dilatation, and effacement between the groups. <italic>p</italic> values below 0.05 were considered significant.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>After explaining the study objectives to participants, informed consents were obtained from participants who were eligible and agreed with the study procedures.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>The exclusion criteria were any sign of fetal distress, the use of psychotherapeutic drugs, medications for labor induction, and the presence of any medical or obstetrical complications. Lastly, data collected from 131 patients were included for the data analysis. Before the intervention, no statistically significant differences were reported between the groups in terms of demographic and obstetrics characteristics (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). The average age of the women in all three groups was 26 years that had no statistically significant difference between the three groups. Before the intervention, no statistically significant differences were observed between dilatation and effacement in three groups (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).

Also, the use of sedative and analgesics between the groups had a statistically significant difference. The lowest rate of sedative and analgesic use belonged to the pressure group. Accordingly, it was 73.2, 95.1, and 91.8% in the pressure, touch, and routine care group, respectively. A clinical trial evaluated the effect of pressure at BL32 on labor duration, and women's anxiety during labor.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] It showed that anxiety in the pressure group significantly decreased during labor.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In two studies,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] an increased level of anxiety in both groups was reported, but it was lower in the pressure group than the touch group, which was statistically significant. The findings of the present study were similar to those of other studies.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The results of a study on Gall Bladder 21 (GB-21) and SP6 acupoints showed that the anxiety level reduced in the two intervention groups, but it increased in the control group.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Thus, acupressure could reduce anxiety and improve the mood condition.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Moreover, another study showed that the stimulation of particular acupoints effectively reduced anxiety prior to the surgery.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] It has been reported that acupressure could immediately relieve pretreatment anxiety among adults with a medium effect size.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Two other studies showed that acupressure led to the release of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, which had tranquil effects.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] A systematic review and meta-analysis indicated a significant reduction in the use of morphine in intervention groups compared to control groups.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Acupressure is an alternative to acupuncture,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] but it is less likely to cause adverse effects compared to needle acupuncture.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] It has been demonstrated that acupressure could reduce the intensity of pain and use of morphine in patients who recovered from the lumbar spine surgery.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Furthermore, they reported that the application of acupressure in the perioperative period of total knee arthroplasty alleviated postoperative pain and decreased opioid consumption.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] As the limitations of the present study, oxytocin administration was one of hospital routine that was performed on all three study groups in a similar style and timing. Also, no pain assessment tool was used to measure the effect of aupressure on pain level.</p><p>Converse to other studies, more matching and inclusion criteria were considered in the study's design. Also, identical pressure time for all women in the experimental group was applied. The use of a single-blind design, two control groups, measurement tools for pressure, and special tools to confirm the correct point of pressure were the strengths of this study. A few studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of security feeling caused by the presence of the researcher as one of the healthcare staff. This study showed that acupressure, apart from the effect of the investigator, could reduce the anxiety level and the use of analgesics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study showed that acupressure at SP6 could be considered as an alternative method that could decrease the maternal anxiety level and use of sedative and analgesics especially pethidine, which could reduce analgesic and surgical complications in pain management. Lastly, acupressure can be considered by healthcare staff as a method for reducing anxiety and the use of sedative and analgesics during labor.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and
