Lifestyle change has proven effective at reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes, but limitations in the current evidence have been identified in: the promotion of physical activity; availability of interventions that are suitable for commissioning and implementation; availability of evidence-based interventions using new technologies; and physical activity promotion among ethnic minorities. We aim to investigate whether a structured education programme with differing levels of ongoing support, including text-messaging, can increase physical activity over a 4&#x000a0;year period in a multi-ethnic population at high risk of diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A multi-centre randomised controlled trial, with follow-up at 12 and 48&#x000a0;months. The primary outcome is change in ambulatory activity at 48&#x000a0;months. Secondary outcomes include changes to markers of metabolic, cardiovascular, anthropometric and psychological health along with cost-effectiveness. Participants aged 40&#x02013;74 years for White European, or 25&#x02013;74 years for South Asians, with an HbA1c value of between 6.0 and&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;6.4&#x000a0;% (42 and 47&#x000a0;mmol/mol) or with a previously recorded plasma glucose level or HbA1c value within the high risk (prediabetes) range within the last five years, are invited to take part in the trial. Participants are identified through primary care, using an automated diabetes risk score within their practice database, or from a database of previous research participants.</p><p>Participants are randomly assigned to either: 1) the control group who receive a detailed advice leaflet; 2) the Walking Away group, who receive the same leaflet and attend a 3&#x000a0;hour structured education programme with annual maintenance sessions delivered in groups; or 3) the Walking Away Plus group, who receive the leaflet, attend the structured education programme with annual maintenance sessions, plus receive follow-on support through highly-tailored text-messaging and telephone calls to help to aid pedometer use and behaviour change.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will provide new evidence for the long-term effectiveness of a structured education programme focused on physical activity, conducted within routine care in a multi-ethnic population in the UK. It will also investigate the impact of different levels of ongoing support and the cost-effectiveness of each intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN83465245">ISRCTN83465245</ext-link> Trial registration date: 14/06/2012</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Prevention</kwd><kwd>Impaired glucose regulation</kwd><kwd>Type 2 diabetes</kwd><kwd>Prediabetes</kwd><kwd>Walking</kwd><kwd>Physical activity</kwd><kwd>Pedometer</kwd><kwd>Structured education</kwd><kwd>Primary care</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd><kwd>mHealth</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the third leading cause of mortality globally and represents one of the greatest health challenges for modern society, both in the UK and worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The International Diabetes Federation estimate there are 387 million people living with diabetes, and this is predicted to rise to 592 million by 2035 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The healthcare expenditures associated with T2DM, the commonest form of diabetes, are substantial and having T2DM drastically increases lifetime healthcare expenditures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].Diabetes currently accounts for approximately 10&#x000a0;% of the total health resource expenditure in the UK and is projected to account for around 17&#x000a0;% in 2035&#x02044;2036, due to a sharply increasing prevalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Consequently health care organisations have recognised the need for policy and recommendations aimed at prevention at the international, national and regional level. In England this has taken the form of the National Health Service (NHS) Health Checks Programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], designed to screen and treat those at risk of vascular disease in adults between 40 and 75&#x000a0;years. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have also recently issued guidance aimed at the prevention of T2DM in at-risk adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>The status of being at high risk of T2DM refers to an intermediary glucose control category that is outside the normal range but below that needed to diagnose T2DM. This intermediary range has historically been termed &#x02018;prediabetes&#x02019; or &#x02018;intermediate hyperglycemia&#x02019; and classified through oral glucose tolerance test defined impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] . Along with traditional definitions, an International Expert Committee convened by the International Diabetes Federation and NICE now also recognise that HbA1c can be used to identify those at high risk of T2DM in the range of 6.0&#x000a0;% - 6.4&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Twenty five to 40&#x000a0;% of individuals in these risk categories go on to develop T2DM over a 10&#x000a0;year period and as many as 70&#x000a0;% will eventually develop T2DM over the course of their lifetime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. While we recognise there is controversy and lack of consensus in terminology for these categories of glucose dysregulation, we refer to prediabetes henceforth to aid readability.</p><p>Lifestyle interventions aimed at weight regulation, dietary modification and increased physical activity have successfully reduced the risk of T2DM in those with prediabetes in diverse settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and are recommended as the first level of intervention for the prevention of T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, several limitations in the evidence have not been adequately addressed. These include effective interventions to promote physical activity, availability of interventions that are suitable for commissioning and implementation, use of new technologies to increase the scalability of interventions, and the promotion of health behaviour within ethnic minorities. Each of these limitations is discussed below followed by an introduction to how structured education and new technologies may be employed as a solution in the context of the NHS in the UK.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Physical activity</title><p>Although physical inactivity is one of the most important lifestyle determinants contributing to the risk of both T2DM and cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], there is little direct evidence that previous T2DM prevention programmes have resulted in clinically significant increases in physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], even when this health behaviour is the primary intervention target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The effectiveness of diabetes prevention programmes could therefore be enhanced if effective, evidence-based strategies for increasing physical activity are developed and evaluated within the context of diabetes prevention in primary care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Translation into routine care</title><p>Trials of the efficacy of lifestyle interventions in the prevention of T2DM have evaluated highly resource intensive programmes, beyond the level that could be rolled out in the real world given resource limitations and competing clinical needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Whilst there is mounting evidence internationally that the approach used in efficacy trials can be translated into approaches suitable for implementation in a community or primary care setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], there is limited evidence for the long-term effectiveness of these programmes, and evidence-based behaviour change techniques to support the maintenance of behaviour change. In addition, there has been a lack of systematic approaches to translating evidence into practice within the UK setting. Diabetes prevention programmes that are tailored to the resources and infrastructure within primary care and compliant with NICE guidelines are being developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], but there is a need to ensure these are thoroughly evaluated over the longer-term.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Use of new technologies to increase scalability</title><p>New technologies such as the internet (eHealth) and mobile phones (mHealth) offer great potential for the delivery of behaviour change interventions, given their scalability, reach, and capacity to offer highly-tailored, interactive behaviour change support. Text messaging interventions have shown promise in supporting medication adherence, physical activity, weight loss, smoking cessation and prevention/management of chronic disease, either as a standalone intervention or in combination with other modes of delivery, e.g. face to face [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, these interventions are rarely based on evidence and offer general rather than highly tailored support. There is uncertainty about the long-term effectiveness of theory driven and evidence-based behaviour change interventions using mHealth technology that can be integrated into routine diabetes prevention pathways within primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Ethnicity</title><p>In industrialised societies, some minority ethnic groups are known to have a substantially elevated risk of T2DM. South Asians (SAs), the largest ethnic minority in the UK, have prevalence and progression rates for diabetes that are up to four times greater than the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This elevated risk of chronic disease is compounded by lifestyle factors, of which the most notable is physical inactivity. SAs residing in the UK have been shown to be substantially less active with lower levels of cardiovascular fitness than the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This differential in physical activity behaviour and levels of cardiorespiratory fitness has been linked to the increased prevalence of chronic disease and higher rates of insulin resistance seen in SA populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Therefore SAs represent a priority group in the prevention of T2DM. However, there is limited evidence that diabetes prevention programmes within a European context have been effective at targeting lifestyle behaviours and improving health in minority ethnic groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Structured education for the prevention of T2DM</title><p>There is encouraging pilot evidence that the limitations highlighted may be addressed by combining structured education with pedometer use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Structured education refers to educational interventions, generally delivered to small groups, aimed at the promotion of self-management and health behaviour and underpinned by established health behaviour theories, a written curriculum and standardised educator training and quality assurance pathways. Structured education has been widely used as a central part of diabetes management pathways within routine care and has been recommended by NICE since 2003 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The Diabetes Education and Self-Management for Ongoing and Newly Diagnosed (DESMOND) programme is one of the most prominent structured education programmes for people diagnosed with T2DM available nationally to commissioning organisations in the UK and the only programme to undergo a multi-centred randomised controlled trial to quantify effectiveness and cost-effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The DESMOND trial reported reductions in cardiovascular disease risk profile, reduced depression, enhanced smoking cessation, and weight loss whilst being highly cost-effective at &#x000a3;2092 per QALY gained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Given the existing wide spread infrastructure of the DESMOND model, it has started to be adapted to the prevention arena as a feasible and scalable model for implementing diabetes prevention programmes within primary care and public health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Pilot work concluding with a single-centre randomised controlled trial demonstrated that the approach used to promote self-management in the DESMOND programme can be tailored to those identified with prediabetes in the promotion of physical activity. The Prediabetes Risk Education and Physical Activity Recommendation and Encouragement (PREPARE) structured education programme was found to increase physical activity levels and substantially reduce fasting and post-challenge glucose levels in a multi-ethnic population over 12&#x000a0;months when combined with personalised pedometer use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Given the relevance to healthcare providers and commissioners, it is important to investigate the effectiveness of this approach further when translated into routine clinical care.</p><p>Whilst structured education has been identified as a potentially effective method of promoting behaviour change in the prevention of T2DM, guidelines recommend the provision of regular ongoing support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. It is essential to develop sustainable and scalable approaches, such as mHealth, to enhance and reinforce the aims of structured education programmes or other face-to-face behaviour change interventions.</p><p>Given the above considerations, there is an identified need to develop and evaluate the use of structured education as a tool for promoting health behaviour change in those with prediabetes with tailored, ongoing support through low-resource approaches. Here we test whether the approach used in the PREPARE structured education programme, which has proven efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], can promote long-term changes to physical activity and whether the programme&#x02019;s effectiveness is enhanced through the use of a follow-on support programme combining pedometer self-monitoring with tailored text-messaging and telephone calls.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To investigate whether an intervention to support physical activity change and maintenance, offered to an ethnically diverse population with prediabetes, can lead to sustained increases in physical activity over four years.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To investigate the effectiveness of the intervention when delivered at two levels of intensity, with and without follow-on support that enhances self-monitoring with pedometers through tailored text-messaging and telephone calls.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To investigate the effect of the intervention within White Europeans and South Asians sub-groups.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To conduct a within-trial and long-term economic evaluation of both intervention conditions using the costs and benefits arising from the study, rates of progression to T2DM, biomedical outcomes, NHS resource use, and quality-of-life.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Study design</title><p>The study comprises two phases: a development and piloting phase of the text-messaging support for pedometer use and a multi-centre randomised controlled trial. The development phase has been submitted for publication elsewhere, while the present article describes the trial phase.</p><p>The trial is a multi-centre randomised controlled trial comparing two modes of physical activity intervention with a control condition. The study is designed to adhere to internationally recognised criteria for developing complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The design of the study and flow of participants is described in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The study is being run across two centres, Leicester and Cambridge, UK.

The NHS Health Check is a screening programme run in the UK, designed to identify and treat vascular disease risk (heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and kidney disease) in all individuals aged 40&#x02013;74 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. As part of this, many primary care practices now have HbA1c or fasting glucose values recorded for their patients. The research teams in both Leicester and Cambridge are working in collaboration with practices that are providing the Health Checks programme to recruit those found with prediabetes, and who are not currently receiving a systematic diabetes prevention pathway. To help with this process, recruited practices are trained to run an established automated diabetes risk score within their practice database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. A function within the risk score uses a Morbidity Query Information Export Syntax (MIQUEST) search to identify all individuals who have had a previous blood glucose or HbA1c result recorded in the prediabetes range (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) over the previous five years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].

The PREPARE programme has previously been shown in a single centre RCT to increase ambulatory activity by 2000 steps per day compared to control conditions over a 12-month period when combined with pedometer use with sustained improvements in glucose levels. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]</p><p>The programme is delivered by two trained educators to groups of up 10 participants (who are welcome to bring a guest). The content of the programme, examples of activities and the underlying theoretical structures are presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The key aim of the programme is to increase participants&#x02019; physical activity predominantly through increased walking, and to prompt the use of self-monitoring and feedback using pedometers. During the programme participants use their daily habitual step count (measured at baseline prior to the education programme) to set personalised activity goals. They are provided with a pedometer (Yamax SW200) as a self-monitoring tool. Typically, sedentary participants are encouraged to increase their activity levels by at least 3000 steps per day, equivalent to around 30&#x000a0;minutes of walking. Those achieving more than 6000 steps per day are encouraged to try to reach at least 9000 steps per day, an amount that is likely to include 30&#x000a0;minutes of walking activity in addition to usual daily activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Those achieving more than 9000 steps per day are encouraged to at least maintain their current activity levels and develop further goals should they wish to. Goal attainment is encouraged through the use of proximal objectives, such as increasing ambulatory activity by 500 steps per day every two weeks. Participants are encouraged to make an action plan detailing where, when and how their first proximal goal will be reached, to repeat action planning for each new proximal goal, to wear their pedometer on a daily basis and to self-monitor their ambulatory activity using a specifically designed steps-per-day diary.

In addition they are introduced and given access to a highly tailored text-messaging follow-on service designed to support behaviour change and pedometer use with additional telephone calls from educators that are initiated after attendance at the Walking Away programme. Details of the text messaging and telephone follow-on support service are detailed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and have been submitted for publication elsewhere. In brief, approximately one week after the Walking Away session, an educator telephones the participant to help them identify a short- and long-term step goal and action plan for the next six months, and to elicit information on tailoring variables including confidence in increasing physical activity, previous experience of physical activity and potential mobility issues that prevent walking being the primary activity. The educator records the information in an online form and saves it on a database for use by the text-messaging programme. A key feature of the text-messaging and pedometer support is that participants are prompted to text in their weekly step count. They then receive automated feedback by text message tailored to the extent to which they achieved their goals, in relation to the tailoring variables. Participants also receive text-messages using evidence-based behaviour change techniques and a six month telephone call to review their goals and action plans, prompt problem solving and provide social support. The key techniques used in the follow-on support are goal setting (behaviour), action planning, self-monitoring, goal review, problem-solving and social support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The intensity of the &#x02018;follow-on support&#x02019; varies over the course of the year (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) and is repeated over the four years of the study.

Across the study sites, 16 educators have been recruited from a range of registered and non-registered Health Care Professionals from local healthcare providers and other appropriate settings. This mix of personnel was included in order to make the study as pragmatic and generalisable as possible to routine health care systems. To ensure that all interventions are delivered by educators as planned, a fidelity standard operating procedure has been put in place. All educators attended an initial two day training course to ensure that they understood the theories and philosophy that underpin the Walking Away programme and the content and resources used within it. All educators were given a written curriculum to support their delivery of the programme and given the opportunity to practise delivery of the programme. Quality assurance of delivery is undertaken to assess educational style and content using established tools used within routine care through the DESMOND Collaborative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Educators receive structured and instructive feedback from their assessor and key goals and action plans are developed in order to help them improve their performance.

The training was supported by an extensive curriculum outlining the contents (behaviour change techniques, patient-centred communication skills) and mode of delivery of the follow-on support. The curriculum also contains standardised scripts that educators are asked to follow, an explanation of the intervention fidelity procedures, and standardised reflection sheets and checklists to promote and assess fidelity of the phone calls. Educators are asked to audio-record the telephone calls, listen back to a sample, complete the checklists, and discuss these with the intervention lead. The number of calls assessed and their frequency depends on the competence level of the individual educators as well as the year of intervention delivery. Monitoring the delivery of the text-messaging system is done on a weekly basis by examining automatically generated lists of messages sent and received.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Study outcomes</title><p>Data collection clinics are run by research nurses in the Leicester Diabetes Centre, the MRC Epidemiology Unit, Cambridge and other local community centres and clinic areas.

Raw acceleration data are captured and stored at 100&#x000a0;Hz. Data processing will be undertaken on commercially available analysis tools. At least three days valid wear is required to count as a valid recording. Non-wear time is determined by one hour or more of consecutive zero counts.

The standard (4&#x000a0;week) recall format will be used. Data from SF-8 is represented as a physical component score and a mental component score.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Depression and anxiety</title><p>Depression and anxiety are measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HADS) Scale, to produce independent subscales for anxiety and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Health resources</title><p>A health resources questionnaire records the number of times over the past 12&#x000a0;months that the participant has seen a health care practitioner such as a GP, nurse or other health workers, and the number of times they have been to hospital.

This eight item instrument uses an 11 point Likert scale (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;no effect, 10&#x02009;=&#x02009;complete effect) to measure five cognitive diabetes risk representations (consequences, timeline, personal control, treatment control, and identity), two emotional representations (concern and emotion) and risk comprehensibility (perceived knowledge).</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Self-efficacy in relation to physical activity</title><p>Self-efficacy is measured at baseline, 12 and 48&#x000a0;months. Six items measure participants&#x02019; confidence in their ability to undertake any form of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity for 10&#x000a0;minute periods, increasing incrementally from 10&#x000a0;minutes to one hour each day. Items use a 100&#x000a0;% confidence rating scale (where 0&#x000a0;%&#x02009;=&#x02009;no confidence, and 100&#x000a0;% represents complete confidence).

A 5-point Likert scale (where 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;most of the time and 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;never) assesses how often participants set goals, form action plans, use a pedometer, complete an physical activity log, are aware of their activity levels, and are trying to be more physically active.</p></sec><sec id="Sec40"><title>Uptake and adherence to Walking Away and Walking Away Plus interventions</title><p>Measures of uptake and adherence to the intervention groups will include: 1) group session attendance to Walking Away, 2) group session attendance to the annual maintenance sessions at 12, 24 and 36&#x000a0;months 3) proportion of phone calls completed, 4) number of participants who registered for the text messaging service, 5) number of STOP messages received for test messaging (i.e. number opting out of the text messaging and pedometer support), 6) proportion of intended texts sent, and 7) number of step count texts received from participants relative to the number of requests they are sent (engagement).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Qualitative process evaluation</title><p>A process evaluation will be conducted using a combination of ethnographic methods including observations of education sessions and individual interviews.

Assuming 25&#x000a0;% of participants in the total cohort are SA we have an 80&#x000a0;% power to detect around a 2000 steps/day difference when comparing two intervention comparisons to the control group (alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.025) in the SA population.</p><p>Several intervention studies with a follow-up of between 3 to 12-months reported a standard deviation of change in ambulatory activity of around 3000 to 4000 steps per day in individuals with T2DM, prediabetes or in sedentary individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].Therefore we have anticipated a standard deviation of change of 4000 steps per day. An intervention effect of 1000 steps was considered the minimum clinically significant difference between groups and equates to around a 4&#x000a0;% difference in the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec44"><title>Secondary outcome</title><p>Given that around 95&#x000a0;% of the general population fail to meet the Chief Medical Officer&#x02019;s physical activity guidelines when measured objectively by accelerometers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], this study also allows for the 10&#x000a0;% difference in those meeting the current physical activity recommendation to be detected at follow-up based on 1-beta&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.8, alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.025. Consistent with the calculation for ambulatory activity, this study has sufficient power (1-beta&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.8, alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.025) to measure a 10&#x000a0;minute/day difference in change in the time spent in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity based on previous work undertaken by our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>This study has sufficient (1-beta&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.8, alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.025) power to allow for clinically meaningful differences for change in the biochemical measures to be detected in the entire study cohort and after stratification by ethnicity; fasting glucose (0.3&#x000a0;mmol/l), 2-h glucose (1&#x000a0;mmol/l) and HbA<sub>1c</sub> (0.25&#x000a0;%).</p><p>Furthermore assuming a conversion rate to T2DM in the control group of at least 24&#x000a0;% over the course of the entire study (4&#x000a0;years), we will have an 80&#x000a0;% power to detect a 40&#x000a0;% reduction in the relative risk of T2DM in both intervention groups compared to the control group. The estimated conversion rate is at the lower level reported for traditionally defined prediabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. We anticipate that the inclusion of an HbA<sub>1c</sub> defined prediabetes in this study will act to marginally lower the conversion rates, whilst the inclusion of a large South Asian group will act to increase the conversion rates.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec45"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Analysis will involve two <italic>a priori</italic> comparisons; both intervention groups will be compared to the control group. Should any of these comparisons reveal a significant difference, then a third <italic>a priori</italic> comparison will be undertaken by comparing the difference between intervention groups - this will be included as a secondary analysis. Multiple linear regression analysis will be used to investigate the differences in the change in physical activity level achieved between groups at 48&#x000a0;months, after adjusting for potential areas of bias between groups, valid accelerometer wear time and the number of valid wear days. Analysis will be conducted on the cohort as a whole and stratified by ethnic group; interaction terms will be used to quantify the effect of ethnic group. We will also use interaction terms to assess whether the effects of the interventions are modified of gender, age, ethnicity, family history of T2DM or whether prediabetes status was confirmed at baseline; significant interactions will followed by stratified analysis. We will also assess change in physical activity at 12&#x000a0;months as a secondary outcome. The primary analysis will be based on analysing those with complete data at each time point in the group to which they were randomised. A sensitivity analysis will be undertaken to assess the impact of imputing missing data through multiple imputation and through a per-protocol analysis by removing those that failed to attend the initial Walking Away session in both intervention groups; per-protocol analysis for the Walking Away Plus group will be defined as removing those that that failed to attend the initial Walking Away session OR those that failed to register for or actively stopped their text messaging support via the STOP function within the first 2&#x000a0;months.</p><p>Analysis of secondary biochemical and anthropometric outcomes will be analysed using the same strategy and at the same time-points as that described for the primary outcome. Differentials in the time to T2DM between groups will be plotted using the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method for comparing survival curves; the log rank test will be used to assess for differences between the groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec46"><title>Health economics</title><p>We will undertake a costing exercise to determine the cost of delivering the initial interventions covering expenditure such as educator time, educator training and quality assurance. In addition we will determine the cost of the follow-up maintenance support group-sessions and the staff and other costs of the individually tailored telephone and text messaging package for maintenance support. Resource use incurred will be costed using actual costs in the trial and/or standard references for unit costs such as Unit Costs of Health and Social Care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. In addition to the primary endpoint, we will analyse the within-trial impact of the interventions during the trial on other outcomes that are pertinent to the long-term economic analysis, i.e. use of antihypertensives and lipid-lowering therapies, blood pressure, health utility and incidence of T2DM.</p><p>Long-term costs and benefits of the interventions will be evaluated through a combination of the within-trial outcomes and decision-analytic modelling to simulate long-term incidence ofT2DM, microvascular complications arising from T2DM and cardiovascular events. Specifically for progression to T2DM, estimating long-term progression will require a statistical model built partly from incidence data from the trial. The underlying incidence curve will be based on rates of progression in the control arm, and a survival model with time-varying hazards will be built to demonstrate the effect of a unit change in physical activity on risk of T2DM over time. This will allow the impact of alternative assumptions about the degree of maintenance of physical activity beyond the 4-year follow-up period to be modelled. The underlying progression of T2DM beyond the 4-year follow-up will be estimated by the above 4-year survival curve and assumptions about medium-term maintenance of physical activity, but also informed by the trajectory of survival curves from long-term diabetes prevention studies such as the Finnish Diabetes Prevention study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].</p><p>An important input for the modelling will be the effect of increasing physical activity on cardiovascular risk. The relationship between changes in physical activity and cardiovascular risk will be incorporated into an existing decision-analytic model of prevention of diabetes. This relationship will be informed by a recent study that specifically calculated the effect of change in ambulatory activity (steps per day) on cardiovascular disease risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The model will be chosen from existing models used previously for work for NICE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] on prevention of diabetes or developed as part of the School for Public Health diabetes prevention theme within ScHARR, funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR). The economic model aggregates the costs of the intervention, prescribed medications, therapy, the costs of one-off treatments (e.g. cost of amputation), and on-going treatment of complications (e.g. treatment following stroke). The cardiovascular risks of participants with prediabetes, or with diabetes will be estimated using the UKPDS risk engines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. A further adjustment will be made so that the risk can be adapted for the South Asian population using evidence advised by clinical colleagues.</p><p>Separate evaluations will be undertaken for the overall group and for the South Asian subgroup. Cost-effectiveness will be reported in terms of incremental costs and QALYS and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Uncertainty around the results will be explored through probabilistic sensitivity analysis and related techniques for identifying the most important drivers of uncertainty, which will be presented on a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve and a cost-effectiveness plane.</p></sec><sec id="Sec47"><title>Trial Steering Committee (TSC) and Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC)</title><p>The trial is overseen by TSC comprising an independent chair, independent clinical and academic members and the principal investigator.

NICE guidelines on diabetes prevention recommend the use of group-based lifestyle intervention for prediabetes as the cornerstone of any diabetes prevention pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], so it is important to investigate the use of structured education within the prevention domain. It is imperative that any intervention programme is carefully evaluated for both clinical and cost-effectiveness, as well as its capacity to be easily implemented into primary care. Whilst both the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of structured education for those diagnosed with T2DM have already been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], and is recommended by NICE as best clinical practice for the management of T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], there is a lack of translational research within the context of diabetes prevention. Consequently this limits the capacity of commissioners and policy makers to make informed evidence-based decisions regarding the implementation of national diabetes prevention programmes within primary care. Furthermore there is a need to establish what the optimal levels of ongoing support are to ensure any behaviour change is maintained, taking into account the limited resources available in most healthcare settings. This study evaluates highly-tailored, evidence-based text-messaging tool which requires few resources and time, and thus will help address both of these limitations.</p><p>The Walking Away from Diabetes structured educational programme and the follow-on text-messaging and telephone support system have been specifically designed to be translated into primary care. This type of lifestyle intervention in prediabetes could be easily added to other programmes currently on offer for the management of type 2 diabetes, thereby allowing a range of structured education packages and evidence-based mHealth interventions to be offered, to best serve the needs of the diabetes pathways within primary care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec49"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment started in January 2014 and is still ongoing.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BIPQ</term><def><p>Brief illness perceptions questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DESMOND</term><def><p>Diabetes Education and Self-Management for Ongoing and Newly Diagnosed</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DMEC</term><def><p>Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EPIC</term><def><p>European Prospective Investigation of Cancer and Nutrition</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQ-5D</term><def><p>European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HbA1c</term><def><p>Glycated haemoglobin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>prediabetes</term><def><p>Impaired glucose regulation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NAVIGATOR</term><def><p>NateglinideAnd Valsartan in Impaired Glucose Tolerance Outcomes Research</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NICE</term><def><p>National Institute of Health and Care Excellence</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OGTT</term><def><p>Oral glucose tolerance test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PA</term><def><p>Physical activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QALY</term><def><p>Quality adjusted life years</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PREPARE</term><def><p>Prediabetes Risk Education and Physical Activity Recommendation and Education</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PROPELS</term><def><p>The PRomotionOf Physical activity through structured Education with differing Levels of ongoing Support for those with prediabetes</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF-8</term><def><p>Short form 8</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T2DM</term><def><p>Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TSC</term><def><p>Trial steering committee</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p>World Health Organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>MD has acted as consultant, advisory board member and speaker for Novo Nordisk, Sanofi-Aventis, Lilly, Merck Sharp &#x00026; Dohme, Boehringer Ingelheim, AstraZeneca and Janssen and as a speaker for Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation.
