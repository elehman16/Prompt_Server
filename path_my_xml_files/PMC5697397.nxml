Native whey has higher leucine content and thus a potentially greater anabolic effect on muscle than regular whey (WPC-80). This study compared the acute anabolic effects of ingesting 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;20 g of native whey protein, WPC-80 or milk protein after a resistance exercise session.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">
<italic>A total of</italic> 24 young resistance trained men and women took part in this double blind, randomized, partial crossover, controlled study. Participants received either WPC-80 and native whey (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10), in a crossover design, or milk (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;12). Supplements were ingested immediately (20&#x000a0;g) and two hours after (20&#x000a0;g) a bout of heavy-load lower body resistance exercise. Blood samples and muscle biopsies were collected to measure plasma concentrations of amino acids by gas-chromatography mass spectrometry, muscle phosphorylation of p70S6K, 4E&#x02013;BP1 and eEF-2 by immunoblotting, and mixed muscle protein synthesis by use of [<sup>2</sup>H<sub>5</sub>]phenylalanine-infusion, gas-chromatography mass spectrometry and isotope-ratio mass spectrometry. Being the main comparison, differences between native whey and WPC-80 were analysed by a one-way ANOVA and comparisons between the whey supplements and milk were analysed by a two-way ANOVA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Native whey increased blood leucine concentrations more than WPC-80 and milk (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Native whey ingestion induced a greater phosphorylation of p70S6K than milk 180&#x000a0;min after exercise (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03). Muscle protein synthesis rates increased 1&#x02013;3&#x000a0;h hours after exercise with WPC-80 (0.119%), and 1&#x02013;5&#x000a0;h after exercise with native whey (0.112%). Muscle protein synthesis rates were higher 1&#x02013;5&#x000a0;h after exercise with native whey than with milk (0.112% vs. 0.064, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.023).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Despite higher-magnitude increases in blood leucine concentrations with native whey, it was not superior to WPC-80 concerning effect on muscle protein synthesis and phosphorylation of p70S6K during a 5-h post-exercise period.

The ability of a serving of protein to stimulate muscle protein synthesis&#x000a0;(MPS) is dependent on absorption and blood kinetics of amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], amount of protein ingested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], and the amino acid composition of the protein source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Only the essential amino acids (EAA), especially leucine, initiate an immediate increase in MPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Being a rapidly digested protein with a high leucine content, whey has been shown to stimulate MPS more than equal amounts of casein and soy in the first hours after exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Other studies found that despite differences in absorption kinetics and amino acid composition, when measured over a sufficient time interval (4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;h), milk and casein appear to elevate MPS equally effective as whey protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This may be so because both the amount of protein and the complete EAA profile is important for maintenance of MPS over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The mechanisms behind the anabolic effects of amino acids still remain to be fully elucidated. At the molecular level the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and its substrates (p70S6K and 4E&#x02013;BP1) are believed to largely be responsible for the protein synthetic response to resistance exercise and protein intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], with resistance exercise potentiating the effect of protein ingestion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Native whey protein is produced by the filtration of unprocessed raw milk. This production method leaves proteins intact and gives native whey higher leucine content than the more common whey protein concentrate (WPC-80), which is a product of cheese production. Furthermore, it has been shown that intake of native whey induces greater leucine blood concentrations than WPC-80 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Consequently, we hypothesized that native whey is a more potent stimulator of MPS than WPC-80. The aim of the current study was therefore to compare the time-dependent changes in mTORC1 substrate signalling and MPS in response to two 20&#x000a0;g doses of WPC-80 or native whey ingested immediately and two hours after leg resistance exercise. Moreover, we included a group consuming equal amounts of milk protein in order for a comparison against a commonly consumed source of protein in the Norwegian diet to be made [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. To investigate whether potential differences in MPS between supplements had an effect on recovery we measured force-generating capacity before, 10&#x000a0;min after, 300&#x000a0;min after and 24&#x000a0;h after the workout.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants and ethical approval</title><p id="Par8">A total of 24 young men and women were included in the study (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Both WPC-80 and native whey were likely able to maximally stimulate MPS with the applied supplementation regime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. If supplemented as a suboptimal dose or in elderly, the higher leucine content of native whey may have resulted in a greater anabolic effect than WPC-80. However, previous studies showing an effect of added leucine on MPS have applied a substantially larger difference in the leucine content of supplements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Consequently, whether the moderate difference in leucine content between WPC-80 and native whey will have a meaningful effect in these settings is unclear. Native whey, in contrast to WPC-80, was able to maintain MPS-rates significantly higher than baseline during the late period. Although native whey was not significantly different from the other supplements during the late period, the observed pattern is interesting. The question as to whether the optimal feeding frequency is affected by protein type should be investigated in future studies.</p><p id="Par42">Few studies have directly compared the acute anabolic responses to ingestion of milk and whey proteins. As milk protein is primarily composed of casein (80%) and a smaller part of whey (20%), some information might be gained from studies comparing these purified fractions. Such studies suggests there are only minor differences, if any, in MPS response between ingesting whey and casein after resistance exercise if measured over a sufficient amount of time, e.g. 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, there seems to be a temporal difference between the effects of whey and casein, with whey inducing a faster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] more transient increase in MPS, whereas casein ingestion results in a slower more prolonged increase in MPS after resistance exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. We observed a similar pattern as that reported by Reitelseder and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], with the whey supplements increasing MPS during the early post-exercise period (1&#x02013;3&#x000a0;h), whereas milk did not. However, our second serving makes it difficult to compare the late periods between studies. As 18&#x000a0;g of milk protein previously have been shown to increase MPS in young men after resistance exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] we expected our supplementation of 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;20&#x000a0;g of milk protein to elicit a measurable effect on MPS. Perhaps ingesting the milk supplement as a single serving of 40&#x000a0;g instead of 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;20&#x000a0;g would have elicited a greater effect. It is also possible that our standardized breakfast stimulated MPS at baseline and the change from the fasted state would have been greater.</p><p id="Par43">In order to investigate the effects of slow and fast increases in blood amino acid concentrations, without the challenge of different amino acid content, West and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] supplemented participants with either a bolus (25&#x000a0;g) or a pulse (10&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2.5&#x000a0;g every 2&#x000a0;min; mimicking casein) of whey protein. Anabolic signalling and MPS was greater with the bolus during a 5-h post-exercise period, indicating that appearance of amino acids in blood affect the anabolic response. The milk, WPC-80 and native whey supplements in the current study all contained 2.0, 2.2 and 2.7&#x000a0;g of leucine per serving. Thus, all servings contained an amount of leucine above 1.8&#x02013;2.0&#x000a0;g, which has been estimated to be needed in order to maximally stimulate MPS in young individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Thus, leaving the varying digestion rate of milk and whey as the most likely explanation for our observed differences in anabolic response between milk and native whey.</p><p id="Par44">Our resistance exercise protocol led to a 5&#x02013;30% reductions in muscle force-generating capacity (10&#x000a0;min after exercise). These ranges of reductions in muscle function indicate mild to moderate muscular stress, which is supported by small increases in CK across groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In accordance with a previous study, no differences were observed in recovery of muscle function between groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The clear effect of protein on anabolic signalling and MPS may theoretically accelerate recovery of muscle function, as has been shown in studies applying more damaging eccentric muscle contractions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In the current study, a workout considered more &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; and less muscle damaging was applied, while at the same time investigating more comparable supplements, making it less likely to observe a difference.</p><p id="Par45">The lack of a direct measure of muscle protein breakdown (MPB) is a limitation in this study, as both MPS and MPB are needed to calculate net protein balance in muscle. Previous studies have shown MPS to respond with greater changes than MPB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and MPB to be a minor determinant of net muscle protein balance in the acute response to protein intake following resistance exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Thus, we assume that our MPS measurements to large extent reflect the major part of the net protein balance response. [<sup>2</sup>H<sub>5</sub>]phenylalanine TTR in blood was not affected by the supplements. The short-lived increase in [<sup>2</sup>H<sub>5</sub>]phenylalanine TTR was due to a bolus infusion of [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]phenylalanine not related to the results in this study. This increase would not affect the IRMS measures of bound protein but could potentially alter the GCMS measures of intracellular [<sup>2</sup>H<sub>5</sub>]phenylalanine. When analysed, intracellular enrichment of [<sup>2</sup>H<sub>5</sub>]phenylalanine were at steady state and did not reflect the brief fluctuations in blood. Measures of MPS should therefore not be affected.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par46">Native whey is a relatively new form of whey protein, which due to its high leucine content has received substantial attention and claims [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In this study we compared native whey with regular whey protein after a bout of resistance exercise. Despite a higher increase in blood leucine concentrations after ingestion of native whey, there were no differences between native whey and WPC-80 in stimulating the phosphorylation p70S6K, eEF-2 and 4E&#x02013;BP1, MPS during a 5-h post exercise period. Native whey increased post-exercise phosphorylation of p70S6K more and had a higher rate of MPS than milk during the 5-h post exercise period. The higher rates of MPS with native whey compared to milk do not necessitate a greater adaptation over time. In order to investigate the potential differences in adaptation over time a long-term training study is needed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec27"><p>
