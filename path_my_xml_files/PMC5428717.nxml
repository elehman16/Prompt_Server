However, free phthalate can be ingested by hand-to-mouth action or by contact with food. To evaluate the effectiveness in removing phthalate exposure on hand, we compare here the removal efficiency of di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) on hands by handwashing with soap-and-water versus water-only. In two three-day N-of-1 trials, residual DEHP was measured in a single female adult who washed exposed hands with soap-and-water or water-only. Subsequently, a crossover study was performed by randomly assigning another 28 subjects equally to wash with soap-and-water or with water-only, and then each one received the other treatment 24 hrs later. In the N-of-1 trials, mean DEHP removal rates range from 95.9% (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.1%) to 97.0% (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.5%) for soap-and-water handwashes, and 1.8% (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.1%) to 7.0% (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.3%) (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3) for water-only. In the crossover study, mean removal rate was 94.6% (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.5%) for handwashing with soap-and-water (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;28) and 8.7% (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.7%) for water-only (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;28). We concluded that handwashing with soap-and-water removes 80% more DEHP than handwashing with water alone, and may be a cost-effective way of removing other endocrine disruptors from hands.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Handwashing is an important and cost-effective public health intervention for the prevention of infectious diseases spread<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

In this study, we aimed to provide evidence for the effectiveness of handwashing in reducing exposure to phthalate.</p><p id="Par3">Phthalates, a family of chemicals used in plastics and other products, is one of the most prevalent toxic chemical and endocrine disrupting chemicals to which humans are exposed in their daily lives.

Exposure to these chemicals is difficult to avoid due to their ubiquitous prevalence in the environment, where exposure occurs through the ingestion of contaminated foods, direct skin contact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, and transdermal absorption from air<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Being lipophilic, phthalates are easily picked up by hands through contact with products such as PVC flooring, personal care products, and plastic toys and subsequently enter to bodies via dermal absorption or hand-to-mouth routes such as finger sucking, nail biting or smoking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Toddlers and children are more susceptible to phthalate exposure due to their floor play and hand-to-mouth behaviors. In fact, children&#x02019;s exposure to diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), a potent, commonly used phthalate, from toys and hand-to-mouth activities was estimated to be 5.7&#x02013;44&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/kg bw/day using child-specific exposure factors from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.

On average, one handwashing with soap-and-water removed more than 90% of DEHP in our study, whereas one handwashing with water alone removed only 10%. The poor removal efficiency achieved by handwashing one time with only water was substantially improved by combined soap-and-water handwashing. Compared to a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> which did not employ a standardized Six-Step Hand Hygiene Technique (60&#x02013;75% DEHP removed by handwashing), the present study found a higher DEHP removal efficacy by using a standardized Six-Step Hand Hygiene Technique. This previous study with only 5 participants had similar handwashing procedure (eg. the application of soap, the washing duration, and hand drying time) as our study, except the handwashing method, where participants were only asked to rub hands together using typical &#x0201c;washing&#x0201d; pattern. The Six-Step Hand Hygiene Technique ensured that all surface areas of the hands were well washed. The result of the study provided concrete evidences on the benefits and efficacy of handwashing with soap using such standardized technique.</p><p id="Par10">Because children are much more vulnerable to the effects of phthalates and are harder to control, we chose college students as subjects in our interventional studies. We compensated for the difference in subjects by designing an experiment to mimic the behavior of dermal exposure to DEHP in toddlers and children. To do this, we chose 500&#x02009;&#x003bc;g as the exposure dose of DEHP in our interventional studies. The average surface area of one hand in children aged 6&#x02013;11 years was estimated to be 510&#x02009;cm<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Based on the mean dermal DEHP exposure (0.571&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/cm<sup>2</sup>) measured by Kim and his colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, we estimated that the total amount of DEHP on both hands would be approximately 582.42&#x02009;&#x003bc;g (510&#x02009;cm<sup>2</sup>/hand&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;0.571&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/cm<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 hands) in children, close to the exposure dose of 500&#x02009;&#x003bc;g in the present study. Another reason for choosing this exposure level was for comparative purposes. Standardized guidelines have been established to assess dermal exposure in occupational and residential settings, such as the EPA OPPTS 875.2400 test guideline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In a study with comparable exposure conditions, where four workers were exposed to 500&#x02009;&#x003bc;g of Mancozeb, a hydrophobic pesticide, by 0.5&#x02009;mL spiking on their hands, the wash efficiency with soap-and-water was 77&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Thus, our interventional studies reflected the actual DEHP exposure dose among children in real-life situations. However, considering adult&#x02019;s larger hand surface area compared to children, the surface loading (mass of chemicals per skin surface area) for children may be higher. This could result in overestimation of the removal efficiency when using adult participants to estimate children&#x02019;s removal efficiency. We calculated the level of overestimation using the removal efficiency of DEHP in hand area with different DEHP exposure levels provided by Gong <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, and found that when the exposure level was 43% higher (in microgram/meter square), the removal efficiency reduced about 23% (see detailed calculation in the Supplementary appendix).</p><p id="Par11">Handwashing involves three main forces to remove contaminants from skin surfaces: mechanical action, hydrodynamic drag, and wet chemical action<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Rinsing hands involves mostly hydrodynamic drag. Handwashing with water-only, which involved scrubbing the skin via mechanical agitation through back-to-forward movements and pressure of both hands, consisted of mechanical force and hydrodynamic drag. Handwashing with soap-and-water, however, not only involved mechanical action and hydrodynamic drag but also wet chemical (soap) action. The non-polar ends of the dispersed soap bond with hydrophobic chemicals, such as DEHP, and form micelles that can be easily rinsed off the skin. In the N-of-1 trials and the crossover study, one time handwashing with water-alone removed only 5% of the DEHP, whereas handwashing with soap-and-water removed more than 70% DEHP. These results suggest that wet chemical action (dissolution) is the most important force contributing to the removal of lipophilic chemicals such as phthalates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par12">The removal rate of DEHP in some of N-of-1 trials by the treatment of soap-and-water may exceed 100%. Possible explanations are that DEHP exposure traces may be left on the subject&#x02019;s hand before the start of the experiment which was not removed by the prewash step, or simply due to experimental variation. Although we asked the subject to thoroughly wash her hands before the start of the experiment, in this first N-of-1 trial, she might not be as familiar with the Six-Step Hand Hygiene Technique and thus may not have washed all surface area on hand and removed all of the possible DEHP exposure prior to the start of the trial. This also highlights the learning effect of the handwashing technique on improving removal efficiency, which was observed in both the N-of-1 and the crossover experiments.</p><p id="Par13">As DEHP does not hydrolyze in water, the types of tensides within the soap are important in DEHP removal. In our pilot study, we tested major brands of antimicrobial soap, plain handmade soap (vegetable oil and sodium hydroxide), and unscented soaps and found that they worked equally well (unpublished data). Even though we only used one type of phthalate in the study, considering that many phthalate esters have similar chemical and physical characteristics, our results can be generalized to phthalate esters or other chemicals with similar bonding affinity to human skin.</p><p id="Par14">In conclusion, a one-time wash with soap-and-water using a standardized Six-Step Hand Hygiene Technique removes most of the DEHP on hands and is better than washing with water-only. Because DEHP is not readily absorbed through the skin, it is likely that exposure would occur hand-to-mouth. Therefore, we recommend that people, especially toddlers and children, wash their hands properly with soap and water at least shortly before eating.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study Designs</title><p id="Par15">The study was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>, identifier: NCT02707172). Three trials, consisting of two N-of-1 trials and one crossover study, were used to compare the effect of handwashing with soap-and-water and handwashing with water-only on phthalate removal from hands (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The soap was plain soap, consisting of vegetable oil and sodium hydroxide.

In each trial, a trained research technician placed 500&#x02009;&#x003bc;g of DEHP on the participant&#x02019;s hands and asked the participants to thoroughly spread DEHP over both hands. The participant was then asked to wash hands with soap-and-water or water-only. The trials were repeated for three times over the course of three days. The first trial started on 15 May 2013. On Day One, after the subject prewashed her hands, she allowed her hands to be exposed to a designated amount of DEHP. She then washed them with water-only and rinsed them sequentially in three separate polyethylene (PE) bags, each containing 200&#x02009;mL water to collect DEHP residues. One hour later, the same protocol was followed, except the exposed hands were treated with soap-and-water instead of water-only (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). The water rinsing in three separate bags remained the same. The pairs of studies were repeated on two subsequent days (16 and 17 May). In the second N-of-1 trial, which was also performed over three days (22&#x02013;24 May), the protocol using the same subject remained the same for all three days, except that the subject underwent soap-and-water handwash first then water-only handwash (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).
