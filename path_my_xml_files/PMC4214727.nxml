Compared to the ruminal epithelium, the hindgut epithelium is composed of a monolayer structure that is more &#x0201c;leaky&#x0201d; for lipopolysaccharide and susceptible to organic acid-induced damage. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in epithelial structure, apoptosis and inflammatory response in the hindgut of goats fed a high-concentrate diet for 6 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental Design</title><p>Eight local Chinese goats with rumen cannulas were randomly assigned to two groups: one group was fed a high-concentrate diet (65% concentrate of dry matter, HC) and the other group was fed a low-concentrate diet (35% concentrate of dry matter, LC) for 6 wks. Ruminal fluid, plasma, and hindgut mucosa tissues were collected. Histological techniques, real-time PCR and western blotting were used to evaluate the tissues structure, cell apoptosis and local inflammation in the hindguts.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Feeding HC diet for 6 wks resulted in a significant decrease of ruminal pH (p&#x0003c;0.01), and ruminal lipopolysaccharide concentrations were significantly increased in HC goats (p&#x0003c;0.05). Obvious damage was observed to mucosal epithelium of the hindgut and the intercellular tight junctions in HC, but not in LC, goats. The expression of MyD88 and caspase-8 mRNA was increased in colonic epithelium of HC goats compared to LC (p&#x0003c;0.05), and the expression of TLR-4 and caspase-3 showed a tendency to increase. In the cecum, interleukin-1&#x003b2; mRNA expression was decreased (p&#x0003c;0.05), and caspase-3 showed a potential increase (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.07) in HC goats. The level of NF-&#x003ba;B protein was increased in colonic epithelium of HC goats. Caspase-3 activity was elevated in both colon and cecum, whereas caspase-8 activity was statistically increased only in colon.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Feeding a high-concentrate diet to goats for 6 wks led to hindgut mucosal injuries via activating epithelial cells apoptosis and local inflammatory response.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by National Basic Research Program of China (Project No. 2011CB100802) and National Nature Science Foundation of China (Project No. 31272470) and A Project Funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).

These feeding programs might be useful to lower the cost in the short term, however, the excessive amounts of non-structural carbohydrates and highly fermentable forages result in rapid fermentation and organic acids accumulation in rumen and hindgut <xref rid="pone.0111596-Gaebel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111596-Andersen1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Moreover, feeding excessive grain to ruminants likely leads to the accumulation of bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) derived from gram-negative bacteria in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract <xref rid="pone.0111596-Khafipour1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111596-Zebeli1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The increased LPS in the GI tract, especially in the hindgut, can increase the permeability for LPS <xref rid="pone.0111596-Chin1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, leading to the translocation of LPS from GI tract into circulatory system. Therefore, the accumulation and translocation of LPS might cause damages to the histological structure of mucosa barrier in GI tract <xref rid="pone.0111596-Steele1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Under normal conditions, the rumen epithelium prevents the translocation of toxic compounds into blood depending on the multi-cellular structure <xref rid="pone.0111596-Plaizier1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Recent findings suggest that the combination of low pH and high LPS concentration in the rumen may not cause the translocation of LPS <xref rid="pone.0111596-Khafipour2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, there was a high risk of LPS translocation from the large intestine due to the monolayer structure when ruminants suffered a grain-induced subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) challenge <xref rid="pone.0111596-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Tight junctions (TJs) play an important role in maintaining the barrier function of epithelial cells, preventing the translocation of LPS and other toxic compounds from the intestinal tract into the circulatory system <xref rid="pone.0111596-Penner1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The impairment of the epithelial TJ barrier can result in intestinal inflammation, including necrotizing enterocolitis, celiac disease, and Crohn's disease <xref rid="pone.0111596-Gassler1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0111596-John1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. It's reported that the disruption of intestinal TJs can increase the permeability of intestinal epithelia, the translocation of LPS and even cause systemic inflammation <xref rid="pone.0111596-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Intestinal epithelial cells contribute to the regulation of inflammatory conditions and create an intestinal barrier against invading pathogens <xref rid="pone.0111596-Furrie1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the gut epithelium play a key role in maintaining the homeostasis by recognizing ligands known as microbial-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) derived from both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria <xref rid="pone.0111596-Akira1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0111596-Sharma1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. After combining with TLR-4 on the host cell surface, LPS activates myeloid differentiating factor 88 (MyD88), and then elicits a pro-inflammatory NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent signaling cascade <xref rid="pone.0111596-Poltorak1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111596-Takeda1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. As a major transcription factor and a first responder to harmful cellular stimuli, NF-&#x003ba;B plays a central role in inflammation through its ability to induce transcription of proinflammatory genes <xref rid="pone.0111596-Baldwin1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Systemic LPS administration caused a rapid intestinal epithelial cells apoptosis and the activation of caspases, paralleled a significant disruption in the intestinal villi and the epithelial cells shedding <xref rid="pone.0111596-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>Several studies conducted in goat and dairy cattle showed that a high grain diet impaired barrier functions of the rumen epithelium <xref rid="pone.0111596-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111596-Klevenhusen1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, inflammation and caused other health problems in host animals <xref rid="pone.0111596-Zebeli2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Several chaperone proteins with important cellular protective functions in epithelial tissues were collectively down-regulated in response to high dietary energy supply, which indicates that energy-rich diets and the resulting acidotic insult may facilitate the impairment of rumen barrier function by attenuating their cell defense system <xref rid="pone.0111596-Hollmann1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. However, no information exists about the underlying mechanism behind the disruption of protective functions of the hindgut epithelium in response to high grain diet to ruminants. Based on the finding that the rumen digesta and presence of LPS make the hindgut tissues &#x0201c;leaky&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0111596-Emmanuel1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, we hypothesized that feeding goats a diet enriched with a high level of concentrate could cause structure damages in hindgut epithelium via triggering epithelial cells apoptosis as well as the local inflammatory response. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the changes of epithelial structure, apoptosis and inflammatory response in the hindgut of goats after feeding a high-concentrate diet for 6 wks.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ruminal pH</title><p>After feeding a high concentrate diet for 2 and 6 wks, ruminal pH was significantly decreased in HC goats compared to control (<italic>p&#x0003c;0.01</italic>).

However, feeding 65% grain diets to the male goats for 7 weeks resulted in translocation of LPS into the blood with the concentrations of 0.8&#x000b1;0.20 EU/mL, suggesting a leakage of LPS into the blood <xref rid="pone.0111596-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Klevenhusen <italic>et al</italic> found that in growing goats, greater amounts of grain in the diet were associated with a quadratic increase in serum LPS concentration compared with controls (0.04 vs 0.08 EU/mL), whereas no signs of inflammation became apparent, as serum amyloid A (SAA) concentrations remained unaffected by diet <xref rid="pone.0111596-Gaebel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Taken together, these results suggest that increased LPS release in the rumen or hindgut during lyses of gram-negative bacteria exposed to acidic conditions might have contributed to epithelial damage <xref rid="pone.0111596-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111596-Graham1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>The cellular structure of the ruminal epithelium is complex, consisting of a multilayered structure with intercellular tight junctions (TJs) in the two middle layers.

Histological differences between the rumen and the hindgut suggest that the barrier function of the hindgut epithelium is more easily compromised by high level of LPS <xref rid="pone.0111596-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.

Several factors such as pH value and toxic compounds have been suggested to involve in the process of structure disruption in epithelial tissues caused by feeding high grain diet <xref rid="pone.0111596-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111596-Lan1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. The level of organic acids in colonic digesta was significantly increased in dairy cattle fed high grain diet, therefore, resulting in acidotic insult in the hindgut <xref rid="pone.0111596-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, acetate treatment in the pH range of 6.0 to 7.0 induced cell apoptosis rather than necrosis, while acetate treatment at pH 5.5 caused cell necrosis <xref rid="pone.0111596-Plaizier1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Additionally, a recent study conducted in growing goats showed that after feeding high grain diet for 6 wks, several chaperone proteins with important cellular protective functions were collectively down-regulated in ruminal epithelium, indicating an attenuated cell defense system <xref rid="pone.0111596-Hollmann1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>Feeding high grain diet to growing goats resulted in enhanced concentration of LPS in colonic digesta <xref rid="pone.0111596-Graham1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Increased release of LPS in colonic lumen exposed to acidic conditions might have contributed to epithelial damage by its ability to trigger inflammatory response. As one of the most potent inflammatory mediators and a major structural component of Gram-negative bacteria, LPS has been hypothesized to form an important risk factor of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) <xref rid="pone.0111596-Caradonna1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. LPS activates the host Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells in IBD, which contribute to cytokine-mediated mucosal tissue damage, leading to a breakdown in the mucosal barrier <xref rid="pone.0111596-Liu2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. MyD88-dependent pathway is the downstream signals of TLR-4, and initiation of MyD88-dependent pathway could lead to activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and transcription of several pro-inflammatory genes <xref rid="pone.0111596-Akira1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Diverse stimuli (e.g., microbial products, microbes, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress) can activate NF-&#x003ba;B, and the downstream cytokines have been used to assess inflammation <xref rid="pone.0111596-Khafipour1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111596-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In this study, the mRNA transcript level of TLR-4 in colon mucosa was up-regulated in HC goats, and MyD88 mRNA expression showed a significant up-regulation with a 3-fold increase compared to control goats. TNF-&#x003b1; mRNA expression in colon epithelium of HC goats was increased by 1.5 fold compared to control. Moreover, the level of NF-&#x003ba;B p65 protein was significantly enhanced in colonic mucosa of HC goats. NF-&#x003ba;B activation has been detected in the mucosa of patients with IBD and in murine colitis model, and inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B with a specific p65 antisense oligonucleotide is effective in preventing experimental models of IBD and efficiently down-regulates cytokine production <xref rid="pone.0111596-Neurath1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Therefore, the activation of TLR-4 signaling pathway in colonic epithelium indicates the presence of an inflammatory response in HC goats after 6 wks feeding high concentrate diets. However, in cecum epithelium, except for a significant decrease of IL-1&#x003b2; mRNA expression there was no difference of TLR4, MyD88 mRNA expression, or NF-&#x003ba;B p65 protein translation between HC and control goats, suggesting other factors or pathways (e.g., apoptosis pathway) contributed to the epithelial damage.</p><p>Apoptosis was associated with activated caspase-3, -8, -9 and -10, and inactivation of caspase 10 or 3 was sufficient to block apoptosis in this pathway <xref rid="pone.0111596-Yue1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. In epithelial tissues, tight junction damage or disruption is usually thought of as a downstream consequence of caspase cleavage during the apoptotic process <xref rid="pone.0111596-Beeman1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. In another study, signaling through tumor necrosis factor (TNF) leads to the recruitment of signaling complex that activates caspase-8, which then mediates apoptosis by activating caspases including caspase-3, suggesting the important roles of caspase-3 and -8 in mediating cell apoptosis and tissues damage. Our results showed that both mRNA transcription and the activities of caspase-3 and -8 were markedly enhanced in colon epithelium of HC goats compared to control. In cecum epithelium, the transcript level of caspase 3 showed a tendency to increase, and its activity was significantly enhanced in HC goats. It is reported that a high concentration of LPS increased localization epithelial apoptosis and permeability and these changes were dependent on caspase-3 activation <xref rid="pone.0111596-Chin1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Taken together, in the present study, the activation of caspase activity may contribute to the structural damage in colon and cecum epithelium of goats after feeding 6 wks of high concentrate diets.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We report herein for the first time that ruminal pH dropped to the threshold for defining SARA after feeding HC diet to goats for 2 wks. After 6 wks, although ruminal pH of HC goats was lower than that of LC goats, which was increased to above 6.0 due to the adaptation to high grain diet. LPS concentrations in ruminal fluids but not in plasma were significantly increased in HC goats compared to LC. Obvious structural disruption was observed in colon and cecum mucosa barrier in HC goats but not in LC counterparts. Activations of both cell apoptosis and inflammatory response contributed to the process of epithelial damage in colon mucosa, while in cecum mucosa the activation of cell apoptosis was the dominant mechanism responsible for epithelial disruption in HC goats.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s5"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s5a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Nanjing Agricultural University.
