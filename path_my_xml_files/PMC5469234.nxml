After informed consent, all the enrolled 100 patients with wounds ready to be grafted due to varied aetiologies were subjected to detailed history, systemic and local examination followed by routine investigations and wound swab cultures. Patients aged below 10 years, ones with psychiatric disorders and those who refused consent were excluded from the study [<inline-supplementary-material xlink:title="local_file" xlink:href="IJPS-50-43_Suppl1.tif" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e219" content-type="local-data">Supplementary Figure 1</inline-supplementary-material>].</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S1"><label>Supplementary Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flowchart</p></caption><media xlink:href="IJPS-50-43_Suppl1.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><p>The wounds were prepared by debridement, serial saline/betadine dressing or by NPWT until fit for grafting [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>].

No differences exist in application of customised NPWT over limbs as compared to flat surfaces such as trunk. The patient was transported to the recovery room and back to the ward. After arrival in the ward, before connecting the tubing to the wall mounted suction [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>], vacuum regulator was adjusted to the desired negative pressure level (125 mmHg) by occluding the outlet of the canister with the thumb. After connecting the tubing to the canister, further titration of pressure was done if required.

By design, continuous negative pressure dressings provide a uniform distribution of negative pressure and apposition between the graft and the wound bed in most cases, even if the surface contour is irregular.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] This becomes particularly important for patients with traumatic injuries necessitating skin grafting as these grafts are often in irregularly contoured regions such as the hand, wrist and ankle. Second, accumulation of hematoma or seroma under the graft contributes to graft loss. The negative pressure dressing provides continuous removal of wound fluid, which prevents the accumulation of hematoma or seroma while maintaining graft to wound apposition.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Third, desiccation is detrimental to wound healing[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and is reduced with the occlusive nature of the NPWT dressing, in which a moist environment is maintained. Last, infection contributes to graft loss. NPWT has been associated with lower bacterial counts at wound sites,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and this reduction in the local bacterial flora may enhance graft survival.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Need for second-stage grafting</title><p>None of the patients in the NPWT group required second coverage procedure as opposed to six cases in the non-NPWT group who had to undergo second-stage STSG for adequate wound coverage which is a statistically significant difference (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>Initial graft survival with NPWT reduces the need for repeated grafting, which may eliminate costly repeated surgical expense and hospital stay.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Many studies have reported significant reduction in the reoperation rates in the grafts covered by NPWT as found in our study[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] while Moisidis <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] reported no need for regrafting any case in either of the two groups.

Length of post-STSG hospital stay was significantly reduced in the NPWT group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.034), thus reducing the burden on the hospital workforce, resources and infrastructure and enabling their better utilisation.</p><p>Llanos <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] noted that the mean post-grafting hospital stay was 8 days (range 7&#x02013;13 days) in the negative pressure group versus 12 days (7&#x02013;23 days) in the control group which was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001) and is in agreement with our study.

It decreases the need for secondary wound coverage procedures and leads to a reduction of the days of hospital stay with all the benefits to the patient and the hospital. We have been able to reduce the financial burden on the patients as well as the hospital significantly while achieving results at par with other studies which have used commercially available NPWT. More of such cost-effective methods and studies are required to provide the benefit of NPWT to underprivileged poor patients of developing countries as the cost of the widely used commercially available NPWT makes its use restricted to only those who can afford its huge cost.</p><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge the guidance and support provided by the Ex Head of Our Department Prof. M.
