Of those who fall in the U.S., 20 to 30&#x000a0;% suffer moderate to severe injuries that reduce mobility and independence, and increase the risk of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The financial impact in 2000, adjusted for inflation, was $30 billion and is expected to reach $67.7 billion by 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Walking is the major activity in which large proportion of falls in older adults occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Sixty percent of outdoor falls among older adults resulted from slips or trips [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Even among older adults capable of independent walking, there could be a substantial decline in balance performance, which does not become evident until a slip or a trip happens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In fact, the inability to step rapidly in response to unexpected loss of balance ultimately determines whether a fall occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Thus, a better way to improve balance, improve stepping and reduce risk of falls may be to direct preventive efforts towards older adults who have not yet fallen. Until recently these balance recovery responses were considered hardwired postural reflexes that could not be influenced by training. However, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] it was showed that older adults were able to adapt in a reactive manner after participation in a perturbation exercises that challenged the mechanisms responsible for dynamic stability (i.e., increase in base of support and counter-rotating segments around the center of mass).</p><p>A number of studies have begun to examine the effect of perturbation training on balance of older adults. Shimada et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] found improvement in mobility and a trend to fall reduction after split treadmill training. This training method is a very unnatural condition, given that most people walk with the same velocity in each leg. Other studies have other issues. Pai et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] showed a rapid decrease in loss of balance in response to multiple presentations of a slip perturbation after rising from sit to stand. Mansfield et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] found that older adults with a history of falls or instability reduced the frequency of multi-step reactions and foot collisions after perturbation training while standing or walking in place. The training methods perturb the balance of their participants from sit to stand or during standing or walking in place, which may not be as relevant in a natural setting as might be a perturbation while walking. Melzer and Oddsson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] found improvement in voluntary stepping, and balance control, in an exercises program that incorporate mild external balance perturbation exercises applied by the instructors; and Halvarsson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] found that old fallers that suffered from fear of falling, decreased their fear of falling, and voluntary stepping times during dual-task performance and increased velocity of walking post perturbation training.. However, in these program the perturbations of posture were expected, and not random. Recently it was showed that unidirectional translational treadmill training (i.e., a laboratory-induced trip) reduced falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Bhatt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] found that inducing unannounced right-leg slips, participants significantly reduced fall and balance loss incidence. Pai, et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] found that a single session of repeated-slip exposure reduced older adults&#x02019; annual risk of falls from 34 to 15&#x000a0;% (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) especially among those who had history of falls. The above protocol provided an anterior perturbation, causing a backwards &#x0201c;slip&#x0201d; initiated always by on the right foot. Participants might have learned and expected the right-leg slips perturbations. In a recent meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] that include 8 perturbation-based balance training studies (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;404) participants reported fewer falls than those in the control groups.</p><p>Motivated by the above perturbations training studies and trying to accommodate for some of the issues mentioned above (i.e., perturbation training while standing or walking in place; highly predictable repeated-right leg slip exposure; a very unnatural walking on split treadmill), we aimed to explore whether unexpected multidirectional perturbation training while walking on a treadmill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] can reduce risks of falls in independent older adults. A perturbation exercise while walking provides a more realistic balance training that is sufficiently task-specific so that responses on this training regime will be more likely to be transferred to other measures of balance control and voluntary stepping measures.</p><p>Our hypotheses were that following exposure to a gait training program that includes unexpected perturbations exercises during walking will significantly improve voluntary stepping times as well as balance control in older adults, two factors that are associated with falls and injuries related with falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. We believe that perturbation exercises that will challenge both balance control during walking as well as trigger a quick stepping responses to avoid fall during walking. These postural response following an external perturbation receives a higher priority than a voluntary action thus can be incorporated into centrally programmed voluntary movements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This concept should be of importance for balance training and it further supports the notion that postural perturbations should be incorporated into balance training programs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Community dwelling older adults were recruited from two protected housing institutes. Eligibility criteria were: 70&#x000a0;years or older; walking independently; Mini-Mental Score higher than 24; no severe focal muscle weakness or blindness; no known neurological disorders; no metastatic cancer. Out of 72 seniors who were assessed for eligibility, 19 were excluded (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). All subjects provided a medical waiver signed by their primary care physician clearing them to participate in moderate physical exercise.

The intervention group received 24 training sessions, twice a week for 12&#x000a0;weeks. Each session lasted for about 20&#x000a0;min and included 3&#x000a0;min warm-up walking in subject own preferred pace, 14&#x000a0;min of unannounced perturbations exercises, given in random direction order, during walking (every 20&#x02013;40 s) and 3&#x000a0;min of cool down walking. During the training sessions the subjects were instructed to walk on a treadmill, wearing their own walking shoes, with their hands free to swing; there were no handrails on the treadmill. To prevent injury if loss of balance occurred during the treadmill walking, the subject wore a loose safety harness that could arrest the fall, but that allowed the subject to walk comfortably as well as freedom to execute recovery reactions without suspension (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The instructions given to the subjects were: &#x0201c;Walk as naturally as possible at your preferred stride frequency&#x0201d;.

During all sessions, 400&#x000a0;ms horizontal surface translations were delivered as the subject walked on the treadmill. The velocity profiles were triangular waveforms with peak velocities of 0.1&#x02013;3.2&#x000a0;m/s, resulting in displacements of 1&#x02013;18&#x000a0;cm and peak accelerations of 0.5&#x02013;16.0&#x000a0;m/s<sup>2</sup>. Perturbation timing was preset and therefore was not given in a specific phase of the gait cycle or to a specific leg. The perturbation training program had 24 levels of difficulty with increasing levels of perturbations (i.e., increased displacement, velocity and accelerations of the horizontal translations, see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The difficulty level was adjusted according to the subject abilities, starting from the lowest level of 1&#x000a0;cm displacement at 0.1&#x000a0;m/s velocity and 0.5&#x000a0;m/s<sup>2</sup> acceleration at the first training session. If the subject was able to recover from all perturbations during the session (i.e., did not fell during the session) and felt that he can be further challenged, a higher level of perturbation was introduced in the next session. If not, the same level of perturbation was introduced again until successfully dealt with. Fall during the training session was defined as load cell sensors detected 30&#x000a0;% or more body weight suspended by the safety harness.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Details of Protocol Used in the perturbation intervention training program</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>The training sessions #</th><th>platform displacement (cm)</th><th>platform peak velocity (cm/s)</th><th>platform peak acceleration (cm/s<sup>2</sup>)</th><th>Number of unannounced random Perturbations per minute (forward, backward, left, right)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;cm</td><td>0.1&#x02013;0.5&#x000a0;m/s</td><td>0.5&#x02013;3.0&#x000a0;m/s<sup>2</sup>

Ten 30-s quiet-standing trials with eyes blindfolded. Center of pressure and ground reaction force data were collected with a Kistler 9287 force platform (Kistler Instrument Corp, Amherst, NY, USA), sampled at a frequency of 100&#x000a0;Hz. Evaluation of balance control was made using both traditional measure of postural sway in eyes closed condition (e.g. ML-sway, AP-sway, mean sway velocity, and Mean sway area), we also calculated the Stabilogram-Diffusion Analysis parameters from Center of pressure data. The Stabilogram-Diffusion Analysis plots (SDA) of the mean square center of pressure displacement (Critical Displacement, Cd) vs. time interval (Critical Time, Ct) parameters were extracted from the center of pressure trajectories. The SDA plots derived from COP trajectories during standing indicate the presence of two different behaviors depending on the time interval of interest. For shorter time intervals (less than 1&#x000a0;s) the COP tend to drift away from a relative equilibrium point while longer time intervals (more than 1&#x000a0;s) the COP tends to return to a relative equilibrium point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. It has been suggested that long-term region is governed by closed-loop control mechanisms whereas the postural control systems operate with sensory feedback, while during the short-term region the postural control system is governed by open-loop control mechanisms whereas the postural control systems operate without sensory feedback. The transition point between the short-term and long-term behavior has been termed the Critical Time (Ct) and sway displacement has been termed the Critical Displacement (Cd) at which closed-loop control begins to dominate sway behavior. It was described in detail by Collins and De Luca [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

To analyze the effect of the intervention program a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA for within subjects (pre vs. post-test) and between group (perturbation intervention vs. control group) was performed. Since age was significantly different between intervention and control group subjects, we included age as a covariate in the analyses. The primary outcome variables were the parameters that we previously found to be related to falls and injury from fall: the step execution times in single and dual task conditions (i.e., foot contact-time) and step reaction time, traditional postural sway in eyes closed condition (ML- and AP- sway, sway velocity and mean sway area) as well as Stabilogram diffusion Analysis parameters (Critical Displacement (<italic>Cd</italic>), and Short-term Effective diffusion coefficients (<italic>Ds</italic>) in eyes closed condition.

These parameters have been shown in the past to predict injury from falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This shows that the benefits of unexpected perturbation during walking were generalized to other aspects of balance. Our findings are supported by Pai and Bahtt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] that suggested that the central nervous system makes adaptive improvements in proactive and reactive control of stability as a result of trial and error perturbation practice (i.e., a forward slip). They suggested that the central nervous system probably decreases the reliance on feedback corrective mechanisms for successful recovery and builds an internal representations to improve its feedforward control while walking. Pai and Bahtt training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] used forward slip practice, the training program, while in the present study the direction of the perturbation was highly unpredictable (forward, backward, right and left perturbations), the intervention group subjects were unable to predict the direction of perturbation during the training. Thus it is unlikely that the improvement was due to feedforward control. Our results support the notion that the central nervous system probably increased the reliance on feedback corrective mechanisms for successful recovery. This is supported by the results of the SDA.</p><p>The significant improvement in the intervention group and the large effect size in the SDF parameters (ES&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.65&#x02013;0.92) in eyes closed conditions are promising. Age-related decrease in SDF parameters are well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and indicates that a COP tends to drift away from the equilibrium point is a predictor to falls in elderly persons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The improvement in the <italic>Dxs</italic> and <italic>Cdy</italic> as well as tendency towards improvement in <italic>Dys</italic> of SDA in eyes closed condition showed in this study indicates that the deterioration of balance control could be reversed by perturbation balance training. AP balance control in eyes close condition (<italic>Dys</italic> and <italic>Cdy</italic>) were found to be an important risk indicator of falls and injurious falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Laughton et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] found a greater <italic>Dys</italic> in elderly fallers compared with the young&#x02019;s, and greater AP and ML sway in older adults who demonstrated lower scores in the POMA. Kurz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] found that a deterioration of AP postural control present higher risk of serious injury. Most Studies usually used traditional balance measures, which provide descriptive information on the postural sway, however it is very difficult to understand the mechanism of postural control using traditional COP statistics, this we performed SDA. We found training effects on open- and close-loop control mechanism when vision was occluded as indicted by a significant decrease in Critical Displacement in AP direction (<italic>Cdy</italic>). . Improvements in and Short-term Effective diffusion coefficients in ML direction (<italic>Dxs</italic>) as well as a trend towards a decreased in Short-term Effective diffusion coefficients in AP direction (<italic>Dys</italic>) further support this notion. These parameters reflect the degree of sway in the short term region. A decreased tendency to continue sway in an ongoing direction (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>) indicates a behavior that reflects a more stable balance control system. This indicates that the intervention group was able to better detect COP movement under their feet and initiate a more effectively close loop balance control. These suggest that the improved closed-loop balance control when vision was occluded would likely be from proprioceptive and/or maybe vestibular sources.</p><p>The improvement in step execution in the intervention group was seen during the step execution times i.e., foot contact times, in both ST and DT (72&#x000a0;ms in ST and 131&#x000a0;ms in DT, see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). A shorter step execution indicates improvement in the ability to prevent a fall if balance is lost, consequently, the risk of fall and injury maybe reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The improvement in the step execution in the intervention group was accompanied with improvement in step reaction times, in particular under dual task conditions. The step reaction time duration is mainly dependent on sensory detection thresholds, nerve conduction velocities and central neural processing times. A shortened step reaction time in dual task condition suggests that the central neural processing time was improved as a result of perturbation training. This indicate that the executive functioning was improved, subject were able to step quickly while their attention was allocated elsewhere. The executive functioning is related to the ability to rapidly shift attention from a cognitive task to the stepping task. This could be interpreted also in terms of automaticity of the stepping behavior as an essential characteristic of the central reorganization process. Therefore, we could assume that the interference effect during dual task stepping was reduced as a result of the treadmill perturbation training.</p><p>Halvarsson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] also found significant improvements in stepping performance, in a group of elderly fallers that performed perturbation exercises. Melzer and Oddsson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], Mansfield et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and Rogers et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] also found that specific step training that includes perturbation of balance improves stepping abilities in older adults. Pai et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] have shown reductions in falls and balance loss following a repeated-slip during walking exposure. The same group had further showed that those gains could be retained for 6&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and cut older adults&#x02019; annual risk of falls by 50&#x000a0;% especially among elderlies who had history of falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Our results and the results above suggests that specificity-of-training principle is a major factor in achieving treatment goals and therapists need to tailor balance perturbation training programs to target functional aspects of balance control such as the ability to step rapidly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p>It is still unknown how the improvement seen in balance and stepping carries over to real-life falls. It may be that carryover to fear of falls and physical performance as measure with POMA did exist but was not detected by these outcomes measures due to insufficient sample size or due to ceiling effects, subjects were close to score the highest score in both measures. We also did not find significant carryover effects on self-reported and performance based function. This suggests that function is not derived only by the ability to perform balance tasks, but is influenced by environmental and behavioral factors. Most perturbation training programs did not measure self-reported physical function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. However other studies found improvement in self-reported function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and fear of falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This two studies trained balance in a group setting adding also behavioral factors. This may suggest that physical intervention per-se without behavioral intervention cannot change the levels of physical function. The fact that Performance based measure are weakly associated with self-reported mobility in healthy elderly persons (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.21&#x02013;0.29) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] support this notion.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, the data came from a fairly small sample of independent older adults thus the results cannot be generalized to frail or institutionalized elderly persons. Second, the training program was done on a treadmill and not on leveled ground. Treadmill walking is somewhat different then over ground walking and might pose different demands on the trainee. However, it has been showed that fall-resisting skills acquired from such training can be transferred to over-ground walking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Third, to provide stronger evidence of the clinical efficacy of this training procedure, future studies should compare the current intervention with an alternative treatment such as Tai Chi, or strength training as this was found beneficial in a recent review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Also there is a need to determine whether this type of training improves the ability to cope with falls that resulted from slips and trips only, or can be transferred to any kind of loss of balance. Fourth, further research is needed in order to determine whether randomly ordered perturbations exercises (Random practice) would render better results than repeating the same perturbation exercises (blocked practice) in terms of acquisition, adaptation and retention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Participation in a balance training program that includes unexpected perturbation of balance during treadmill walking reduced the risk factors for falls as presented by biomechanical markers that have been shown in the past to identify fallers and predict falls. However levels of physical functioning were not improved, this suggests that preventing sedentary lifestyle for the elderly require additional behavioral intervention.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>IM and AS have developed and built the BaMPer perturbation system that was used in this project.
