Unfortunately, all these drugs cause respiratory depression.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Midazolam is the shortest-acting benzodiazepine available. Despite its rapid onset, it can cause prolonged sedation following repeated administration due to a relatively long half-life.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Combining midazolam with opioids increases the risk of hypoxemia and apnea.

The nonpremedicated patients included in this study were between 25 and 38 years of age and were planned for ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval in an IVF program. This study was conducted at Dr. Soliman Fakeeh Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia between September 2014 and April 2015. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to participating in the study.</p><p>We included patients having their first IVF cycle and showing bilateral ovarian follicular response; since pain scores during oocyte collection may be influenced by repeated IVF experiences. Exclusion criteria were psychological abnormalities, cardio-respiratory, renal, or liver diseases, patients requesting a general anesthesia, and less than three dominant follicles present in either ovaries. Chronic alcohol/drug abusers and those allergic to any of the medications used in the study were also excluded.</p><p>Women who fulfilled the eligibility criteria began down-regulation treatment on days 21&#x02013;22 of the pretrial cycle. On patient's arrival at the IVF unit, preoperative check-up was carried out, and the procedure was explained. Each patient was instructed on the use of a standard 100 mm linear visual analog scale (VAS) with &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; as no pain and &#x0201c;100&#x0201d; as the worst pain imaginable.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Baseline measurements of heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), respiratory rate (RR), and room air oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were obtained using an electrocardiogram, a &#x0201c;Dinamap&#x0201d; automated blood pressure monitor and a pulse oximeter, respectively. Those parameters were recorded after the loading dose of the drug under study was given and then every 5 min, till completion of the procedure. Venous access was secured by 20 G cannula, Ringer's Lactate drip (10 ml/kg/h) was started, and oxygen facemask (6 l/min) was applied.</p><p>Patients were randomized into group (D) and group (M) with a 1:1 allocation ratio. The allocated intervention was written on a slip of paper, placed in serially numbered, opaque envelopes, and sealed. The envelopes were serially opened, and the allocated intervention was implemented. Patients were equally distributed in both groups. Both investigators and patients were blind to which method was being used. Patients were followed from the point of randomization until complete recovery.</p><p>Initially, all patients in both groups received intravenous (IV) fentanyl (1 mcg/kg) followed by a paracervical block 3,3&#x02019;,4,4&#x02019;-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB) in the form of four injections given at 2, 4, 8, and 10 o&#x02019;clock positions, comprising a total of 100 mg of lidocaine 1% (10 ml of Xylocaine&#x02122; 10 mg/ml, AstraZeneca Sverige AB). We used a needle 0.9 mm in diameter and 120 mm in length (Mediplast AB, Malm&#x000f6;, Sweden).[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Patients in group (D) received IV dexmedetomidine in a loading dose of 1 mcg/kg over 10 min followed by 0.5 mcg/kg/h infusion until they scored 3&#x02013;4 on the Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) (3: responds to commands only; 4: brisk response to light glabellar tap or a verbal stimulus).[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Group (M) received IV midazolam in a loading dose of 0.06 mg/kg over 10 min followed by 0.5 mg incremental doses until RSS reached 3&#x02013;4. VAS scores were recorded at 5-min intervals intraoperatively and 20-min intervals in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU).</p><p>During the procedure, if the patient or surgeon were uncomfortable, rescue IV sedation was given in the form of propofol top-up increments of 0.25 mg/kg until the patient reached RSS 3&#x02013;4. The total requirements of the rescue sedative drug were recorded.</p><p>Intraoperatively, complications were observed, recorded, and treated accordingly as discussed later. Oxygen desaturation was considered when SpO<sub>2</sub> dropped below 93% for more than 10 s. Bradycardia was defined as a HR under 50 beats/min or a 20% decrease from the baseline, whereas a HR more than 20% of the baseline was labeled as tachycardia. A drop in MAP by 20% or more of the baseline was regarded as hypotension while an MA<italic>P</italic> value higher than the baseline by 20% was regarded as hypertension. Other possible complications such as respiratory depression, allergic reactions, coughing, gagging, dizziness, restlessness, headache, nausea, and vomiting were recorded and managed accordingly. For example, IV ondansetron 4 mg was given as a rescue antiemetic.</p><p>In the recovery room, all vital signs were recorded every 5 min and pain score (VAS) was measured every 20 min. Patients whose VAS was more than 3 received an IV infusion of acetaminophen 1 g (Perfalgan&#x02122;, Bristol&#x02013;Myer's Squibb). The total amount of acetaminophen given as a rescue analgesic was recorded. Any adverse effects such as restlessness, dizziness, headache, nausea, and vomiting were recorded and managed accordingly.</p><p>Criteria for discharge from the PACU were full consciousness, hemodynamic stability, and the absence of significant pain, nausea, and/or vomiting. The procedure time (measured from initiation of PCB until the end of oocyte retrieval) and the time of PACU stay (measured from the end of oocyte retrieval until patient's transfer to the ward) were recorded. Before discharge to the ward, patient's satisfaction was assessed using the 7-point Likert scale:[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] 1 = extremely dissatisfied, 2 = dissatisfied, 3 = somewhat dissatisfied, 4 = undecided, 5 = somewhat satisfied, 6 = satisfied, and 7 = extremely satisfied.</p><p>The number of oocytes obtained, embryos transferred per patient, and percentage of pregnancy per embryo transferred were all registered.</p><p>The sample size was calculated according to a confidence interval of 95% and power of the test of 80%; considering the primary outcome of this study as the length of PACU stay. Based on a previous investigation, 20 patients per group was the minimum sample size required to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in the duration of PACU stay. In our study, we included 52 patients, 26 in each group.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS program version 19 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.) and EP16 program.
