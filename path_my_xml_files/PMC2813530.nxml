While psychotherapy is an effective treatment for depression, not all individuals benefit. We examined whether baseline social support might differentially affect treatment outcome in 127 participants with MS and depression randomized to either Telephone-administered Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (T-CBT) or Telephone-administered Emotion-Focused Therapy (T-EFT). We predicted that those with low social support would improve more in T-EFT, since this approach emphasizes the therapeutic relationship, while participants with strong social networks and presumably more emotional resources might fare better in the more structured and demanding T-CBT. We found that both level of received support and satisfaction with that support at baseline did moderate treatment outcome. Individuals with high social support showed a greater reduction in depressive symptoms in the T-CBT as predicted, but participants with low social support showed a similar reduction in both treatments. This suggests that for participants with high social support, CBT may be a more beneficial treatment for depression compared with EFT.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Social support</kwd><kwd>Depression</kwd><kwd>Multiple sclerosis</kwd><kwd>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</kwd><kwd>Emotion-Focused Therapy</kwd><kwd>Treatment outcome</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and disabling autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. The disease can produce a wide variety of symptoms, including impaired motor function or feeling in limbs, debilitating fatigue, pain, loss of bowel or bladder control, sexual dysfunction, blindness due to optic neuritis, impaired cognitive functioning and emotional symptoms (Goodkin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1992</xref>; Mohr and Cox <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2001</xref>). Depression is common&#x02014;individuals with MS have a lifetime risk of major depressive disorder of over 50% (Patten et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2003</xref>; Sadovnick et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">1996</xref>; Schubert and Foliart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">1993</xref>)&#x02014;and depression is likely both a primary symptom of MS and secondary to the unpredictability and impairment of the disease. Depression not only exacerbates functional impairment in patients (Mohr et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2007</xref>), there is also evidence that it also increases inflammatory processes in MS (Gold and Irwin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2006</xref>; Mohr et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">b</xref>).</p><p>Both psychotherapy and antidepressant medications have been shown to be effective in reducing depression in patients with MS (Foley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1987</xref>; Mohr et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2000b</xref>). One issue MS patients face, however, is difficulty in accessing mental health care, particularly psychotherapy. Like many other people living with chronic illness, MS patients face fatigue and mobility issues that can make it difficult for them to physically get to regular appointments. Telephone therapy may help overcome some of the barriers to direct care that people with chronic medical conditions often face (Mohr et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2006</xref>). Telephone therapy has been found to be an effective modality for delivering depression treatment in several studies (Miller and Weissman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2002</xref>; Mohr et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2005</xref>; Sandgren and McCaul <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2003</xref>; Simon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2004</xref>). In fact, a recent study found that telephone therapy was as effective as face-to-face therapy in the treatment of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (Lovell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2006</xref>).</p><p>But while the telephone administration of psychotherapy for depression may overcome certain barriers to care, there remains the vexing problem that even the most effective depression treatments (no matter how they are delivered) fail to help a large percentage of the patients in randomized control trials&#x02014;25&#x02013;50% do not show improvement at post-treatment, and among those who do improve, many relapse by the 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;year follow-ups (DeRubeis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2005</xref>; Westen and Morrison <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2001</xref>). This may partly be due to the fact that different patients may fare better in one type of treatment over another, depending on individual characteristics and factors. The key to improving outcome, then, is to better match patients to particular treatments. In searching for variables that may differentially affect outcome in one depression approach versus another, social support stands out as a likely treatment outcome moderator.</p><p>There is a well-documented literature establishing a relationship between social support and depression. In naturalistic studies it has been found that lower levels of social support are associated with higher levels of depression (for a review, see Bagby et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2002</xref>; Brugha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1987</xref>; Grant et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2006</xref>). Others have described the lack of a social support structure as an important vulnerability factor for depression in both healthy (Bosworth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2002</xref>; Bromberger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1994</xref>; Ezquiaga et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1998</xref>; Vanderhorst and McLaren <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2005</xref>) and medically ill populations (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2006</xref>; Revenson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1991</xref>). Some studies also suggest that social support positively predicts better treatment outcome in depression. In several controlled trials for inpatient treatment of depression, higher levels of social support predicted improvement (George et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1989</xref>; Keitner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1997</xref>; Nasser and Overholser <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2005</xref>; Szadoczky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2004</xref>). Others have reported similar results in outpatients who received either psychopharmacological interventions or psychotherapy for depression (Ezquiaga et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1998</xref>; Lyness et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2006</xref>; Oxman and Hull <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2001</xref>).</p><p>However, studies do not show a uniformly positive relationship between social support and improvement in depression in treatment outcome research (Beekman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1997</xref>; Paykel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1996</xref>), suggesting that the relationship of social support to outcome may vary with the treatment approach. In a study by Helgeson and colleagues, individuals with high levels of social support fared less well in a peer support group than did those who reported low levels of social support at baseline (Helgeson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2000</xref>). One explanation for this finding is that those with low social support benefited more from group therapy than their high social support cohorts because the treatment provides what these individuals lack&#x02014;group members&#x02019; empathy and support. In the realm of individual therapy, some theoretical approaches place a heavy emphasis on the therapeutic relationship, and it is possible that individuals with low social support might benefit more from the direct support provided by these depression treatments compared with more practical, skill-building approaches such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Those with high social support, on the other hand, may have more emotional resources to take on the challenging tasks of CBT including doing homework, testing out new behaviors, and developing new skills.</p><p>In the current study, we tested whether social support moderates outcome in two telephone treatments targeting depressive symptoms in patients with MS: Telephone-administered Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (T-CBT) and Telephone-administered Emotion-Focused Therapy (T-EFT). T-EFT is based on Greenberg&#x02019;s Process-Experiential therapy manual (Greenberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1993</xref>), and is a humanistic approach that emphasizes using the therapeutic bond to help patients express and process emotional material. T-EFT also includes specific interventions that target self-criticism and dependence, which can interfere with relationships and social support. While the therapeutic alliance between the therapist and patient is an important factor in T-CBT as well (Beckner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2007</xref>), T-CBT is highly structured and session time is focused on teaching communication and problem-solving skills, fatigue management planning, and cognitive restructuring of depressogenic automatic thoughts and beliefs. We predicted that MS patients with low levels of received social support and low satisfaction with that support at baseline would improve more in the T-EFT condition, while patients who score high on these baseline social support variables would do preferentially well in the T-CBT condition. We looked at both level of received social support and satisfaction with that support separately, given that these constructs are conceptually unique (i.e., one may have large social network but feel unhappy with the quality of that support). Several studies have also found that satisfaction with support (quality) may be a better predictor of depression outcome than quantity of support received (Beedie and Kennedy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2002</xref>; Rintala et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">1992</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study is a secondary analysis from a randomized clinical trial examining telephone-administered psychotherapy treatments for depression among patients with multiple sclerosis (please see Mohr et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2005</xref> for additional details regarding methods and primary treatment outcomes).</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited to participate in a telephone-administered depression treatment by letter to Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Group of Northern California members and advertising and outreach through regional chapters of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. All potential participants were verbally consented over the telephone prior to a screening interview. If after the initial screening process participants were still eligible to participate, they were mailed a written consent before being more thoroughly assessed on all inclusion and exclusion criteria. The consent process was approved by the Human Subjects Review Committees of both the University of California at San Francisco and Kaiser Permanente. Participants were paid $10.00 to $50.00 per assessment, depending on the length of the assessment.</p><p>Inclusion criteria included: (1) a neurologist confirmed diagnosis of MS, (2) functional impairment resulting in limitations in activity as measured by a score of at least 3 (out of a total of 6) on one or more functional areas assessed by the Guy&#x02019;s Neurological Disability Scale (Sharrack and Hughes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1999</xref>), (3) a score of at least 16 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II, Beck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1996</xref>) and at least 14 on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D, Hamilton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1960</xref>), (4) ability to speak and read English, (5) at least age 18.

Use of antidepressant medications was not exclusionary.</p><p>Among the 748 participants who completed a telephone screen, 223 were eligible for and agreed to a complete eligibility assessment. Of those, 150 were found to be eligible for randomization, though 23 (15.3%) refused to be randomized. Therefore, 127 participants were randomized: 62 were assigned to the T-CBT condition and 65 were assigned to the T-EFT condition. There were 3 participants in the T-CBT condition and four in the T-EFT condition who dropped out of treatment; of those, 2 in the T-CBT condition and 3 in the T-EFT condition completed the remaining assessments. Two participants discontinued assessments once treatment was completed in the T-CBT condition, and 3 in the T-EFT condition.</p><p>The final intent-to-treat sample of 127 was largely female (77%) and Caucasian (90%), with 5% African American, 1.5% Hispanic, and about 1% Asian. The gender and ethnicity of the sample reflects the epidemiology of multiple sclerosis, which largely afflicts women and Caucasians. The mean age of participants was 47.96 (SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10.10).

While CBT and EFT both include many &#x0201c;non-specific&#x0201d; characteristics of therapy (active listening by the therapist, a supportive therapeutic relationship), each had their own unique therapeutic interventions (see below).

We have developed a participant workbook to guide the treatment (Mohr et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2000a</xref>). The manual included five chapters that are used by all participants which focused on teaching the participants methods to identify and modify depressogenic thoughts, increase the number pleasant activities in their life, enhance effective problem solving, and manage interpersonal difficulties (through improving communication skills and increasing social support). There were also 11 optional modules for specific problems such as fatigue management and sexual difficulties. The participants worked with their therapist to identify areas they believe to be particularly problematic from these 11 modules, and to focus on and apply the skills learned in every day settings. The T-CBT manual did not include interventions specific to T-EFT (below), such as having patients focus on deepening their emotional experience by forming an image of the emotion and describing it&#x02019;s shape, color, and so on.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Telephone-administered Emotion Focused Therapy (T-EFT)</title><p>T-EFT is a manualized process-experiential therapy developed by Greenberg and adapted for this study (Greenberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1993</xref>). The approach was chosen because of its emphasis on non-CBT components, including a primary focus on empathic attunement and the facilitation of communicating emotional experience in the moment. T-EFT emphasizes the creation of a genuine, supportive and validating therapeutic relationship as the necessary condition for using process interventions aimed at carefully exploring emotional experience. Through careful attunement to affective material in the moment, T-EFT therapists help clients work though emotional difficulties presumed to underlie depression. In the current study, T-EFT therapists were instructed to avoid interventions that focused on modifying cognitions, behaviors, or skill attainment, to minimize the overlap between the two approaches. Some of the processes used in Greenberg&#x02019;s original treatment, such as empty chair and two-chair work, were impossible given that the therapy was conducted over the phone.

Both level of received support and satisfaction with support had good reliability (level of received support, &#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.87; satisfaction with that support, &#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.84).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Depression severity</title><p>Depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline and post-treatment using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II, Beck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1996</xref>) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D, Hamilton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1960</xref>). The BDI-II is a 21-item self-report measure of depression, which is both widely used and reliable. In addition, the BDI-II is not confounded with MS symptom severity (Aikens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1999</xref>; Moran and Mohr <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2005</xref>). The HAM-D is a 17-item semi-structured interview that was adapted for use over the telephone (Potts et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1990</xref>). Raters were trained by listening to previous tapes and engaging in mock interviews.

Because demographics and disease related variables are not specifically relevant to the question, are unrelated to baseline social support variables, and are known not to affect these outcomes (Mohr et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2005</xref>), they were not included in the analyses. This reduces the risk of spurious findings related to overfitting regression models (Babyak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2004</xref>).</p><p>Each social support measure (level of received support and satisfaction with support) was tested separately. Baseline depression was entered first to control for depression severity at the start of treatment, given that it was a significant predictor of end of treatment depression in every model (<italic>p</italic>s&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;0.01). Baseline social support was entered next, followed by treatment assignment, and finally the cross-product of treatment condition and social support at baseline. The direction of the interaction in significant models was explored using scatter plots of the unstandardized predicted value from the interaction model and the social support variable at baseline. Examination of the moderation effect was also done within each treatment condition for each social support outcome found to have a significant moderation effect with treatment. The main effect model was tested separately within the T-EFT and T-CBT conditions to determine the relationship between baseline social support and depression outcome within each treatment condition, controlling for baseline depression level.</p><p>Results of the analyses are displayed in Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>.

However, the two social support variables did appear to moderate treatment outcome for depression. First, a significant interaction between <italic>level of</italic><italic>received support</italic> and treatment was found when predicting end of treatment residualized BDI-II and HAM-D scores (<italic>p</italic>s&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.03). The meaning of these interactions was examined using separate regressions within each treatment condition, as displayed in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. For participants assigned to the T-CBT condition, higher baseline received support was associated with lower residualized end-of-treatment BDI-II and HAM-D scores (&#x003b2;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x02212;0.33 and &#x003b2;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x02212;0.35, respectively, <italic>p</italic>s&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;0.01).

We found that both the level of social support participants reported receiving at baseline, as well as their satisfaction with that support, moderated treatment outcome among participants with MS and depression. Specifically, individuals with higher levels of received support and satisfaction with their social support network showed greater reductions in depressive symptoms when enrolled in T-CBT compared with T-EFT. Participants with low social support at baseline improved similarly in both treatments. This suggests that depression outcomes do vary depending on baseline levels of social support and treatment type, but that the important differences are only seen in participants with high social support. These results have important implications for matching participants to treatments. For participants with high social support, CBT may be a more beneficial treatment for depression than emotion-focused therapy. These results need to be replicated, however, given recent findings that challenge the robustness of interaction findings (Risch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2009</xref>).</p><p>While the data supported our prediction that those with high social support would see greater reductions in depression with a cognitive-behavioral approach compared with an experiential emotion-focused approach, there are several possible explanations for this finding. Our hypothesis was based on the idea that individuals with a strong social network do not need the supportive &#x0201c;ear&#x0201d; of a therapist in the same way that those with little social support do. They already have empathetic people in their life; what they need to do is make some behavioral changes to break the depression cycle (i.e., challenge negative interpretations, engage in pleasurable activities, etc.). We also suspect that high social support may be a &#x0201c;marker&#x0201d; for certain skills or traits that facilitate improvement in T-CBT, such as greater openness to trying new behaviors, or more cognitive resources for learning new skills. Additional research is needed to investigate these or other possible explanations.</p><p>In contrast, we expected that participants with lower baseline levels of social support (both level of received and satisfaction with that support) would improve more in the T-EFT treatment. Because the T-EFT intervention focuses specifically on the therapeutic relationship&#x02014;encouraging clients to express and explore emotional issues within the context of this safe and empathetic bond&#x02014;we expected that this approach would fill an important social support gap for those who lack family and friends with whom they can talk to. The data did not support this hypothesis: participants low in social support improved similarly in both treatment groups.</p><p>There are a number of ways to interpret this outcome. It may be that while the T-CBT therapists are focused more on education and skills training, they are also providing a supportive bond within the therapeutic relationship. Indeed, evidence suggests that the therapeutic alliance is as strong between clients and therapists using a cognitive-behavioral approach compared to therapists using various process-oriented approaches that specifically emphasize the therapeutic bond (Beckner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2007</xref>). An alternative interpretation is that among participants with low social support, similar levels of improvement resulted for different therapeutic processes. For example, those who received T-EFT may have responded positively to the focus on the therapy relationship, while those in the T-CBT may have benefited from the CBT skills training. No matter what the explanation, however, it is clear that for participants who entered the study with a weak social network, it didn&#x02019;t matter which treatment they received: both reduced depression similarly.</p><p>An important caveat is that that all of the participants were managing a chronic, debilitating medical illness. Social support may interact with depression in a unique way within certain medical populations, like MS. While short-term illness often elicits social support, chronic illness can exhaust people&#x02019;s network and strain relations with family and close friends, leading to isolation or less satisfaction with one&#x02019;s social support. Physical symptoms and related disability can also make attending social activities difficult. Participants in this study all had at least one symptom that impaired their daily functioning (i.e., mobility issues, fatigue, etc.) that could have impacted social relationships. It is therefore difficult to know whether the findings in this study would generalize to individuals in good health or without a disability.</p><p>It is also important to consider the fact that both treatments in this study were delivered over the phone. While the data indicates that both T-CBT and T-EFT are effective in reducing depression (see Mohr et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2005</xref>), it is difficult to know whether the interaction of social support with the treatments was affected by their mode of delivery. There is evidence that good rapport was established and maintained in therapy, and did not differ between conditions (Beckner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2007</xref>). However, non-verbal communication may be essential to fully facilitate the emotional processing that is the core of Emotion-Focused Therapy. It remains an empirical question whether those with low social support might indeed benefit more from an experiential approach emphasizing the therapeutic relationship if it was delivered face-to-face.</p><p>In summary, if our findings are confirmed in subsequent research, it may be important in treating depression in people with chronic illness that their baseline level of social support is assessed prior to selecting a treatment approach. Although our study suggests that individuals who report low social support may do just as well in a variety of treatments, this does not appear to be the case for individuals with MS who entered treatment for depression with a relatively strong social support network. Matching these individuals with a CBT based treatment may significantly improve the likelihood of a positive outcome.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Open Access</title><p>This article is
