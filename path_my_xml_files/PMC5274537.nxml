No experimental trials have investigated the impact of Housing First on adherence among patients with schizophrenia. We investigated whether Housing First in congregate and scattered-site configurations resulted in superior adherence compared to usual care. Adult participants (<italic>n</italic> = 165) met criteria for homelessness, schizophrenia, and initiation of antipsychotic pharmacotherapy prior to recruitment to an unblinded, 3-arm randomized controlled trial in Vancouver, Canada. Randomization arms were: congregate Housing First (CHF) with on-site supports (including physician and pharmacy services); scattered-site Housing First (SHF) with Assertive Community Treatment; or treatment as usual (TAU) consisting of existing services. Participants were followed for an average of 2.6 years. Adherence to antipsychotic medication was measured using the medication possession ratio (MPR), and 1-way ANOVA was used to compare outcomes between the 3 conditions. Data were drawn from comprehensive pharmacy records. Prior to randomization, mean MPR among participants was very low (0.44&#x02013;0.48). Mean MPR in the follow-up period was significantly different between study arms (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001) and approached the guideline threshold of 0.80 in SHF. Compared to TAU, antipsychotic adherence was significantly higher in SHF but not in CHF. The results demonstrate that further implementation of SHF is indicated among homeless people with schizophrenia, and that urgent action is needed to address very low levels of antipsychotic adherence in this population (trial registration: ISRCTN57595077).</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>homelessness</kwd><kwd>medication possession ratio</kwd><kwd>Assertive Community Treatment</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-id">Mental Health Commission of Canada</named-content></funding-source><award-id>2009s0231</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-id">Canadian Institutes of Health Research</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-id">Wellcome Trust</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</named-content></funding-source><award-id>095806</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Serving homeless people with psychiatric disorders is a complex and global challenge. Reports released prior to the current refugee crisis estimated that more than 400000 people in the European Union were homeless on any given night,<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and another 700000 in the United States and Canada.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The prevalence of schizophrenia among the homeless has been estimated at approximately 11%.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>Poor adherence to antipsychotic medication is a significant problem among homeless people,<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> leading to increased risk of relapse, hospitalization and suicide,<sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> arrest, violence and victimization,<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and greater overall public costs.<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Duration of homelessness is significantly associated with suboptimal adherence to prescribed antipsychotic regimens.<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Current antipsychotic treatment protocols provide little guidance on how to care for individuals who are concurrently homeless and seriously mentally ill.</p><p>Housing First,<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> a housing-based intervention implemented throughout the United States, Canada, and several European countries, prioritizes rapid, low-barrier (nonabstinence based) re-housing for individuals who are chronically homeless and who experience serious psychiatric illness (eg, schizophrenia), problematic substance use, and/or compromised physical health. Support services are delivered using a case management model that tailors services to individual client needs. Housing First has been implemented using both &#x0201c;scattered-site&#x0201d; market housing<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> (where clients are offered a choice of individual market rental units) as well as &#x0201c;single-site&#x0201d; or congregate configurations<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> (where clients reside in separate units within a single housing project).</p><p>Some evidence suggests that Assertive Community Treatment (ACT)&#x02014;the case management model integral to scattered-site Housing First (SHF)&#x02014;may be effective at increasing adherence to antipsychotics among homeless and precariously housed individuals.<sup><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;15</xref></sup> Moreover, experimental research on congregate-style supportive housing (with on-site supports) found significant improvement in clinical symptoms among severely mentally ill people at high risk of homelessness compared against community market housing with mobile ACT supports.<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The authors suggested that this outcome may have been attributable to improvements in medication adherence, although medication use was not measured directly.</p><p>No randomized controlled trial has evaluated the impact of either congregate Housing First (CHF) or SHF on adherence to antipsychotics among formerly homeless adults with psychotic disorders. The current analysis used comprehensive administrative data and a randomized controlled design in the context of comprehensive prescription drug coverage to investigate the impact of both these models on antipsychotic medication adherence compared to treatment as usual (TAU) among homeless adults diagnosed with schizophrenia. We used a 3-arm design, comprised of SHF with ACT, CHF with on-site supports, and TAU. We hypothesized that both formats of Housing First would be associated with significantly higher rates of adherence to antipsychotic medication than TAU.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Study Design and Participants</title><p>This study was reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Board at Simon Fraser University. Participants were enrolled in the Vancouver At Home study: Housing First plus ACT vs CHF plus supports vs TAU (ISRCTN57595077)&#x02014;a 3-arm, randomized controlled trial involving homeless mentally ill adults. Randomization was performed using a centralized computer-generated procedure. Interviewers uploaded data on laptop computers with live connections and received randomization results. Following baseline interviews, participants randomized to SHF or CHF were immediately directed to appropriate service representatives. Further details of the Vancouver At Home protocol, including measures and procedures not included in this study, have been published separately.<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p>For the purposes of the current study, participants were asked to provide separate written informed consent for researchers to receive administrative data, including prescription details. A baseline interview collected self-reported participant history and sociodemographic details (eg, gender, ethnicity, health status, duration of homelessness, etc.). The Multnomah Community Ability Scale<sup><xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and the SF-12 Health Survey<sup><xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> were also administered to assess illness severity and functional health and well-being. Participants received a stipend ($25.00) for the baseline interview.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Recruitment and Eligibility</title><p>Recruitment involved community agencies serving homeless and mentally ill individuals in Vancouver. Eligible participants were Canadian citizens (eligibility for public benefits received by participants [eg, financial assistance, healthcare, and prescription medications] requires Canadian citizenship), at least 19 years of age, who met criteria for homelessness or precarious housing, and current mental disorder status.<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p>Inclusion criteria specific to the current study included consent for researchers to access administrative data and linkable health records, and participant initiation of antipsychotic pharmacotherapy prior to study recruitment. In order to increase the probability of recruiting participants under current treatment, eligibility was limited to those with physician-diagnosed schizophrenia (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision&#x02014;Administrative [Medical Services Plan] records in British Columbia are based on ICD-9 codes, all diagnoses beginning with code 295), in the 10-year period prior to randomization. Previous studies support the validity of administrative data in relation to diagnoses of schizophrenia.<sup><xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Interventions</title><p>Two Housing First interventions were compared to TAU. Both interventions satisfied formal fidelity assessments administered by an independent team led by staff from Pathways to Housing in New York.<sup><xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p>The SHF condition provided participants with a choice of single occupancy market-based apartments throughout the city of Vancouver, with home-based support from a psychiatrist-led, multidisciplinary ACT team available 24/7. Other than once-weekly meetings with the team, there were no requirements concerning treatment compliance or abstinence from substance use.</p><p>The CHF condition was implemented in a former hotel where participants had their own rooms, but without full kitchens. On-site, 24/7, multidisciplinary supports were provided by an existing agency with longstanding experience delivering harm reduction services (eg, needle exchange, supervised injection site, low-barrier housing, etc.) in Vancouver&#x02019;s Downtown Eastside. CHF also provided recreational activities, communal meals, and vocational opportunities associated with daily operation of the facility (eg, laundry, cleaning). Front-desk staff continuously monitored the building and arrival/departure of guests to ensure the safety and security of residents. A medical examination room and pharmacy were also located on-site.</p><p>Individuals randomized to TAU did not receive housing supports and services through the study but were followed in the same manner as other study participants by members of the research team. The majority of participants randomized to TAU resided in the Downtown Eastside, a neighborhood well known for its concentration of health and social services targeted to the needs of homeless of people in Vancouver.<sup><xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> These include housing units with varying levels of support, (eg, emergency shelters, single-room-occupancy hotels, purpose-built social housing units), meal programs, outreach services, HIV/AIDS and methadone treatment, drop-in centers, needle exchange, a supervised injection site, detox/recovery centers, and advocacy services.</p><p>All study participants, including those randomized to TAU, had free access to healthcare and all prescribed antipsychotic medication. Cost was not a barrier to pharmacological treatment. Research detailing components of the 3 treatment conditions has been published elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Outcome Measures</title><sec id="s7"><title>Medication Possession Ratio.</title><p>Patient-specific medication details were drawn from a province-wide database (PharmaNet; see <uri xlink:href="http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/health-drug-coverage/pharmacare-for-bc-residents/pharmanet">http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/health-drug-coverage/pharmacare-for-bc-residents/pharmanet</uri>) that records every prescription dispensed in British Columbia. PharmaNet has previously been shown to accurately reflect medication adherence for most patients.<sup><xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>Expert consensus guidelines define acceptable adherence to antipsychotics as taking medication at least 80% of the time for which it is prescribed.<sup><xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> We operationalized adherence using the medication possession ratio (MPR), which represents the percentage of time a given patient was dispensed prescribed medication (ie, number of days of medication supplied within refill interval divided by the total number of days in refill interval). The MPR is the preferred measure of adherence using administrative data<sup><xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and should be analyzed as a continuous variable<sup><xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> to minimize bias.<sup><xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> The MPR is also a valid correlate of important patient outcomes,<sup><xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> including psychiatric hospital admission among patients with schizophrenia.<sup><xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p><p>The observation period we used to assess adherence to antipsychotic medication consisted of the length of time between the date of participant randomization (October 2009 to June 2011) and the study end date (March 31, 2013) or date of death. Accordingly, follow-up time varied between participants. MPR was calculated using number of days for which antipsychotics were prescribed during the follow-up period as the numerator, and the total postrandomization period (from randomization to study end date/death) as the denominator. Receipt of more than one antipsychotic prescription on any given day (antipsychotic polypharmacy) did not result in double counting or inflation of MPR (ie, upper bound = 1.0). Although participants may have received more than one antipsychotic agent over time, the current analysis did not focus on changes in medication regimen during the follow-up period.</p><p>Treatment guidelines recommend uninterrupted antipsychotic use up to 3 years following a first episode of psychosis, and indefinite prescription where clinically indicated.<sup><xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Because the current analysis selected individuals who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia prior to recruitment, and whose psychiatric symptoms were associated with long-term homelessness, we assumed that participants were in continuous need of their medications. This assumption conforms to the current standard of care of long-term antipsychotic use for maintenance therapy for schizophrenia,<sup><xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> and to findings of a recently published review demonstrating that continuous antipsychotic use still outweighs the benefits of discontinuation.<sup><xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p><p>MPR in the prerandomization period was calculated using the same procedure as described above. A list of antipsychotic medications prescribed to participants in the pre- and postperiods is provided separately (see supplementary table 1).</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Sociodemographic Variables.</title><p>Sociodemographic variables used in this study were collected via self-report at the baseline interview (prerandomization). These included: age (at recruitment and at first episode of homelessness), gender, ethnicity, education, marital status, chronic health conditions, blood-borne infectious diseases, and lifetime duration of homelessness. Age of participants was treated as a continuous variable. Ethnicity was collapsed into 3 groups: White, Aboriginal (including Inuit, Metis, First Nations Status, First Nations Non-Status, and Indigenous from outside Canada), and Other (including Asian, Black, Latin American, Indian-Caribbean, Middle Eastern, or other category). Education level was defined as highest level of formal education obtained at the time of recruitment and dichotomized into complete vs incomplete high school. Lifetime duration of homelessness was dichotomized using the median value and analyzed as a categorical variable.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s9"><title>Sample Size Calculation</title><p>Examination of mental health services, including medications, was a secondary outcome analysis of the parent study, involving only those participants who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and prescribed antipsychotics prior to recruitment. The parent study was powered to detect differences between groups on the primary outcome variable, housing stability.<sup><xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Previous studies using MPR as a measure of adherence to antipsychotic medications in comparable samples report a SD of approximately 0.29.<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> For the current secondary analysis, we anticipated that a moderate effect size (Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic> = 0.6, equivalent to a 17% difference) would be clinically meaningful. Based on this effect size with alpha level of .05, we estimated that 45 participants in each treatment arm would be sufficient to yield an 80% power to reject the null hypothesis of no effect in 2-sided statistical tests. We anticipated zero attrition due to the use of administrative data. No adjustment for multiplicity was made due to the exploratory nature of our outcome analysis.<sup><xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37&#x02013;41</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Continuous variables (eg, age and MPR) were presented using descriptive statistics (mean with SD or median with interquartile range as appropriate).

Randomization to CHF was also associated with an increase in MPR, although the difference was not statistically significant. To our knowledge, this study is the first randomized controlled trial to examine the impact of housing interventions on adherence to antipsychotic medication in a sample of homeless adults with psychotic disorders.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that Housing First in market rental accommodations with ACT can effectively increase antipsychotic adherence to recommended levels among people who were homeless and diagnosed with schizophrenia. This finding adds to the demonstrated effectiveness of ACT with this population<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> and supports the use of scattered-site housing as described by Pathways to Housing.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>Numerous studies have reported benefits of SHF for people with serious mental illness who experienced homelessness, including improved residential stability<sup><xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> and reduced service costs.<sup><xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> Previously reported findings from the Vancouver At Home study (the parent study for the current trial) have shown that, compared to TAU, participants assigned to SHF spent more days stably housed,<sup><xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> experienced better community integration,<sup><xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> and had significantly fewer criminal convictions<sup><xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> and emergency department visits<sup><xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> than those assigned to TAU. Similar differences were not observed between CHF and TAU, and these findings may be a function of clinical improvements that were specific to SHF.</p><p>Access to medications has been identified as a potentially important factor contributing to adherence to psychotropic prescriptions among homeless veterans.<sup><xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> However, the CHF condition in the current trial (which included an on-site pharmacy) resulted in little evidence of superior antipsychotic adherence. The number of antipsychotic-related pharmacy transactions per person-year in CHF and SHF (167.3 and 180.2, respectively) were both higher than in TAU (98.9). The relatively high overall frequency of antipsychotic-related pharmacy transactions may have been medically advised to help ensure that clients neither lost nor forgot to take their medications. The fact that MPR was significantly higher in SHF suggests that improving adherence to antipsychotic medication in this population involves factors beyond access to medical resources. Important considerations include patient attitudes to medications, as well as clinical priorities and attitudes of prescribing physicians.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that usual services and supports available to homeless people with schizophrenia in Vancouver were associated with low rates of antipsychotic adherence. The observed MPR (0.55 in the postperiod) in TAU was substantially below consensus guidelines. Suboptimal adherence and consequent symptom persistence are associated with a range of adverse outcomes, including impaired functioning, self-neglect, and decreased quality of life,<sup><xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> which may prevent access to services and supports needed to maintain health and overcome homelessness. These findings reinforce the importance of further expanding Housing First with ACT. They also underscore the need for immediate action to increase antipsychotic adherence among those who remain homeless while living with schizophrenia. One example of a potentially promising practice in this context is providing patients with financial incentives.<sup><xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup></p><p>Although self-report remains the most common method of assessing medication adherence,<sup><xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup> the predictive validity of subjective adherence measures is poor.<sup><xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup> Administrative data from a robust surveillance system, universal drug coverage, and no loss to follow-up are strengths of the current study. Nonetheless, some limitations should be considered.</p><p>MPR is an approximation of adherence behavior. Unlike directly observed therapy, MPR does not provide information on actual medication consumption. Use of pharmacy records may overestimate patient adherence, particularly as we did not account for hospitalization days in our analysis, although our use of a relatively long timeframe (&#x0003e;2.5 y) limits this potential for upward bias.<sup><xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup> Moreover, MPR does not differentiate between monotherapy and polypharmacy. This is potentially problematic, as antipsychotic polypharmacy is associated with refractory symptoms<sup><xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup> and greater illness severity.<sup><xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref></sup></p><p>Circumstances associated with homelessness and street involvement (eg, lack of proper storage and routine, vulnerability to theft, etc.) may contribute to upward bias in MPR. In the current study, this potential would have been greatest among participants in TAU, as those in CHF and SHF were housed. Accordingly, upward bias of MPR in the current analysis likely contributed to even greater treatment effect.</p><p>Treatment interventions in SHF and CHF satisfied independent and detailed fidelity assessments, and support services in both groups were designed to be comparable in intensity and composition (ie, supports were delivered by multidisciplinary teams and available 24/7). However, it is possible that differences in clinical style arose and are unaccounted for in these analyses. Given their longstanding involvement with harm reduction services prior to this study, CHF support staff may have emphasized these principles (eg, greater tolerance for substance use/abuse).</p><p>The vast majority of participants were recruited from Vancouver&#x02019;s Downtown Eastside. Individuals randomized to SHF were subject to norms established in existing market accommodations, where they could comprise at most 20% of the tenants in any single building.<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Those randomized to CHF were housed among other study participants and may have been more likely to carry forward norms derived from their previous neighborhood. This may have resulted in substantially different sociocultural norms and living environments between the 2 treatment conditions, with associated differences in resident behavior, motivation, and adherence.</p><p>We are not able to attribute differences in MPR to housing/support models alone. For instance, random assignment to a preferred treatment condition may promote treatment adherence and positive outcomes, while assignment to a less-preferred condition might limit motivation.<sup><xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup> Some evidence suggests that homeless consumers of mental health services&#x02014;when given a choice&#x02014;prefer market-based, independent tenancies without on-site services to congregate-style accommodations.<sup><xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></sup> However, other research found that individual housing preferences may have little influence on clinical outcomes, per se.<sup><xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></sup> Baseline participant preferences in our trial were not measured. The current findings contribute to the development of hypotheses for future trials. Research is needed to investigate the mechanisms that contribute to improvements in adherence and to examine the relationship between antipsychotic adherence and previously reported benefits of Housing First.</p></sec><sec id="s16"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Homeless participants with schizophrenia randomized to SHF exhibited significantly higher antipsychotic medication adherence&#x02014;approaching guideline levels&#x02014;than those in TAU. There were no significant differences between CHF and TAU, with both groups exhibiting very low adherence. Merely increasing access to medications, such as the provision of an on-site pharmacy, may not be sufficient to cause significant improvement in adherence. Further implementation of market-based housing with ACT is indicated as a means of increasing adherence to antipsychotic treatment among homeless people with schizophrenia.</p></sec><sec id="s17"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>Schizophrenia Bulletin</italic> online.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by the Mental Health Commission of Canada (2009s0231).
