Sixty-four hospitalized patients with gastro-intestinal disease who undertook curative gastro intestinal resection were studied prospectively and administered with TPN solutions. Three types of commercially available TPN products were assigned randomly to eligible patients. Serial studies of blood acid-base status, serum electrolytes, and urinary acid-base status were conducted in the three groups administered with different TPN solutions. Patients received appropriate electrolytic solutions on the operation day and TPN solution from 2 to 7 days after operation. There were no differences among any of the serum electrolytes in the three groups. In one group, urinary pH decreased slightly and urinary net acid excretion (NAE) increased significantly after administration. This TPN product contains about 40&#x000a0;mEq/L of non-metabolizable acid to avoid the Maillard reaction that produces a complex of glucose and amino acids. Urinary NAE did not change in the other two groups. These TPN products do not use non-metabolizable acid to adjust pH. The present results suggest that the non-metabolizable acid may be a risk factor of metabolic acidosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>acidosis</kwd><kwd>total parenteral nutrition</kwd><kwd>Maillard reaction</kwd><kwd>acid-base imbalance</kwd><kwd>Humans</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is well known that malnutrition generates a predisposition for postoperative complications, increased incidence of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], and prolonged hospital stays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Metabolic disturbances occur in malnourished patients undergoing major surgery and patients with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Acid-base imbalance, <italic>i.e.</italic>, metabolic acidosis resulting from infusates of intravenous nutrition, is observed frequently during TPN therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Further acidosis occurs because of metabolic abnormalities, such as thiamine deficiency, and an excess of lactic acid induced by the bolus injection of D-fructose, as well as an excess infusion of anionic components such as chloride salts provided by the administration of synthetic L-amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Moreover, acidosis could be related to either the excess amount of titratable acidity in the infusates or hydrogen ions released by the metabolism of nitrogen sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The problem may be overcome by the use of thiamine hydrochloride, management of the infusion rate, or adding free salts or acetate of cationic amino acid to the preparation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. However, even with such interventions hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis has been reported during TPN therapy in Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Previously, it was reported that the acid load with hydrochloric acid in TPN solutions may cause severe hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis in rabbits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], although acetic acid may not produce acidemia for patients, because hydrogen ions from the acetic acid are neutralized by bicarbonate ions generated from the metabolism of acetate ions. However, this hypothesis has not yet been proven by clinical research. In addition, the regulation of the kind or the amount of acid for adjusting the pH is not prescribed by the guidelines of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) or the Japanese Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (JSPEN).</p><p>This study investigated the effects of three types of commercial TPN products on plasma acid-base balance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>The study was approved by the institutional review board of Nagoya University Hospital, and the patients gave written informed consent before enrollment. It was assumed that the annual incidence of acidosis was lower than 5%. In this situation, the sample size was calculated by the coordinator of the Critical Appraisal Skills Program JAPAN (CASPjp: http://caspjp.umin.ac.jp). Patients with gastrointestinal carcinoma who had undergone curative resection, such as gastrectomy, proctocolectomy, or cholecystectomy, and were admitted to the first surgical unit of Nagoya University Hospital were enrolled. Because patients with renal dysfunction may have an increased risk of acidosis, those with renal insufficiency (50&#x000a0;mL/min: calculated creatinine clearance using the Cockcroft-Gault formula) were excluded. Patients with metabolic acidosis or pulmonary complications were also excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Nutritional management</title><p>All patients were managed according to a standard treatment protocol. Central venous catheters were placed and all patients received a crystalloid infusion (4.5% dextrose and 0.2% sodium chloride fluid: Solita T3&#x000ae; Ajinomoto Pharmaceuticals) before their operations. After the operation, eligible patients were administered TPN solutions. The compositions of the three TPN solutions used in this study are shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, and these were based on the guidelines of ASPEN and JSPEN.</p></sec><sec><title>TPN product randomization</title><p>After written consent was obtained from the patients before operation, the attending physician called the CASPjp call center and the TPN products were assigned randomly using a computer-generated random number. Sixty-four patients who had undergone curative resection were randomized into the three TPN product groups. The TPN solutions used were three general commercial products: Aminotoripa&#x000ae; (AMINO: Branched chain amino acid (BCAA) rich solution with glucose, fructose, and xylitol solution in a separate cavity bag; Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), PNtwin&#x000ae; (PN: Milk composition amino acid solution and glucose solution contained in a separate cavity bag; Ajinomoto Pharma Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), and Unicaliq&#x000ae; (UNI: BCAA rich solution and glucose solution in same cavity bag; Terumo Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Patients received appropriate electrolytic solutions on operation day and TPN solution from 2 to 7 days after operation. All patients received multivitamins during this study. Blood and urine samples were collected before operation and 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after operation. Serum electrolytes, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), lactic acid, pyruvic acid, and blood acid-base status were calculated by using standard automated laboratory techniques. Twenty-four hour urine collections for the measurements of urine electrolytes, pH, creatinine, and urinary NAE were also performed. Urinary NAE was determined by a titrimetric method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and was the sum of titratable acid and ammonium concentrations minus the bicarbonate concentration. The titratable endpoint pH was 7.40 at 0 Pa as a PCO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>This randomized clinical study was conducted to discover the acidosis risk of TPN therapy, and the primary outcome measure was acidosis as an adverse event. However, considering the patients&#x02019; safety, it was difficult to measure the harm of TPN therapy using a randomized clinical study method. Therefore, this study initially evaluated the acidosis risk in animal subjects, and urinary acid excretion was confirmed as a risk factor of acidosis. NAE was correlative with arterial blood pH (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001). Thus, urinary total acid excretion used as a surrogate outcome of the acidosis risk during TPN therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Efficacy was analyzed according to the intention to treat approach. All statistical analyses were performed using StatView for Windows software (Version 5.0, SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All data were presented as means&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;s.e. Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test was used for the comparison of data; a <italic>p</italic> value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 76 patients in the surgical ward who received curative operations during the study period, 12 were excluded because of renal insufficiency. Sixty-four eligible patients were assigned randomly to the three groups. The demographics for each group were similar (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Consent was sought from the 64 eligible patients; all patients agreed to participate in this study. Twenty one, 22, and 21 of the 64 patients were allocated to the AMINO, PN, and UNI groups, respectively. The three groups of patients showed no important differences in baseline characteristics. No patient was withdrawn from the study after randomization. All patient data were included in this study.</p><p>The time courses of plasma pH, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>, pCO<sub>2</sub>, and blood base excess (BE) levels in the patients after administration of the TPN solutions are shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. The pH of arterial blood increased significantly in the AMINO and PN group after administration. The pCO<sub>2</sub> of arterial blood decreased significantly in the AMINO and PN group at 6 days after administration compared with postoperative day (POD) 1. The HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> concentration of arterial blood increased significantly in the PN group 1 day after administration. BE increased significantly in the AMINO and PN groups 1 day after administration. There were no significant differences in anion gap among the three groups during the study period. No patients suffered from metabolic alkalosis or acidosis. All patients did not change their body weight during this study.</p><p>The time courses of serum electrolyte levels after administration of the TPN solutions are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>.

The serum concentration of lactic acid decreased significantly in the AMINO group at POD 3 and in the PN group at POD 3 and 7 compared to POD 1. The serum concentration of pyruvic acid decreased significantly in the AMINO group at POD 3 and in the PN group on POD 3, 5, and 7 compared to POD 1. There were no significant changes in the serum concentration of lactic acid or pyruvic acid in the UNI groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Acidosis during TPN therapy could be related to the presence of hydrochloric salts in synthetic L-amino-acid preparations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. ASPEN and JSPEN have developed clinical guidelines for TPN therapy. However, these guidelines have not commented on the risk of the acid load induced from pH adjustment agents in TPN solutions.</p><p>Recently, hydrochloric acid has been added to bagged commercial TPN solutions to avoid Maillard reaction, which is induced by D-glucose and amino acids, and the UNI solution uses hydrochloric salts of synthetic L-amino-acid to avoid this reaction. Organic acids such as acetic acid are added to the TPN solutions to stabilize the pH of the products after heat sterilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Therefore, two types of acids are added to commercial TPN solutions to maintain the quality of the formula. As a result, the titratable acidity of the nutrient solution consists of hydrochloric acid and organic acids. In general, titratable acidity is higher in solutions containing hydrochloric salts, and the adjusted TPN solutions have higher titratable acidity compared to the standard solutions. Terashima <italic>et al.</italic> suggested that metabolic acidosis is caused by the high titratable acidity induced from not only non-metabolizable acids but also from metabolizable acids in commercial TPN solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This study focused on acids in TPN solutions as a cause of metabolic acidosis and investigated the effect of non-metabolizable and metabolizable acids on the plasma acid-base balance. The present findings suggested that the amount of titratable acidity is not related to the incidence of acid load. Only non-metabolizable acids such as hydrochloric acid influence the patient&#x02019;s acid load.</p><p>Metabolic acidosis is a pH imbalance in which the body has accumulated too much acid and does not have enough bicarbonate to effectively neutralize the effects of the acid. Previously, we reported that the acid load with hydrochloric acid in TPN solutions may cause severe hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis in rabbits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In the present study, urinary pH decreased slightly and NAE increased significantly after administration in UNI group, but other two groups did not change urinary pH and NAE. Urine becomes more acidic when the body is in acidosis. Since urine is a waste, the acid in the urine are lost for the body and this contributes to return the body pH to a normal value. However, there is no regulation that pharmaceutical companies should indicate the amount of added acid in the attached documents for their products. This situation is dangerous for physicians because they cannot determine the risk of acidosis when they order TPN prescriptions. Therefore, information regarding the potential inorganic acid content in commercial TPN solutions should be included in the attached documents for TPN products.</p><p>The present study focused on acids in TPN solutions as a cause of metabolic acidosis and investigated the effect of metabolizable and non-metabolizable acids on the plasma acid-base balance. The present results suggest that the amount of titratable acidity is not related to the incidence of acid load. Only non-metabolizable acids such as hydrochloric acid influence serum pH in patients. Non-metabolizable acid may be a risk factor of metabolic acidosis. Therefore, pharmaceutical companies should inform medical professionals of the amount of non-metabolizable acid in TPN solutions to help to avoid metabolic acidosis.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>TPN</term><def><p>total parenteral nutrition</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NAE</term><def><p>net acid excretion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CASPjp</term><def><p>Critical Appraisal Skills Programme JAPAN</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BCAA</term><def><p>Branched chain amino acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BUN</term><def><p>blood urea nitrogen</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TA</term><def><p>titratable acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BE</term><def><p>base excess</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Aminotoripa&#x000ae;</term><def><p>AMINO</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PNtwin&#x000ae;</term><def><p>PN</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Unicaliq&#x000ae;</term><def><p>UNI</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>POD</term><def><p>postoperative day</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fong</surname><given-names>Y.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Marano</surname><given-names>M.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Barber</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>W.</given-names></name><name><surname>Moldawer</surname><given-names>L.L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bushman</surname><given-names>E.D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Coyle</surname><given-names>S.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Shires</surname><given-names>G.T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lowry</surname><given-names>S.F.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Total parenteral nutrition and bowel rest modify the metabolic response to endotoxin in humans</article-title><source>Ann.
