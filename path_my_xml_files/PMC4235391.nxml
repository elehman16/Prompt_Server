Remission, or the return to normal functioning, is the goal of depression treatment for all patients. Ideally, remission should be determined by a reduction in the number and severity of depression symptoms, in addition to improved work, social, and family functioning (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Israel, 2006</xref>). The broad spectrum of symptoms associated with MDD, different levels of depression severity, and lack of comprehensive efficacy with available treatments predicate the need for new treatments that offer advantages in efficacy, as well as good safety and tolerability.</p><p>Levomilnacipran (1<italic>S</italic>, 2<italic>R</italic>-milnacipran) is a potent and selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that is Food and Drug Administration approved for the treatment of MDD in adults; an extended-release (ER) formulation was developed to allow for once-daily dosing. In-vitro studies have shown that levomilnacipran has two-fold greater potency for norepinephrine reuptake inhibition relative to serotonin reuptake inhibition (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Auclair <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Levomilnacipran has 10-fold higher selectivity for inhibiting norepinephrine reuptake versus serotonin reuptake compared with duloxetine and an even higher selectivity for norepinephrine reuptake inhibition compared with desvenlafaxine or venlafaxine (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Deecher <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Auclair <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The safety and efficacy of levomilnacipran ER in the treatment of MDD have been established in four positive randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of fixed-dose or flexible-dose design (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Sambunaris <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Asnis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Bakish <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Montgomery <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). An additional flexible-dose trial demonstrated consistent improvement in depressive symptoms with 40&#x02013;120 mg/day levomilnacipran ER relative to placebo, but the overall difference between treatments was not statistically significant (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Gommoll <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). A relapse prevention study comparing levomilnacipran ER and placebo has also been conducted (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Shiovitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>); although time to relapse was slower in the levomilnacipran ER group versus placebo, the treatment difference did not reach statistical significance because of the limited number of patients who relapsed. Levomilnacipran ER was generally well tolerated in all studies.</p><p>The first positive trial of levomilnacipran ER was a 10-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, proof-of-concept trial (EudraCT Number: 2006-002404-34; <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Montgomery <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) in which 75 or 100 mg/day levomilnacipran ER demonstrated efficacy versus placebo. To fully assess the results from this trial, multiple secondary and post-hoc analyses were carried out to evaluate the efficacy across the range of depression symptoms, improvement in functional impairment, and a severe depression patient subgroup; the clinical relevance of the effects of levomilnacipran ER treatment was evaluated using remission and number needed to treat (NNT) analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted between 13 December 2006 and 22 October 2007 at 68 international sites in France, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden, Germany, Estonia, Czech Republic, Bulgaria, India, and South Africa. The study was performed in accordance with the principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and the final study protocol was approved by appropriate ethics committees and authorities. All patients provided written informed consent.</p><p>Detailed study design, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and statistical methods have been reported in a prior publication (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Montgomery <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). In brief, the study consisted of a 3-day to 21-day drug wash-out, followed by a 2-week progressive titration period, an 8-week double-blind treatment period, and a 1-week down-titration period. Patients randomized to levomilnacipran ER received 25 mg on Days 1&#x02013;3, 50 mg on Days 4&#x02013;7, and 75 mg on Days 8&#x02013;11; the 100-mg levomilnacipran ER target dose was reached on Day 12 if good tolerance was demonstrated. If tolerability issues arose, down-titration to 75 mg was allowed and this dose was fixed for the remainder of the trial.</p><sec><title>Inclusion/exclusion criteria</title><p>Outpatients between the ages of 18 and 70 years who met the criteria for a major depressive episode (moderate or severe, without psychotic features) according to the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>, 4th ed. &#x02013; text revision (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">APA, 2000</xref>) were included. Depressive episode duration was 1 month or more and patients had a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD<sub>17</sub>; <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Hamilton, 1960</xref>) score of greater than 22 and a Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS; <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Sheehan <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>) score of 10 or higher, with at least one subscale (work, social life, or family life) score of 6 or higher.

The rate of &#x02018;complete remission&#x02019; at Week 10, defined in this analysis as a MADRS total score of 5 or lower (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Zimmerman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Wade <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Favre, 2012</xref>), was calculated using a logistic regression model with treatment and baseline MADRS score as explanatory variables analyzed with a last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach on the FAS. &#x02018;Sustained remission&#x02019; was defined in these analyses as a MADRS total score of 10 or lower persisting from Week 4 through to Week 10 and was analyzed using the same model with an observed cases approach.</p><p>Functional improvement was evaluated as the proportion of patients achieving SDS response (total score&#x02264;12 and all item scores&#x02264;4) and remission (total score&#x02264;6 and all item scores&#x02264;2; <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Sheehan and Sheehan, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Sheehan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Analyses were carried out on the basis of a logistic regression model with treatment group and corresponding baseline SDS total score as explanatory variables using an LOCF approach. To determine the proportion of patients who achieved combined symptomatic and functional improvement, an analysis was carried out to determine the proportion of patients who achieved both SDS and MADRS remission (SDS total score&#x02264;6 and all item scores&#x02264;2, and MADRS total score&#x02264;10).

Remission rates obtained using more stringent criteria supported the findings based on standard remission criteria (MADRS total score&#x02264;10) from the earlier publication (levomilnacipran 46%; placebo 26%; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001; <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Montgomery <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The failure of antidepressants to treat the full range of diagnostic and core symptoms of depression is of great concern. The disturbances in monoamine neurotransmission that occur in depression are most likely basic to its pathophysiology (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Leonard, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Charney, 1998</xref>), although different symptoms of depression may be particularly responsive to increases in the levels of certain neurotransmitters (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Nutt, 2008</xref>). As such, the strong norepinephrine-related pharmacological profile of levomilnacipran ER may offer potential advantages in treating certain symptoms of depression for which selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be less effective (e.g. decreased concentration, loss of energy, lassitude, tiredness, and reduced self-care; <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Nutt, 2008</xref>). Of interest in the present analyses, efficacy across a full range of depressive symptoms was demonstrated with significant differences in favor of levomilnacipran ER over placebo in all MADRS single-item items, showing broad efficacy against symptoms that may be associated with serotonin and/or norepinephrine.</p><p>A critical distinction between the MADRS and HAMD<sub>17</sub> is the inclusion of items in HAMD<sub>17</sub> that correspond more closely with the somatic symptoms of MDD. As such, statistically significant differences compared with placebo in most of the single items of this scale support the concept of broad efficacy of levomilnacipran ER across the core symptoms and somatic symptoms of depression. The slightly better drug&#x02013;placebo difference in MADRS compared with HAMD<sub>17</sub> in the post-hoc analyses may have been related to the inclusion of agitation, loss of weight, somatic anxiety, and insight factors in the HAMD<sub>17</sub> scale. Wide-ranging symptomatic improvement is an essential component of stable recovery and the return to wellness as residual symptoms have been identified as a predictor of MDD relapse (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Judd <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Thase, 2009</xref>), whereas remission is associated with a reduced relapse risk (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Montgomery <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>).</p><p>The goal of antidepressant treatment is to achieve and maintain remission, a state of symptomatic wellness that is compatible with normal life and functioning. The remission rate achieved by levomilnacipran ER patients in the initial study (46%) was high in comparison with that in the STAR*D study (37% after acute treatment), a large, naturalistic antidepressant trial that was conducted in primary and specialty care settings (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Rush <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Remission is an accepted measure of the clinical relevance of treatment; as statistical significance alone may not sufficiently reveal important clinical implications, clinical relevance takes into account both the size and consistency of treatment differences between the active drug and placebo (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Thase, 2008</xref>).</p><p>It is unusual to achieve significantly different remission rates for drug versus placebo in a single acute study. Remission often takes longer to achieve than the treatment duration in an acute study and the numbers of patients achieving remission within a study are normally too low for a meaningful analysis (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Montgomery and Moller, 2009</xref>). In secondary analyses, remission was evaluated using more stringent criteria than the prospective measure in the primary study. On the measure defined as &#x02018;complete remission&#x02019; (MADRS total score&#x02264;5), the difference of 13 percentage points between levomilnacipran ER and placebo met or exceeded the 10&#x02013;15 point difference in response or remission that is considered clinically relevant (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Thase, 2011</xref>). Complete remission, which indicates a symptom-free state, has not been examined in relapse prevention studies, but it is reasonable to assume that it could be associated with a lower level of subsequent relapse because the residual symptom burden is very low after complete remission criteria are met (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Pintor <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Further exploratory analysis of remission revealed that when remission was achieved at Week 4, it was sustained through to Week 10 by a significant percentage of levomilnacipran ER patients. The six-point difference between levomilnacipran ER and placebo observed at Week 10 for patients who achieved &#x02018;sustained remission&#x02019; from Week 4 was statistically significant. In addition, the rate of &#x02018;sustained remission&#x02019; achieved by patients with severe depression was significantly greater for levomilnacipran ER compared with placebo despite a lower number of patients and consequent loss of statistical power.</p><p>NNT calculation is a standard reflection of clinical significance in the context of evidence-based medicine for categorical outcomes (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Kraemer and Kupfer, 2006</xref>) such as response and remission. For antidepressants, an NNT of 10 is considered to be the threshold of clinical relevance (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Thase, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Montgomery and Moller, 2009</xref>), meaning that 10 additional patients would need to be treated with the more effective intervention to achieve one additional response or remission. A significant difference is often judged to be clinically meaningful if the difference in a clinically relevant outcome is equal to or greater than 10%, which is the same as an NNT of 10 or less (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Cipriani <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Thase, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The NNT for MADRS response, remission, and &#x02018;complete remission&#x02019; was very similar for the entire population (6, 5, and 7, respectively) and for those with severe depression (6, 6, and 6, respectively), indicating that levomilnacipran ER can produce clinically relevant outcomes across a range of depression severity. This is noteworthy as patients with higher symptom severity scores require a greater change in rating scale scores to achieve remission (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Thase, 2009</xref>), and greater severity of depression predicts longer time to remission (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Israel, 2006</xref>).</p><p>As functional improvement frequently lags behind symptomatic improvement in patients with MDD (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Israel, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Sheehan and Sheehan, 2008</xref>), it is interesting to find significant concurrent functional and symptomatic improvements in a single acute study. In the primary study, significant differences in favor of levomilnacipran ER versus placebo were demonstrated by a change from baseline in SDS total and subscale scores (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Montgomery <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>); post-hoc analyses revealed clinically relevant SDS response (NNT=6) and remission (NNT=10) at Week 10, which supports the primary outcome. Of additional interest, significant improvement for levomilnacipran ER versus placebo in a measure of combined symptomatic and functional remission (MADRS total score&#x02264;10, and SDS total score&#x02264;6 and subscale scores&#x02264;2) further indicates that symptomatic and functional improvement took place concomitantly in this study; an NNT of 10 for the combined remission measure demonstrated the clinical relevance of this finding.</p><p>Limitations of this study include the retrospective nature of these analyses. In addition, these data have not been subject to statistical adjustment for multiple analyses and are presented using the customary <italic>P</italic> less than 0.05 significance criterion because of the number of exploratory analyses undertaken; the results should therefore be interpreted with caution. Although the significant differences between levomilnacipran ER and placebo that were observed in post-hoc remission analyses should be regarded as a demonstration of clinical relevance, the stringent criteria used are not standard measures and are therefore difficult to generalize. Although the remission rates observed in the primary study and additional analyses raise the possibility that levomilnacipran ER may be unusually effective in achieving remission, it may alternatively indicate that the population studied included patients who were particularly sensitive to treatment. Rising placebo response observed in recent studies may compromise the ability to assess efficacy. The placebo response rate of 37% in the present study is lower than that observed in some other recent studies (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Rutherford and Roose, 2013</xref>). This may be because great care was taken by the investigators in selecting the study population, by ensuring roughly equal numbers of those with moderate and severe depression, and by achieving good compliance in the 10-week study.</p><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Significant differences between levomilnacipran ER and placebo in a variety of post-hoc and secondary measures support the primary and secondary efficacy outcomes reported previously in this study. Results from single-item analyses and measures of functional improvement support the broad efficacy across diverse symptoms and domains of depression. Significant differences in rates of remission between levomilnacipran ER and placebo, as well as the NNTs in the overall population and in patients with severe depression, satisfy the criteria frequently used to assess clinically relevant or meaningful treatment differences. The results from these analyses are convincing and demonstrate the benefit of treatment with levomilnacipran ER compared with placebo for patients with symptomatic and functional impairment associated with MDD.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Writing assistance and editorial support during the preparation of this manuscript was provided by Carol Dyer, MS, Prescott Medical Communications Group, Chicago, Illinois, a contractor for the Forest Research Institute.</p><p>This study was supported by funding from Forest Research Institute, a subsidiary of Forest Laboratories Inc.
