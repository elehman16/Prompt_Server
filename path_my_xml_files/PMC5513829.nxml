This pathway regulates and promotes angiogenesis as well as increases endothelial cell proliferation, permeability, and cancer survival. Ramucirumab is a new fully human monoclonal antibody that targets the VEGF receptor-2, an important key receptor implicated in angiogenesis. Ramucirumab has been approved for the treatment of second-line advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in combination with the chemotherapy agent docetaxel. This was based on the result of the randomized trial REVEL of 1,253 patients with metastatic NSCLC previously treated with a platinum-based combination therapy. The authors observed a significant improvement in overall survival (OS) with an acceptable toxicities profile. In this study, patients were randomized to receive ramucirumab plus docetaxel or placebo with docetaxel. The combination of docetaxel and ramucirumab showed an improved OS (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.75, 0.98). Median OS was 10.5 months in the ramucirumab arm versus 9.1 months in the placebo arm. Regarding side effects, the toxicity described on the ramucirumab arm were principally diarrhea, fatigue, and neutropenia. The most common (5%) adverse reactions of grade 3 and 4 in the ramucirumab arm were fatigue, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, and hypertension. Adding ramucirumab to docetaxel improves QoL of patients, and does not impair symptoms or functioning. There are currently several trials in progress evaluating the effects of ramucirumab in combination with other drugs in patients with advanced NSCLC.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>ramucirumab</kwd><kwd>NSCLC</kwd><kwd>antiangiogenesis</kwd><kwd>VEGF-targeted therapy</kwd><kwd>pretreated</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in developed countries.

Tumor angiogenesis pathways are important therapeutic targets in many malignant tumors, including NSCLC.<xref rid="b6-lctt-8-057" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Tissue hypoxia is one of the principal stimulants of angiogenesis, which leads to overproduction of proangiogenic factors. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family (VEGF-(A&#x02013;D) and placental growth factor) are important proangiogenic protein factors. Of these, VEGF-A is primarily responsible for vessel formation in adult tissues.<xref rid="b7-lctt-8-057" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> VEGF binds to a family of transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases called receptors (VEGFRs with three isoforms VEGFR-[1&#x02013;3]).<xref rid="b8-lctt-8-057" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> VEGF binds to VEGFR-1; however, its primary effects on angiogenesis are mediated principally by VEGFR-2, involved in endothelial cell proliferation and migration.<xref rid="b9-lctt-8-057" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> VEGF binds to VEGFR-2, leading to endothelial proliferation, differentiation, permeability, migration, and generation of new blood vessels.<xref rid="b10-lctt-8-057" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Tumor angiogenesis is characterized by the formation of abnormal vessels, with permeability altered.

Ramucirumab binds VEGFR-2 and inhibits responses resulting from the activation of VEGFR-2 by VEGF-A and VEGF-C.

The study consisted of a Phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ramucirumab 10 mg/kg or placebo in combination with docetaxel 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> in 157 Japanese patients with stage IV NSCLC, whose disease has progressed during or after one platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. Patients who received previous EGFR-tirosin-kinase inhibitor (TKI) monotherapy for EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC in addition to platinum-based chemotherapy participated as a separate, exploratory population. Primary endpoint was PFS and secondary outcomes included OS, RR and safety. Median PFS was longer in the ramucirumab arm, 5.22 m (95% CI: 3.5&#x02013;6.9), than in the placebo arm; 4.21 m (95% CI: 2.8&#x02013;5.6); HR: 0.83 (95% CI: 0.59&#x02013;1.16).

The results of second-line ramucirumab-docetaxel were not statistically significant because of the low number of patients included, but it showed numerically improved PFS similar to that seen in the REVEL trial with a manageable safety profile in Japanese patients with NSCLC. In the exploratory population of EGFR mutation-positive patients with prior EGFR-TKI treatment, median PFS (5.65 m vs 4.37 m), ORR (44.4% vs 41.2%), and DCR (88.9% vs 76.5%) were numerically greater with ramucirumab than with placebo.<xref rid="b25-lctt-8-057" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>Several studies of small molecule inhibitors of VEGFRs have been associated with benefits in PFS but not in OS in NSCLC.

Currently, ramucirumab has been approved for several indications in gastrointestinal tumors, and specifically, in lung cancer, it has recently been approved for the treatment of advanced second-line NSCLC in combination with chemotherapy, specifically, docetaxel. The approval was achieved thanks to the data from the clinical trial REVEL. This study is a clinical Phase III trial, with an appropriate statistical design, in which a statistically significant benefit in its primary objective was observed. The experimental arm had improved OS of 1.4 months and toxicity was acceptable, with similar grade 3-4 toxicity with respect to the control arm and without deterioration in the quality of life of patients. Although these data are encouraging in the improvement of the overall prognosis of the natural history of advanced NSCLC, however, many questions remain about the utility of this agent in this context.</p><p>For example, the benefit of adding ramucirumab to docetaxel in elderly patients is not clear. Patients whose tumors carry genomic alterations of ALK or EGFR must have progression to EGFR or ALK therapy before receiving treatment with ramucirumab, and the number of patients included in the study is very low to be able to obtain clear conclusions. Ongoing clinical trials will give us more information about these issues.</p><p>However, with the good current data of immunotherapy, the main question with respect to the indication of the anti-angiogenic therapies (both ramucirumab and nindetanib) in combination with docetaxel in the second line of the advanced NSCLC, will be to establish what subgroup of patients will be most beneficial with immunotherapy or with anti-angiogenic therapies. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab have provided data of benefit in OS with docetaxel monotherapy, with less toxicity profile, and have positioned themselves as a standard for second-line in this setting. This adds another factor of complexity in clinical decisions. In second-line advanced NSCLC, there is no face to face comparison of checkpoints inhibitors to the combination of docetaxel and antiangiogenic agents and no projected new trials with this methodology in the near future. Actually, the selection of post-platinum treatments depends for each patient on several parameters, including performance status, age, corticosteroids use or other contra-indication to immunotherapy, PD-L1 expression or tumor mutational status, and as the hot topic, aggressiveness of the disease with threatening metastatic sites or response and time to progression on first-line therapy. However, availability of the drugs often remains the main decisive consideration. Probably, the role of anti-PD1/PD-L1 agents in the second-line treatment algorithm for advanced NSCLC will likely become the principal options, even in situations where the clinical decision is difficult, relegating docetaxel in combination with an anti-angiogenic drug to the third-line setting, although there are no available data to assess the potential use of ramucirumab plus docetaxel after anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy.</p><p>However, availability of the drugs often remains the main decisive consideration, and in determinate algorithms, there are several recommendations that suggest that the use of one strategy against another in specific patients will depend on the evaluation combining pathological factors, specifically, the expression of PD-L1 determined by immunohistochemistry, together with clinical factors.</p><p>Moreover, the available data seem to reveal that patients with rapid progression receive little benefit from immunotherapy, with an ORR of 8%&#x02013;10% with nivolumab and pembrolizumab,<xref rid="b27-lctt-8-057" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b29-lctt-8-057" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> mainly in patients with low PD-L1 expression. However, angiogenesis inhibitors, such as ramucirumab or nintedanib, seem to work better, specifically in this subgroup which gains the greatest benefit, principally, patients with time &#x0003c;9 months from the beginning of the first line of treatment. This is the subgroup of patients in whom the combination of docetaxel and antiangiogenic drugs may have more benefit than immunotherapy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We
