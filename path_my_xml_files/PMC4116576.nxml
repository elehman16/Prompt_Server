To the best of our knowledge, published studies reporting the comparison of intravenous versus IA administration of midazolam on postoperative pain after knee arthroscopy are limited and the site of midazolam action (systemic absorption versus local peripheral action) is questioned. Thus, this study was aimed to assess the comparison of intravenous versus IA administration of midazolam on postoperative pain after knee arthroscopy in a randomized controlled trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was a randomized, parallel-group, double-blind study which was conducted between April, and October, 2013, on 75 patients who scheduled for knee arthroscopy under general anesthesia in Kashani Hospital in Isfahan, Iran. The Ethics Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences investigates and approves this study, and written informed consent was obtained from all studied patients. Eligibility was define as age older than 18 years old in both gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification I and II, no history of chronic disease, no use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs up to 2 weeks before surgery. Furthermore, patients with history use of opioids, patients with postoperative complications that increased postoperative pain, and those whose pain evaluation was judged unreliable because of neurologic disease did not enrolled in the study.</p><p>Using random-maker software &#x0201c;random allocation&#x0201d; eligible patients were randomly divided into three 25-member groups. Group I include patients who received 75 mc/kg IA injection of midazolam and 10 cc intravenous injection of isotonic saline. Group II include patients who received 75 mc/kg intravenous injection of midazolam and 10 cc IA injection of isotonic saline.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Patients in Group III received IA and intravenous injection of isotonic saline (10 cc).</p><p>In all groups, standardized general anesthesia was selected, and in the entire cases anesthesia was induced intravenously with fentanyl (2 mcg/kg), sodium thiopental (5 mg/kg) and atracurium (0.5 mg/kg). Endotracheal intubation was performed with a single-lumen tube. Balanced anesthesia was maintained using with inhalation of isoflurane (1.2%) and morphine (0.1 mg/kg). Patients&#x02019; lungs were mechanically ventilated with the same setting during ventilation (10 mL/kg and respiratory rate, 10 min). The patients were monitored and observed using an electrocardiogram, noninvasive arterial blood pressure device, end tidal CO<sub>2,</sub> and pulse oximeter. Studied drugs were prepared in syringes in a double-blind fashion by a team member who was not involved in data recording. Furthermore, to maintain blinding, patients were unaware of the treatment allocation.</p><p>Collected data included age, and sex combination, weight, duration of anesthesia (from induction of anesthesia until disconnecting of anesthesia drug), duration of surgery (from the beginning of incision until last suture), extubation time (from disconnecting of anesthesia drugs until extubation of trachea), duration of recovery (from extubation until achieving modified Alderet score 9/10)[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Time to first analgesic requirement, 24-h analgesic consumption, number of patients requiring analgesics, sedation, complications (desaturation, bradycardia, allergy, hypotension, local infection) satisfaction, pain and mean arterial pressure (MAP) which were assessed in all patients.

The pain is caused by an irritation of free nerve endings of the synovial tissue, anterior fat pad, and joint capsule due to surgical excision and resection.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] In this randomized study, we found that the administration of IA midazolam improved postoperative pain, and patient satisfaction. It was also associated with lower sedation scores following administration, decreased total postoperative analgesic consumption, and delayed the time of first analgesic administration compared with intravenous midazolam and saline controls group. This is supported by a significant decrease in pain scores during the first eight postoperative hours and by a prolonged delay between the IA administration of midazolam and additional analgesic requirement. These beneficial effects of midazolam were not as marked when the drug was given intravenous and it produced a limited improvement in postoperative pain and less effect on postoperative analgesic requirement and the time of first analgesic administration compared with saline controls group. Based on our results, the analgesic effect of IA midazolam appears to be mainly act at a peripheral site in the joint, as this effect was less pronounced after systemic administration, however, a central analgesic effect resulting from systemic absorption cannot be excluded. Opioid receptors are existed on peripheral nerve endings and opioid peptides are produced in various immune cells of synovial tissue after knee trauma. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) acts through its receptors on endorphin-containing immune cells,[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Likar <italic>et al</italic>. investigated whether the IA injection of CRH reduces postoperative pain intensity and supplemental analgesic consumption in patients undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery. They found evidence for a short analgesic effect of a single dose of IA CRH in patients undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>In a double-blinded, randomized study by Batra <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] postoperative pain, the time to first analgesic consumption and the total dose of analgesics used over 48-h after IA administration of midazolam 50 &#x003bc;g/kg, 75 &#x003bc;g/kg, or isotonic saline were assessed in 60 patients undergoing knee arthroscopy. Authors in this study reported that both doses of midazolam decreases postoperative pain after arthroscopic knee surgery in compared with placebo. Also, a prolonged delay between the IA administration of midazolam and additional analgesic requirement, and during the first four postoperative hours a significant decrease in pain scores were reported in this study in both doses of midazolam compared with the placebo group. They did not demonstrate a dose dependent effect with administration of midazolam 50 &#x003bc;g/kg or 75 &#x003bc;g/kg doses. Like Batra <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] we found greater analgesic effect after IA administration than placebo, and lower additional analgesic requirement. Results of these studies show the effect of IA administration of midazolam as an analgesic technique for postoperative pain management after knee arthroscopy.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there are no published studies reporting the comparison of intravenous versus IA administration of midazolam on postoperative pain after knee arthroscopy and other studies were done using different drugs. Alagol <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] in a double-blinded, randomized study assessed the effect of intravenous versus IA administration of tramadol on postoperative pain after knee arthroscopy. In this study, different doses of tramadol were used and results are shown that IA tramadol provide longest duration of analgesia, lower pain scores and minimal analgesic consumption during 24-h with few side-effects in compare with intravenous administration of tramadol. Effect of dexmedetomidine after IA and intravenous administration was evaluated in Al-Metwalli <italic>et al</italic>. study,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and reported that IA dexmedetomidine enhanced postoperative analgesia after arthroscopic knee surgery, with an increased time to first analgesic request and a decreased need for postoperative analgesia compared with intravenous administration. In another randomized study, Ho <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] assessed the effect of intravenous versus IA administration of morphine on postoperative pain after knee arthroscopy and reported that patients who received IA morphine consumed less rescue analgesia than those who received intravenous morphine with fewer side-effects. Arti and Arti studied the analgesic effects of different opioids in the early postoperative period in comparison to control group. They found that morphine in comparison to meperidine or methadone is more useful in reducing pain or analgesic need when is added to bupivacaine injection following arthroscopic menisectomy.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Isik <italic>et al</italic>. studied IA injection of ketamine or ketamine plus levobupivacaine on postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing arthroscopic meniscectomy. They found that IA ketamine provides effective postoperative analgesia, and addition of IA levobupivacaine to ketamine may provide better pain relief after outpatient arthroscopic meniscectomy.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>In agreement with these three studies, our results show that greater analgesic effect and lower side-effects of midazolam after IA administration than after intravenous injection. Although, studied drugs in these studies is different but their findings display that the mechanism of the analgesic effect of intraarticularly administered of these drugs is not due to the systemic effects and there is limited absorption of the drug.</p><p>Strength of our study is that to determine the site of midazolam action and the utility of IA midazolam, patients were assessed in three comparing groups receiving IA midazolam with intravenous saline, IA saline with intravenous midazolam, and IA saline with intravenous saline. Furthermore, the low number of sample size is the possible main limitation of our study. Therefore, future studies with appropriate sample size are necessary to specifically assess the effect of IA administration of midazolam compare to intravenous injection. For the purpose of ethical considerations and study limitations, because we used IA midazolam, then before starting of administration we discussed the procedure for every patient and received written informed consent, Also we coordinated about the study with the surgical team as study coworker before starting of the study, therefore no ethical barrier or limitation has been determined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The results of our study show the greater analgesic effect after IA administration of midazolam than after intravenous injection, with better patient satisfaction score, lower sedation scores following administration, decreased total postoperative analgesic consumption, and delayed the time of first analgesic administration and lower side-effects. Thus, IA administration of midazolam may be the method of choice for pain relief after arthroscopic knee surgery.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This article has been originated from a medical thesis, which has been conducted in Anesthesia Department of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences and approved by the University Department of Research, with the research code 291211.
