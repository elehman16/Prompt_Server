Early interventions that target parenting have the greatest potential to create sustained effects on child development and parental psychopathology. Triple P (Positive Parenting Program) has shown positive effects on child behaviour and adjustment, parenting practices and family functioning. Baby Triple P for Preterm infants, has been developed to target parents of very preterm infants. This study tests the effectiveness of Baby Triple P for Preterm infants in improving child and parent/couple outcomes at 24 months corrected age (CA).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Families will be randomised to receive either Baby Triple P for Preterm infants or Care as Usual (CAU). Baby Triple P for Preterm infants involves 4 &#x000d7; 2 hr group sessions at the hospital plus 4 &#x000d7; 30 min telephone consultations soon after transfer (42 weeks C.A.). After discharge participants will be linked to community based Triple P and intervention maintenance up to 24 months C.A. Assessments will be: baseline, post-intervention (6 weeks C.A.), at 12 and 24 months C.A. The primary outcome measure is the Infant Toddler Social &#x00026; Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) at 24 months C.A. Child behavioural and emotional problems will be coded using the mother-toddler version of the Family Observation Schedule at 24 months C.A. Secondary outcome will be the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID III) cognitive development, language and motor abilities. Proximal targets of parenting style, parental self-efficacy, parental mental health, parental adjustment, parent-infant attachment, couple relationship satisfaction and couple communication will also be assessed. Our sample size based on the ITSEA, has 80% power, predicted effect size of 0.33 and an 85% retention rate, requires 165 families are required in each group (total sample of 330 families).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This protocol presents the study design, methods and intervention to be analysed in a randomised trial of Baby Triple P for Preterm infants compared to Care as Usual (CAU) for families of very preterm infants.

Most admitted to neonatal intensive care survive (&#x02248;85%), but 10% develop major disabilities such as cerebral palsy and 50% develop intellectual, educational and/or behavioural problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These problems cause emotional and financial stress for families and society.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Disability in very preterm babies</title><p>Children born very preterm are at increased risk of behavioural and emotional problems at 2&#x000a0;years corrected age (C.A.) including internalising and dysregulation difficulties as measured by the Infant Toddler Social &#x00026; Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Clinically relevant, pervasive behaviour problems are 2&#x02013;9 times more common in preterm than in term born infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Behavioural difficulties early in childhood have implications for the developmental trajectory including schooling, social development and mental health. Children born very preterm experience problems across educational domains and as a result, approximately 40% require special educational assistance and 20% repeat a grade in primary school. Attentional problems, poor postural control and hyperactivity are prevalent; Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder is 3&#x02013;6 times more common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Mean general intelligence (IQ) score is about <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> SD (i.e. 10 points) below that of term born peers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The learning and behavioural impairments in children born very preterm are associated with numerous &#x02018;medical&#x02019; risk factors such as gestational age, periventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leucomalacia, respiratory distress syndrome, necrotising enterocolitis, suboptimal nutrition/growth and therapeutic exposures, but collectively these factors account for only a portion of the variance associated with long-term outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Social and environmental factors such as social class, parental education, parental mental health, parenting style, family structure, family functioning and the home environment also have major impacts on the development of children born very preterm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, families of children born very preterm are more likely to experience socioeconomic disadvantage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and this social risk is in turn associated with increased behavioural problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Infants born preterm are at high risk of a &#x02018;double whammy&#x02019; of adversity, the initial being the biological adversity that preterm birth confers, and the subsequent being environmental adversity. This project focuses on optimising the developmental environment for the first 2&#x000a0;years through the pervasive neurodevelopmental influence of parenting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Cochrane reviews show that early interventions improve preterm outcomes</title><p>Early interventions have the potential to improve outcomes for children born very preterm but few babies receive high quality intervention due to the high costs (e.g. home visiting). Systematic reviews of existing early interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] suggest that beneficial effects are present including improvements in cognitive outcomes in infancy (standard mean difference [SMD] 0.46 SD; 95% CI 0.36-0.57; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001), and at preschool age (intelligence quotient SMD 0.46 SD; 95%CI 0.33-0.59; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These improvements were not however sustained at school age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Our Cochrane review concluded that further high quality RCTs with long term follow-up are needed to identify the potential of early developmental interventions in very preterm infants to produce sustained effects on cognitive, behavioural, motor and family outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A recently conducted RCT of a distributed model of developmental care at home demonstrated effects on maternal mental health and child externalising behaviour but with no effects on cognitive or motor outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The lack of sustained treatment effects for existing interventions suggests that a novel intervention that specifically addresses sustainability of effect may be beneficial. An intervention that focuses on sustained environmental enrichment through enhanced parenting practices is a promising approach. A key strength of the current study is that the parenting intervention is integrated into a successful, existing, funded community-based parenting program (Triple P) which will facilitate sustained exposure to the intervention at relatively low cost.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Early interventions that target parenting hold the greatest potential</title><p>Of the early interventions that may impact child development, interventions that target parenting hold the greatest potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Parenting interventions have the potential to create sustained effects on child development at a relatively low cost as changes in the family system continue to support changes in the child&#x02019;s developmental trajectory over time. Several studies have confirmed that the quality of daily parent&#x02013;child interactions powerfully impacts many domains of development throughout childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Evidence from behavioural genetics, epidemiological, correlational and experimental studies demonstrates that parenting practices have a major influence on children&#x02019;s development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] including upon behavioural and emotional development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], early language and social development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] later executive processing skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and academic achievement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The influence of parenting practices on development has been confirmed in preterm infants, with changes in parental behaviour producing equal or greater effects on development in infants born preterm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Parenting interventions, derived from social-learning, functional analysis, and cognitive-behavioural principles, are among the most powerful interventions available and are the treatment of choice for a number of developmental problems in toddlers and preschool aged children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Parents of infants born very preterm are at risk for parenting difficulties</title><p>Preterm birth is associated with maternal depression, withdrawal and low levels of maternal coordination with the infant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. These less-than-optimal features of early parent-infant interaction may contribute to the poor socio-emotional, behavioural, cognitive and language outcomes common in infants born preterm. Interventions to improve parental mental health may therefore impact on child outcomes. An RCT of a preventive care at home intervention for very preterm infants demonstrated significant differences in maternal depression (mean difference [MD] -2.0 95% CI &#x02212;3.2 to &#x02212;0.7; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.003) and anxiety (MD &#x02212;3.1 CI &#x02212;4.5 to &#x02212;1.6; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) along with significant reductions in child externalizing (MD &#x02212;4.1 CI &#x02212;8.2 to &#x02212;0.02; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05) and deregulation behaviours (MD &#x02212;8.7 CI &#x02212;13.2 to &#x02212;4.2; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) and improvements in child competence (MD 6.7 CI 0.7 to 11.8; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Further, in comparison to children of mothers who experienced a positive transition to parenthood, children of mothers who experienced postpartum adjustment difficulties have poorer cognitive development, including problem solving and visuomotor performance at age 1 and 4&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Infants born very preterm may also be at increased risk of abuse. Reported rates of referrals of 14.8% for child abuse and of substantiated cases at 8.8% are high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, parents of preterm infants themselves identify a need for support in their transition to parenting and a need for more information on how they can support their infant&#x02019;s development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Triple P is a highly effective parenting intervention</title><p>Triple P (Positive Parenting Program) has been developed and evaluated over the past 30&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. It is one of the most extensively evaluated and effective models of parenting intervention, and is now implemented in Australia and 25 other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Triple P is a comprehensive population-level system of parenting and family support that incorporates a multi-level system of interventions targeting parents of children from infancy to adolescence. The aim of Triple P is to impact upon child outcomes at a population level through enhancing parenting practices. Various levels of the Triple P system have been subjected to controlled evaluations and consistently shown positive effects on observed and parent-reported child behaviour and adjustment, parenting practices, and parental adjustment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The benefits of Triple P are not restricted to children and include beneficial effects on family functioning, including reduced maternal depression and stress, increased parental satisfaction and efficacy, and reduced couple conflict over parenting issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. A 5-year RCT reported that Triple P significantly reduced population indicators of child maltreatment at a population level with effect sizes ranging from large to very large (d&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.09 &#x02013; d&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.22) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. At least two independent meta-analyses drawing on 55 evaluation studies from different countries, research teams and child age groups have established the efficacy of Triple P in improving children&#x02019;s behaviour and adjustment over and above improving parenting skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and the efficacy of Triple P has been noted in a systematic review of all preventative interventions for child behavioural and emotional problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Effect sizes of the intervention on child outcome measures range from small-moderate (mean d&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.4) with universal, low-risk populations to moderate-large for high risk and clinical populations (mean d&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. There is also strong evidence that improvements in the domains of parenting and child behaviour have a positive effect on cognitive and school performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Triple P specifically targeted to preterm infants &#x02013; preliminary evaluation</title><p>Recently Baby Triple P, a tailored variant of Triple P for expectant couples of term born infants has been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The development of Baby Triple P included extensive independent review of the research on risk and protective factors for adverse developmental outcomes in infancy as well as policy documents and UNICEF/WHO guidelines on infant care. An RCT of Baby Triple P in expectant couples (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;128) examined the impact on infant problem behaviours, maternal depression and couple relationship satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Couples receiving Baby Triple P reported high satisfaction with the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>Recently a modified variant of Baby Triple P specifically targeting very preterm infants, Baby Triple P for Preterm infants has been developed for the present clinical trial (ACTRN1261200194864). The modification process was informed by qualitative research with parents of very preterm infants and involved the collection of extensive consumer preference data both qualitatively through focus groups and quantitatively through a national survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. A focus group of parents of very preterm infants (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;15) after viewing Prem Baby Triple P materials agreed that Baby Triple P for Preterm infants is appropriate, feasible and needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Parents identified numerous strengths in the intervention including (i) normalisation of preterm parenting, (ii) information about development, (iii) creating a safe environment, (iv) building a positive parent-infant relationship, (v) strategies to manage behavioural issues, (vi) building adaptive coping skills and (vii) a focus on &#x02018;learning to parent together&#x02019;. In a nation-wide survey (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;123 parents of preterm infants; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;32 parents of term infants) parents rated the program highly, with no significant differences between term, preterm and very preterm parent responses, <italic>F</italic>(8, 98)&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.34, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e;0.23 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].

A clinically important difference in child behavioural and emotional problems is considered to be a standardised effect size of 0.33 on the ITSEA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. This is a conservative estimate of the expected effect size observed in past RCTs of Triple P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. With a type-1 (alpha) level of 0.05, and 80% power, a total of 140 per group are required for analysis. Based on our experience, the expected retention rate is&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;85% so that 330 families (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;165 in each group) will be recruited to allow for attrition. As babies of multiple births cannot be considered independent, the unit of randomisation is family (or delivery), and the total number of babies recruited will depend on the number of multiple births. A total of ~675 families of preterm infants born at &#x0003c;32&#x000a0;weeks who survive to term equivalent are admitted to RBWH and MMH combined over the proposed 3&#x000a0;year recruitment period. Allowing for the estimated retention rate of 50% of those eligible, the feasibility is high of recruitment of a sufficient sample of at least 330 of the eligible 338 families to be studied at 24&#x000a0;months C.A.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Consent, randomisation, stratification</title><p>At each site the recruitment nurse will assess infants for eligibility and approach their parents as soon as the infant is medically stable (as determined by conferring with one of the attending doctors before approaching the parents). At first approach the research nurse will outline key elements of participation (including the voluntary nature of participation), and give a brief outline of both the risks and benefits and specific research activities of the study. Parents who indicate interest at this stage will be given a &#x02018;recruitment pack&#x02019; containing printed material about the key elements of participation and a copy of the parent information and consent form (PICF) to read over. After sufficient time to consider participation the recruitment nurse will make a second approach to the parents. For parents who at second approach indicate willingness to participate the recruitment nurse will then go through the PICF in detail with the parents and ask if they have any further questions. Parents who agree to participation will then either sign and return a written consent form or give consent by clicking the &#x0201c;I agree&#x0201d; box at the start of completing the online version of baseline questionnaires.</p><p>Once baseline assessment has been completed by the parents the family will then proceed to random allocation to either the Intervention group (Baby Triple P for Preterm infants) or the Care as Usual (CAU) group. Randomisation will occur from concealed envelopes opened in front of the participants by non-study personnel. Treatment allocation will be recorded on a piece of folded paper inside each envelope in random order (the allocation sequence will be comprised of computer-generated random numbers in a block design) with green paper indicating Intervention group and yellow paper indicating the Care as Usual group.

A parent workbook accompanies the program and is given to parents for use with exercises and as a reference. Parents complete homework tasks between sessions to consolidate learning. A flexible approach to delivery format is essential. If group sessions are not possible then individual sessions will be provided. Any family discharged from hospital prior to session completion will be provided with a DVD of missed modules to be watched at home followed by a telephone consultation with their facilitator. After hospital discharge and completion of the first four modules, 4&#x000d7;30-min telephone consultations are conducted with the family in their community by the trained Triple P facilitator who conducted the hospital-based sessions. The telephone sessions provide additional support to parents as they put into practice what has been learnt and the facilitator will assist parents in setting and reviewing parenting goals. Upon completion of all 8 sessions participants will be provided with contact details of their nearest community-based Triple P support location and encouraged over a 2&#x000a0;year period to access these services including seminars, groups and enhanced individual support if required.

The experimental unit is a family. The effect of clustering for children in multiple births will be partitioned from the experimental error, which will be estimated from the between family variability. Up to 50% of eligible families may not consent or alternatively, be back-transferred to regional hospitals before an approach can be made, and a further 15% may be lost to follow-up at 2&#x000a0;years. Consequential threats to external and internal validity will be checked using baseline and descriptive information for eligible families. Imputation techniques will be used to avoid bias which may be a consequence of non-ignorable missing data during follow-up. All data analyses were performed using STATA 10.0 (Statacorp 2007).</p><p>The primary endpoint at 24&#x000a0;months C.A. is the child behavioural and emotional problems as measured on the ITSEA and the mother-toddler observation. This comparison will be between treatment groups using general linear models, with terms included for stratification and important confounding variables, such as the extent of brain injury and socio-demographic variables. Secondary analyses will use similar methods to compare the outcomes between groups for the additional outcomes (cognition, language etc.). For dichotomous outcomes, comparison will be by chi-square tests and multiple logistic regression. Where continuous data exhibit substantial skewness not overcome by transformation, non-parametric methods (Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test) will be used for simple comparisons. Further analysis will be performed using latent growth modelling (LGM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>] as it provides simultaneous analysis of time points and can incorporate latent measures corrected for measurement error [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. The added-growth LGM used in evaluating the efficacy of Baby Triple P for Preterm infants tests the extent to which the intervention alters the trajectory of the target behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. The models may incorporate main effects of time-independent and dependent covariates (e.g. control variables) on trajectories, as well as interactions of such measures with intervention effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>].

The lack of sustained treatment effects for existing interventions suggests that an intervention that focuses on sustained environmental enrichment through enhanced parenting practices may be beneficial. Baby Triple P for Preterm infants is designed to enhance the knowledge, skills and confidence of parents of preterm infants. It has the potential to make a significant contribution to positive family relationships, good infant development and to the reduction of psychological adjustment difficulties and improved behavioural, language and cognitive development leading to improved educational outcomes all of which are important in functional community contribution in later years.</p><sec id="Sec30"><title>Ethics approval</title><p>Ethical permission to conduct the study has been obtained from Qld Children&#x02019;s Health Services, Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC/08/QRCH/114) and the University of Queensland (2008002268).</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Data sharing statement</title><p>TE, MH, JA will use data from this study to contribute to their PhD theses.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AU</term><def><p>Care as Usual</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomised Controlled Trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IVH</term><def><p>Intraventricular haemorrhage</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PVL</term><def><p>Periventricular leukomalacia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BSID III</term><def><p>Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CA</term><def><p>Corrected age</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CP</term><def><p>Cerebral palsy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GA</term><def><p>Gestational age</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PMA</term><def><p>Post menstrual age</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare they have the following competing interests.</p><p>The Triple P-Positive Parenting Program is owned by the University of Queensland (UQ).
