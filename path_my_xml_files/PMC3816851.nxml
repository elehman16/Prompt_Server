MedDiet interacted significantly with rs7903146 on fasting glucose at baseline (<italic>P</italic> interaction = 0.004). When adherence to the MedDiet was low, TT had higher fasting glucose concentrations (132.3 &#x000b1; 3.5 mg/dL) than CC+CT (127.3 &#x000b1; 3.2 mg/dL) individuals (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001). Nevertheless, when adherence was high, this increase was not observed (<italic>P</italic> = 0.605). This modulation was also detected for total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides (<italic>P</italic> interaction &#x0003c; 0.05 for all).

Neither do we know how diet modulates the associations between this gene and type 2 diabetes, plasma glucose concentrations, plasma lipids, other cardiovascular risk factors, or cardiovascular events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). A deeper understanding of these associations and dietary interactions is crucial for improving existing, or designing new, interventions in primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases in high-risk subjects. The product of <italic>TCF7L2</italic> is a high-mobility box-containing transcription factor that plays a role in activating many genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The mechanism through which the <italic>TCF7L2</italic> is associated with type 2 diabetes has yet to be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), although various hypotheses have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The rs7903146 polymorphism (C&#x0003e;T) is one of the most important genetic variants influencing type 2 diabetes risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). At present, the prevalence of the 7903146T allele, associated with higher type 2 diabetes risk, is lower than that of the C allele in Caucasians. However, Helgason et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) reported that the rs7903146T allele is probably the ancestral allele, suggesting that changes in its prevalence are due to positive selection, driven, among other things, by dietary factors. Thus, a study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) highlighted the north&#x02013;south gradient for the 7903146T allele found in Europe, the frequency of this allele being higher in Mediterranean populations (&#x0223c;0.4) than in Northern Europeans (&#x0223c;0.2). Although there is evidence that the Mediterranean food pattern may reduce type 2 diabetes risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) and cardiovascular disease incidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), no studies have investigated the influence of Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) on <italic>TCF7L2</italic> gene effects. Some investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) have analyzed the interaction between dietary factors and <italic>TCF7L2</italic> gene variation on incidence of type 2 diabetes, but the results are inconclusive. In addition to type 2 diabetes risk and fasting glucose concentrations, the <italic>TCF7L2</italic>-rs7903146 polymorphism has also been associated with other diabetes-related traits such as plasma lipid concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), and even with increased atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Although a few studies have found interactions among dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids, saturated fat, or proteins in determining plasma lipids or metabolic syndrome components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), there are no data on the influence of an overall healthy food pattern, such as the MedDiet pattern, in modulating the associations between the <italic>TCF7L2</italic>-rs7903146 polymorphism and these traits.</p><p>Moreover, no study has examined the influence of a dietary intervention with MedDiet on the effects of the <italic>TCF7L2</italic> polymorphisms on incidence of cardiovascular events. Thus, our aims were <italic>1</italic>) to investigate the influence of prerandomization adherence to the MedDiet pattern in modulating the associations between the <italic>TCF7L2</italic>-rs7903146 polymorphism and fasting glucose, type 2 diabetes, plasma lipids, and incidence of major cardiovascular diseases (stroke and myocardial infarction); and <italic>2</italic>) to assess the modulation of the effect of this polymorphism on the incidence of these cardiovascular events through long-term postrandomization intervention (median &#x0223c;5 years) with MedDiet in a large nutrition intervention trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Subjects</title><p>We included the 7,018 participants (2,993 men and 4,025 women) entering the PREvenci&#x000f3;n con DIetaMEDiterr&#x000e1;nea (PREDIMED) trial from whom DNA was isolated, the <italic>TCF7L2</italic>-rs7903146 polymorphism determined, and who had valid data for the main clinical and lifestyle variables analyzed. The PREDIMED study is a multicenter clinical trial (ISRCTN35739639) aimed at assessing the effects of the MedDiet on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). The completion date of this study was December 2010. The 7,018 participants analyzed did not differ in the main characteristics from those of the total cohort (7,447). Details of this study have been fully described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Briefly, from October 2003, potential high-cardiovascular-risk subjects were selected by physicians in primary care centers. Eligible subjects were community-dwelling people (aged 55&#x02013;80 years for men, 60&#x02013;80 years for women) who fulfilled at least one of two criteria: type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) and three or more cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, BMI &#x02265;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, current smoking, or a family history of premature cardiovascular disease). Exclusion criteria included a personal history of cardiovascular disease, any severe chronic illness, and drug or alcohol addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Participants were randomly assigned to three interventions: MedDiet with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), MedDiet with mixed nuts, and control group (low-fat diet). Participants assigned to both MedDiet groups received intensive training to follow the MedDiet and allotments of either EVOO (50 mL/day) or mixed nuts (30 g/day) at no cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Participants assigned to the control diet received recommendations to reduce the intake of all types of fat. A detailed description of the nutritional interventions has been provided elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Subjects were followed up for a median of 4.8 years (interquartile range 2.8&#x02013;5.8 years). The Institutional Review Board of each participating center approved the study protocol, and all participants provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Demographic, clinical, anthropometric, and dietary measurements</title><p>The baseline examination included assessment of standard cardiovascular risk factors, medication use, sociodemographic factor, and lifestyle variables, as previously detailed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Food consumption was determined by a validated semiquantitative 137-item food frequency questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). The glycemic index (GI) for food and beverage items was estimated by using average values from the 2002 international tables of GI and glycemic load (GL) and expanded in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) with glucose as the reference food. Dietary GL was calculated considering the quality and the amount of carbohydrate (GL = [GI &#x000d7; amount of available carbohydrate]/100) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). A validated 14-item questionnaire indicating the degree of adherence to the traditional MedDiet was also administered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Each question was scored 0 or 1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc13-0955/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>). The final score ranged from 0&#x02013;14. The greater the score, the greater the adherence to the MedDiet. Dichotomous variables of prerandomization adherence to the MedDiet and nutrient intake were created using sample means as cutoff points. Physical activity was estimated by the Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Weight and height were measured with calibrated scales and a wall-mounted stadiometer, respectively. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Outcome ascertainment</title><p>The primary end point was the occurrence of the major cardiovascular events and comprised stroke, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).

All medical records related to end points were examined by the end point adjudication committee, whose members were blind to treatment allocation. Only end points confirmed by the adjudication committee that occurred between 1 October 2003 and 1 December 2010 were included in the analyses. The criteria for adjudicating primary outcomes are detailed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Biochemical determinations, DNA extraction, and genotyping</title><p>At baseline, blood samples were obtained from each participant after an overnight fast, frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C, and shipped to central laboratories for analyses. Fasting glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) were measured using standard enzymatic automated methods as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). In patients whose triglyceride levels were &#x0003c;400 mg/dL, LDL-C concentrations were estimated using the Friedewald formula.

The <italic>TCF7L2</italic>-rs7903146 was genotyped on a 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using a fluorescent allelic discrimination TaqMan assay. The calling rate was &#x0003e;95%; 5% of samples were randomly selected and genotyped a second time, and there were no discrepancies.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests were used to test differences in percentages. Triglycerides were log-transformed for statistical analyses. The <italic>t</italic> and ANOVA tests were applied to compare crude means. Multivariate adjustments for continuous variables were carried out by covariance analysis. Models were adjusted for age, sex, BMI, type 2 diabetes, total energy intake, alcohol consumption, smoking, physical activity, and medications (antidiabetic, lipid-lowering, and antihypertensive drugs). Dichotomous variables for dietary intake and physical activity were created using as cutoff the sample means. Logistic regression methods were also used for prevalence of type 2 diabetes. To test the interaction between the <italic>TCF7L2</italic>-rs7903146 polymorphism, adherence to MedDiet, or the other dietary variables on cardiovascular risk factors at baseline, separate multivariate regression models including the corresponding main effects and interaction terms in addition to control for potential confounders were fitted assuming codominant or recessive genetic effects. Stratified analyses were also carried out. To examine the association between MedDiet and cardiovascular events, we used Cox regression models with the length of follow-up as the primary time variable. The exposure time was calculated as the time between recruitment and the date of death for deceased participants or the last study visit or the last recorded clinical event of participants who did not die. We evaluated the association between both prerandomization adherence to the MedDiet (low and high) and the postrandomization intervention with MedDiet (analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle) and cardiovascular events. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CI for the <italic>TCF7L2</italic>-rs7903146 genotypes were calculated and stratified by MedDiet (prerandomization adherence to the MedDiet or intervention with MedDiet, pooling together the groups supplemented with EVOO and nuts vs. the control group). In the multivariable model 1, covariates were sex, age, and recruitment center and intervention group. A multivariable model 2 was also fitted including additional adjustment for type 2 diabetes, BMI, smoking, drinking, total energy intake, and prerandomization adherence to the MedDiet. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted to estimate the probability of remaining free of myocardial infarction during follow-up. Statistical analyses were performed with the SPSS package, version 17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL).

Likewise, no statistically significant interactions were detected when two categories of other dietary variables (carbohydrates, fiber, GI, GL, total fat, saturated fat, and proteins) were analyzed (results not shown). This may be due in part to the fact that we are dealing with prevalent cases of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, we analyzed how current fasting glucose concentrations are modulated by the MedDiet and the <italic>TCF7L2</italic> polymorphism to better understand the relationship between present dietary intake and a <italic>TCF7L2</italic> polymorphism-related trait.</p><p>We detected a statistically significant interaction (<italic>P</italic> = 0.014) between the <italic>TCF7L2</italic> polymorphism (three categories) and prerandomization adherence to the MedDiet as dichotomous in determining fasting glucose concentrations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc13-0955/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></ext-link>).

Changes in dietary intake by intervention groups in the PREDIMED study have been widely detailed in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). After a mean of 4.8 years of follow-up, we observed a significantly higher incidence of stroke in TT subjects in the control group (HR 3.06 [95% CI 1.43&#x02013;6.59] in the adjusted model including diabetes) compared with CC homozygotes, but no significantly higher risks were observed in the MedDiet intervention groups either when grouped together (HR 1.02 [95% CI 0.52&#x02013;1.99] for TT compared with CC) or considered separately (HR 1.13 [95% CI 0.49&#x02013;2.64] in the MedDiet + EVOO and HR 0.89 [95% CI 0.26&#x02013;2.99] in the MedDiet + nuts).

In this study, however, we have described for the first time that prerandomization adherence to the MedDiet is capable of modulating the effects of the <italic>TCF7L2</italic>-rs7903146 polymorphism on fasting glucose concentrations, so that a higher adherence to the MedDiet attenuates the genetic increase of fasting glucose concentrations in TT individuals. We have consistently observed this effect in the whole population and in both men and women. Moreover, and more important, we have described for the first time that dietary intervention with a randomly assigned MedDiet may modulate the association of the <italic>TCF7L2</italic>-rs7903146 polymorphism with stroke incidence. Although several previous studies have analyzed the association between <italic>TCF7L2</italic> polymorphisms and cardiovascular risk, the results are controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). In the first report of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), <italic>TCF7L2</italic> polymorphisms were not significantly associated with incident coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, or cardiovascular disease in the whole cohort, although greater risk was found in white patients with diabetes (HR 1.21; <italic>P</italic> = 0.04). Some years later, a second reanalysis of the ARIC study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) reported a higher risk of coronary heart disease among lean TT individuals (HR 1.42 [95% CI 1.03&#x02013;1.97]). Muendlein et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>), using a population of Austrian patients undergoing coronary angiography, did report a higher risk of coronary atherosclerosis associated with the 7903146T allele for the whole population (odds ratio 1.29 [95% CI 1.09&#x02013;1.53]), but, in the stratified analysis by diabetes status, they found that this association was strong in type 2 diabetes patients but not in nondiabetic subjects. Conversely, Sousa et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) found in Brazilian patients that the 7903146T allele was associated with a higher prevalence and severity of coronary atherosclerosis in nondiabetic patients. These contradictory results may be due to either the different demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients included in each study or to the contribution of interactions with different environmental factors.</p><p>In our study, although we did not find any significant association of the <italic>TCF7L2</italic>-rs7903146 polymorphism with cardiovascular events on the population as a whole, we did find a very important modulation by the MedDiet on stroke incidence. TT individuals with a lower prerandomization adherence to MedDiet presented a statistically significant higher stroke risk than CC individuals. More important is that, despite this starting point, the intervention with MedDiet over a median of 4.8 years follow-up had a greater influence on stroke. Hence, TT individuals assigned to the control group presented a higher stroke incidence than CC individuals. However, stroke incidence was not greater in TT individuals in the MedDiet intervention groups, so reversing the genetic susceptibility conferred by the <italic>TCF7L2</italic>-rs7903146 polymorphism. These results are especially important given that the allocation to the MedDiet intervention was randomly assigned. No previous study has analyzed the dietary modulation of the <italic>TCF7L2</italic>-rs7903146 polymorphism on cardiovascular events, so more studies are required to confirm our findings. We do not know the mechanisms by which this modulation takes place, but the results obtained in our study do show a significant gene&#x02013;diet interaction between the rs7903146 polymorphism and prerandomization adherence to the MedDiet in determining fasting glucose and plasma lipids, so that higher adherence results in a lower concentration of these cardiovascular risk factors in TT individuals compared with that which they would have with a lower adherence to the MedDiet. The association of the <italic>TCF7L2</italic>- rs7903146 polymorphism with plasma lipids is controversial, and we found great variability in results depending on the different populations analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), suggesting a possible modulation of this association by diet. Although no previous study has analyzed the influence of the MedDiet on this association, some gene&#x02013;diet interactions have indeed been described between <italic>TCF7L2</italic> polymorphisms and several macronutrients in determining plasma lipids; e.g., with dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids in determining fasting VLDL concentrations and postprandial triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in the Genetics of Lipid-Lowering Drugs and Diet Network (GOLDN) study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) and with saturated fat on the metabolic-syndrome related variables in the LIPGENE study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Our findings, however, go further as we have found an interaction with the whole dietary pattern instead of individual components.</p><p>Considering the gene&#x02013;diet interaction with MedDiet that we have found on glycemia and lipids, lower plasma concentrations of these atherogenic factors would lead over time to lower stroke incidence in TT subjects on a MedDiet than in those who are not. The modulation of stroke incidence by MedDiet is observed equally in the MedDiet + EVOO and in the MedDiet + nuts intervention groups, so that our results suggest once again that it is the overall MedDiet pattern rather than specific foods that contribute to not increasing stroke risk in TT individuals. Although we also have found that TT individuals randomly assigned to the control group had a higher incidence of total cardiovascular events, our results did not reach the statistical significance. Taking into account that we have reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) a higher effect of the intervention with MedDiet on reducing stroke incidence than myocardial infarction, the results obtained in our work for the <italic>TCF7L2</italic>-rs7903146 polymorphism are in line with this observation. The major strength of our study is the large sample size in a long-term nutritional intervention randomized trial with MedDiet, which presents the highest level of evidence in nutritional studies. However, the interactive findings on stroke risk after intervention with MedDiet rest on relatively few stroke cases. Despite this limitation, the fact that the results obtained, when considering adherence to the MedDiet at baseline go in the same direction, strengthens this gene&#x02013;diet interaction.</p><p>In conclusion, we have described for the first time that the association between the TT genotype and fasting glucose is modulated by adherence to the MedDiet. This interaction occurs not only for fasting glucose but also for lipids. A greater prerandomization adherence to MedDiet leads to a reduction in fasting glucose, total cholesterol, LDL-C, and triglycerides in TT individuals who have high genetic susceptibility to increased levels compared with other genotypes. Importantly, we observed that intervention with a randomly assigned MedDiet reduced the risk of stroke in TT individuals. These results, based on a dietary intervention study, support the benefits of a MedDiet, especially for genetically susceptible individuals, and emphasize the importance of studying entire dietary patterns rather than individual components.</p></sec>
