Data on the most favorable anesthetic in this context, with the lowest rate of upper airway complications and fast emergence times, are controversial and limited. Desflurane seems to match these criteria best, but large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a standardized study protocol are lacking. Therefore, we aim to compare desflurane with other commonly used anesthetics, sevoflurane and propofol, in a sufficiently powered RCT. We hypothesize that desflurane is noninferior regarding the frequency of upper airway events and superior regarding the emergence times to sevoflurane and propofol.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A total of 351 patients undergoing surgery with an LMA will be included in this prospective, randomized, double-blind controlled, multicenter clinical trial. The patients will be randomly assigned to the three treatment arms: desflurane (<italic>n</italic> = 117), sevoflurane (<italic>n</italic> = 117), and propofol (<italic>n</italic> = 117). The emergence time (time to state the date of birth) will be the primary endpoint of this study. The secondary endpoints include further emergence times, such as time to open eyes, to remove LMA, to respond to command and to state name. Additionally, we will determine the frequency of cough and laryngospasm, measured intraoperatively and at emergence. We will assess the postoperative recovery on the first postoperative day via the Postoperative Quality Recovery Scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite increasing importance of cost-effective and safe anesthesia application, we lack proof for the most advantageous anesthetic agent, when an LMA is used. There are only a few RCTs comparing desflurane to other commonly used anesthetics (sevoflurane, propofol and isoflurane) in patients with LMA. These RCTs were conducted with small sample sizes, huge interstudy variability, and some also showed strong biases. The present multicenter RCT will provide results from a large sample size with a standardized study protocol and minimized bias, which is feasible in the clinical routine. Furthermore, we will expand our knowledge regarding the most favorable recovery on the first postoperative day, which impacts patients&#x02019; comfort after surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>EudraCT Identifier: 2014-003810-96, 5 September 2014</p><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02322502">NCT02322502</ext-link>, December 2014</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-015-0855-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>laryngeal mask airway</kwd><kwd>emergence time</kwd><kwd>airway reaction</kwd><kwd>anesthesia</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background and rationale</title><p>Fundamental pillars of anesthesia care are the safe and measured application of anesthesia. Improvement of facility and resource utilization with a high patient turnover and early discharge of patients from the operating room and hospital is becoming increasingly important. This hinges on a rapid emergence and early recovery from anesthesia. Desflurane&#x02019;s low blood gas coefficient supports general anesthesia (GA) in a fast-track technique, even in obese patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The use of a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) attenuates the risk of postoperative airway-connected complications in comparison to endotracheal tubes (ETT) in GA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Desflurane&#x02019;s possible airway irritant properties compared to other anesthetics like sevoflurane, propofol and isoflurane are still the subject of discussions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, studies comparing the risk of intraoperative upper airway adverse events like cough and laryngospasm (LS) vis-&#x000e0;-vis other common anesthetics are limited. One meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] considered these adverse events in patients with LMA and could not evince a greater incidence with desflurane compared only to sevoflurane anesthesia. Data regarding recovery times were not assessed in this meta-analysis. Therefore, we have recently performed a further meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] comparing desflurane&#x02019;s properties to other commonly used anesthetics with LMA: isoflurane, sevoflurane and propofol. We identified only 13 randomized controlled trials that have analyzed the variables of upper airway adverse events (intraoperative cough (CO), cough at emergence (CE) and laryngospasm (LS)) and the recovery times (time to open eyes (TOE), to remove LMA (TLR), to respond to command (TRC) and time to state date of birth (TSB)). While the frequency of upper airway adverse events did not differ between the analyzed anesthetics, the recovery times in the desflurane groups were superior to the other anesthetic groups. The variable CO showed a non-significant RR (95 % CI) of 1.12 (0.63, 2.02), (<italic>P</italic> = 0.70), between desflurane (<italic>n</italic> = 284) and all other examined anesthetic agents (<italic>n</italic> = 313). CE was only examined after desflurane (<italic>n</italic> = 148) and sevoflurane (<italic>n</italic> = 146) administration and also indicated no difference, RR [95 % CI] of 1.49 (0.55, 4.02), (<italic>P</italic> = 0.43). LS was rare and desflurane (<italic>n</italic> = 262) showed no difference when compared to all other analyzed anesthetics (<italic>n</italic> = 289), or when compared only to sevoflurane, RR (95 % CI) of 1.03 (0.33, 3.20), (<italic>P</italic> = 0.96). All emergence-time variables were significantly faster in the desflurane group. Due to the small sample sizes, huge study protocol distinctions and the fact that the examined variables were mainly secondary endpoints of the included studies, these findings have to be seen within their limits. Additional large randomized controlled trials are indicated to validate the results of our meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives and study design</title><p>This will be a multicenter, controlled, double-blind, randomized, three-arm parallel, interventional clinical study.

To ensure the blinding process, at least two investigators will be needed, when a patient is enrolled in this study. Therefore the screening and enrollment process will be performed according to the logistical possibilities of each center. All potential patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be documented in a screening log kept at each site. The reasons for not enrolling eligible patients will have to be stated in the screening log.</p><p>Inclusion criteria: A written informed consent prior to study participation will be mandatory. Participants in the study have to be adult patients between 18 and 75 years of age. They have to be scheduled to undergo elective surgery with a planned duration of 0.5 to 2 hours and the use of LMA. Both sexes will be included, and further inclusion criteria are an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status 1 to 3 and body mass index (BMI) &#x0003c;35 kg m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>.</p><p>Exclusion criteria: Subjects fulfilling one or more of the following exclusion criteria will not be included in the study: patients with planned additional regional and local anesthesia, with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) grade IV, contraindication for the use of a LMA, known allergy or hypersensitivity to any drugs administered during this study. Furthermore, women who are pregnant, breast-feeding or of childbearing potential and not using adequate contraceptive methods will be excluded. Patients legally unable to give written informed consent, nonfluency in German language, with severe psychiatric or neuropsychiatric disorders or recent (&#x0003c;6 months) history of alcohol or drug abuse will not be included. The participation in a drug or device trial within the previous 30 days will be a further exclusion criterion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>General interventions for all patients</title><p>Premedication: All patients will receive an oral administration of up to 7.5 mg midazolam 30 to 45 minutes preoperatively, according to the clinical routine of each center.</p><p>Induction: Upon arrival into the surgery room, a standard monitoring will be applied to all patients. This will consist of continuous electrocardiogram (ECG), measurement of non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>). A connection of Bispectral Index (BIS) monitoring will follow. After pre-oxygenation with oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub> = 1.0) for 3 minutes via face-mask, all patients will receive remifentanil injection via infusion pump at an initial rate of 0.5 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> over 60 seconds and 1.5 to 2.5 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (plus 2 ml lidocaine 1 %) propofol by bolus titration intravenous (i.v.). After loss of consciousness, the LMA will be inserted and blocked with a cuff pressure at 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. Teeth marks on the device will help to check the correct insertion. The leakage will have to be controlled by applying a positive airway pressure of 25 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. A reassessment will take place after 5 minutes. If the LMA is not tight, a replacement of LMA will follow. After a second failure of LMA placement, an alternative airway will be applied.</p><p>Maintenance: All patients will receive a postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) prophylaxis with 8 mg dexamethasone and 4 mg ondansetron, if the Apfel-Score is &#x02265;2. Analgesia will be maintained with remifentanil injection via infusion pump at a rate of 0.15 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Dosage will be adapted according to clinical needs based on the patient&#x02019;s hemodynamic (difference of NIBP and HR greater than 20 % from baseline), autonomic (sweating, salivation, or flushing) and somatic (movement or swallowing) signs. Twenty minutes before the estimated end of surgery, all patients will receive 0.05 to 0.1 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> piritramide and 15 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> metamizole i.v. The inspired oxygen concentration will be adjusted to 35 to 50 %, or above this range if medically indicated. The end-expiratory CO<sub>2</sub> level during the maintenance of anesthesia should be kept between 36 and 45 mmHg. The use of muscle relaxants is undesired, except for emergency situations. Spontaneous breathing or controlled ventilation with LMA will be applied during maintenance of anesthesia, according to the standard operating procedure of each participating center. Inspired desflurane concentrations of &#x0003e;8 vol. % and sevoflurane &#x0003e;2.2 vol. % have to be avoided. The systolic blood pressure should be kept at &#x02265;90 mmHg (or &#x02265;65 mmHg for mean arterial blood pressure), and a relative variation &#x0003e; 20 % from baseline values has to be avoided and requires appropriate treatment. If indicated additional bolus injection of propofol is permissible in patients.</p><p>End of anesthesia: At five minutes before planned termination of surgery, remifentanil will be discontinued. The LMA will be removed when the upper airway reflexes are fully recovered and the respiratory function is adequate (regular spontaneous breathing with a frequency of at least eight breaths per minute and SaO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003e;95 %) and when the patient opens his/her eyes on request or is able to follow any other requests. In addition, the patient has to be hemodynamically stable before removal of LMA. The patients will be admitted to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) following surgery. They will receive 0.05 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> piritramide if the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain is more than 30.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Specific interventions</title><p>There will be three parallel intervention groups receiving different anesthetics for the maintenance of anesthesia after the induction phase and placement of the LMA.</p><p>Group 1 will receive desflurane. After setting the fresh gas flow at 2l min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, the desflurane vapor will be turned to 12 vol. % until the desired end-expiratory target concentration of 0.8 MAC (minimal alveolar concentration) or 4 to 5 vol. % desflurane is achieved. Thereafter, a reduction of the fresh gas flow to 500 to 1,000 ml will be performed to maintain anesthesia. Desflurane concentration will be adjusted to maintain a BIS index value between 40 and 60. Five minutes before estimated termination of surgery, the vapor will be set to zero. At the end of the surgery maximum fresh gas flow will be applied. This time-point will be defined as time zero (T<sub>0</sub>).</p><p>Group 2 will receive sevoflurane. After setting the fresh gas flow at 2l min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, the sevoflurane vapor will be turned to 8 vol. % until the desired end-expiratory target concentration of 0.8 MAC or 1.2 to 1.4 vol. % sevoflurane is achieved. Thereafter, a reduction of the fresh gas flow to 500-1000ml will be performed to maintain anesthesia. Sevoflurane concentration will be adjusted to maintain a BIS index value between 40 and 60. Five minutes before estimated termination of surgery, the vapor will be set to zero. At the end of the surgery maximum fresh gas flow will be applied. This time-point will be defined as time zero (T<sub>0</sub>).</p><p>Group 3 will receive propofol via infusion pump at an initial rate of 5 to 7 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> propofol and then adjusted to maintain a BIS index value between 40 and 60. Five minutes before estimated termination of surgery the propofol concentration will be halved. Propofol will subsequently be discontinued and maximum fresh gas flow with F<sub>i</sub>O<sub>2</sub> = 1.0 will be applied at the end of surgery. This time-point will be defined as time zero (T<sub>0</sub>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Interventions - modifications</title><p>All drugs used in this trial are anesthetics used daily in the clinical routine of all participating centers.

The time to state the date of birth was chosen, since this variable requires the most conscious answer compared to the other emergence variables.

All sample sizes were calculated using a type 1 error, &#x003b1; = 0.05, and power of 0.80. The primary outcome calculations were carried out based on a one-way analysis of variance (same n) with three groups. The variances and means were estimated for the primary outcome variable time to state the date of birth from our meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. For the sevoflurane, propofol and desflurane groups, means were set to 8.75, 6.8 and 5.6 minutes, respectively. A standard deviation of 3 minutes was considered (these parameters correspond to an effect size (f) of 0.43). A sample size of 19 patients per group is needed to detect such an effect for our superiority hypothesis.</p><p>The sample size for the noninferiority hypothesis was calculated based on the secondary outcome variable cough overall (CO). Using the normal approximation to the binomial and assuming a proportion of the outcome in the population between 0.07 and 0.10 and noninferiority bound of 0.20 a sample size of 81 and 112, respectively, is required to claim noninferiority. The margin delta of 20 % was chosen for clinical considerations. We claim that a difference of cough occurrence up to 20 % is clinically not relevant. This is justified by the result of our meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], where the identified coughs had never lead to a serious impact on the patients&#x02019; outcomes.</p><p>The sample size calculation for noninferiority of treatment is based on a sample size formula published by Blackwelder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Considering data from the literature, a dropout rate of 5 patients per group (for example, requirement of endotracheal intubation, protocol deviations and losses for first postoperative day- follow up) is expected. We decided therefore to include 117 patients per group, to cover the calculated sample size of 19 + 5 patients per group for the superiority hypothesis as well as 112 + 5 patients for the noninferiority hypothesis. Altogether, there will be 351 randomized patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Each participating center will recruit in 5 months as many patients as possible according to their clinical routine during the preoperative anesthesia consultation. Before inclusion of study patients, each center must ensure that at least two investigators are available: one physician for the randomization and the intraoperative visit and the second one for the pre- and postoperative visit. The exact time point of the informed consent has to be documented in written form in the patient source data to enable reproducing the sequence of patient recruitment and randomization, in order to prevent selection bias.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Randomization</title><p>The responsible biostatistician will perform a study-specific computer-generated randomization (study arms, number of blocks and block lengths) according to the study-specific biometric specifications, by using the software framework &#x0201c;R&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The complete randomization list and potential block sizes will only be accessible by the biostatistician of the study. To guarantee adequate allocation concealment, the group assignments will be preserved in sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes and these will be provided to the principle investigator of each center at the beginning of the study by the biostatistician. The principle investigator will ensure that only the unblinded investigators have access to these envelopes and that they will be opened in sequential order of the patients&#x02019; surgery time points. Additionally, he will have to assure that the anesthesia is truly performed according to the assigned intervention, to avoid performance bias. In order to maintain blinding during enrollment and data entry to the electronic case report form (eCRF), two different accounts will be created per center. By utilizing the first user account, access to intraoperative data, as well as randomization, will be possible. Using the second account, entry of pre- and postoperative data will be permitted. Patients in compliance with all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned into one of the three study groups: desflurane, or sevoflurane, or total intravenous anesthesia with propofol.</p><p>Access to randomization is reserved solely to the intraoperative investigator and has to be done shortly before surgery. The time point of envelope opening, the patient initials and the screening number of the patient will be written on the appropriate envelope before it is opened. The envelopes have to be safely stored in the intraoperative patient file. Within a center, the randomization number will occur in succession. The number will contain information about the randomizing study site and the patient sequence. The randomization number will consist of six digits, the first three for the center and the last three for the patient, for example, 001 to 001 (for center 001 and the first patient included). This randomization code will be used to label all information collected for each patient. The monitors of the study will check carefully that the envelopes were really used in the correct sequence and that the signed informed consent occurred definitively before opening of the randomization envelope.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Blinding</title><p>The trial participant and the investigator performing the pre- and postoperative visits will remain blinded throughout the entire study period. The unblinded intraoperative investigator will ensure that the blinded individual is prevented from recognizing which anesthetic was used, by masking the ventilator with an opaque board before the blinded investigator enters the operating room. The blinded investigator will not have access to the anesthesia records until the study participation of each patient is completed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Unblinding procedures</title><p>In the event of medical emergency that requires identification of an individual patient&#x02019;s treatment, blinded investigators will be allowed to contact the unblinded investigator or peruse the anesthesia protocols. The reason must be documented in the patient&#x02019;s medical record and eCRF and must explain why revealing the treatment assignment was essential to guide subsequent intervention and therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Data collection methods</title><p>The coordinating principal investigator will ensure local training to enhance the data collection quality and reduce bias. The investigator will ensure that all assisting study personnel will be adequately qualified and informed about the study protocol, any amendments, study medication and study related responsibilities and functions. The investigator will maintain a study staff authorization log.</p><p>Each center will provide a stopwatch with minutes and seconds to measure awaking times. The modified Aldrete Score and PQRS form are enclosed in the Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref> of the study protocol. After an initial pilot study of 133 patients, the PQRS tool was revised to its current form, and a validation study of 701 participants was conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The VAS and VRS scales are valid, reliable and appropriate for use in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

The time point and specific reason for premature treatment termination of each subject have to be documented. The investigator shall determine a fundamental reason for premature treatment termination of each subject. All relevant safety data until subject&#x02019;s treatment termination will be collected and reported. The study will be terminated in the event the risk-benefit-ratio alters in such a way, that premature treatment termination is indicated to protect a subject&#x02019;s health.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Premature study termination</title><p>Participants may withdraw from the study for any reason at any time. As the follow-up period in this study is only one day, we do not expect many withdrawals. These withdrawals could only imply missing data for the PQRS testing at T40 and on 1<sup>st</sup> POD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Data management</title><p>Standardization procedures will be implemented to ensure accurate, consistent, complete and reliable data, including methods to ensure standardization among sites (for example, training, newsletters, investigator meetings, monitoring, centralized evaluations, and validation methods). The monitors will be trained during a kick-off meeting. Preparatory training to prepare the investigators and to standardize performance will be held during an investigators&#x02019; meeting before study start. This study will be monitored regularly by a qualified monitor from the sponsor Clinical Trial Center Aachen (CTC-A) according to the good clinical practice (GCP) guidelines and the respective SOPs (see Section&#x000a0;<xref rid="Sec28" ref-type="sec">Monitoring</xref>).</p><p>All data collected from a subject during the course of this clinical study have to be entered and/or filed in the respective subject file (CRF, case report forms). These data will be considered as source data. The subject file must contain a detailed statement on the informed consent procedure. The subject&#x02019;s participation in this study must be appropriately documented in the subject file with study number, subject number, date of subject information and informed consent, date of each visit, and date of a potential telephone contact. If a study site is using an electronic system for documenting source data, a member of the site staff must print out the source data after each visit. The paper printouts must be overlapping, if possible (for example, must contain at least the last row of data from the subject&#x02019;s previous visit). Otherwise, the thoroughness of source data must be ensured by other suitable means. The printout must be signed and dated by a member of the site staff who can confirm the accuracy and completeness of data in the paper printout. Additionally, the monitor shall sign and date the verified paper printout. The paper printout shall be stored in the investigator site file (ISF). If the source data information is entered retrospectively, it must be done directly on the paper printout and must be initialed and dated. The same applies to any corrections of initial data. Paper printouts are not required if the site is using a validated computer system, including audit trail, with separate access for the monitor (for example, monitor has solely access to data of the study subjects). If corrections are necessary, the subject shall be instructed to draw a single line through the error, leaving the incorrect entry legible. The subject should date the correction, but not initial it. The investigator shall not falsify the documents. The sponsor&#x02019;s data management function will be responsible for data processing in accordance with the sponsor&#x02019;s data management procedures. Database lock will occur only after quality assurance procedures have been completed.</p><p>All source data related to study data should be kept in locked cabinets. Access to the study data will be restricted. Investigators will enter the information required by protocol into an electronic data collection system via internet (eCRF). The study data manager will develop the eCRF. Detailed information on the eCRF completion will be provided during the site initiation visits. An eCRF completion manual will be provided to each site. An e-learning tool will train all persons who enter data into the eCRF. After the successful completion of the training, all participants will receive a training certificate. The access to the e-learning tool and to the eCRF will be password-controlled. Plausibility checks (including valid values, range checks, and consistency checks) will be performed according to a data validation plan to ensure correctness and completeness of these data. Inconsistencies will be queried via the electronic data collection system; answers to queries or changes of the data will directly be documented in the system. The database will be closed after all data are entered and all queries are solved. By signing the CRF (eCRF/eSignature), the investigator will confirm that all investigations have been completed and conducted in compliance with the clinical study protocol, and that reliable and complete data have been entered into the eCRF. The investigator will keep the subject files and original data as long as possible and according to the local procedure, but at least for 10 years, as specified in the International Conference on Harmonisation, (ICH)-GCP Guideline. The investigator/institution should take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these documents.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>All efficacy, safety and economical results will be presented on the Intention to Treat (ITT) data set, which will be composed of all randomized patients. In case it appears necessary, we will define a secondary Per Protocol (PP) data set prior to the database lock. The PP would be a subset of the ITT data set, composed of all randomized patients who have no major protocol deviations throughout their entire study period. This PP data set would be used for the secondary supportive analysis of the primary efficacy criterion and serve as a check of its robustness.</p><p>Parametric data will be analyzed with ANOVA and nonparametric data with the two-tailed Fisher&#x02019;s exact test if incidence &#x0003c;5 or the Chi-square test with incidence &#x0003e;5.

Monitoring procedures will include one or more visits designed to clarify all prerequisites before the study commences. Interim monitoring visits will take place on a regular basis according to a mutually agreed upon schedule. During these visits, the monitor will check for complete entries in the eCRF/CRF: for compliance with the clinical study protocol, ICH-GCP principles, the Declaration of Helsinki, regulatory authority requirements, for the integrity of the source data with the eCRF/CRF entries, and for subject eligibility. Monitoring will also be used to detect any misconduct or fraud. In addition, the monitor will check whether all adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) have been reported appropriately within the required time periods. The investigator and all staff will be expected to cooperate with the monitor by providing any missing information whenever possible. The investigator must be available to answer questions arising during regular monitoring visits.

Auditors conduct their work independently of the clinical study and its performance. Contract auditors may also perform audits. In that case, the sponsor&#x02019;s quality assurance function will agree with the contract auditor regarding the timing and extent of the audit(s).

There were no significant differences regarding the frequency of upper airway complications during the anesthesia or at emergence, though the emergence times in the desflurane group were faster. Due to the small sample sizes of these trials and enormous trial inconsistencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], there remains a lack of evidence confirming the results of our previous meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Furthermore there was a high risk of performance bias in all trials and only two have precisely described the randomization process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In the present large multicenter RCT, all patients will receive the same dosage of additional agents (for example, lidocaine at induction, the same kind of opioids and no muscle relaxants) in regard on their possible impact on the outcome variables. It is not feasible to blind the attending anesthetist to the intervention group. Therefore, we aim to minimize the performance bias by providing a strict but in clinical routine feasible study protocol for the intervention performance. A second, blinded investigator will assess the pre- and postoperative outcome data to reduce the detection bias to a minimum.</p><p>Furthermore, the previous trials analyzed in our meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] mainly included ASA I-II patients. However, ASA III patients would also benefit from the LMA, especially in regard to significantly better hemodynamic stability at anesthesia induction and during the emergence. The inclusion of ASA III patients in our RCT will allow us to extend our findings to this patient group. Finally, the recovery on the 1<sup>st</sup> POD was only assessed in four reviewed trials with different assessment methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>We have chosen the PQRS test, as it was also validated for the assessment of later recovery in patients remaining in the hospital as well as via telephone questionnaire once the patient was discharged home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. We will perform the PQRS testing on the 1<sup>st</sup> POD in all patients, either on the ward or via telephone. Another significant advantage of our RCT is that the recruitment and conduction process can work within the usual clinical routine.</p><sec id="Sec40"><title>Risk benefit assessment</title><p>All drugs used in this trial are anesthetics that have been used in the daily clinical routine for many years. Harms are not expected for any study group. If desflurane enables significant faster emergence from anesthesia, it would have a positive impact on the patient recovery from anesthesia with probably faster discharge times. This would certainly enhance patient comfort and improve cost effectiveness.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Trial status</title><p>Patient recruitment started at the end of February 2015.
