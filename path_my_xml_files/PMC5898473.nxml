Smoking reduction may be a viable treatment approach if it prompts quit attempts and subsequent abstinence.

Patients not ready to quit within the next month but willing to reduce their smoking, were randomised to receive either intensive smoking reduction counselling plus combination NRT or a single information meeting plus self-help manual. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months. The primary outcome is&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;1-year prolonged abstinence. Secondary outcomes are point prevalence abstinence, successful (i.e.&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;50%) smoking reduction, and incidence of quit attempts reported at follow-up assessments. Smoking status is biochemically verified by salivary cotinine and expired CO.

However, only 22.5% of Dutch smoking COPD patients are ready to quit smoking (i.e. intending to quit within one month) <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Current treatments of tobacco dependence, almost exclusively aiming at (abrupt) cessation, are thus not appealing to many, or even most, smoking COPD patients and unlikely to motivate them to enrol. Approaches that could coax these reluctant patients into smoking cessation treatment are therefore urgently needed.</p><p id="p0020">Smoking reduction could be such an approach; a systematic review of smoking reduction trials showed that nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) as well as combined pharmacological and behavioural smoking reduction interventions increase long-term cessation among otherwise healthy smokers who are initially not ready to quit <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p id="p0025">Offering assistance to reduce smoking may also persuade reluctant COPD patients to engage in tobacco dependence treatment and successful smoking reduction may facilitate complete cessation in this specific patient group <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. However, as far as we are aware, no smoking reduction interventions specifically targeting COPD patients not ready to quit smoking have yet been developed or tested. This constituted the rationale for the REDUQ (REDUce and Quit) trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.2"><label>1.2</label><title>Objectives and hypotheses</title><p id="p0035">The primary objective of the REDUQ trial is to determine whether intensive smoking reduction counselling plus combination NRT is effective in promoting long-term abstinence in COPD patients not ready to quit, compared to a single information meeting plus a self-help manual as a control condition. Other objectives are to: (1) assess the effects of the intervention on point prevalence abstinence rates, reduction rates, number of quit attempts, intention and motivation to quit, attitude, social influence and self-efficacy; (2) investigate whether successful reduction (&#x02265;50% compared to baseline) and cessation influence health-related outcomes such as lung function and quality of life; (3) identify factors that moderate the effects of the intervention, as well as mechanisms through which intervention effects occur; and (4) estimate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.</p><p id="p0040">A priori, we hypothesised that the intensive NRT-aided smoking reduction intervention will result in higher reduction and (prolonged) abstinence rates compared to a self-help intervention and that the higher abstinence rate will primarily be the result of an increased number of patients who &#x02013; after successful smoking reduction &#x02013; decide to participate in a subsequent cessation programme.</p><p id="p0045">The aim of this paper is to describe the design, methodology, and analysis plan of the REDUQ trial.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Study design and ethics</title><p id="p0050">We conducted a two-site, parallel group, randomised controlled trial (RCT) with 18 months follow-up. Smoking COPD outpatients not ready to quit smoking were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to an intervention group (intensive group smoking reduction counselling plus free combination NRT) or control group (single information meeting plus self-help manual on smoking reduction). For participants in either group it was optional to participate in a concurrent smoking cessation programme as soon as they were ready to quit. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> shows a flowchart of the study design.<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flowchart of study design.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0010">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p><p id="p0055">The primary outcome is biochemically validated prolonged abstinence of at least one year at the final follow-up. The study was performed at the outpatient pulmonary clinics of Medisch Spectrum Twente (MST) Enschede and University Medical Centre (UMC) Groningen in the Netherlands.</p><p id="p0060">The study protocol was approved by the accredited Medical Research Ethics Committee (MREC) Twente (P09-22/NL30620044) and subsequently by the Board of Directors of both centres.

Patients not meeting these criteria, and those who were pregnant or intended to become pregnant within the next 18 months, had a serious psychological condition, were contraindicated for all types of NRT, or had insufficient comprehension of the Dutch language, were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Recruitment and screening</title><p id="p0070">Patients were recruited from medical records, by their chest physician during outpatient visits, through leaflets and posters in waiting rooms, and through advertisements in local newspapers. Potential participants were screened via telephone to determine interest in participation and initial eligibility. As we aimed to recruit patients not (yet) ready to quit smoking, we felt that it might be counterproductive to set abstinence as the primary treatment goal. Therefore, we communicated to potential participants that smoking cessation was highly recommended but not mandatory for participation and that the treatment programme would focus on smoking reduction, allowing patients to gradually take control of their smoking. We emphasised, however, that smoking cessation is the best way to change the course of the disease and that it was possible to engage in smoking cessation treatment during the entire study period as soon as a participant expressed readiness to quit.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><label>2.4</label><title>Information and consent</title><p id="p0075">Patients who were eligible following the initial screening were sent a study information letter and an informed consent form. In addition, they were invited to attend an orientation meeting to more fully explain the study and review the consent form. After written informed consent was obtained, patients were scheduled for a visit with a chest physician to assess final eligibility (i.e. verifying COPD GOLD stage and ruling out serious psychiatric morbidity) and, if found eligible, to undergo baseline assessments. Patients were informed that they could withdraw from the study at any time, without any consequences for their subsequent treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><label>2.5</label><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p id="p0080">After completing baseline assessments, the patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either one of the study groups, using a computer-generated randomisation list prepared by a staff member with no involvement in the trial. Randomisation was stratified according to centre and nicotine dependence (Fagerstr&#x000f6;m Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> score&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;6 versus&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;6) with variable block sizes of two and four. The allocation sequence was concealed until the interventions were assigned. Each patient was aware of the content of the intervention to which he or she was allocated, but unaware of whether it was the experimental or control condition. Research staff involved in follow-up remained blind to treatment allocation as much as possible and staff carrying out the primary outcome assessments (i.e. biochemical validation of smoking status) remained blind to study group assignment.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><label>2.6</label><title>Interventions</title><sec id="sec2.6.1"><label>2.6.1</label><title>Intensive smoking reduction intervention</title><sec id="sec2.6.1.1"><label>2.6.1.1</label><title>Theoretical foundation</title><p id="p0085">The theoretical foundation of the smoking reduction intervention is primarily formed by two models to explain and change health behaviours: the TTM <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and the Attitude&#x02013;Social influence&#x02013;self-Efficacy (ASE) model <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The TTM recognizes behaviour change as a process that unfolds over time, involving progress through five stages <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, each representing a different temporal and motivational aspect of behavioural change <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The first three stages describe individuals' readiness to quit smoking. These stages include: (a) pre-contemplation, when smokers have no intention to quit; (b) contemplation, when smokers express an intention to quit smoking within six months, but not within the next month; and (c) preparation, when smokers plan to quit smoking within the next month. When individuals have quit smoking and been abstinent up to six months, they are in the action stage. They are considered to be in the maintenance stage if they have been abstinent for more than six months after initial quitting. The REDUQ intervention is stage-based in the sense that it is designed to match smoking COPD patients in the pre-contemplation or contemplation stage of smoking cessation and help them progress from these stages to action and maintenance.</p><p id="p0090">The ASE model, which is the core of the Integrated Change (I-Change) model <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, served as the theoretical framework for the analysis of the determinants of motivational and behavioural change, and for intervention development. According to the ASE model, the most proximal determinant of behaviour is the intention to perform this behaviour. Intention, in turn, is determined by three motivational constructs: attitude, consisting of the perceived advantages and disadvantages of the behaviour (change); social influence, including perceived social norms, social modelling and social support/pressure; and self-efficacy, or a person's level of confidence to perform the behaviour. These cognitive constructs are influenced by various distal factors such as predisposing factors (i.e. behavioural, psychological, biological, social and cultural factors), awareness factors (i.e. knowledge, cues to action, risk perception) and information factors (i.e. message, channel, source). Finally, a person's abilities (e.g. being able to create and execute action plans, actual behavioural skills) and perceived barriers can increase or decrease the likelihood that intentions will be transferred into actions <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6.1.2"><label>2.6.1.2</label><title>Intervention delivery</title><p id="p0095">The intervention was delivered by experienced counsellors of the hospitals' in-house smoking cessation services and consisted of eight small-group sessions and four telephone counselling sessions in between group meetings, and provision of free combination NRT. The group sessions were sequenced and gradually faded over time. Each group session lasted 90&#x000a0;minutes, except for the first session (120&#x000a0;minutes), and comprised of education, group discussion, sharing of experiences, and strategies to improve participants' self-efficacy to achieve and sustain reduced smoking levels. Patients received a comprehensive workbook, containing written information on all aspects of the intervention and homework assignments to be carried out prior to each session. The telephone sessions (10&#x000a0;minutes each) were tailored to the individuals' needs and progress towards the reduction objective and addressed, for example, current smoking status and experiences with smoking reduction and NRT. <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Appendix A</xref> provides a session-by-session outline of the intervention components.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6.1.3"><label>2.6.1.3</label><title>Methods and techniques</title><p id="p0100">Elements from cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, relapse prevention (RP) <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP) <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> were used such as self-monitoring, goal setting, changing unhelpful thoughts/attitudes, teaching problem-solving strategies, exercises to cope with craving symptoms and negative affect, and preventing and learning from relapses.</p><p id="p0105">Motivational interviewing (MI), a client-centred counselling method, was used to facilitate the participants' internal motivation to reduce and/or quit smoking by identifying dissonance between behaviours and values and resolving ambivalence <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Specific motivational techniques included, for example, scaling in the form of importance and confidence rulers, decisional balancing, reflective listening and evoking change talk.</p><p id="p0110">To reduce smoking, we used &#x02018;scheduled reduced smoking&#x02019;, a procedure where smokers are instructed to smoke only at pre-specified times of the day and the interval between cigarettes is progressively increased <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. By controlling the timing of smoking, associations between cues (e.g. presence of others smoking) and smoking behaviour are attenuated and smokers are forced to use coping strategies to overcome urges to smoke, yielding increased self-efficacy to quit <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. For each participant, individualised smoking reduction schedules were constructed according to his or her baseline smoking rate, daily wakening cycle and success at meeting intermediate reduction goals. The first treatment week, participants were expected to follow a schedule with set smoking times without reducing daily cigarette consumption. Participants were subsequently instructed to reduce their smoking by 25% compared to baseline from week 2 to week 4 and by 50% in the subsequent four weeks (week 4&#x02013;week 8). At each meeting, patients who were unsuccessful in meeting their (intermediate) reduction goal were motivated to reach this goal by the next meeting. From week 8 to week 13, those successful in achieving a 50% or greater reduction were highly encouraged to consider cessation and enter smoking cessation treatment. If they were not ready to quit smoking completely they were given the options to reduce further (e.g. 75% reduction compared to baseline) or maintain their current level of reduced smoking. Those who did not reach a reduction of at least 50% were encouraged to continue working on the 50% reduction goal. From three months onwards, all participants were encouraged to consider cessation, regardless of the reduction achieved at that point. Participants persistently unmotivated to quit were invited to contact the research team throughout the remainder of the study if they changed their mind.</p><p id="p0115">To aid smoking reduction, from week 2 through week 13, participants were provided with combination NRT, consisting of a long-acting patch (Nicotinell<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> TTS 30/20/10) to provide a constant concentration of nicotine to relieve cravings and tobacco withdrawal symptoms plus a short-acting oral product of their choice (Nicotinell<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 2&#x000a0;mg gum, lozenge or sublingual tablet) to be administered ad lib for immediate relief of breakthrough cravings and withdrawal symptoms. In accordance with the smoking schedule, participants were instructed to replace a cigarette missed with a type of acute NRT and encouraged to use this sufficiently to avoid smoking more than quota. Dosing of the patch was based on the number of cigarettes smoked per day at baseline and the (intermediate) reduction goal.

In addition, a non-tailored self-help manual was provided, describing the scheduled reduced smoking procedure and other ways to reduce smoking. The manual also contained tips on how to cope with urges to smoke and stress, and how to prevent relapse. Participants received no formal behavioural counselling for smoking reduction and there was no face-to-face contact except for the measurements at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months. NRT was recommended but at the patients' own expense.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6.3"><label>2.6.3</label><title>Smoking cessation intervention</title><p id="p0125">An integral part of this study was that as soon as a participant of either group expressed readiness to quit, he was encouraged to enter the SmokeStopTherapy (SST) <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, a proven effective, high-intensity group smoking cessation programme for COPD patients delivered within the same outpatient clinic. To enable participants to enter this cessation treatment without delay due to group formation intervals, an individual counselling version of the SST was also offered. This individual smoking cessation treatment was generally similar to the original group-based intervention with regard to the topics and intensity. SST in both intervention components and overall intensity. It consisted of five to eight individual sessions of 20&#x000a0;minutes each, depending on the needs and wishes of the participant, and two to three telephone contacts of 10&#x000a0;minutes each.</p><p id="p0130">To aid smoking cessation, participants were provided with free NRT, bupropion (Zyban<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) or varenicline (Champix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>/Chantix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>). Smoking cessation treatment was offered alongside the patients' continued participation in their assigned reduction intervention, which enabled them to act as role models to other reduction group members.

The training also included readings on smoking reduction and cessation, motivational interviewing, CBT, and mindfulness. The second session was on-site and discussed in detail the counselling manual, the patients' workbook and audio-visual materials to support the group sessions. During the entire study, the counsellors used the manual and audio-visual materials, which enabled them to provide standardized counselling during each session. &#x02018;Hands-on&#x02019; supervision was available for the first two to three group meetings. The research team contacted the counsellors before and after a treatment session, for case-sharing and evaluation.

One to two weeks before each assessment, participants were sent an invitation and a paper-and-pencil questionnaire, which they were asked to complete and bring to their appointment. To minimise the burden for participants, assessment visits were scheduled before or after a group counselling session where possible. At each assessment visit, questionnaires were collected and checked for completeness. Lung function was assessed by post-bronchodilator spirometry at baseline and final follow-up. Weight measurements were obtained at each assessment visit using a calibrated medical scale. To verify self-reported smoking status, all participants, not only those who reported being abstinent, were asked to provide a saliva sample for cotinine assessment as well as a carbon monoxide (CO) sample at each visit. Saliva was collected in a plastic vial containing a sterile dental cotton roll (Salivette<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Sarstedt, N&#x000fc;mbrecht, Germany). Participants were asked to chew the cotton roll for one&#x000a0;minutes and to replace it in the tube without touching it.

The accuracy and precision of the method and instrumentation were checked by means of reference samples. The CO concentration in expired air was obtained using a handheld Micro III Smokerlyzer (Bedfont Scientific, Maidstone, Kent, England). Patients were requested to inhale and hold their breath for 15&#x000a0;seconds before exhaling into the analyser.

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first RCT to assess whether an NRT-aided smoking reduction intervention is (cost-)effective in achieving prolonged abstinence in smoking COPD patients not ready to quit.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><label>3.1</label><title>Limitations</title><p id="p0245">This study has a number of limitations. An important consideration is that the intervention group actually received three interventions: scheduled reduced smoking, behavioural counselling, and combination NRT. Moreover, the behavioural intervention comprised many components (e.g. motivational interviewing, skills training, relapse prevention). This makes it difficult to identify the relative importance of each component. However, as the primary goal of the REDUQ study is to assess the overall effectiveness of a multicomponent reduction approach, the current design is adequate for this purpose. If the REDUQ intervention appears to be effective, future studies may be useful to identify which particular components are most important in achieving sustained reduction and cessation.</p><p id="p0250">It should also be noted that in this study, participants in the intervention group were provided free of charge with combination NRT, whereas participants in the control group were only encouraged to use NRT at their own expense. Consequently, some control participants may have used NRT, while others have not. Prohibiting the use of NRT in the control group would have reduced the within-group variability to some extent. However, it would have increased the between-group variability and reduced the ecological validity of the study, because in the Netherlands over-the-counter NRT is readily available and can be used by smokers in the population to which we wish to generalise. We therefore will attempt to conduct additional analyses to examine the effect of NRT use between and within groups. However, as we have noted above, the goal of the current study is primarily to demonstrate increased efficacy of the complete intervention over a brief self-help intervention.</p><p id="p0255">The self-help control treatment is not a true &#x02018;placebo&#x02019; intervention, as it contains potentially effective elements. This may conceal the full effectiveness of the REDUQ intervention when compared to no intervention. However, available evidence from smoking cessation research suggests only a small effect is to be expected from the use of standard self-help materials on quit rates compared with no intervention <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. In addition, no-treatment controls might be more likely to seek help elsewhere during the study due to disappointment about their allocation, leading to a greater potential for contamination by external interventions and/or differential dropout between groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><label>3.2</label><title>Strengths of the study</title><p id="p0260">This study also has a number of strengths. First, the study is innovative as it addresses three important issues in one design:<list list-type="simple" id="olist0010"><list-item id="o0010"><label>1.</label><p id="p0265">It may engage reluctant (i.e. not ready to quit) smoking COPD patients into tobacco dependence treatment, who would have otherwise refrained from seeking help and remained smoking as usual.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0015"><label>2.</label><p id="p0270">It has been shown that smoking cessation, even intermittent cessation, reduces the accelerated decline in lung function due to tobacco smoke <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Reduced smoking may serve as a strategy to shorten the intervals between quit attempts and provide an intermediate step towards complete cessation, while minimising health damage.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0020"><label>3.</label><p id="p0275">The REDUQ programme offers a continuum of treatment for a chronic dependency, integrating smoking reduction treatment and smoking cessation treatment into a more comprehensive tobacco control approach. Hereby, it accommodates shifts through episodes of smoking reduction and abstinence, whereby lapses and relapses are not regarded as treatment failures but part of the behaviour change process.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="p0280">Second, the trial was set up to explore whether smoking reduction facilitates smoking abstinence in COPD patients who are currently not ready to quit smoking rather than evaluating this method as a way to quit. By targeting reluctant patients instead of patients highly motivated to quit, we expect our trial to reflect this population more truly, and as such to approach everyday clinical COPD care.</p><p id="p0285">Third, the length of follow-up (i.e. 18 months) is also a major strength of this study. Since the primary goal of our trial was cessation induction among patients not ready to quit, it is unlikely that they would begin a cessation attempt early in the study. On the contrary, quit attempts may only occur well after the smoking reduction phase of 12 weeks and a considerable follow-up period is needed to capture such delayed treatment effects. Also, a relatively long follow-up may approach lifelong tobacco abstinence more closely and be more appropriate to detect changes in health outcomes.</p><p id="p0290">A fourth strength is the biochemical verification of smoking status, which has been recommended by the Subcommittee on Biochemical Verification of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco (SRNT) to be used in harm reduction studies and in patients with smoking related diseases <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Self-reporting of cessation by COPD patients is not always trustworthy and misreporting rates up to 52% have been found <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, thus overestimating treatment effectiveness systematically if not corrected for. The dual use of exhaled CO and salivary cotinine for the assessment of smoking status at all measurement points allows for the validation of smoking status, regardless of continued NRT use. More importantly, this study will contribute to the limited knowledge on biochemical validation of smoking reduction. This may be an even more critical issue than in cessation trials because of compensatory smoking behaviour <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> and recall error.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>3.3</label><title>Conclusions and implications</title><p id="p0295">Despite the urgent need for quitting, prevalence of smoking is high in COPD patients. The outcomes of the REDUQ trial will advance knowledge and treatment of smoking COPD patients not (yet) ready to quit. Specifically, if found to be (cost-)effective, the smoking reduction intervention can be an important treatment modality for this difficult-to-treat target group.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0300">This work was supported by the <funding-source id="gs1">Netherlands Lung Foundation</funding-source> (grant number 3.4.08.036).

Owing to possible contra-indications, cardiologists had to approve the delivery of NRT for patients with cardiac comorbidities. Nicotine patches were administered for 24&#x000a0;hours/day. Dosing of the patch was as follows. Participants who smoked less than 20 cigarettes per day at baseline were instructed to use a daily 7&#x000a0;mg patch for two weeks (weeks 2&#x02013;4: 25% reduction phase), followed by a 14&#x000a0;mg patch for the next four weeks (weeks 4&#x02013;8: 50% reduction phase). Participants who smoked 20 cigarettes per day or more at baseline were instructed to begin with a 14&#x000a0;mg patch for two weeks (25% reduction phase), followed by a 21&#x000a0;mg patch for the next four weeks (50% reduction phase). In addition to patch, participants had free choice of 2&#x000a0;mg gum, 2&#x000a0;mg sublingual tablets or 2&#x000a0;mg lozenges. They were instructed to use their preferred oral product when smoking reduction was difficult because they felt irritable, edgy, and experienced urges to smoke when smoking was &#x02018;not allowed&#x02019; according to their smoking schedule and to use NRT sufficiently to avoid smoking more than quota. From week 8&#x02013;13, all participants were asked to taper off the dose. As off week 13, NRT was no longer provided free of charge, but patients were allowed to continue NRT up to the six-month assessment at their own expense.</p><p id="p0330">At each session while using the patch, participants were asked about side effects they might be experiencing. Participants who experienced problems with insomnia or difficulties with vivid dreams were instructed to use the patch for 16&#x000a0;hours daily, instead of 24&#x000a0;hours. Participants who had skin reactions to the patch that were not controlled by using other locations, switched to short-acting NRT only. Participants who showed symptoms of overdose had the dose reduced. Although participants were strongly encouraged to use both a patch and a short-acting form of NRT concurrently, they were allowed to use only one form of NRT to satisfy their wishes and to avoid non-compliance. Also, they were allowed to change their NRT at any time during the trial.</p></sec></sec><ack id="ack0010"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We wish to thank the pulmonary staff and COPD outpatients of Medisch Spectrum Twente Enschede and University Medical Centre Groningen for their time and willingness to participate in this study.
