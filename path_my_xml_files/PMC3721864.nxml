It is now the source of much of the knowledge on the risk of CHD and is synonymous with the &#x02018;risk factor hypothesis&#x02019;.</p><p>The use of the FRA tool is especially important as it is designed to estimate risk in adults who do not yet have CHD. The FRA tool also determines CHD risk from a group of variables (i.e. age, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), rather than from a single variable.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R09">9</xref> This FRA score can then be utilised to identify patients for primary or preventative treatments, including exercise.</p><p>Over several decades, volumes of information have been produced on aerobic training, its adaptations and its benefits in preventing CHD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> Although the specific cardioprotective benefits of aerobic training are well known, resistance training is becoming increasingly popular among the general public and individuals who have substantial mobility limitations (especially the elderly), which preclude aerobic methods of exercise. This necessitated the determination of the effects of this mode of training on CHD risk. Research may reveal additional benefits from the inclusion of resistance training with or instead of more traditional modes of aerobic exercise. Well-known benefits of resistance training include increased muscle strength, increased lean tissue mass, maintenance of or increase in metabolically active tissue, and increased neuromuscular control and coordination.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></p><p>While it is commonly accepted that resistance training should be regarded as a complementary mode of exercise and not a substitute for aerobic training,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> unfortunately, it is not well understood what the effect of a concurrent aerobic and resistance training programme would be on CHD risk factors. Just as CHD is not a single condition, no single exercise-training programme is optimal for risk reduction in all individuals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> Furthermore, while the necessary quantity and intensity of exercise for the primary prevention of CHD are becoming understood, most research to date focuses on the effect of a single mode of exercise on a single CHD risk variable in isolation.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of aerobic exercise alone, with that of aerobic combined with resistance training on the FRA scores of young males with few CHD risk factors. A finding that a combination of aerobic and resistance training could reduce several CHD risk factors simultaneously would be of critical importance, due to the synergistic benefits to be gained from each mode of exercise.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2a"><title>Methods</title><p>Thirty-seven sedentary young adult males volunteered to participate in this study (mean age 25 years and six months).

Although their study supports the findings of the present study, that concurrent training reduced systolic blood pressure, the study of Pierson <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> refutes these findings as they found unchanged systolic blood pressure values following concurrent training.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings are noteworthy since the addition of resistance training to aerobic training can now be considered an alternative and effective treatment to reduce the risk and prevalence of CHD in males. Participation in activities that require both aerobic and resistance components should be considered in future as a tool to lower absolute risk for CHD, since each mode of exercise has unique benefits.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to the University of Johannesburg (formerly Rand Afrikaans University), Johannesburg, South Africa for the use of their laboratories at
