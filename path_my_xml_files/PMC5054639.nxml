Data were obtained from 13 sites and included 2500 patients. The design of these studies allowed for the evaluation of large numbers of patients with reduced bias.

Notably, if surgeons better selected patients for surgery, requiring a significant neurological deficit and neuroradiological lesions, and avoided unnecessary procedures for &#x0201c;black discs alone&#x0201d; or pain alone, the results of surgical intervention would likely be more clearly confirmed.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Surgical vs. nonoperative treatment for lumbar disk herniations: The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT): A randomized trial</title><p>Weinstein <italic>et al</italic>. in 2006 evaluated surgical vs. non-surgical treatment for lumbar disc herniations utilizing the SPORT database in a randomized fashion.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>They identified 501 surgical candidates with neurodiagnostic studies confirming lumbar intervertebral disc herniations who had exhibited at least 6 weeks of radiculopathy. Patients underwent &#x0201c;standard open discectomy&#x0201d; vs. non-operative treatment. Outcomes were assessed with the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) and modified Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 and 2 years from the time of enrollment. Notably, there were some problems in the study design: &#x0201c;50% of patients assigned to surgery received surgery within 3 months of enrollment, while 30% of those assigned to non-operative treatment received surgery in the same period.&#x0201d; They found &#x0201c;Patients in both the surgery and the non-operative treatment groups improved substantially over a 2-year period.&#x0201d; However, the large numbers of patients who crossed over did not lead to a clear conclusion regarding the benefits of either treatment modality.</p><p><bold>Comments:</bold> This study nicely highlighted the difficulty in obtaining significant data regarding the superiority of one treatment modality over another. Here, the randomized design was clearly contaminated by &#x0201c;crossovers&#x0201d; in both directions. That is, those initially choosing surgery opted for conservative care with others initially opting for conservative treatment later undergoing surgery. Therefore, although the numbers were large, and the theoretical design excellent, the authors had to clearly confront their inability to claim superiority of surgery over non-operative care. I congratulate the authors for their honesty and attempts to conduct such a complex study. It is interesting to note that the cohort study performed simultaneously appeared to indicate superiority of surgery vs. non -operative intervention for the treatment of lumbar disc herniations.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Surgical vs. non-operative treatment for lumbar disk herniation: The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) observational cohort</title><p>Weinstein <italic>et al</italic>. in 2006 evaluated the relative efficacy of diskectomy vs. non-operative care for lumbar discs. In this study, they prospectively evaluated &#x0201c;a cohort of potential&#x0201d; surgical candidates with neurodiagnostic confirmation of lumbar disc herniations treated in 13 centers in 11 states (met SPORT criteria but declined randomization).[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Outcomes were assessed using the SF-36 for bodily pain and physical function scales and a modified ODI. There were 528 of 743 patients enrolled who underwent spinal surgery; 191 were treated without surgery. Three months later, patients who opted for surgery demonstrated greater improvement: &#x0201c;bodily pain (mean change: surgery, 40.9 vs. non-operative care, 26.0); physical function (mean change: surgery, 40.7 vs. non-operative care, 25.3). They also showed greater improvement on the ODI: &#x02212;36.1 vs. non-operative care, &#x02212;20.9. The authors concluded that although all patients improved, those undergoing surgery demonstrated consistently better results. They also cautioned that these data were culled from a non-randomized group of patients (e.g., unlike the subsequent study).</p><p><bold>Comments:</bold> The study involved a large sample of patients, but was admittedly a prospective cohort study, in which there were many more patients (528 patients) in the operative vs. non-operative groups (191 patients). However, they nicely demonstrated utilizing two major patient-based outcome measures (SF-36 and ODI) that those undergoing operative intervention showed better outcomes than those managed without surgery.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Surgical versus non-operative treatment for lumbar disc herniations: four-year results for the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT)</title><p>Weinstein <italic>et al</italic>. in 2008 published their concurrent, prospective, randomized, and observational cohort study looking at the 4-year outcomes of surgery versus non-operative care for lumbar discs.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] There were 501 prospective, randomized patients and 743 cohort patients in this study.

Note that the operative modality was a &#x0201c;standard open procedure&#x0201d;: This likely accounted for the better surgical outcomes as too many of the minimally invasive techniques leave pathology behind (e.g. residual discs or insufficient disc resection contributing to recurrent discs) or cause inadvertent neural or dural injury due to inadequate exposure.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Surgical versus non-operative treatment for lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis; four-year results in the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT)</title><p>Weinstein <italic>et al</italic>. in the 2009 SPORT trial (13 centers/11 states) evaluated 4-year postoperative results of surgical versus non-operative treatment of degenerative spondylolisthesis.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Patients were symptomatic for at least 12 weeks&#x02019; duration and had studies documenting degenerative spondylolisthesis with spinal stenosis (randomized cohort or observational cohort), treated with decompressive laminectomies (with or without fusion) versus non-operative care. Outcomes were assessed utilizing the SF-36 and ODI scales starting at 6 weeks and extending up to 4 postoperative years. The authors concluded; &#x0201c;compared with patients who are treated non-operatively, patients in whom degenerative spondylolisthesis and associated spinal stenosis are treated surgically maintain substantially greater pain relief and improvement in function for four years.&#x0201d;</p><p><bold>Comments:</bold> In this large SPORT study, patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis were treated with decompressive laminectomy (with or without fusion) versus non-operative care.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Four years later, they found that those managed surgically had better outcomes. Large SPORT trial databases better enable us to answer basic questions like this one; does surgery help patients with stenosis/spondylolisthesis versus non-operative treatment? The answer was &#x0201c;yes,&#x0201d; and this was accomplished with substantially greater validity due to the large data base utilized in this SPORT study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Degenerative spondylolisthesis: does the fusion method influence outcome?</title><p>Abdu <italic>et al</italic>. in 2009 compared outcomes of different fusion methods to treat degenerative spondylolisthesis.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Data were obtained from 13 centers in 11 states [Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT)]. The 380 patients selected were symptomatic for at least 12 weeks, and underwent the following surgical procedures; decompressive laminectomy with posterolateral <italic>in situ</italic> fusion (21%; PLF 80 patients), posterolateral instrumented fusion with pedicle screws (56%; Pedicle Screws (PS) 213 patients), pedicle screws plus interbody fusion (17%; 63 patients 360 degree surgery), or laminectomies alone (6%). Outcomes were assessed at 1.5, 3, 6 months, and yearly up to 4 postoperative years utilizing the SF-36 and the modified ODI. At 2 years, 360 fusions showed better outcomes, but &#x0201c;no consistent differences in clinical outcomes were seen among fusion groups over 4 years.&#x0201d; In short, non-instrumented and instrumented fusions yielded comparable results.</p><p><bold>Comments:</bold> This large SPORT database study, evaluated 380 patients variously treated with decompressive laminectomy with posterolateral <italic>in situ</italic> fusion, posterolateral instrumented fusion/pedicle screws, pedicle screws plus interbody fusion (360 degree procedures), or laminectomies alone.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Outcomes were assessed at 4 postoperative years using major validated questionnaires (SF-36, ODI).

Outcomes were again assessed utilizing the SF-36 Bodily Pain and Physical Function scales and the modified ODI (e.g. at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and yearly up to 8 postoperative years). The data at 8 years included 55% from the randomized group and 52% from the observational group. Of interest, &#x0201c;70% of those randomized to surgery and 52% of those randomized to non-operative (group) had undergone surgery by 8 years.&#x0201d; Furthermore, the &#x0201c;early benefit for surgery out to 4 years converged over time, with no significant treatment effect of surgery seen in years 6 to 8 for any of the primary outcomes.&#x0201d; Alternatively, the observational group showed a &#x0201c;stable&#x0201d; advantage for surgery at 5 and 8 years. In addition, many patients were lost to follow-up.</p><p><bold>Comments:</bold> Again, the study design is a major challenge because here again those randomized to the different treatment groups demonstrated substantial crossover; only 70% randomized to surgery actually underwent surgery, whereas 52% in the non-operative groups had surgery by the 8<sup>th</sup> year of the investigation. What was of interest was the documented 4-year benefit of surgery, which appeared to dwindle/disappear by the 6<sup>th</sup> to 8<sup>th</sup> postoperative year. Because many patients were lost to follow-up, the conclusions of the study were further jeopardized.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://surgicalneurologyint.com/Commentary-on:-The-role-of-surgery-for-treatment-of-low-back-pain:-Insights-from-the-randomized-controlled-SPORT-trials/">http://surgicalneurologyint.com/Commentary-on:-The-role-of-surgery-for-treatment-of-low-back-pain:-Insights-from-the-randomized-controlled-SPORT-trials/</ext-link></p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abdu</surname><given-names>WA</given-names></name><name><surname>Lurie</surname><given-names>JD</given-names></name><name><surname>Spratt</surname><given-names>KF</given-names></name><name><surname>Tosteson</surname><given-names>AN</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Tosteson</surname><given-names>TD</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Degenerative spondylolisthesis: Does fusion method influence outcome?.
