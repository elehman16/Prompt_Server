The sample was 59 undergraduate students, who were selected by cluster random sampling. 29 participated in the HBMCCP for 8 weeks, and were followed up 4 weeks after the program, and 30 students in the control group. Data was collected 3 times, before, immediately after and 4 weeks after the program, by 6 scale &#x02013; questionnaires which had high reliability of Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha-coefficient between .81 to .94. The stratified variables were psycho-social variables, being a positive attitude towards health behavior and social support. Data were analyzed by MANOVA and ANCOVA. Results showed that 1) Obese students in the experimental group with HBMCCP had self &#x02013; efficacy, self- regulation and self-care behavior at immediately after and 4 weeks later program significantly higher scores than before the program (p&#x0003c;0.000). For body weights at immediately after program were significantly lower scores than before the program (p=0.02), 2) Obese students in the program had self &#x02013; efficacy, self- regulation and self-care behavior scores at immediately after and 4 weeks after the program significantly higher than obese students in the control group (p=0.009) and significantly lower body weights than obese students in the control group (p=0.026), and 3) No three - way interaction among positive attitude towards health behavior, social support and the program was found, although there was a two-way interaction between positive attitude towards health behavior and the program (p=0.001) and effect size=0.272.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>behavioral modification</kwd><kwd>self-efficacy</kwd><kwd>self-regulation</kwd><kwd>self-care</kwd><kwd>BMI</kwd><kwd>obese students</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Globally, one of the most serious public health challenges of the 21<sup>st</sup> century is overweight and obesity in childhood increasing worldwide and growing incidence of type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2013</xref>). Rapidly changing dietary practices and a sedentary lifestyle have led to increasing prevalence of childhood obesity (5&#x02013;19 years) in developing countries (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Gupta et al., 2012</xref>). The risk factors caused by lifestyle changes, including, poor diet with excess caloric intake, a lack of fruits and vegetables, a lack of exercise, smoking, drinking and stress. The key factors that lead to chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cancer, arthritis, and tendon, arteriosclerosis and thrombosis, respiratory disorders during sleep, disease of the gallbladder and severe mental disorders (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Arthur, 2005</xref>). The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey: NHANES of the United State of America found that the prevalence of adults with a BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in the year 1999-2000 was 64.5 then increased to be 68.0 in the year 2007-2008 (Katherine et al., 2010). A study of the obesity among young Americans revealed that there were 32% are obese and 40% of those remain obese in adolescents and that 75 to 80% of obese adolescents will remain obese as adults. In 2004, health studies in the Asia Pacific region showed that the prevalence of overweight and obesity in Thailand was 50% higher compared to 14 countries and ranked fifth following Australia, Mongolia, Republic of Vanuatu, and Hong Kong (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Division of Public Health Statistics, 2007</xref>). The obesity data in over 15 years old of Thai people in 2008 to 2009 found that nearly one-third of Thai men and almost half of Thai women were obese (BMI&#x0003e;25kg/m<sup>2</sup>) compared to the previous survey conducted in 2003 to 2004 which shows obesity was increasing markedly. The prevalence of obesity in women had increased from 34.4 to 40.7% and in men increased from 22.5 to 28.4%. For obesity prevalence in Thai newborn to 12 years old was 40% and in adolescent obesity was 30% in 2007. The survey also, found that Bangkok had the highest prevalence of obesity at 44.2% of population (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Health Systems Research Institute, 2009</xref>)</p><p>The director of the Department of Health clearly indicates that in the past decade, Thai adolescent obesity, especially aged 15 years old or older is a growing problem. 58% of women had waist circumference over 80 cm whereas, 34% of males had a waistline over 90 cm. In addition, 30% of children, aged between 2-18 year old (17.6 million) are obese and this study could predict that 80% of these children will grow up into obese adults (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Tul, 2010</xref>). Today, the health promotion is to reduce the virulence of chronic non-communicable diseases by focusing on the prevention and control of risk factors, including smoking, drinking alcohol, emotional health promoting behavior based on a good diet and nutrition less sugar, less salt, more fruits and vegetables and promoting physical activity to control for preventing obesity as well as creating a new attitudes (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Nitaya &#x00026; Nutcharee, 2009</xref>). Focusing on activities that use energy and get the body to the point of balance point is the way forward. Therefore, guidelines which seek to control, modify and promote new patterns of behavior by establishing the willingness and cooperation of the patient is necessary. This research applied technique that focused on client-centered theory (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Rogers, 1987</xref>). There is a realization that to beat overweight problems the importance of HBMCCP program by client centered decision making that supports the personality and attitude of the client together with participatory learning through group processes is necessary. It helps achieve cooperation in the performance of the tasks and leads to the development of and changes in goals that are self-defined by the groups. The group members help to develop knowledge, skills, attitudes, and share their learning experiences helping each other in problem solving and builds confidence which carries over into daily life (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Intarakamhang &#x00026; Duangchan, 2012</xref>). This research studies the effects of the HBMCCP program for health behavioral modification that emphasizes the self-efficacy, self-regulation, self-care behaviors and body weight of the obese students. The results of this study will enable appropriate strategies to be developed to modify behavior to reduce the obesity and the other diseases.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>2.

Discussion</title><p>The results of testing the 3 hypotheses indicate that the Health Behavior Modification program Client-centered are effective modifiers of health behaviors and the body weight of participants. Those entering the program had a weight decrease (p &#x0003c;.05) which is in agreement with the study of <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Arirat (2003)</xref> which found a health promotion program using a group process together with self-control helped the overweight to modify dietary behavior and physical activity resulting in a better body weight.</p><p>Also, when considering the activities in this research focused on learning by the program participants and positive reinforcement, friends helping friends using repeatedly words as <italic>spell triggers and extracted</italic> to achieve self-confidence. Their behavior is directed towards positive activities and good diet. Regular exercise and stress management. Which corresponds to the concept of <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Bandura (1997)</xref>, who asserts that a person self-efficacy is the key element for people which determines how much they effort they need to work successfully (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Bandura, 1989</xref>), using cognitive processes related self-efficacy and self- regulation to visualize success and better enable a person to act successfully (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Annesi &#x00026; Gorjala, 2010</xref>). The results of this study found a change in behavior at the conclusion of the trial and at the follow up point 4 weeks later, this was without the constant input of the program, except some stimulatory activity such as, providing reinforcement via social networks, and self-motivated friend helping friend, through positive reinforcement. These findings show that learning activities that focus on the patient are important as the participants are made aware of the importance of their self-care behaviors constantly and in a positive way. Participants were motivated by their peer group and witnessing their success together with their own enabled them to continue decreasing their body weight. Additionally, they influence each other to exercise and remind each other to eat right etc. This result is in accordance with the study of <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Intarakamhang (2012)</xref> which studied the effect of modifying health behavior in a group with a high risk of metabolic disease which studied the effect of the PROMISE program and evaluated it based on the CIPP Model, together with health behaviors, and indicators of health, such as, body mass index, blood pressure and waist circumference. There were 4,649 vulnerable aged from 15 years and over in Bangkok. It was found that after participating in the program participants had 3 Self behaviors higher than before with statistical significance and had health behaviors indicators such as, body mass index, blood pressure and waist circumference lower than prior to enrollment at a statistically significant level. The study by <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Boonroum (2005)</xref> studied the outcome of a health promotion program according to the theory of self-efficacy augmented by the learning focused on exercise for good health. The participants were 50 first year university students in the program group. The group had discussions, received an exercise for good health hand book, offering and demonstrating aerobics with video and finally, prompting from the researcher. After the trial was completed it was found that participants in the program showed that they were more aware of their self-efficacy regarding exercise and had positive expectations of exercise, and whilst doing an exercise the pulse rates were better than prior to attending the program at a statistically significant level.</p><p>In this study the self-regulation was found to changes over the program correlating with the duration of the trial. At this point, we could summarize that the program that based on the client-center, extract by prompting the group members. Weight loss goals which are based on the concept of <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Schunk &#x00026; Zimmerman (1997)</xref> indicate that self-regulation is a process that encourages and supports the understanding of behavior and satisfaction in order to achieve set goals. The results were consistent with the study of <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Michael (2003)</xref> who studied self- regulation change in the prevention of obesity and eating disorders that can be treated with behavioral change, finding that interpersonal communication is an important technique in the control of body weight. This result was similar to the study of <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Jakicic (2003)</xref> who conducted a study regarding exercise and obesity. Jakicic found that exercise is the most important in strategy to control the body weight, rather than diet. Perhaps the exercise was an effective factor in weight control whilst the energy intake was restricted. This research had studied the effects of self-regulation program by the physicians those encouraging their obese patients to start exercising at least 150 minutes per week and make a call to follow up about the exercise and augmented with home visits to assess the actual progress. The results showed that participants can control their body weight over the long-term with exercise regime of 300 minutes per week.</p><p>The results of the hypothesis testing showed the interaction between good attitudes towards the healthy behavior program and outcome, based on the social cognitive theory of <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Bandura (1989)</xref>. Bandura asserts that human behavior is not a result of environment forces and punishment only but human behavior is inextricably linked to an individual&#x02019;s idea and sense of self. The results of <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Duangchan et al. (2010)</xref> found that a positive behavior supports a positive outcome for actions. A positive attitude is a strong intention to commit seriously to a behavior. On the contrary, if a person has a strong negative attitude the strong intention not to behavior in an efficacious manner will appear.</p><p>The social support variables were associated with behavior and that led to positive effects on health status. Persons who have adequate social support have reduced stress and are able to adapt well and have good health. In addition, social support can be predictor of quality of life. And the study of <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Kusuma (2007)</xref> that studied the effectiveness of weight loss programs by applying the concept of self- regulation together with strong social support for nurses. The study found social support for weight loss is associated with good practice to reduce weight and is statistically significant. In accordance with the previous research of Supitcha et al. (2012) that found that social support can predict health behaviors related to nutrition status of the Department of Health personnel with a statistical significance. A finding that accords with this study when considering only the main effect found that receiving social support affected to healthcare with statistically significant at 0.05 (F-test=4.979, p=0.03). However, it was no found to interaction significantly in the program based on the self-efficacy, self-regulation and behavioral modification for health. This means that the participants who received social support and those do not receive social support once joining the program both evidenced positive changes in health behaviors and body weight was not affected by the level of social support. So this program is not limited to those who received social support only. May be it be due to the participants those continued to lose weight as a result of internal factors that act as the driving force for participants.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-8"><title>8.
