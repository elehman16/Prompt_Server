The World Health Organization Pesticide Evaluation Scheme has established evaluation criteria to facilitate registration for public use. A household randomised trial was conducted in Tanzania according to WHOPES Phase III procedures to evaluate the alpha-cypermethrin coated Interceptor&#x000ae; LN (BASF) over three&#x000a0;years&#x02019; use. Outcomes were calibrated against results of Phase II experimental hut trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Interceptor LN (200&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> alpha-cypermethrin) and conventionally treated nets CTN (40&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> alpha-cypermethrin) were randomly distributed to 934 households. At 6-monthly intervals, household surveys recorded net use, durability, adverse effects, user acceptance and washing practices. Concurrently, 30 nets of each type were collected and tested for knock-down and kill of <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> mosquitoes in cone and tunnel bioassays. Alpha-cypermethrin content of nets was assessed annually.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At 12&#x000a0;months 97&#x000a0;% of Interceptor LN met the efficacy criteria by cone or tunnel test; this pass rate declined to 90&#x000a0;% at 24&#x000a0;months and 87&#x000a0;% at 36&#x000a0;months. In contrast only 63&#x000a0;% of CTN met the efficacy criteria at 12&#x000a0;months, 14&#x000a0;% at 24&#x000a0;months and 0&#x000a0;% at 36&#x000a0;months. The alpha-cypermethrin content at 36&#x000a0;months on Interceptor LN was 20&#x000a0;% (42&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;13&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>) of the initial content but on CTNs only 4&#x000a0;% (1.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.6&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>) remained. Interceptor LN was reported to be used year-round and washed 4.3 times/year. A few recalled facial tingling during the first days of use but this did not deter usage. The average number of holes at 36&#x000a0;months was 18, hole area per net was 229&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup> and hole index was 332. Insecticide content and cone bioefficacy of LN and CTN after 36&#x000a0;months&#x02019; use were similar to that of LN and CTN used in earlier Phase II hut trials, but while the 20 times washed LN tested in experimental huts gave adequate personal protection the 20 times washed CTN did not.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>More than 80&#x000a0;% Interceptor LN fulfilled the WHOPES Phase III criteria at 36&#x000a0;months and thus the LLIN was granted full WHO recommendation. Phase III outcomes at 36&#x000a0;months were anticipated by Phase II outcomes after 20 standardized washes.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Long-lasting insecticidal net</kwd><kwd>LLIN</kwd><kwd><italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic></kwd><kwd>Tanzania</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Alpha-cypermethrin</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004423</institution-id><institution>World Health Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) that repel or kill mosquitoes that make contact with the netting are the primary method of preventing malaria in many countries of Africa south of the Sahara and Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The retention of this biological activity, through 20 washes and 3&#x000a0;years of field use <italic>without need for re-treatment</italic>, is ultimately what defines and distinguishes a long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) from a conventionally treated net (CTN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Preservation of bio-efficacy is achieved during the manufacturing through one of three treatment processes: a) the active ingredient is incorporated into the synthetic fibre materials before the yarn is extruded; b) the extruded yarn is coated with insecticide and polymer binding agent before the nets are sewn; c) pre-sewn nets are mechanically sprayed with the insecticide plus binder. Formal evaluations of LLIN started more than a decade ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. More recently the WHO Global Malaria Programme has urged national malaria control programmes to purchase, promote and scale-up the coverage of LLINs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], effectively phasing out CTN that require multiple re-treatments during the lifetime of use. Today, the World Health Organisation reports that almost half of the African population at risk from malaria has access to insecticide treated nets (mainly LLIN) in the home and an estimated 44&#x000a0;% were sleeping under treated nets compared to 2&#x000a0;% in 2004 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Several brands of LLIN are recommended by WHOPES. One of these is Interceptor&#x000ae; LN (BASF Corporation, Germany) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], which even after 20 standardised washes demonstrates high killing effect (&#x0003e;&#x000a0;75&#x000a0;%) and personal protection (&#x0003e;&#x000a0;75&#x000a0;%) against malaria vectors in Phase II experimental hut trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, less is known of the longevity, physical integrity, attrition rate, persistence of bio-efficacy and insecticide content of LLIN under household conditions. For donors and procurement organizations, such information is vital to the planning of LLIN distribution and replacement campaigns.</p><p>Interceptor LN nets contain a textile auxiliary Fendozin&#x000ae; (BASF) as a finishing product that binds the alpha-cypermethrin insecticide to the polyester fibres in a resin-based polymer coating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This coating can withstand multiple washes and yet allows the slow release of the alpha-cypermethrin to the net surface where it rapidly knocks down and kills mosquitoes as they make contact with the net.</p><p>Some field studies of Interceptor&#x000ae; LN have shown encouraging efficacy and acceptability outcomes over 1&#x02013;3 years of use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In Liberia, a prospective study showed a low rate of insecticide loss and high acceptability of Interceptor LN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]; however, these outcomes were measured for only 1 year post-distribution. In north-eastern India, two groups of three [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and six [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] villages received Interceptor LN in field trials, which resulted in large reductions in vector mosquito population densities. However, in these studies the intervention villages were compared with villages that received untreated nets or focal spraying of DDT instead of conventionally treated nets. As such, neither the study design nor the outcome measure (reduction of vector abundance) satisfies the requirements of a WHOPES Phase III trial or WHOPES criteria for full recommendation. A full WHOPES recommendation is only granted after demonstrating that the candidate LLIN still meets specific efficacy criteria after 3&#x000a0;years of regular household use in clearly defined phase III trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>The overall objective of this study was to carry out a Phase III evaluation of Interceptor LN in line with WHOPES guidelines and procedures to determine their efficacy, longevity, integrity, wash resistance and household acceptability under field conditions. The specific objectives were a) to evaluate Interceptor LN in terms of biological efficacy at 7 time points over 36&#x000a0;months in comparison with conventional alpha-cypermethrin treated nets used under similar field conditions, b) to determine chemical content at annual intervals up to 3&#x000a0;years of use, c) to monitor net integrity, d) to assess household acceptance and use of Interceptor LN, and e) to calibrate the outcomes of Phase III household trials with outcomes of Phase II experimental hut trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study area</title><p>The study site was comprised of 3 villages containing 15 hamlets in Muheza district, Tanga region, northeast Tanzania (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The household demographic survey and baseline census was conducted in 2008. Magila village consists of 5 hamlets (Kibaoni, Kwedunda, Magazini, Potwe, Seluka), 391 houses and a population of 2,959. Ubembe village consists of 8 hamlets (Mianzini, Majengo, Ubembe, Misufini, Mbuyuni, Mgombezi A and B, Mkinga), 335 households and a population of 1,478. Mikwamba village consists of 2 hamlets (Mikwamba, Mangachini), 208 households and a population of 943.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Location of study villages and hamlets within Muheza district, Tanzania</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13071_2016_1490_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>The area experiences a long rainy season between April and August and a short rainy season between December and January. During the rainy seasons <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> sensu lato predominates. <italic>An. funestus</italic> becomes more common in the dry season. The area has been shown in the past to have high entomological inoculation rates, estimated between 300 and 1,000 infective bites per person per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>A 3 year community randomized trial was conducted with the household as the unit of randomization and with the mosquito nets as the unit of observation. The efficacy of Interceptor LN was monitored over 3 years of continuous use. Conventionally treated nets were used for comparative purposes. Initially it was proposed to replace the CTNs with LNs 1 year into the trial as recommended in the WHOPES 2005 guidelines for laboratory and field testing of LN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Unfortunately, thieves raided the store in which the replacement nets were stockpiled and all the nets were stolen. After review the decision was made to continue monitoring the CTN until a randomly selected net failed to meet the cut-off bioassay criteria (see section <italic>Insecticide bioassay efficacy of nets</italic>), at which point all the nets from that household were replaced with LN. This study pre-dated the 2013 revised WHOPES guidelines for laboratory and field testing of LN, which recommended that a candidate LN is field evaluated against an existing WHO-recommended LN rather than a CTN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Household randomisation</title><p>A pre-distribution baseline census collected details of residents including the number of sleeping places per household, sizes of beds, net ownership and net usage. A household was defined as a group of related or unrelated persons living together in the same dwelling, acknowledging one adult as the household head. Each household was given a unique identification number and the house was physically labeled with this number to facilitate revisits. The household number was used to randomly allocate the Interceptor LNs or CTNs to selected households, stratified by hamlet so that both net types were well represented within each hamlet (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The allocation of nets to each household was dependent on the number of sleeping places. Every bed or sleeping place had to be covered by a net in all hamlets to ensure the community was adequately protected.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Distribution of study nets within the 15 hamlets.

Interceptor LN was treated with alpha-cypermethrin (coated onto filaments) at a target dose of 6.7&#x000a0;g AI/kg of netting material for 75-denier yarn, corresponding to 200&#x000a0;mg alpha-cypermethrin per m<sup>2</sup> of polyester fabric (with a tolerance limit of &#x000b1;25&#x000a0;%). Polyester nets of the same denier and supplier were treated individually at the NIMR Amani Medical Research Centre using an aqueous solution of alpha-cypermethrin (Fendona 10SC, BASF), with volume dependent on the size of the net using the formula of Pleass et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] to achieve a target dosage of 40&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>. Nets were laid flat over plastic sheeting to dry in shaded conditions and rolled over periodically until the insecticide solution had dried. A unique code number was stenciled onto each net using a permanent marker. Nets were also marked with a cross in water-soluble ink for the assessment of washing practices.</p><p>A total of 1,953 Interceptor LN and 1,593 CTN were distributed to the selected households in 2008. The household number was used as the unit to randomly allocate the Interceptor and CTNs. The distribution teams and the recipients were blinded to the identity of the nets received by each household. Individual households received either Interceptor LNs or CTNs and not a mix of types. Enough nets were distributed to cover all sleeping spaces in the house. Householders were informed about the need for reporting adverse effects during net use, as well as advised on appropriate use and maintenance of nets. Assistance in hanging up the nets over the sleeping area was given where needed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Household surveys and net sampling</title><p>Thirty nets of each type were sampled at baseline (pre-distribution) and during cross sectional surveys of households carried out after 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36&#x000a0;months of field use. The 60 households sampled per survey were selected randomly from the household ID master list. The selected households received a replacement LN and were removed from the study. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the number of nets sampled from each hamlet. At the time of collection, a questionnaire was applied to assess current net use, acceptability, washing practices and any adverse effects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Net integrity and durability</title><p>Net integrity and durability surveys were carried out for Interceptor LN at baseline and 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36&#x000a0;months post-distribution and for CTNs at baseline, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months post-distribution. The nets were hung over a wooden frame and scored for the size and distribution of holes, repairs (stitches, knots and patches) and open/failed seams. Cleanliness assessment was done simultaneously and nets categorised according to grade of cleanliness/dirtiness.</p><p>Hole sizes were categorised as size 1 &#x02013; smaller than a thumb, size 2 &#x02013; larger than a thumb but smaller than a fist, size 3 &#x02013; larger than a fist but smaller than a head, size 4 &#x02013; larger than a head.

The formulae for calculating the hole area and hole circumference was based on the area and circumference of a circle: size 1 holes were of 0&#x02013;2&#x000a0;cm diameter (midpoint&#x02009;=&#x02009;1&#x000a0;cm). Size 2 holes were of 2&#x02013;10&#x000a0;cm diameter (midpoint&#x02009;=&#x02009;6&#x000a0;cm). Because no size 4 holes were observed and few holes categorised as size 3 were wider than 10&#x000a0;cm, the average diameter of size 3 holes was set at the lower limit of 10&#x000a0;cm diameter. Thus the estimate of hole area gives a slightly more conservative value when compared to the hole index. Hole circumference was included as it might be the more biologically relevant indicator: mosquitoes walking or skipping across the surface of net must encounter the edge of a hole before penetrating the net.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Insecticide bioassay efficacy of nets</title><p>Thirty Interceptor LNs and 30 CTNs were sampled at baseline and at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36&#x000a0;months post-distribution.

Respondents reported that symptoms stopped once the net had been washed and nobody was deterred from using their nets. No adverse effects were reported in any of the subsequent surveys.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Discussion</title><p>This WHOPES sponsored Phase III trial evaluated the efficacy of Interceptor LN over 36&#x000a0;months of household use using the standard WHO cone bioassay criteria of knockdown and mortality and the tunnel test criteria of mortality and blood feeding inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. At the conclusion of the trial 87&#x000a0;% of LNs sampled at 36&#x000a0;months met one or more of these efficacy criteria, and thus the LN product exceeded the 80&#x000a0;% threshold required to attain WHO full recommendation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Each criterion contributed to determining whether a sampled batch of nets achieved the WHOPES threshold or not. For example at 36&#x000a0;months 30&#x000a0;% (9/30) of nets reached the threshold on the basis of both cone mortality and knockdown criteria, a further 40&#x000a0;% (12/30) passed on mortality criteria only (having failed on knockdown criteria), and 2/30 (7&#x000a0;%) passed on knockdown criteria only (having failed on mortality criteria). Thus it can be seen that cone mortality made by far the larger contribution to the overall pass rate. At 24&#x000a0;months the contribution of cone mortality was greater still: 63&#x000a0;% passed on the basis of cone mortality, 27&#x000a0;% passed on the basis of knockdown, but no nets passed on knockdown alone which means that knockdown rates made no contribution to the overall pass rate. A similar story emerged at 12&#x000a0;months with 93&#x000a0;% passing on the mortality criterion and only 3&#x000a0;% passing on the basis of knockdown alone. This indicates the major contribution of mortality over knockdown to the evaluation of pyrethroid LN efficacy.</p><p>Tunnel tests also made an important contribution. At 36&#x000a0;months 77&#x000a0;% of samples passed on the basis of cone criteria but critically an additional 10&#x000a0;% (3/30) passed on the basis of tunnel test criteria, lifting the overall pass rate to above the WHO threshold of 80&#x000a0;%. Tunnel tests can also be an important validation check on the veracity of the interpretation in the rare circumstances where anomalous results are recorded in the cone bioassays. For example, at 24&#x000a0;months an unexpectedly low 63&#x000a0;% of nets passed on the basis of cone criteria, but a further 27&#x000a0;% subsequently passed on the basis of tunnel test criteria.</p><p>At 36&#x000a0;months 26/30 (87&#x000a0;%) of LN had reached the required standard. It is sobering to reflect that had 3 LNs of this batch by chance not met the required standard Interceptor LN would have failed to reach the pass rate of 80&#x000a0;%. Just a few nets can exert great leverage around the 80&#x000a0;% threshold when only 30 nets form the basis of the decision. In response to this, WHOPES has decided to increase the sample size at the all important 36&#x000a0;month time point from 30 to 50 nets to improve statistical power and precision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The CTNs were monitored beyond the anticipated 12&#x000a0;months&#x02019; end point because of theft of Interceptor LNs from the store. In-use CTN continued to be followed up for efficacy and chemical content. After 12&#x000a0;months&#x02019; use the insecticide content of the CTNs had decreased by 66&#x000a0;% relative to baseline; however, the majority of nets still met the efficacy criteria. From that point on the situation changed profoundly: after 24&#x000a0;months the insecticide content of the CTNs decreased by 94&#x000a0;% and few CTNs met the WHO efficacy criteria. Despite this, it is notable that while only a milligram per m<sup>2</sup> alpha-cypermethrin residue remained on the average CTN, the nets still killed about 40&#x000a0;% of mosquitoes in cone bioassay. A similar observation was made during the Phase II experimental hut trial conducted in the same locality 3&#x000a0;years earlier; while after 20 standardised washes only a milligram of alpha-cypermethrin per m<sup>2</sup> remained on the CTNs, mortality of 68&#x000a0;% was being recorded in cone bioassays and 44&#x000a0;% of free flying <italic>An. gambiae</italic> were still being killed by these nets in experimental huts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, the level of personal protection from mosquito biting from these nets was, at 6&#x000a0;%, insignificant both statistically and in terms of protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and this provides a strong argument for always deploying LLIN over CTN.</p><p>The rate of loss of insecticide over time was more gradual in the Interceptor LNs, and was remarkably constant year by year. After 12&#x000a0;months of use the insecticide content of the LNs had decreased by 43&#x000a0;% of the initial content of 204&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>, after 24&#x000a0;months it had decreased by a further 42&#x000a0;%, and after 36&#x000a0;months it had decreased by a further 38&#x000a0;%. At 36&#x000a0;months the average insecticide content was 42&#x000a0;mg alpha-cypermethrin per m<sup>2</sup>; this was remarkably similar to the 41&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> alpha-cypermethrin content observed in Interceptor LNs after 20 standardized washes in the Phase II experimental hut trials done in the same locality 3&#x000a0;years previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This similarity in chemical content between a Phase III household randomized trial and Phase II experimental hut trial indicates that the 20 standardized washes which LLINs undergo before testing in experimental huts is a fair approximation to the average loss of insecticide due to wear and tear, abrasion and washing that LLINs undergo during 3&#x000a0;years of household use. The outcomes of Phase II experimental hut trials would appear to be a reasonable prediction of the outcome of Phase III trials conducted in the community. While this correlation is encouraging, more LN products need to be evaluated and compared in Phase II experimental hut and Phase III household trials before this conclusion can be fully verified or justified. It is nevertheless encouraging &#x02013; even fortuitous - that the arbitrary 20 washes that LLIN are purposefully subjected to in WHOPES Phase II seem a good approximation to Phase III after 3&#x000a0;years. In practice the number of washes that a net is subjected to during 3&#x000a0;years of household use may fall short of the 20 washes of Phase II; in the present Interceptor LN trial the average net was estimated to be washed 4.3 times a year or only 13 times over the 36&#x000a0;months. Under household use the average net would be subjected to more vigorous challenges than washing &#x02013; the removal of surface insecticide through friction and abrasion in everyday use, for example - but over the 36&#x000a0;months this removal would seem to add up, or be equivalent to, the 20 washes of Phase II.</p><p>Taking the logic of the Phase II and Phase III calibration one step further, a typical Interceptor LN after 3&#x000a0;years of household use and alpha-cypermethrin content of 42&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> should, as predicted by experimental hut trials, continue to kill up to 78&#x000a0;% of hosting seeking <italic>An gambiae</italic> that contact the net and would still provide 76&#x000a0;% protection to the occupants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Given the major loss of efficacy and protection observed with the average CTN after 3&#x000a0;years, discussed above, this concludes the argument for always deploying LLIN over CTN.</p><p>At all time points, trial participants reported a high frequency of net use all year round; this assertion was corroborated by the high proportion of nets observed hanging above the beds. After 36&#x000a0;months in the field most nets had incurred damage: few were without holes (only 17&#x000a0;%) and most were dirty or very dirty (70&#x000a0;%). The Tanzanian nets were in worse condition than the Interceptor LNs studied in Uganda where after 36&#x000a0;months, 27&#x000a0;% were without holes and 29&#x000a0;% were scored as dirty or very dirty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The bioefficacies were very similar between the Tanzanian and Ugandan studies, and therefore the accumulation of dirt or soot on the nets may not affect the toxicity of the pyrethroid, as noted by Kayedi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Nevertheless the trials do highlight the issue of durability and the importance of high denier netting to achieve that durability (the Interceptor LN issued were only 75 denier). The majority of holes were size 1 and most were found on the lower half of the nets where abrasion caused by tucking under the mattress was more likely to occur. While the attrition of nets (loss of nets from households) was not monitored, the trend in hole index over time indicates that it stabilized after 24&#x000a0;months. Nets were probably being discarded once they had become highly holed so the residual population of nets maintained a more regular pHI after 24&#x000a0;months. A &#x02018;steady state&#x02019; hole index after 24&#x000a0;months&#x02019; use has been observed during sequential household surveys in the Phase III evaluations of PermaNet 2.0 and Olyset LN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A threshold hole index or hole area which a given proportion of LN are expected to reach after 3&#x000a0;years are important criteria for WHOPES to establish and encourage manufacturers to improve the durability and longevity of their products.</p><p>Although some adverse effects were reported during the first weeks of net usage, these were rare and short lived and did not deter Interceptor LN use.</p><p>The Tanzanian trial was one of three trials commissioned by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], while a fourth non-WHOPES trial was conducted independently in Uganda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. After 36&#x000a0;months, the percentage of nets that met the WHO efficacy criteria was 98&#x000a0;% at one site in India (Gujarat), 73&#x000a0;% at a second site in India (Chhattisgarh) and 83&#x000a0;% in Uganda. The data from Gujarat had to be discounted as the majority of Interceptor LN exceeded the tolerance limit of alpha-cypermethrin content at baseline and the study in Chhattisgarh failed after 36&#x000a0;months as only 73&#x000a0;% of the nets passed the threshold bioassay criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In the two trial locations where the Interceptor LNs were within the acceptable range for alpha-cypermethrin content &#x02013; Tanzania and Uganda &#x02013; the LNs did meet the WHOPES efficacy criteria after 3&#x000a0;years of use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this WHOPES Phase III household randomized trial conducted in Tanzania, Interceptor LN succeeded in meeting the WHOPES efficacy criteria for long-lasting insecticidal nets after 36&#x000a0;months of use. On the basis of this trial and one other non WHOPES trial where the LNs were within the acceptable range of alpha-cypermethrin content at baseline, Interceptor LN obtained WHO full recommendation. The calibration of Interceptor LNs at 36&#x000a0;months and Interceptor LNs with similar levels of alpha-cypermethrin content tested in Phase II experimental hut studies predicts that such nets would continue to give high levels of personal protection and mosquito control after 3&#x000a0;years of household use provided net integrity is maintained. Threshold net integrity criteria that a LN should reach in order to obtain recommendation should be established by WHOPES to improve LN durability.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>PKT supervised the study implementation in the field and the laboratory, undertook the data collection and analysis and drafted the manuscript.
