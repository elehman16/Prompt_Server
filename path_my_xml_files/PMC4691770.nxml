The use of perioperative injections around the knee containing local anaesthetic, opiates and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has increased in popularity to manage pain. Theoretical advantages include reduced requirements for analgesia and earlier mobilisation. We propose a single-centre randomised controlled trial of multimodal periarticular anaesthetic infiltration versus femoral nerve anaesthetic blockade as analgesia for TKA. The aim is to determine, in patients undergoing TKA, if there is a difference in patient-reported pain scores on the visual analogue scale (VAS) prior to physiotherapy on day 1 postoperatively between treatment groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>Patients undergoing a primary unilateral TKA at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire Hospitals will be assessed for eligibility. A total of 264 patients will provide 90% power to detect a difference of 12&#x02005;mm on the VAS on day 1 postoperatively at the 5% level. The trial will use 1:1 randomisation, stratified by mode of anaesthetic. Primary outcome measure will be the VAS for pain prior to physiotherapy on day 1. Secondary outcome measures include VAS on day 2, total use of opiate analgesia up to 48&#x02005;h, ordinal pain scores up to 40&#x02005;min after surgery, independent functional knee physiotherapist assessment on days 1 and 2. Oxford knee Scores (OKS), EuroQol (EQ-5D) and Douleur Neuropathic Pain Scores (DN2) will be recorded at baseline, 6&#x02005;weeks and 12&#x02005;months. Adverse events will be recorded up to 12&#x02005;months. Analysis will investigate differences in VAS on day 1 between the two treatment groups on an intention-to-treat basis. Tests will be two-sided and considered to provide evidence for a significant difference if p values are less than 0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>NRES Committee West Midlands, 23 September 2013 (ref: 13/WM/0316).

During the last decade, there has been increased interest in optimal perioperative care to enhance recovery following TKA. Improvement of analgesia; reduction of surgical stress responses and organ dysfunctions; including nausea, vomiting and ileus; early mobilisation; and oral nutrition have all been examined. Measures to try and improve pain management have been developed including multimodal regimes which theoretically allow functional rehabilitation to be initiated more rapidly postoperatively. TKA generates substantial amounts of postoperative pain, which effects range of movement and ability to mobilise. Good pain relief with minimal physiological disturbance is important for postoperative knee rehabilitation.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;4</xref> Epidural analgesia is very effective in pain control but is associated with side effects such as pruritus, urinary retention and motor block.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Epidural analgesia can also occasionally lead to serious complications such as spinal cord ischaemia, vertebral canal haematoma, vertebral canal abscess, infective meningitis, nerve and spinal cord injury, wrong route administration and cardiovascular collapse.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>The use of opioid drugs, administered by means of either patient-controlled analgesia or other methods, is another effective method of postoperative pain relief but is often associated with systemic side effects, including nausea and vomiting, respiratory depression, drowsiness, pruritus, reduced gut mobility, and urinary retention.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Drowsiness in particular may delay the patient's postoperative mobilisation. Femoral nerve block, as a single perioperative infiltration or via an indwelling catheter, has been shown to improve postoperative pain control and reduce the use of systemic analgesics and is currently the standard care for perioperative analgesia.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The key advantage of the technique is that it avoids the systemic effects associated with both epidural and opioid analgesics. However, it may be associated with complications such as vascular puncture, nerve damage, infection and diminished muscle control.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The inhibition of the quadriceps muscle group can delay postoperative mobilisation.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Since the posterior capsule of the knee joint is innervated by the branches of the sciatic nerve rather than the femoral, femoral nerve blockade may also result in incomplete pain relief. Femoral nerve block is currently the standard perioperative analgesia for TKR surgery among anaesthetists working within the NHS.</p><p>Recently the use of intraoperative, periarticular infiltration of multimodal analgesics has gained in popularity. Periarticular infiltration has the advantage of delivering drugs directly to the sources of pain, thereby avoiding systemic side effects.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The concept of multimodal analgesia refers to the simultaneous administration of multiple anaesthetic agents, such as local anaesthetics, opiates and non-steroids anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). To produce optimal pain relief combined with the lowest incidence of side effects, a multimodal pain therapy is essential.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> This technique of analgesia was developed specifically to avoid sedation and facilitate rapid physiological recovery after lower limb arthroplasty in order to enable early mobilisation and discharge.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;13</xref> In contrast to femoral nerve blockade, periarticular infiltration does not inhibit quadriceps function and also reaches the posterior capsule of the knee joint. Published studies suggest that periarticular infiltration may reduce requirements for postoperative analgesia, lead to earlier mobilisation and discharge from hospital. However, the number of published randomised controlled trials involving TKA is small and all are underpowered and lack statistical rigour. An initial pilot study comparing femoral nerve block and multimodal periarticular infiltration has already been completed in order to help plan and design a full trial with the following null hypothesis.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Postoperative pain following primary TKA does not differ between multimodal periarticular knee infiltration with levobupivacaine 150&#x02005;mg, morphine 10&#x02005;mg and ketorolac 30&#x02005;mg diluted in 0.9% saline to make a volume 100&#x02005;mL (0.5&#x02005;mL 1:1000 epinephrine) and the single-agent femoral nerve blockade.</p><p>These two comparators have been chosen for comparison because femoral nerve block is the current standard care for perioperative analgesia for TKR surgery and multimodal periarticular infiltration represents a new but now established alternative.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective of this full trial is to quantify and draw inferences on the efficacy between treatment groups based on observed differences as shown by a validated, patient-reported 100&#x02005;mm visual analogue pain score, prephysiotherapy on the first postoperative day, collected by an independent physiotherapist. This is the most important outcome as pain at the time when the patient is first starting to walk and use their new knee replacement will determine the ability of the patient to mobilise. Early mobilisation is associated with improved functional outcomes and a reduced risk of complications.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>The secondary objectives of the study are to quantify and draw inferences on the efficacy of the treatment groups based on observed differences as shown by:

In order to ensure all eligible patients are approached for recruitment patients already on the waiting list (as identified via hospital operative planning software, Opera) for a unilateral TKA will be screened and may be contacted during their preoperative assessment at the hospital, which normally occurs a few weeks before surgery. All appropriate patients will be approached as per ICH-GCP guidelines. Patients will be recruited by trained research associates who will help to present the trial and interventions in a consistent and unbiased manner. Recruitment by trained research associates will also be a mechanism to help ensure optimum participant enrolment.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Patients will only be given &#x02018;Letters of Invitation&#x02019; if, in the opinion of the research associate, there has been an adequate verbal introduction to the trial. Patients will be given adequate time to consider their participation in order to ensure informed consent to participate in the trial. Signed and dated informed consent will be obtained by medically trained personnel as per trust protocol for Clinical Trial Investigation of a Medicinal Product (CTIMP) study. In the event that any further information becomes available, which may influence the patient's willingness to continue in the trial, the trial team will contact the participant. The participant's general practitioner (GP) will be informed by letter that the patient is taking/has taken part in this clinical trial. A participant may deny the research team permission to inform the GP of their trial involvement by not initialling the appropriate box on the consent form. Prerandomisation eligibility checks will be carried out to ensure that a patient fit the eligibility criteria and is not randomised in error. Inclusion of a patient in the trial will be flagged on their clinical notes by means of a trial sticker.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Allocation of trial treatments will be provided through a distal randomisation service. Randomisation will be a 1:1 allocation using a computer-generated randomisation schedule stratified by anaesthetic type&#x02014;general or spinal block using permuted blocks of random sizes. The block sizes will not be disclosed, to ensure concealment. To ensure allocation concealment, the mechanism of contact being used is via a telephone and has a stringent procedure to ensure enrolment before randomisation. Randomisation via telephone will be undertaken by a trained member of the theatre team present on the day of surgery. They will then inform the rest of the theatre team (excluding the participant) of the treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Sample size</title><p>The primary outcome measure for this study is pain on day 1 postoperatively, assessed using a 100&#x02005;mm VAS. Pilot data (n=46) were used in a power analysis to estimate the sample size required for a two-arm parallel group RCT. Based on the available literature, a change in the VAS of 12&#x02005;mm (95% CI 9 to 15) is clinically meaningful; thus, these calculations assume the minimum clinical important difference (MCID) to be approximately 12&#x02005;mm.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The observed SD from the pilot study was 30&#x02005;mm, giving a standardised effect size (MCID/SD) of 0.4, a moderate value, and of the appropriate order of magnitude for a pragmatic study of this type. Hence, to power a trial to test the null hypothesis of equality of the treatments, assuming approximate normality for the VAS, would require 132 patients in each treatment arm or 264 in total&#x02014;assuming 90% power, 5% significance, a SD of 3&#x02005;cm and an MCID of 12&#x02005;mm. Given that the majority of data collection will occur during participant hospital stay, with the exception of the patient-reported outcome measures, we anticipate loss of follow-up data will be minimal (&#x0003c;5%). The sample size for this trial corresponds to effects observed in previous similar studies.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> These studies demonstrated effects on a 100&#x02005;mm VAS (our primary outcome measure) and on participant consumption of &#x02018;as required&#x02019; analgesia with 20&#x02013;25 patients per experimental group.</p><p>Recent audit within the department indicated there are approximately 50 elective primary unilateral total knee replacements carried out per month, of whom over half would be eligible for this trial. Although not all patients will want to take part, our previous experience in trials of perioperative adjuncts to surgery has shown high levels of patient recruitment (80&#x02013;100%) with only 7% declining the pilot study. Therefore, we believe 11 patients per month to be a realistic recruitment figure. At this rate, the entire study sample can be recruited within 24&#x02005;months. However, if recruitment rate is not as high as anticipated, a sample size of 200 patients will still be adequate to identify any difference between groups with 80% power.</p><p>Participants may withdraw from the trial treatment and/or the whole trial at any time without prejudice. Unless a participant explicitly withdraws their consent, they should be followed-up and data collected as per the protocol until the end of the trial.</p><p>Should a participant withdraw from the trial, they would continue to be treated as per normal routine postoperative management, follow-up and clinical practice. The data collected up until the point of withdrawal would be used for analysis at the end of the trial. Participants may be withdrawn from the trial at the discretion of the investigator and/or the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) due to safety concerns.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Blinding</title><p>Patients will be blind to the intervention to which they are allocated, as femoral nerve blocks will be done after sedation and or anaesthetic. All interventions will be conducted within a sterile zone with drapes which will physically prevent patients seeing which intervention they receive. Owing to the nature of the study, it is not possible for the surgeon and anaesthetist delivering the interventions to be blinded to the treatment options. Outcome data will be collected by a research associate and an independent clinical physiotherapist who are blinded to the treatment allocation. Furthermore, the trial statistician will be blinded to the treatment allocations throughout.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Interventions</title><p>In this pragmatic trial, patients will undergo routine elective primary unilateral TKA using the standard technique of the anaesthetist and the operating surgeon. In addition, the patient will receive one of the following perioperative analgesic interventions:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Femoral nerve block</p></list-item></list></p><p>Under aseptic conditions, the femoral artery will be palpated immediately below the inguinal ligament and nerve stimulation and or ultrasound will be used to identify the femoral nerve just lateral to the artery. Once the femoral nerve has been identified, the block may be performed in the routine manner (15, 16) using 30&#x02005;mL (75&#x02005;mg) of levobupivacaine hydrochloride 0.25%.
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Intraoperative periarticular injection</p></list-item></list></p><p>The periarticular infiltration of multimodal agents will involve the preparation of two 50&#x02005;mL syringes each containing 30&#x02005;mL (75&#x02005;mg) of levobupivacaine hydrochloride 0.25% injection, 0.5&#x02005;mL (5&#x02005;mg) morphine sulfate injection, 0.5&#x02005;mL (15&#x02005;mg) ketorolac trometamol injection and 0.25&#x02005;mL of 1:1000 epinephrine then diluted with 0.9% saline to make a mixture containing a total volume of 50&#x02005;mL. Epinephrine is added to the mixture to reduce blood loss after the operation. Each syringe will be prepared for immediate use and not stored. Fifty millilitre of the mixture will be injected into the posterior, medical and lateral soft tissues just prior to implantation of the TKR components. Care will be taken to avoid excessive infiltration in the area of the common peroneal nerve. Then, while the cement is curing, the anterior soft tissue including the quadriceps mechanism, the retinacular tissues and the subcuticular tissues will be infiltrated with the remaining 50&#x02005;mL of periarticular injection.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Following wound closure, the tourniquet will be released and the &#x02018;tourniquet-down time&#x02019; noted on the trial documentation.</p><p>The allocated intervention will be discontinued if there is evidence of an immediate serious adverse reaction such as anaphylaxis.

Baseline data will be summarised to check comparability between treatment arms, and to highlight any characteristic differences between those individuals in the study, those ineligible and those eligible but withholding consent.</p><p>The main analysis will investigate differences in the primary outcome measure, the VAS pain score prephysiotherapy on the first day postoperatively, between the two treatment groups (single injection femoral nerve block and multimodal periarticular injection) on an intention-to-treat basis. Initial analysis will investigate differences in pain score measurements on an intention-to-treat basis using a t test based on an assumed normal distribution for the primary outcome (VAS pain score). Tests will be two-sided and considered to provide evidence for a significant difference if p values are less than 0.05 (5% significance level). Estimates of treatment effects will be presented with 95% CIs. The simple t test will be augmented with a linear regression analysis that adjusts for expected confounders of age and gender. Adjusted and unadjusted analyses will be presented together with diagnostics that assess the modelling assumptions (eg, quantile-quantile plots). Subsidiary analyses will also test for differences at intermediate times and more generally across all times using a repeated-measures approach (eg, generalised estimating equations). For secondary outcome measures that can be assumed to be approximately normally distributed (eg, OKS, EQ-5D), data will be analysed in a similar manner to VAS pain scores. However, routinely collected pain scores, measured on a four-point ordinal score scale, will be analysed using the proportional odds model and the time course modelled using appropriate methods (eg, repolr). Counts of AEs will be compared between groups using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests.</p><p>Inevitably some data may not be available due to voluntary withdrawal of patients, lack of completion of individual data items or general loss to follow-up. Where possible, the reasons for missing data will be ascertained and reported. Although missing data are not expected to be a problem for this study, the nature and pattern of the missing data will be carefully considered including in particular whether data can be treated as missing completely at random. If judged appropriate, missing data will be imputed using the multiple imputation facilities (eg, mice in R). Any resulting imputed data sets will be analysed and reported, together with appropriate sensitivity analyses. Any imputation methods used for scores and other derived variables will be carefully considered and justified. Reasons for ineligibility, non-compliance, withdrawal or other protocol violations will be stated and any patterns summarised. More formal analysis, for example, using logistic regression with &#x02018;protocol violation&#x02019; as a response, may also be appropriate and aid interpretation.</p><p>The main analyses will be conducted using the software package R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>), with some additional analyses in SPSS if this proves necessary. The primary focus of the statistical analysis will be the comparison of the two treatment groups, and this will be reflected in the analysis which will be reported together with appropriate diagnostic plots that check the underlying model assumptions.</p></sec><sec id="s11"><title>Trial organisation, regulation and oversight</title><p>All issues pertaining to the management of the trial will be coordinated by a trial management group (TMG).
