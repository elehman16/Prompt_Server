The prevalence of COPD in Japan is reported to be 8.6%, which is comparable to the global prevalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In Japan, approximately 5.3 million individuals &#x02265;40&#x000a0;years old and 2.1&#x000a0;million individuals &#x02265;70&#x000a0;years old are estimated to be affected by COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Bronchodilators are recommended as first-line therapy in symptomatic patients with airflow limitation, and are fundamental to the management of stable COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist (LABA) combination therapy is recommended if symptoms persist despite treatment with bronchodilator monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) of LAMA&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;LABA can maximize the bronchodilator response without increasing the dose of individual components by LABA-mediated stimulation of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors, LAMA-mediated inhibition of acetylcholine action at muscarinic receptors, and signaling cross-talk-induced synergistic bronchodilation effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Further, the safety of LAMA&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;LABA combination therapies and monotherapies is comparable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Tiotropium/olodaterol FDC is a LAMA&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;LABA FDC approved for use in many countries, including Japan, the European Union, and the United States. Numerous randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III studies (with durations of 6, 12, and 52&#x000a0;weeks), including parallel-group and crossover studies, have shown that treatment with tiotropium/olodaterol FDC (5/5 and/or 2.5/5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g) significantly improved lung function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and transition dyspnea index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] compared with either monotherapy in patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD [Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), grades 2&#x02013;4]. In particular, in the Japanese subpopulation of replicated phase III studies (TONADO<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 1 and 2), tiotropium/olodaterol FDC (5/5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g) was superior to either monotherapy for lung function and St George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score at 24&#x000a0;weeks, being consistent with results of the overall population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Also, in several phase III studies, tiotropium/olodaterol FDC showed a significant improvement/reduction in lung hyperinflation [an increase in inspiratory capacity (IC)] after 6 or 12&#x000a0;weeks treatment compared with either monotherapy or placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, no Japanese patients with COPD were included in these studies. Importantly, Japanese patient characteristics such as age, body mass index, smoking habits, maintenance treatment usage, and environmental exposures differ from those of Western patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, the VESUTO<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> study has been planned to investigate the effect of tiotropium/olodaterol FDC and tiotropium monotherapy on IC as an index of lung hyperinflation in Japanese patients with COPD, because lung hyperinflation is one of the main factors for dyspnea, fatigue, and low exercise capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The 6-min walk distance (6MWD) is a validated measure of exercise capacity and correlates well with IC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], responds to interventions with bronchodilators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and predicts morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Reduction in hyperinflation (increase in IC) with tiotropium/olodaterol FDC is considered to be associated with improvement in exercise capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and possibly in physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Therefore, it is expected that improvement of symptoms resulting from reduction of hyperinflation will contribute to increasing patients&#x02019; exercise capacity and their daily activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Physical activity levels could be a new therapeutic target for COPD management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], because low physical activity is associated with poor prognosis and is the most influential factor affecting all-cause mortality in COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], ranking as the third most important factor associated with death caused by lifestyle-related diseases in Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Assessment of physical activity in the earliest stages of COPD is associated with better prognosis, as it helps maintain best achievable physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Nonetheless, Japan is known for taking active measures to improve the health of its population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COPD issued by the Japanese Respiratory Society specifically include improvement in exercise capacity and daily physical activity as one of six treatment goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, its importance has only recently been recognized, and evidence demonstrating the effect of bronchodilators on physical activity is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Furthermore, there are no randomized interventional studies focused on exercise capacity and physical activity in Japanese patients with COPD. Given that tiotropium is widely used as first-line monotherapy for maintenance management of COPD in Japan, the VESUTO<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> study has been planned to investigate the efficacy of tiotropium/olodaterol FDC compared to tiotropium monotherapy on exercise capacity (measured by 6MWD) and daily physical activity (measured by a 3-axis accelerometer).</p><p id="Par9">This paper describes the study design of the VESUTO<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> study (NCT02629965), which is the first, randomized, 2-way crossover, interventional study (2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;2 crossover study with 90 patients in each sequential group; in total, 180 patients/treatment group) in Japanese patients with COPD.</p><p id="Par10">This study aims to assess the efficacy of tiotropium/olodaterol FDC compared with tiotropium monotherapy on IC as an index of lung hyperinflation in Japanese patients with COPD.

The 6MWT will be performed at the hospital at Visit 3 and Visit 4, starting 90&#x000a0;min (allowance +15&#x000a0;min) after administration of the study medication. During the 6MWT, oxygen saturation and heart rate will be monitored using a mobile pulse oximeter. Just after the end of the 6MWT, the intensity of breathing discomfort and leg discomfort will be assessed using a modified Borg Scale.</p><p id="Par22">A physical activity monitor (HJA-750C; OMRON, Kyoto, Japan) will be used for assessment of physical activity.

The Japanese COPD guidelines specifically include improvement in exercise capacity and daily physical activity as one of the six treatment goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]; however, the evidence of exercise capacity or physical activity is limited in Japanese patients with COPD. Accordingly, evaluation of IC as an index of lung hyperinflation and its relationship with exercise capacity and physical activity in the VESUTO<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> study will provide additional evidence for COPD management.</p><p id="Par36">The 6MWD is strongly associated with pulmonary hyperinflation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and the 6MWT will be performed to assess exercise capacity. Physical activity is potentially related to exercise capacity and is an independent prognostic factor in patients with COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Decline in physical activity is also reported in association with poor prognosis and all-cause mortality in COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].
