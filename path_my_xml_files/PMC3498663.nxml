Failure to adequately immobilize the neck during tracheal intubation in patients with cervical spine injuries can result in devastating neurological outcomes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>Anatomic studies that mimic complete C4-5 ligamentous injury demonstrate that manual in-line axial stabilization (MIAS) reduces segmental angular rotation and distraction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] It also results in less subluxation into the spinal canal during Orotracheal intubation than cervical collar immobilization in a cadaver model of cervical spine injury.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] However, it can be a double-edged sword, in that it has been shown to increase the difficulty level in visualizing the larynx using conventional laryngoscopy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] This is because MIAS prevents head extension and neck flexion, which are necessary for optimal alignment of the three airway axes and exposure of the vocal cords using direct laryngoscopic techniques.</p><p>Laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation are known to cause an increase in arterial blood pressure, heart rate and intracranial tension, which can be deleterious in trauma cases with associated head injury.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Obtunding this reflex response during laryngoscopy and intubation remains a major concern of the anesthesiologists. Exposure of the glottis during laryngoscopy requires the elevation of the epiglottis by a forward and upward lifting of the laryngoscope blade. It has been observed that the amount of forces exerted during laryngoscopy and intubation is the key determinant for mechanical stimulation of stretch receptors present in the respiratory tract. Any laryngoscopy technique requiring lesser lifting force would proportionally reduce the sympathetic discharge, and hence changes in heart rate and blood pressure.</p><p>TruView EVO2 (Truphatek International Ltd., Netanya, Israel) is a modified laryngoscope that illuminates and expands the angular view of the larynx and adjacent structures, thereby facilitating endotracheal intubation. It provides a 42&#x000b0; anterior refraction in the line of sight, making difficult cases easier to intubate.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] TruView EVO2 uses an optical system view tube that consists of prisms and lenses that extend vision beyond the distal end of the blade. It reduces the amount of force needed to successfully intubate a patient by greater than 30%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] It is used for endotracheal intubation where there is difficulty in visualizing the laryngeal inlet, especially in cases with limited neck extension.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>The McCoy laryngoscope (Penlon) was introduced in 1993.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] It is based on the standard Macintosh blade with a hinged tip that is operated by a lever mechanism on the back of the handle, which allows for elevation of the epiglottis while reducing the amount of force required. It has been designed to facilitate tracheal intubation when the patient's head is in a neutral position. It has also been shown to reduce the stress response to laryngoscopy, probably as a result of the reduction in the required force.</p><p>In this study, an attempt has been made to compare the TruView EVO2 and the McCoy with the cervical spine immobilized, with regard to the difference in the ease of intubation and the associated hemodynamic response. Comparison of the intubation difficulty score (IDS), hemodynamic response, Cormack and Lehane grade, duration of tracheal intubation and rate of successful placement of the endotracheal tube (ETT) in the trachea between TruView EVO2 and McCoy laryngoscopes will be reported.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>The study was conducted on 60 adult patients belonging to ASA physical status 1 and 2, between the ages of 18 and 65 years, who were scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia, requiring endotracheal intubation. The approval for the study was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Exclusion criteria for the study include patients not fasted for 8 h prior to surgery, rapid sequence intubation, anticipated difficult airway on preoperative assessment with Mallampati class IV, thyromental distance less than 6.5 cm and interincisor distance less than 3.5 cm, pathology of oropharynx, larynx or mass in the neck that is likely to alter the anatomy of the airway, obese patients (body mass index &#x0003e;30), central nervous system disorders, intracranial space-occupying lesion or patients with features of raised intracranial tension or intraocular pressure and allergy to any of the drugs being used in the study. Sixty patients were selected in a random manner and allocated to the TruView (T) group and the McCoy (M) group, each with 30 patients by the &#x0201c;chit in a box&#x0201d; method. Sixty chits, 30 labeled T and 30 labeled M, were put into a box and after mixing, and were picked by the subjects and not replaced in the box. This simple method of randomization ensured equal allocation of cases to both the Truview and the McCoy groups. Use of the airway device and endotracheal intubation was performed by an anesthesiologist who has at least 3 years of experience in anesthesia and has performed at least 20 intubations in the clinical settings with both devices. Two anesthesiologists had performed the laryngoscopy for the study, and they had performed cases in both groups, which were allocated by the &#x0201c;chit in box&#x0201d; method.All patients were kept nil per oral for 8 h prior to the surgery. They were premedicated with lorazepam 0.04 mg/kg orally the night before and 2 h prior to the surgery. In the operating room, preinduction monitoring was performed with a five-lead electrocardiogram, noninvasive blood pressure and a pulse oximeter. Appropriate intravenous access was secured. Premedication with Fentanyl 2 mcg/kg was given. The patients were preoxygenated with 6 L of oxygen for 5 min and general anesthesia was induced with propofol titrated to induce anesthesia in a dose sufficient to produce loss of response to verbal commands. Muscle relaxant vecuronium bromide 0.12 mg/kg was administered after checking adequacy of the mask ventilation. Mask ventilation with oxygen and isoflurane was done for 3 min. At the end of the 3 min, after confirming adequacy of block with a peripheral nerve stimulator, the pillow was removed and the neck was immobilized using MIAS applied by an experienced assistant holding the sides of the neck and the mastoid processes thus preventing flexion/extension or rotational movement of the head and neck.</p><p>Direct laryngoscopy was done with either TruView [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] or McCoy laryngoscopes [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>] in their respective groups. Oxygen was connected to the TruView blade and a flow rate of 5 L/min was kept to prevent fogging. The trachea was intubated with an appropriate size cuffed ETT (7.0 in females and 8.0 in males). After successful tracheal intubation, the lungs were mechanically ventilated for the duration of the procedure and anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in a mixture of N<sub>2</sub>O and O<sub>2</sub>. No other medications were administered or procedures performed during the 5-min data collection period after tracheal intubation. Subsequent management had been left to the discretion of the anesthesiologist providing care for the patient.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>TrueView EVO2</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-6-248-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>McCoy blade</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-6-248-g002"/></fig><p>The duration of the tracheal intubation procedure was noted. The duration of the intubation attempt is defined as the time taken from insertion of the blade between the teeth until the ETT is placed through the vocal cords, as evidenced by visual confirmation by the anesthesiologists. However, in patients in whom the ETT was not directly visualized as passing through the vocal cords, the intubation attempt was not considered complete until the ETT was connected to the anesthetic circuit and evidence obtained of the presence of CO<sub>2</sub> in the exhaled breath. A failed intubation attempt is defined as an attempt in which the trachea is not intubated or which required more than 60 s to perform. A maximum of two intubation attempts was permitted with the device tested. If the tracheal intubation is unsuccessful with the device tested, MIAS will be discontinued and tracheal intubation performed with the Macintosh laryngoscope. The duration of the first tracheal intubation or of the second, in case the first was unsuccessful, will be recorded.</p><p>The number of intubation attempts, the rate of successful placement of the ETT in the trachea, the number of optimization maneuvers required (use of a bougie, cricoid pressure, second assistant) to aid tracheal intubation, the Cormack and Lehane grade at laryngoscopy and hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy were noted. The IDS was calculated. The IDS score, developed by Adnet and colleagues, is a quantitative scale incorporating multiple indices of intubation difficulty that more objectively quantifies the complexity of tracheal intubations.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>A pilot study on 12 patients, six in each group, was conducted. The results were analyzed with the aid of a statistician and a sample size of 60 was decided to ensure a level of significance of 5% and a suitable power. Analysis of the statistical data obtained from the study was carried out by a statistical programming software Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 10.

Both TruView and McCoy offer better glottic view and lesser force exerted during intubation when compared with the standard Macintosh laryngoscope.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>The IDS is a quantitative scale incorporating multiple indices of intubation difficulty that objectively quantifies the complexity of tracheal intubations. IDS score was developed by Adnet and colleagues.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] In our study, the IDS is significantly low with the TruView laryngoscope (mean of 0.3 with standard deviation of 0.5) than with the McCoy laryngoscope (mean of 1.2 with standard deviation of 1.2), with a <italic>P</italic> value of less than 0.001, which shows that it is very highly significant. In the study conducted by Malik <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] the IDS was significantly low with the TruView laryngoscope when compared with the Macintosh laryngoscope. He evaluated the effectiveness of the Pentax Airway scope, Glidescope and TruView EVO2 in comparison with the Macintosh laryngoscope in 120 patients (30 in each group). IDS were lowest with the Pentax Airway scope.</p><p>In this study, the Cormack and Lehane glottic view is significantly better with the TruView laryngoscope than with the McCoy laryngoscope (<italic>P</italic>=0.01). Mallampati classes of the patients studied were comparable in both groups. The studies conducted by Malik <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Barak <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] and Rashid <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] showed a significantly better glottic view with the TruView laryngoscope when compared with the Macintosh laryngoscope. The studies conducted by Laurent <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] and Gabbot <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] showed a significantly better glottic view with the McCoy laryngoscope when compared with the Macintosh laryngoscope.</p><p>The cardiovascular response to laryngoscopy and intubation is significantly higher with the McCoy group than with the TruView group. There was a significant increase in heart rate in both groups up to 2 min after intubation, but it did not persist till 5 min. The increase in heart rate is significantly higher in the McCoy group than in the TruView group for 1 min after intubation. In the second minute, there was no significant difference between the two groups. There was significant increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in both the groups for 5 min after intubation. And, the increase in blood pressure is significantly higher in the McCoy group than the in TruView group for 2 min after intubation. In the fifth minute, there is no significant difference between the two groups. This less hemodynamic response with TruView may be due to the lesser force applied to the base of the tongue by TruView. The lifting force is very minimal with TruView when compared with McCoy. In the study conducted by Rashid <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] the hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation was significantly less with the TruView laryngoscope when compared with the Macintosh laryngoscope. The duration of intubation was significantly less with the McCoy laryngoscope (mean of 22.9 s with standard deviation of 8.5) than with the TruView laryngoscope (mean of 33.2 s with standard deviation of 12.3), with a <italic>P</italic> value of less than 0.001, which shows that it is very highly significant. The main reason for increased duration of tracheal intubation with TruView is the difficulty experienced in advancing the tube through the lateral side of the patient's mouth, which was also reported by Malik <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] and Barak <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Another problem with TruView is fogging, which hinders the visualization of the cords. To overcome this, we have used Oxygen at the flow rate of 6 L/min. There was no intubation failure in any group. There was no incidence of dental or more severe airway laceration with any group. Appearance of blood on the laryngoscope blade was noted in one patient each in both groups.</p><p>However, there are a few limitations to this study. The potential for observer bias does exist, as it is extremely difficult to blind the anesthesiologist intubating with the device to data collection. Another limitation is that the study did not focus on which laryngoscope would be appropriate in a case of difficult intubation, as none of the patients had a Cormack and Lehane grade of 4. This arose from the fact that any potential difficult airway was excluded from the study.</p><p>In conclusion, while comparing the effectiveness of the TruView EVO2 and the McCoy laryngoscopes, when performing tracheal intubation in patients with neck immobilization using manual in-line axial cervical spine stabilization, we found that the TruView laryngoscope appears to be better than the McCoy laryngoscope in terms of ease of laryngoscopy and intubation, lesser hemodynamic response and better glottic view.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Appendix 1</title><p>N1=No. of intubation attempts &#x0003e;1</p><p>N2=No. of operators &#x0003e;1</p><p>N3=No. of alternative intubation techniques used</p><p>N4=Glottic exposure (Cormack and Lehane grade minus 1)</p><p>N5=Lifting force required during laryngoscope (0 - normal, 1 - increased)</p><p>N6=Necessity for external laryngeal pressure (0 - not applied, 1 - applied)</p><p>N7=Position of the vocal cords at intubation (0 - abduction/not visualized, 1 - adduction)</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="SJA-6-248-g009.jpg"/></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Grossman</surname><given-names>MD</given-names></name><name><surname>Reilly</surname><given-names>PM</given-names></name><name><surname>Gillet</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>National Survey of the incidence of Cervical Spine Injury and Approach to Cervical Spine Clearance in US trauma centre</article-title><source>J Trauma</source><year>1997</year><volume>47</volume><fpage>684</fpage><lpage>90</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10528602</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hastings</surname><given-names>RH</given-names></name><name><surname>Kelly</surname><given-names>SD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Neurologic deterioration associated with airway management in a cervical spine injured patient</article-title><source>Anaesthesiology</source><year>1993</year><volume>78</volume><fpage>580</fpage><lpage>3</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lennarson</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>DW</given-names></name><name><surname>Sawin</surname><given-names>PD</given-names></name><name><surname>Todd</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name><name><surname>Sato</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Traynelis</surname><given-names>VC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Cervical spine motion during intubation.Efficacy of stabilization manoeuvres in the setting of complete segmental instability</article-title><source>J Neurosurg</source><year>2001</year><volume>94</volume><fpage>265</fpage><lpage>70</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11302629</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gerling</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>DP</given-names></name><name><surname>Hamilton</surname><given-names>RS</given-names></name><name><surname>Morris</surname><given-names>GF</given-names></name><name><surname>Vilke</surname><given-names>GM</given-names></name><name><surname>Gartin</surname></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Effects of cervical spine immobilization technique &#x00026; laryngoscope blade selection on an unstable cervical spine in a cadaver model of intubation</article-title><source>Ann Emerg Med</source><year>2000</year><volume>36</volume><fpage>293</fpage><lpage>300</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11020675</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nolan</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>ME</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Orotracheal intubation in patients with potential cervical spine injuries.
