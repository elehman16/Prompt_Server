Guanfacine extended release (GXR), a selective &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist, is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as monotherapy and as adjunctive therapy to psychostimulant medications for the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents aged 6&#x02013;17&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The safety and efficacy of GXR in combination with psychostimulants were demonstrated in two trials. An open-label, 9-week study of 75 children and adolescents with ADHD who had operationally defined suboptimal responses to a psychostimulant found that the addition of GXR did not result in unique adverse events (AEs) compared with those reported historically with either treatment alone, and was associated with significant improvements in ADHD symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, a large, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of GXR as adjunctive therapy to psychostimulants in children and adolescents aged 6&#x02013;17&#x000a0;years with ADHD who exhibited suboptimal responses to psychostimulants alone confirmed the results of the earlier open-label investigation and provided further support for the effectiveness of GXR as an adjunctive therapy to psychostimulants in this age group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Since methylphenidate hydrochloride (MPH) is considered among first-line treatments for ADHD because of its established efficacy and safety profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the potential for pharmacokinetic drug&#x02013;drug interactions between GXR and MPH requires thorough investigation.</p><p>Although guanfacine is known to be metabolized by the cytochrome p450 (CYP) 3A4 pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], MPH is primarily metabolized by de-esterification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Even though MPH is not metabolized by the CYP system and is neither an inducer nor an inhibitor of the system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], it is important to study the pharmacokinetics of GXR in combination with MPH to confirm the lack of metabolic interactions between these two therapies.</p><p>Although data on the pharmacokinetics of GXR used in combination with MPH are limited, the pharmacokinetic profiles of GXR or MPH alone have been well characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. GXR is readily absorbed and is approximately 70&#x000a0;% bound to plasma proteins, independent of the drug concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Oral administration of single doses of GXR in adults leads to a maximum guanfacine plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) in approximately 5&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A single-dose pharmacokinetic study of GXR in healthy adults demonstrated that the single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of GXR 1-, 2-, and 4-mg tablets were statistically linear, with the C<sub>max</sub>, area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve (AUC) to the last measurable concentration at time t (AUC<sub>t</sub>), and AUC extrapolated to infinity (AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub>) for guanfacine increasing with dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. MPH is also readily absorbed, with MPH mean concentrations initially plateauing at 1&#x02013;4&#x000a0;h and ascending to maximum plasma concentrations between 6&#x02013;10&#x000a0;h after administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>The safety profiles of both GXR and MPH alone have also been examined in previous studies. The most common treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) reported in the short-term pivotal studies of GXR included somnolence, fatigue, upper abdominal pain, and sedation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The most common adverse reactions reported in clinical trials of MPH included upper abdominal pain, vomiting, dizziness, and insomnia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The effects of these medications on cardiovascular parameters have also been examined. In subjects who received GXR in clinical trials, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and pulse rate decreased as actual doses increased, and they then returned toward baseline as doses stabilized and were tapered down [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These changes were expected, given that immediate-release guanfacine was initially used as an antihypertensive agent. In contrast, increases in SBP, DBP, and pulse rate are often reported with MPH treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Consequently, there is a need to investigate the impact of coadministration of GXR and MPH on these parameters as well as the overall safety of this combination.</p><p>The primary purpose of the present study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00901576) was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profiles of GXR and MPH, alone and in combination, in healthy adults. Evaluating the safety of GXR, MPH, and coadministration of both drugs was a secondary objective of this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This open-label, randomized, single-center, three-period crossover, drug&#x02013;drug interaction study was conducted from 18 May to 6 July 2009.

The most commonly reported TEAEs included headache (5.4, 10.5, and 8.1&#x000a0;% following GXR, MPH, and GXR and MPH combined, respectively), dizziness (2.7, 5.3, and 2.7&#x000a0;%, respectively), and postural dizziness (8.1, 0.0 and 0.0&#x000a0;%, respectively). The TEAEs observed were consistent with the known effects of GXR and MPH administered alone.</p><p>One event (orthostatic syncope) was considered serious but was mild in severity and did not lead to study discontinuation. The subject was a 22-year-old male who had no relevant history, no history of syncope, and no recent illness. The event occurred 2&#x000a0;h after he received his first treatment, which was a single oral dose of GXR 4&#x000a0;mg alone. The event lasted less than 1 minute, and the subject recovered spontaneously and completed the study.</p><p>No subject had a severe AE or an AE leading to withdrawal. The majority of TEAEs were mild, and no differences in the types, incidences, or severity of TEAEs were reported across treatments. No clinically meaningful differences in biochemistry, hematology, or urinalysis results across treatment groups were noted.</p><p>The effects of monotherapy with GXR or MPH on vital signs, including SBP, DBP, and supine pulse rate, were as expected. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the mean supine pulse rates over the course of 12&#x000a0;h following administration of GXR, MPH, and GXR and MPH.

Postural orthostatic changes in pulse rate and BP after coadministration of GXR and MPH were highly variable. There did not appear to be clinically important postural orthostatic changes in pulse rate or BP following coadministration of GXR and MPH compared with GXR alone.</p><p>Two subjects had potentially clinically significant abnormalities in ECG results based upon prespecified parameters (asymptomatic supraventricular extrasystoles and a wandering atrial pacemaker). Both abnormalities occurred 2&#x000a0;h after coadministration of GXR and MPH, were mild in severity, and resolved the same day. These abnormalities were determined not to be clinically meaningful ECG changes; overall, ECG results were consistent with the known effects of these compounds.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In clinical practice, &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonists such as GXR have been coadministered with psychostimulants such as MPH to treat ADHD, and GXR is now indicated as adjunctive therapy to psychostimulant medications for the treatment of ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Although guanfacine is known to be metabolized by the CYP3A4 system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and MPH is neither an inducer nor an inhibitor of that system, it was considered prudent to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of this combination.</p><p>In this study of healthy adults, no pharmacokinetic drug interactions were observed with coadministration of GXR and MPH. No noteworthy differences in pharmacokinetic parameters were observed with GXR and MPH in combination compared with either medication alone. In fact, analyses of the 90&#x000a0;% CIs of the GMRs for C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub> of guanfacine alone or in combination with MPH, or MPH alone or in combination with GXR, met strict bioequivalence criteria (90&#x000a0;% CIs within the interval of 0.80&#x02013;1.25).</p><p>The TEAEs reported in this study were expected and consistent with those observed historically with psychostimulants administered alone or with GXR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. No differences in the type, incidence, or severity of TEAEs among treatment groups were observed, and no subject discontinued treatment because of a TEAE.</p><p>No clinically meaningful changes in ECG results, laboratory parameters, or physical examination findings were noted during the study. Modest changes in BP and supine pulse rate were seen with GXR and MPH treatment alone and were expected. When GXR and MPH were coadministered as single doses, data from this study indicated a potential offsetting effect on pulse rate and BP, compared with the effects typically observed with either treatment alone. Because this study evaluated the impact of only a single dose of GXR and MPH, alone and in combination, it is unknown if this effect would continue with longer-term therapy.</p><p>This study had several limitations. It was a small, short-term, open-label study that only included healthy adult men and women. This population is not representative of the range of patients who are treated with GXR coadministered with a stimulant. Additionally, patients with ADHD have a higher prevalence of comorbid disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and oppositional disorder, compared with control subjects, and subjects with those disorders were excluded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. As this was a single-dose study, rather than a multiple-dose study, the effects seen in the study may not be representative of those seen at steady state. Because of these limitations, the findings of this study may not be readily extrapolated to the therapeutic setting. Moreover, because of the short-term nature of the study, the implications of the results for long-term management of ADHD with a combination of GXR and MPH are also unknown.</p><p>This study was not designed to robustly assess the cardiovascular effects of either GXR or MPH alone or in combination. In fact, the study excluded subjects with comorbidities that might contribute to cardiac AEs and subjects with medical or psychiatric disorders. Therefore, it is important to be cautious when generalizing from the results of this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this short-term, open-label study of healthy adults, coadministration of GXR and MPH did not result in significant pharmacokinetic drug&#x02013;drug interactions.
