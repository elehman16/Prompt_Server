Young children (5&#x000a0;years or younger) spend up to 12&#x000a0;h/day sedentary, of which around 2&#x000a0;h is spent in screen time (e.g. watching television). Interventions to reduce sedentary behaviour in early childhood report mixed results and many have limited potential for scalability. Mobile phones offer a wide-reaching, low-cost avenue for the delivery of health behaviour programmes to parents but their potential to reduce young children&#x02019;s sedentary behaviour has not been widely tested. This study aims to test the feasibility and efficacy of a parent-focused, predominantly mobile telephone-delivered intervention to support parents to minimise the amount of time their child spends using screens and in overall sitting time.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>Mini Movers is a pilot randomised controlled trial recruiting 100 parents and children. Inclusion criteria include having a child aged between 2 and 4&#x000a0;years, being able to speak, read and write English, and smartphone ownership. Participants will be randomised to the intervention or a wait-list control group at a 1:1 ratio. Intervention group parents will receive printed materials including a content booklet and goal-checking magnet and will participate in a one-on-one discussion with the interventionist to plan two goals to reduce their child&#x02019;s sedentary behaviour. Subsequently, the intervention will be delivered over 6&#x000a0;weeks via personalised and interactive text messages promoting positive health behaviours (strategies for decreasing screen time and overall sitting time), goal setting and self-monitoring. Outcomes to be assessed include intervention feasibility and children&#x02019;s screen time and objectively-assessed sitting time.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Few studies have used mobile phone technology to deliver health behaviour programmes to parents of young children.

Some sedentary behaviours, such as television viewing, have been shown to track over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], with early childhood (i.e. birth through 5&#x000a0;years) being recognised as a critical period in which sedentary behaviour habits are established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Guidelines for sedentary behaviour in Australia and internationally recommend that children aged 2 to 5&#x000a0;years should have less than 1&#x000a0;h per day of screen time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Additionally, it is recommended that situations that restrict movement, i.e. in a car seat, stroller or high chair, should be minimised for children aged 5&#x000a0;years and younger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Research has shown that 2- to 5-year-old children are spending on average 2&#x000a0;h per day in screen time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], with only around a quarter of these children meeting current recommendations of 1&#x000a0;h or less per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Children of this age are also spending up to 12&#x000a0;h per day in any form of sedentary behaviour when assessed objectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and approximately 2&#x000a0;h per day in situations that restrict movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This suggests that there is considerable scope to reduce sedentary behaviour in young children. Feasible, acceptable and effective interventions are required during the early childhood period, prior to the establishment of less than optimal levels of sedentary behaviour.</p><p>A recent review of interventions to reduce screen time in children younger than 12&#x000a0;years identified 47 studies, of which only 13 targeted children under the age of 6&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. All of the studies targeting young children were conducted in the United States and the majority (11 studies) were delivered in either preschools or clinic- and Women, Infant and Children (WIC)-based (federally assisted programs for low-income mothers and children in the United States) settings, with the remaining two conducted in the home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Schmidt et al. noted that the largest reductions in television viewing across all studies (i.e. all age groups) were seen in home-based settings, and suggested that high levels of parental involvement are important for intervention effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. An earlier review of obesity-prevention interventions during early childhood similarly suggested that the lack of parental involvement in preschool interventions may explain the lack of significant results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Findings from Schmidt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] highlight the relative paucity of interventions in early childhood, and also the need for interventions that are scalable and have large reach.</p><p>Given the rapid and wide adoption of mobile phone usage across most adult age and demographic groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], health behaviour programmes are increasingly being delivered by mobile phone technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In particular, text messages, or short message services (SMS), are considered to be a wide-reaching, low-cost channel for the delivery of health behaviour programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Text messages are also instantaneous and convenient, in that individuals can read them in their own time. Moreover, they can be individually tailored, which has been shown to have positive effects on behaviour change and reduces attrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, to date, text message interventions have largely focused on preventative health behaviours in adults, such as smoking cessation, and clinical care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Few studies have used text messages in programs targeting child and adolescent health behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, a recent pilot intervention delivered largely via text messages to parents, that focused on healthy lifestyle behaviours for overweight and obese preschoolers, showed significant improvements in parental knowledge around nutrition and physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Moreover, the intervention was found to be both feasible and acceptable for parents of young children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] suggesting such delivery modes hold promise in this population group. Thus, the aim of this study is to test the feasibility and efficacy of a parent-focused, predominantly mobile telephone-delivered intervention to support parents to minimise the amount of time that their 2&#x02013;4-year-old children spend in sedentary behaviour.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Overview</title><p>This protocol describes a two-armed, pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a parent-focused, predominantly mobile phone-delivered intervention to reduce sedentary behaviour in 2- to 4-year-old children. The protocol is guided by the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and the Consolidated Standards of Research Trials (CONSORT) &#x02013; EHEALTH guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: shows the completed SPIRIT Checklist (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Participants will be recruited in Melbourne, Australia through existing playgroups, parent-focused websites and social media, and snowball sampling.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Playgroups</title><p>In Australia, playgroups are informal gatherings for parents, caregivers and their children prior to the commencement of primary school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In addition to providing opportunities for children to interact, play and develop, playgroups also provide a supportive environment for parents to share experiences about parenting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Hence, they may provide an ideal setting for recruiting parents for child behaviour interventions, as parents may be more receptive in a setting where other child or parenting issues are usually discussed. The Playgroup Victoria public website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.playgroup.org.au/">http://www.playgroup.org.au</ext-link>) provides names and contact details for the lead parents and/or playgroup leaders of playgroups across the state. Playgroups within a 10-km radius from the study site (Deakin University, Burwood Campus, Melbourne, Australia) will be identified via the website and randomly selected. Lead parents/playgroup leaders will be contacted by email and/or phone initially to gauge interest in the intervention programme and determine if the families attending the playgroup meet the inclusion criteria for the study. If the leader expresses interest and families appear to be eligible, a researcher will visit the playgroup to explain the study to the parents and provide them with plain language statements, Consent Forms and contact details of the research team. Parents will be able to provide written consent on the day of the recruitment visit, or will be able to return their consent form by email, post or in person at the baseline visit the following week. Alternatively, for more structured playgroups where a recruitment visit may not be possible, flyers with brief programme information will be delivered for playgroup leaders to hand out to parents. Interested parents will then be able to contact the research team directly for more information.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Websites and social media</title><p>Individuals and organisations that provide services to, or work, volunteer or collaborate with, the target population (i.e. parents with young children; e.g. reputable parenting blogs) will be contacted and asked to post information about the study on their website, community groups, blog or social media (e.g. Twitter, Facebook). Information on websites and social media will be the same as that included on the flyer and will instruct parents who are interested in participating to contact the research team directly for more information.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Snowball sampling</title><p>Parents participating in the programme will be asked to pass on the details of the study and research team to any friends that may be interested in participating.

If more than one parent is recruited in a playgroup, randomisation will occur at the group level to avoid potential contamination. A computer-generated random number schedule will be developed by a researcher (not part of the research team) who has no contact with the participants. Allocation will be concealed by sealed, opaque envelopes, which will be opened and revealed to the researcher and participant(s) after baseline data collection to minimise selection and measurement bias.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Mini Movers intervention</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Intervention content</title><p>The intervention content for Mini Movers was developed based on evidence-based guidelines for sedentary behaviour and active play in early childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and guided by the CALO-RE taxonomy of behaviour change techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and Social Cognitive Theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The intervention comprises a content booklet, a one-on-one goal-setting discussion with the interventionist, and regular, personalised text messages for a period of 6&#x000a0;weeks.

</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Intervention materials</title><p>After baseline measures have been completed and randomisation has taken place, participants in the intervention group will receive their intervention materials, including a content booklet, goal-checking magnet and a Move and Play Every Day: National Physical Activity Recommendations for Child 0&#x02013;5 Years brochure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The content booklet provides an overview of the Mini Movers programme and text messages that parents will receive, suggests ideas for reducing sedentary behaviour and increasing active play, and introduces goal setting. At this time, participants will have a one-on-one discussion with the interventionist to set their goals. Participants will be asked to set two goals around their child&#x02019;s sedentary behaviour; specifically, one screen time goal (e.g. to limit their child&#x02019;s screen time to 60&#x000a0;min per day) and one overall sedentary behaviour goal (e.g. to walk to local destinations without the pram on 3&#x000a0;days per week). The interventionist will assist participants in identifying and setting SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-bound) goals. The goal-checking magnet provided to participants was designed to help track their progress with their two goals for the duration of the programme (6&#x000a0;weeks).</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Text messages</title><p>Personalised, interactive text messages will be the main mode of delivery for the intervention. Participants will receive four text messages per week for 6&#x000a0;weeks (24 texts in total). The text messages will include ideas for limiting and displacing their child&#x02019;s screen and sitting time, active play ideas, and monitoring and encouraging achievement of individual goals. Some text messages will include links to reputable websites for further information.</p><p>The text messages will be tailored to the participant&#x02019;s name, child&#x02019;s name, behaviour goals and the interventionist&#x02019;s name, as evidence suggests that personalisation of text message programs encourages behaviour change and reduces attrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Text messages will be sent on specific dates at specific times. Participants will be asked to nominate a preferred time of day to receive messages (e.g. early morning, late afternoon); however, some text messages are designed to be delivered at specific times of the day to coincide with specific activities (e.g. ideas for keeping their child entertained without screens whilst cooking dinner). Examples of the text messages include: &#x0201c;Hi &#x000ab;parent&#x000bb;. We know that entertaining &#x000ab;child&#x000bb; can be difficult sometimes without using the TV or other screens.

Existing interventions to reduce sedentary behaviour in early childhood are scarce and report mixed results; few have been conducted with parents outside the preschool setting and many have limited potential for scalability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Mobile phones have been rapidly adopted across most demographic groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and offer a wide-reaching, low-cost channel for the delivery of health behaviour programs. However, they have not been extensively used in health behaviour programs for parents of young children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Hence, small-scale RCTs are required to determine whether interventions delivered in this way are acceptable, feasible and practical for both participants and researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p>Strengths of the current pilot study include the use of an objective measure of children&#x02019;s sitting time and the large range of specific sedentary behaviours assessed (encompassing screen time, time spent restrained). In addition, the use of mobile phone technology to deliver the majority of the intervention content affords the potential for the intervention to be scaled-up and widely disseminated.</p><p>The findings of this study will be used to inform the development of larger-scale, mobile technology RCTs to support parents to minimise the amount of time their children spend in sedentary behaviour. Moreover, findings will contribute to the limited medical literature on interventions designed to support health behaviour during early childhood.</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial commenced recruitment in June 2016.
