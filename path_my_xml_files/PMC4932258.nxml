Poor satisfaction levels reflect a large difference between expectations and fulfilment of perceived needs, and may have implications for adherence to treatment that subsequently affects patient outcomes.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> For example, following cardiac surgery, patients dissatisfied with discharge information were more likely to report a poorer physical recovery and psychological state at home 1&#x02005;month after undergoing surgery.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><sec id="s1a"><title>Family satisfaction with care</title><p>Severe illness and its potential outcome impacts not only on the patient, but also their close family, defined as those persons with close family, social or emotional relationships with the patient. In addition, many intensive care unit (ICU) patients cannot make decisions for themselves. Their family must, therefore, become surrogate decision-makers for important parts of the care process. Hence, measuring family satisfaction with ICU care has become an important and essential component of quality of care in this setting.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Several family satisfaction surveys measuring satisfaction with general ICU care have been developed with sound psychometric properties, and have been reviewed elsewhere.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The key domains related to family satisfaction include ICU environment<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and process of care,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> sufficient information, and quality communication with medical professionals to make important decisions about care.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In order to improve the quality of care in ICU, it is essential to examine the perspectives of the patients and their family members,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and implement strategies to address areas of concern. As an example of the impact of the environment of ICU on patients, the satisfaction levels of patients and family members increased by 6% with the changes due to a shift from a ward with multiple beds to a newly designed ICU with noise-reduced, single rooms with daylight and improved family facilities.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Patient and family psychological distress</title><p>Surgical patients encounter physical trauma and psychological distress after surgery.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Psychological distress has been defined as a collective term for anxiety and depression levels.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Beyond that, an unfamiliar hospital environment, such as the ICU, is another stressful factor that is associated with high anxiety and depression levels.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients, anxiety and depression occurs for several reasons: (1) routine procedures during ICU admission, for instance, oral and nasal tubes are important stressors<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> because they result in an inability to talk, affecting communication with ICU staff and (2) the associated time spent on the waiting list before the surgery. The prevalence of clinically significant anxiety and depression in patients awaiting CABG was 28% and 47%, respectively.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Results from a systematic review found that higher levels of preoperative anxiety and depression in CABG patients were predictive of psychological distress in the postoperative period.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Generally, family members were significantly more anxious than patients themselves about the cardiac surgery.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> However, family members of the cardiac surgery patients reported lower level of anxiety and high satisfaction if their informational needs about the surgery and treatment of the patients were fulfilled.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Informational needs</title><p>Previous studies have shown that multimedia educational interventions can reduce anxiety and foster an understanding of the processes and risks of cardiac surgery for patients<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and their family members,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> regardless of the format to convey the patient education: using tape,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> written leaflets<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> or verbally during the preoperative visit by ICU or specialist cardiac nurses.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Additionally, results from a multicentre study in a non-cardiac ICU<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> showed that disclosing all the available information in a frank, direct and empathetic way could meet the informational needs of family members about the patients and thus, they were more satisfied; conversely, families who felt that they had received contradictory information had 21.1% lower satisfaction scores than their counterparts.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Effect of patient education</title><p>Having a preoperative patient education programme which provides sufficient information on the risk and process of surgery to patients may help to increase their satisfaction levels and reduce their anxiety levels. A randomised controlled trial<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> of a preoperative educational intervention (usual care plus information leaflet and verbal advice) versus usual care for patients undergoing cardiac surgery showed a moderate reduction in anxiety levels (adjusted mean difference &#x02212;3.6, 95% CI &#x02212;4.62 to &#x02212;2.57) and depression levels (adjusted mean difference &#x02212;2.1, 95% CI &#x02212;3.19 to &#x02212;0.92) using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Another recent study showed that an effective nurse-led preoperative education not only reduced anxiety levels, but also reduced the risk of postoperative complications, such as sternal infection, in cardiac surgical patients.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>However, the evidence to support benefits from patient education in the ICU setting is mixed. In a recent multicentred randomised controlled trial of a structured information programme during the ICU stay as compared with a non-specific conversation of similar duration, there was no reduction in patient anxiety levels (mean difference &#x02212;0.2, 95% CI &#x02212;4.5 to 4.1, on a scale from 0 (no anxiety) to 100 (maximum anxiety)) in medical and surgical critically ill ICU patients.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In a cross-sectional study of family members visiting ICU patients, although there was a moderate correlation between family perception of informational support and satisfaction with care (r=0.74, p&#x0003c;0.001), very little correlation between informational support and anxiety levels (r=&#x02212;0.13, p=0.50) was found.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Neither of the two studies provided information about the ICU before the ICU admission.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> A non-randomised study examining the effect of a preoperative ICU tour prior to cardiac surgery failed to detect a significant difference in anxiety levels between the control (no ICU tour) and treatment (ICU tour) after adjusting for previous ICU experience (p=0.43).<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Nevertheless, the authors showed that patients in the treatment group perceived the tour to be beneficial for themselves and for future patients.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In addition, other studies found that in order to reduce psychological distress, both ICU nurses and patients believed that preoperative patient education led by ICU nurses explaining the reasons for ICU admission, ICU environment and the expected postoperative care would be beneficial.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1e"><title>Significance of the present study</title><p>The previous studies discussed above have focused individually on the separate issues of satisfaction with general ICU care, preoperative psychological distress and informational needs related to surgical aspects of care. However, few have adequately examined the effect of educational interventions specifically targeting surgical issues and the postoperative ICU stay, or investigated the inter-relationships between patient education, patient and family satisfaction scores, and measures of anxiety and depression. This two-group, parallel, superiority, double-blinded randomised controlled trial will examine the effectiveness of a multifaceted patient education intervention on patient and family satisfaction, and postoperative anxiety and depression in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The primary objective is to determine the effect of the preoperative patient education package (video and ICU tour) for patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery on patient and family satisfaction with care and decision-making in the ICU. The second objective of the study is to determine the effect of preoperative patient education package on anxiety and depression levels in patients after elective cardiac surgery. The primary hypothesis is that preoperative patient education will increase both patient and family satisfaction levels after elective cardiac surgery, and the secondary hypothesis is that preoperative patient education will reduce patient anxiety and depression measures after cardiac surgery.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>We will conduct a single-centre, double-blinded, two-group, parallel, superiority, randomised controlled trial of 100 adults undergoing general anaesthesia for elective CABG, with or without valve replacement (CABG&#x000b1;valve) surgery.

Currently, there are 12&#x02013;15 adults who undergo elective CABG&#x000b1;valve surgery per month. All elective CABG&#x000b1;valve surgery patients are routinely admitted to our 22-bed ICU for early postoperative care and monitoring with 1:1 nursing at all times, and are expected to be discharged from ICU to a high dependency cardiac ward within 24&#x02005;hours after surgery.</p><p>Only adult patients undergoing primary elective CABG&#x000b1;valve surgery whose primary language is Cantonese will be recruited from the operating theatre list published on the day before cardiac surgery. A face-to-face meeting will be scheduled with potential participants to confirm their study eligibility. Before obtaining written informed consent, the purpose of the study, procedures, risks and benefits of participation, and the time commitment involved will be explained to them. Patients and family members may withdraw from the study without prejudice at any time during the study.</p><p>The patient education intervention includes a video in Cantonese, the predominant language used in Hong Kong. Patients will be excluded if they have a history of dementia, psychosis or neurological disease that would prevent them from completing the outcome questionnaires and are unable to provide written informed consent. We will also exclude patients undergoing emergency cardiac surgery (no opportunity to apply the intervention), patients who have had a previous cardiac surgery (prior exposure) and those who have received previous care in an ICU (prior exposure).</p><p>Family members of the patient will be also invited to join the patient education intervention before the elective cardiac surgery. &#x02018;Family&#x02019; will be defined as persons with close family, social or emotional relationship to the patient;<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> thus, next of kin and adult children of the patient will be included in the study. One family member per patient will be recruited. Family members will be excluded if they are unable to understand Cantonese, have previous experience with ICU care, previously underwent any cardiac surgery or did not visit the patient in ICU. The reasons for exclusion and number of patients or families lost to follow-up will be documented.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Sample size</title><p>A sample size of 45 in each group will have 80% power to detect a difference in means of 10 points (the difference between mean control group satisfaction of 70 and a mean intervention group satisfaction of 80) assuming that the common SD is 16.6 (effect size of 0.60) using a two-group t-test with a 0.05 two-sided significance level.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> We considered this moderate effect size as clinically important. Given that our fast-track failure rate in cardiac surgery is &#x0223c;10%, we will recruit 100 patients for the study (50 patients in each group). A study of 100 is adequately powered to detect a decrease in anxiety (unadjusted mean difference of 2.7) score at day 7 after cardiac surgery (using the Chinese&#x02013;Cantonese version of HADS<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) that was associated with a preoperative education intervention.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The sample size calculations were performed using nQuery Advisor V.7.0 (Statistical Solutions, Cork, Ireland).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Randomisation and allocation concealment</title><p>Block randomisation with 1:1 allocation will be carried out according to a computer-generated sequence, and will be performed by one of the authors (AL) not involved in screening, patient recruitment, clinical care or data collection, using a software program PASS V.11 software (NCSS, Kaysville, Utah, USA). The treatment allocation will be concealed in consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes, and opened after obtaining patient consent before surgery and measuring of baseline anxiety and depression levels.

<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34&#x02013;36</xref> and translated into Chinese<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and other languages.

The surveys each take about 10&#x02013;15&#x02005;min to complete for patients and a close family member. All items use a five-point Likert scale, and will be recoded and transformed to a 0&#x02013;100 scale (0 represents poor satisfaction, 100 represent high satisfaction) for both subscales and the total satisfaction score. The reliability of the overall satisfaction score is high (Cronbach's &#x003b1;=0.94), and there are moderate-to-strong correlations with the Quality and Dying and Death questionnaire and nurse-assessed quality indicators.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p><p>Both the Chinese 24-item FS-ICU survey for family members and its adapted patient version will be used on day 3 after the surgery. In the event that the patient stays longer than 24&#x02005;hours in the ICU, the questionnaires will be completed on the third day after the time of extubation. Every effort will be made to collect the family satisfaction data during visiting hours by a blinded outcome assessor.

A designated care team was formed, consisting of a group of ICU nurses who were trained in the postoperative care of cardiac surgical patients, as well as for conducting preoperative ICU site visits. The aim of the preoperative ICU visit was to decrease patients' anxiety levels due to unfamiliarity with the ICU environment and to have a better understanding of the immediate postoperative management in the ICU. As the feedback to the site visit by the healthcare team, patients and family members were positive, a preoperative video was developed in 2002. When severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak occurred in 2003, the video viewings and ICU tours stopped. We did not reinstitute the ICU education intervention after the outbreak.</p><p>Using the literature to establish the factors associated with anxiety and those important to patients and family members regarding ICU care (outlined in the introduction), as well as the experience gained in the brief education intervention before SARS, we developed an updated video. To improve the portrayal accuracy of the video, we employed a professional actor to play the role of a patient for this project. The video aimed to standardise the information content of the visit and included information about the ICU environment, routine care and expected postoperative course of the patient (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">box 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study builds on the work performed in the past. The video provides comprehensive and standardised preoperative information to patients and family members about ICU care to complement preoperative information given by other healthcare professionals working in the cardiac surgical ward. Early informal feedback from patients and family members in the treatment arm is positive, with a common theme that the intervention makes the perioperative pathway processes more transparent to them. This may help set more achievable recovery goals and expectations, and therefore affect satisfaction levels related to the healthcare provided. However, a limitation of the study is that the overall contact time in ICU is limited, in most cases to 24&#x02005;hours after cardiac surgery. Also, we did not include family members' anxiety and depression levels due to the time constraints during visiting hours.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Dissemination</title><p>We are unaware of studies examining both patient and family satisfaction levels with ICU care associated with preoperative patient education for major surgery requiring postoperative ICU care. This paper describes a patient education intervention for use within the Hong Kong health service and the video (in Cantonese dialect) will be made available to others after completing the trial on request to the authors. The results of this study will highlight aspects of ICU care and decision-making process for further quality health services improvement. As part of the knowledge translation approach, study participants will receive a one-page plain language summary of the results. The results will be disseminated at an international critical care medicine conference and in a peer-reviewed journal.
