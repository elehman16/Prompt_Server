Twenty-six consecutive Caucasian patients (26 eyes) with ocular hypertension after pars plana vitrectomy and SOI were included in the study.

The first part of the surgical procedure was similar between groups. The operation was performed under monitored anesthesia care using a peribulbar block; a 6-0 silk stay suture (B Braun Aesculap, Tuttlingen, Germany) was placed in the superior cornea, and the eye moved inferiorly. A 30 gauge needle was passed through the conjunctiva (at 7 mm from limbus) and it was advanced laterally in Tenon's capsule, creating a bubble; the wound bed was treated with 0.1 mg/mL mitomycin c to prevent spread over the future site of the conjunctival wound. After 3 min, the perilimbal conjunctiva was opened 5-7 mm and saline solution was injected into Tenon's capsule. The process was repeated 3 times until a total of 10 mL of balanced saline solution was used. The exposed sclera under the conjunctival flap was cleaned with gentle bipolar diathermy.</p><p>A scleral flap (4 mm &#x000d7; 3 mm) was created first by cutting a horizontal incision parallel to the limbus using a blade calibrated at 250 &#x003bc;m (BD, Waltham, MA, USA). Subsequently, a partial thickness scleral pocket was dissected with a crescent knife angled bevel up (Alcon Ophthalmic, Fort Worth, TX, USA), and finally, cutting the two side incisions.</p><p>A 4 mm &#x000d7; 4 mm piece of sponge soaked in mitomycin c (0.1 mg/mL) was placed under the dissected scleral flap. After an exposure time of 2 min, the sponge was removed, and the area was irrigated with 20 mL of balanced saline solution. A paracentesis was created using a 15&#x000b0; slit knife (Pearsalls Ltd., Taunton, UK), followed by injection of carbacolo solution (Farmigea, Pisa, Italy) and viscoelastic solution (Healon GV Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) in the anterior chamber.</p><p>Then, in the trabeculectomy group, the 2.85 mm blade (Peasralls Limited) was used to enter the anterior chamber and create a sclerotomy. A 1.5 mm diameter hemispherical block of corneal trabecular tissue was excised using a trabeculectomy punch (E Janach, Como, Italy) beneath the scleral flap. An iridotomy was performed in all cases. In the Ex-PRESS group, a 27 gauge needle was used to create the sclerotomy through which the Ex-PRESS device was placed [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Ex-PRESS under scleral flap</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="MEAJO-23-177-g002"/></fig><p>Subsequently, in both groups, the scleral flap was closed with two 10-0 nylon interrupted sutures (Sharpoint Surgical Specialties Corporation, Reading, PA, USA) (one at each corner, with knots buried in the sclera). The conjunctiva was closed using 8-0 Safil quick interrupted sutures (B Braun Aesculap, Tuttlingen, Germany).

There are several underlying mechanisms that may be interrelated that cause elevated IOP. In a significant proportion of cases, IOP elevation is directly related to the presence of SO in the anterior chamber, with or without emulsification and regardless of the duration of SO tamponade.</p><p>Although the removal of SO reduces IOP, 7.1-10%<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> of patients develop uncontrolled glaucoma despite medical therapy. Moisseiev <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> reported improved IOP in only 1 of 11 eyes after removal of emulsified oil. Honavar <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> observed success in 15 of 35 patients who underwent only SO removal, and in 3 of 5 patients (60%) who underwent trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (0.4 mg/ml for 3 min). However, the follow-up duration was not documented.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Casswell and Gregor<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> reported success in 5 of 9 eyes (55.55%) after trabeculectomy preceded by SO removal and no medical therapy.</p><p>A number of studies<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> have suggested that implantation of glaucoma drainage device improves outcomes in lowering IOP in SO glaucoma compared to trabeculectomy. In glaucomatous eyes with and without SO endotamponade, treated with the Ahmed glaucoma valve, Ishida <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> reported a success rate of 47% in SO group and 76% in the group without SO (4 years follow-up). SO was identified as a risk factors for surgical failure by the Cox hazard model (risk ratio = 3.43; <italic>P</italic> = 0.04). Nguyen <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> reported a 60% (3 of 5 eyes) success rate with the Molteno implant and Scott <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> reported a 78% success rate at 1 year follow-up after implantation of the 350 mm<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Baerveldt device.</p><p>Wickham <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> documented ultrastructural evidence of SO in trabecular meshwork associated with a macrophage response. This study<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> suggested a trabecular infiltration of SO with an associated trabeculitis and macrophages often contained phagocytosed SO.</p><p>These changes likely persist even after oil removal, and may account for the chronically raised IOP seen in eyes that had previously intraocular SO.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>Trabeculectomy in silicomacrophagocytic open-angle glaucoma is technically difficult because of conjunctival scarring from the vitreoretinal surgery resulting in poor prognosis.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Failed trabeculectomy can be due to the presence of macrophages and an inflammatory reaction in internal ostium.</p><p>The best results obtained with glaucoma drainage device<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> corroborate this hypothesis.</p><p>In our study, we recorded a statistically significant difference in success rate (37%) between Ex-PRESS device and trabeculectomy at 2 years follow-up (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03). This outcome could be because the Ex-PRESS device eliminates deposition of macrophages and subsequent inflammatory reaction to internal ostium of the trabeculectomy.</p><p>Glaucoma drainage implants are an alternative surgical option, but oil migration can occur through the tube into the subconjunctival space inciting an inflammatory reaction.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Souza <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> suggested that previous conjunctival surgery changed the conjunctival environment, and the subsequent surgical procedure can induce a proliferation of fibrous cells causing bleb encapsulation.</p><p>There are two hypotheses for the failure of surgery in silicomacrophagocytic open-angle glaucoma: The first is the scar reaction induced by the previous vitreoretinal surgery; the second is the inflammatory reaction induced by the presence of micro-droplets of SO in the subconjunctival space. The same assumptions are valid both for glaucoma drainage device and for Ex-PRESS. The outcomes of this study with Ex-PRESS are inferior to previous studies with glaucoma drainage device where the success rate ranged between 78%<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and 100%<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> at 2 years follow-up.</p><p>In this study, we used low doses of mitomycin C (0.1 mg/mL) for 5 min, which has been reported as the effective dose in primary open-angle glaucoma.<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Low doses of mitomycin C may be unable to control the development of a severe reaction scar, and the use of higher doses may improve long-term results of trabeculectomy with Ex-PRESS. One drawback of our work was the small sample sizes for both groups. However, this is a relatively rare type of secondary glaucoma and enrolling a large number of patients would have taken inordinately long.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This technique could be a less-invasive surgical alternative to the drainage valves, but further follow-up studies may help establish a more effective therapeutic and surgical strategy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Financial support and sponsorship</bold> Nil.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflicts of interest</bold> There are no conflicts of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Engelmann</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Becker</surname><given-names>KA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Heavy silicone oil endotamponade - A useful alternative to conventional endotamponade</article-title><source>Klin Monbl Augenheilkd</source><year>2009</year><volume>226</volume><fpage>699</fpage><lpage>704</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19750418</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Romano</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name><name><surname>Angi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Romano</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Parmeggiani</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Campa</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Valldeperas</surname><given-names>X</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Intraocular pressure changes following the use of silicone oil or densiron 68 as endotamponade in pars plana vitrectomy</article-title><source>Clin Ophthalmol</source><year>2010</year><volume>4</volume><fpage>1391</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21179224</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lucke</surname><given-names>KH</given-names></name><name><surname>Foerster</surname><given-names>MH</given-names></name><name><surname>Laqua</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Long-term results of vitrectomy and silicone oil in 500 cases of complicated retinal detachments</article-title><source>Am J Ophthalmol</source><year>1987</year><volume>104</volume><fpage>624</fpage><lpage>33</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3688104</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Burk</surname><given-names>LL</given-names></name><name><surname>Shields</surname><given-names>MB</given-names></name><name><surname>Proia</surname><given-names>AD</given-names></name><name><surname>McCuen</surname><given-names>BW</given-names><suffix>2nd</suffix></name></person-group><article-title>Intraocular pressure following intravitreal silicone oil injection</article-title><source>Ophthalmic Surg</source><year>1988</year><volume>19</volume><fpage>565</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3173977</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nguyen</surname><given-names>QH</given-names></name><name><surname>Lloyd</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Heuer</surname><given-names>DK</given-names></name><name><surname>Baerveldt</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Minckler</surname><given-names>DS</given-names></name><name><surname>Lean</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Incidence and management of glaucoma after intravitreal silicone oil injection for complicated retinal detachments</article-title><source>Ophthalmology</source><year>1992</year><volume>99</volume><fpage>1520</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1454317</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Leaver</surname><given-names>PK</given-names></name><name><surname>Grey</surname><given-names>RH</given-names></name><name><surname>Garner</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Silicone oil injection in the treatment of massive preretinal retraction.
