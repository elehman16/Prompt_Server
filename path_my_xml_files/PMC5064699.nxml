Children with a history of psychiatric disorders, on anti-psychotic drugs, language or communication difficulties, sleep disorders, renal or hepatic derangement, low intelligence quotient, colour blindness, abnormalities of the right and left hands which precluded them from performing the finger tapping test (FTT) were excluded from the study. Patients were randomly assigned to four Groups A, B, C and D (<italic>n</italic> = 25 patients/group) according to a computer-generated list. The pharmacist posted in our department did the randomisation and decided the group the patient belonged to. He informed the group to the pre-induction room anaesthesiologist, who administered the drug orally, that is, either 0.5 mg/kg midazolam (Group A) or 0.5 mg/kg MT (Group B) or 0.75 mg/kg MT (Group C) or placebo (Group D) via similar looking measuring cups to the child. We used aqueous preparation of midazolam (preservative free) 1 ml of which was equivalent to 5 mg midazolam (&#x02018;Mezolam<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>&#x02019; from Neon Labs, Mumbai). It was mixed with freshly drawn raw liquid honey. Commercially available MT syrup (&#x02018;Fast acting liquid MT&#x02019; from Life extension pharmaceuticals, Lauderdale, obtained online) was used for the study. Each 1 ml had MT equivalent of 3 mg. A volume of 5 ml of multivitamin syrup (&#x02018;Kidicare<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>&#x02019; from Meyer Vitabiotics, Mumbai) was used as the placebo. Both the patient and the investigator were unaware of the identity of the administered drug. We ensured parental (preferably maternal) presence, a good social conversation, and reassurance with the children in all the groups in the pre-operative period.</p><p>The modified Yale Pre-operative Anxiety Scale (mYPAS), and objective tests for cognition like colour cancellation test (CCT), psychomotor performance tests such as FTT were explained to the patients on the pre-operative day during pre-anaesthesia assessment and they were asked to do it in a sample test.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>The mYPAS is an observational state anxiety measure for children comprising 27 items in 5 domains that contemplate the child's relationship with its environment, namely, activity, state of arousal, vocalisation, expression of emotions and interaction with family members. It has demonstrated high reliability and validity for measuring children's anxiety pre-operatively.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>The YPAS-m total score was calculated. Each domain received a partial score based on the punctuation observed divided by the number of categories of that domain. The score of each domain was added to the others and multiplied by 20. Higher scores indicated more anxiety.</p><p>Observer's sedation score[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] was used to assess sedation. It is rated from 5 to 1 where 5 = ready responsiveness to name, 4 = lethargic response, 3 = response when name is called out loudly, 2 = response only with mild prodding, 1 = no response to prodding and 0 = no response to noxious stimuli indicating deep sedation.</p><p>Cognition was assessed by the CCT which consists of 150 circles in red, blue, yellow, black and grey. The participants were required to cancel only the red circles as fast as they could. Time taken in seconds to complete the test comprised the score.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] CCT results are reported as the number of seconds required to complete the task; therefore, higher scores reveal greater impairment.</p><p>Psychomotor function was assessed using the FTT. Subjects were asked to tap the mounting key on a finger-tapping instrument as rapidly as possible using the index finger of the preferred hand. A comparable set of measurements was then obtained with the non-preferred hand, each trial lasting for 10 s.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The average number of taps counted manually for each hand comprised the score due to the non-availability of finger tapping boards.</p><p>The heart rate and oxygen saturation were recorded by attaching conventional monitors.</p><p>The patient was shifted to a quiet room near the operation theatre 2 h pre-operatively. The drug was given to the patient by the pre-induction room doctor, 60 min before induction time in similar looking measuring cups. No other pre-medication was given.</p><p>Before giving the drug, the patient's anxiety, sedation, cognition and psychomotor levels were assessed using mYPAS, OSS, CCT and FTT scores, respectively, by the investigator. The child was asked to relax and sleep following the intake of syrup. After 30 and 60 min, the patient was assessed with the same parameters and the tests were repeated again. At the end of 60 min the behaviour of the child during separation from parents and during venepuncture was recorded. Occurrence of side-effects of MT such as headache, dizziness, nausea and drowsiness and side-effects of midazolam such as dizziness, vertigo, ataxia, disorientation, amnesia and prolongation of reaction time-impairment of psychomotor skills were also noted.</p><p>The sample size was determined based on previous studies.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] A sample of 25 was taken to provide a power of 90% with a confidence interval of 99% with respect to mYPAS based on the assumption that placebo could have an effect in producing anxiolysis in 20% of patients, whereas MT and midazolam in at least 50% of patients. The data were analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20.0 software (SPSS Inc., 233 South Wacker Drive, 11<sup>th</sup> Floor Chicago, IL, USA). Chi-square test was used for analysing categorical data such as age, gender and ASA grade.

One of these[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] has shown oral MT (0.5 mg/kg) to be ineffective as a pre-medicant in children. The others have observed positive results with oral MT (0.25 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg).[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>We chose children from 5 to 15 years age group so that they were able to comprehend and perform the tests required for the study. In a related study, the researchers used oral MT in the dose range of 0.1, 0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In another study, 20 mg of oral MT was used in children undergoing brainstem audiometry and was found to be safe;[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] even higher doses of MT (up to 80 mg) were found to be safe in children.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Hence, we chose MT in doses of 0.5 mg/kg and 0.75 mg/kg.</p><p>The peak effect of exogenous MT ranges from 60 to 150 min. The peak action of oral midazolam ranges between 30 and 90 min.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Hence, we gave both the drugs 60 min before induction. We did not include a rescue anxiolytic in our study since most related researchers[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] have not done so.</p><p>The primary outcome measures in our study were the effects of oral MT in two doses (0.5 and 0.75 mg/kg), midazolam 0.5 mg/kg and placebo on pre-operative anxiety, sedation, cognitive and psychomotor function. Our results showed that oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg and MT 0.5 mg/kg produced effective anxiolysis. This was comparable to the results of some previous researchers.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] However, this was in contrast to some studies[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] wherein the researchers used oral MT (3 mg, 6 mg) and another study[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] where a maximum oral MT dose of 0.4 mg/kg was used and no significant anxiolytic effect of oral MT was found when compared to either midazolam or placebo. This was probably because the dose of MT which they used was lesser compared to ours. In our study, midazolam produced the highest degree of sedation when compared to MT and placebo. MT, like placebo, did not produce any sedation in our study. This outcome was comparable to the results of studies by other researchers.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Our study showed that MT in doses 0.5 and 0.75 mg/kg did not produce sedation compared to the midazolam group. Hence, we can say that patients pre-medicated with MT would require less pre-operative monitoring (no sedation) than patients pre-medicated with midazolam (moderate to deep sedation). Our study results showed a significant increase in the time in seconds taken for CCT after pre-medication in midazolam group compared to MT and placebo. These were in agreement with the results of a similar study done in children[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and a study done in adults using the Trieger dot test.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Our secondary outcome measures were the behaviour of the child during separation from parents, the child's compliance during venepuncture and the occurrence of side effects of MT and midazolam. The parental separation score[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] used in our study was different from the scores used in other studies[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] where the mYPAS was used for evaluation of parental separation. In one of these studies,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] it was observed that children in the MT 0.25 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg or midazolam 0.25 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg groups exhibited less anxiety compared to placebo and this was similar to our results. However in the other study,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] wherein oral MT was compared in doses of 0.05 mg/kg, 0.2 mg/kg and 0.4 mg/kg with oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg, it was reported that the groups did not differ significantly in their separation anxiety and this was similar to our study results; nevertheless the mean age of the children in these studies[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] was 3.5 &#x000b1; 0.6 and 5.1 &#x000b1; 2.35 years, respectively, whereas it was 10.49 &#x000b1; 2.66 years in our study. No research has yet been carried out on the effect of age and emotionality on the effectiveness of MT administered, although the effects of midazolam have been shown to vary with the age and temperament of the child;[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] nevertheless, we suggest research on this topic.</p><p>Our study had several unique features. To date, ours is the only study among published literature, wherein MT has been used in a dose of 0.75 mg/kg in children for pre-medication. Most researchers on MT have not assessed cognition and psychomotor function using tests specific for them. The effects on these functions were simply noted down as observations in a few studies.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] However, we used the CCT to assess the cognition of children. This test has been used in many psychiatric studies not related to MT.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Thus, since it was not possible to compare our study results regarding this aspect with other studies, we have compared our study results with those of studies done in adults.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Studies have shown that the heart rate decreases when the patient is calm or less anxious.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] We monitored the heart rate and found that midazolam produced a maximum decrease in mean heart rate compared to the other groups; we also studied compliance to venepuncture after receiving oral MT. Our study findings support the use of MT in a dose of 0.75 mg/kg for effective pre-operative anxiolysis without sedation or cognitive and psychomotor dysfunction in children.</p><p>Most studies on pre-medication in children include assessment of parameters such as acceptance of face mask, post-operative analgesia, nausea, vomiting and agitation in addition to response to intravenous cannulation; our study ended at intravenous cannulation. Other parameters could not be assessed because variable anaesthetic techniques were used in our patients with intravenous cannulation as a common step to all.</p><p>Our study has some limitations. As the drugs were available in the syrup form, we experienced a difficulty in accurately measuring and administering the drug according to body weight. We used placebo as a pre-medication in one group. It may appear that there was a total lack of anxiolysis in children belonging to this group; however, children older than 4&#x02013;6 years are easy to communicate with.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Research has shown that a lower level of parental anxiety and maternal presence helps in overcoming anxiety in a child.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] We ensured parental (preferably maternal) presence but it was not possible for us to maintain uniformity in the level of parental anxiety. Furthermore, we manually counted the number of finger tappings as we did not have the finger tapping boards which are ideally used for automatically counting the number of finger taps.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Oral MT at 0.75 mg/kg appears to be the most effective drug for allaying pre-operative anxiety in children followed by MT 0.5 mg/kg and oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg, in that order. Oral MT in the doses of 0.5 mg/kg and 0.75 mg/kg does not cause sedation or cognition and psychomotor dysfunction unlike oral midazolam at 0.5 mg/kg.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Perry</surname><given-names>JN</given-names></name><name><surname>Hooper</surname><given-names>VD</given-names></name><name><surname>Masiongale</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Reduction of preoperative anxiety in pediatric surgery patients using age-appropriate teaching interventions</article-title><source>J Perianesth Nurs</source><year>2012</year><volume>27</volume><fpage>69</fpage><lpage>81</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22443919</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kain</surname><given-names>ZN</given-names></name><name><surname>Caldwell-Andrews</surname><given-names>AA</given-names></name><name><surname>Mayes</surname><given-names>LC</given-names></name><name><surname>Weinberg</surname><given-names>ME</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>MacLaren</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Family-centered preparation for surgery improves perioperative outcomes in children: A randomized controlled trial</article-title><source>Anesthesiology</source><year>2007</year><volume>106</volume><fpage>65</fpage><lpage>74</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17197846</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Patel</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Kurdi</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A comparative study between oral melatonin and oral midazolam on preoperative anxiety, cognitive, and psychomotor functions</article-title><source>J Anaesthesiol Clin Pharmacol</source><year>2015</year><volume>31</volume><fpage>37</fpage><lpage>43</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25788771</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>DP</given-names></name><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>WI</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Practical oral sedation in dentistry.
