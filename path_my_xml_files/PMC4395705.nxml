back pain by using a therapeutic climbing program on lumbar muscle activity and function.
[Subjects and Methods] Thirty adult subjects with chronic back pain participated. The
subjects were assigned to 2 exercise groups, namely the lumbar stabilization (Mat Ex) and
therapeutic climbing exercise groups (TC Ex). Each group trained for 30 minutes, 3 times a
week for 4 weeks. The Short-form 36-item Questionnaire (SF-36) was administered and the
surface electromyographic (sEMG) activities of the lumbar muscles were measured. [Results]
Both therapy groups showed significant increases in the SF-36 score, and the increase was
greater in the TC Ex group. Significant increases in the sEMG activities of the lumbar
muscles were found in both groups. The increases in the sEMG activities of the rectus
abdominis and internal and external oblique muscles of the abdomen were greater in the TC
Ex group than in the Mat Ex group. [Conclusion] These findings demonstrate that TC Ex,
which is similar to normal lumbar stabilization exercise, is effective at activating and
improving the function of the lumbar muscles. These results suggest that TC Ex has a
positive impact on the stabilization of the lumbar region.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Chronic lower back pain</kwd><kwd>Therapeutic climbing</kwd><kwd>Stabilization exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Lower back pain causes improper posture and movement in an effort to avoid pain, resulting
in abnormal muscle and ligament function that can limit the active range of motion<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients with lower back pain have been
observed on electromyograms, to display delayed muscle reactions, which would adversely
affect trunk stability and increase the potential for lower back pain. In addition, the deep
lumbar muscles of patients with lower back pain show greater muscle imbalance than subjects
without lower back pain. This imbalance can cause destabilization of the spine due to
decreased position sense arising from reduced proprioception, which can result in recurrence
of lower back pain as well as muscle reduction and atrophy near the spine<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
O&#x02019;Sullivan found that the deep muscles in patients with lower back pain were weak compared
to patients without lower back pain. They also found that patients with low back pain lacked
position sense due to reduced proprioception function. Thus, spinal stability problems may
lead to recurrence of lower back pain<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The muscles associated with lumbar stability are attached to the spine. These muscles
include the multifidus, transverse abdominis, and internal oblique muscles, that provide
stability between the segments, and the major paraspinal and rectus abdominis muscles that
aid general movement. For normal upright positioning, the muscles associated with trunk and
pelvic stability must function normally<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>When a heavy or dynamic load is exerted in a standing position, the erector spinae, lumbar
multifidus, and internal and external oblique muscles must be activated to stabilize the
sacroiliac joint. Because most patients with lower back pain maintain the center of force at
the rear of their base of support, the trunk muscles become relaxed and lumbar lordosis is
increased compared to people without lower back pain. Poor standing posture influences
static and dynamic motions that affect the entire body, and lead to musculoskeletal
diseases<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Co-contraction of the deep stabilizer and superficial stabilizer muscles as well as
strengthening of the deep stabilizer muscles in the lumbar region are necessary.
Co-contraction of the trunk muscles increases trunk rigidity (defined as the hardness of an
elastic object), and as rigidity increases, stability also increases. Thus, joint stability
increases with increased muscle tone, resulting from increased muscle activity<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recently, lumbar stabilization exercises that improve lumbar spine stability and prevent
lower back pain have been developed. These exercises strengthen the deep muscles of the
spine by strengthening and enhancing intra-abdominal pressure through the development and
control of the rectus abdominis and internal and external oblique muscles, leading to
increased spinal stability<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Exercises
that increase spinal stability can prevent micro-damage to discs, facet joints, and
peripheral tissues by increasing the spine&#x02019;s ability to maintain a neutral posture<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lower back pain patients who preform
therapeutic exercises to improve lumbar stabilization report decreases in pain and increases
in QOL<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, and many studies have
demostrated the effectiveness of lumbar stabilization exercises<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therapeutic climbing is a new approach which has been adapted from artificial rock climbing
motions. It is currently used as physical therapy for orthopedic, neurological, and
psychological diseases as well as trauma<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therapeutic climbing offers anaerobic exercise through movements
of the upper and lower body against gravity as well as aerobic exercise through muscle and
cardiovascular endurance incontinuous movements on a climbing wall. Isometric exercise at a
climbing wall utilizes changing bases of support and effectiely generate of gravity to
create static and dynamic movements. Stabilization exercises subject&#x02019;s like therapeutic
climbing, can properly elicit muscle use through resistance to gravity, depending on the
position<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Most studies to date have examined the effects of therapeutic climbing on physical and
functional skills as well as its psychological impact; however, studies are lacking on its
benefits for patients with chronic lower back pain, especiallyts effects on activity levels
and patterns of change in the deep trunk muscles. Therefore, this study performed a
comparative analysis of therapeutic climbing and lumbar stabilization exercises performed on
mats to determine the effect of therapeutic climbing on deep trunk muscles and their
functional recovery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty patients with &#x02265;3 months&#x02019; history of lower back pain agreed to participate in this

activities of the lumbar muscles were measured before and after 4 weeks of therapy.</p><p>In the lumbar-stability mat exercises, the first movement was the supine bridging exercise,
followed a the bridging exercise, which consisted of an upper or lower limb lift, and then
the side bridging exercise, which consisted of the lower limb upward lift.</p><p>The therapeutic climbing exercise was performed on a 4 &#x000d7; 3 m, 90-degree-inclined
therapeutic climbing wall. The therapeutic climbing exercise movements which change the base
of support and center of gravity were selected to effectively generate static and dynamic
movements. The first movement was the shoulder stability exercise, in which mimic the arms
and legs are positioned further apart than shoulder width in the start position, and is
followed by elbow flexion and extension to the push-up movement. Then, the subjects were
instructed to perform one quasi-static climbing exercise on the therapeutic climbing wall.
The initial position was indicated as both hands and feet on the wall, slightly wider than
shoulder width. After 3 seconds of static holding, the subjects had to let go and move the
left hand to laterally reach another climbing hold placed at the same height as the initial
hold, but approximately 50&#x02005;cm farther away. The subjects were advised to move their hand as
slowly as possible, to take about 3 seconds to cover the distance between the holds<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Finally, for the upper and lower limb
co-contraction movement, the subjects performed a squat movement on the therapeutic climbing
wall. However, the holding hand was changed when alternating between sitting and standing

back pain, which can spontaneously subside in 4&#x02013;8 weeks. However, about 85% of patients
experience relapse within 1&#x02005;year and eventually develop chronic lower back pain, especially
those with trunk instability due to spinal muscular atrophy<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The goal of lumbar
stabilization exercise is to restore the function of the abdominal trunk muscles and spinal
posture to facilitate the reduction of the pain intensity in the ligaments and joint capsule
of sensitive organs and to reduce the retricition of the joint range of motion<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The effectiveness of therapeutic climbing as a complement to conventional physiotherapy has
been proven in different &#x0fb01;elds of rehabilitation<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Climbing appears to be well suited to the promotion of core
strength and trunk mobility. In fact, climbing is characterized by continuous changes in
dynamic and isometric contractions<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, we investigated whether therapeutic climbing exercise, which focuses on the
movement of the shoulder joint stabilizer muscles, could minimize the load on the spine and
thereby enhance the superficial muscle and stabilize the trunk.</p><p>The SF-36 results showed significant increases in scores in both exercise groups after the
4 weeks of therapy. However, the increases in SF-36 scores were greater in the TC Ex group
than in the Mat Ex group. These findings are important given that a previous study
demonstrated that patients with a lower SF-36 score are more likely to respond favorably to
stabilization exercise<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To evaluate the stabilization of the spine, we examined the sEMG activities of the rectus
abdominis, erector spinae, and internal and external oblique muscles of the abdomen. The
increase in erector spinae sEMG activity was greater in the Mat Ex group than in the TC Ex
group. In contrast, the TC Ex group demonstrated greater increases in the sEMG activities of
the rectus abdominis, and internal and external oblique muscles of the abdomen. In line with
these findings, a previous study that examined the muscle activities of the rectus
abdominis, and internal and external oblique muscles of the abdomen during movement of the
arms and legs, demonstrated that these muscles provide stability to the pelvis and trunk,
and maintain the stability of the spine<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. The similarities of therapeutic climbing with common sports have a
motivational effect on patients, which makes it more attractive than other rehabilitation
exercises. Highly controllable movements adapted from sports climbing are characteristic of
therapeutic climbing. It has been reported to help patients overcome fears and to increase
their self-discipline. Especially in back pain therapy, there is a high potential for the
use of therapeutic climbing<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study had some limitations. Because the study period was short, the results cannot be
generalized across different populations. However a therapeutic climbing program based on
the the stabilizer muscles of the rectus abdominis muscle during rehabilitation can activate
the features of oblique movements and thus improve and stabilize the lumbar trunk muscles
during exercise.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Magnusson</surname><given-names>ML</given-names></name><name><surname>Bishop</surname><given-names>JB</given-names></name><name><surname>Hasselquist</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Range of motion and motion patterns in patients with low
