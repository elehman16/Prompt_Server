Topical capsaicinoids have been used for decades to treat musculoskeletal pain.

Mean baseline PI was 6.8 on a 0&#x02013;10 point numerical rating scale. After 8 hours, pain was more reduced with the FDC than with placebo (adjusted means: 2.824 vs. 0.975 points; <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001). On the last treatment day, mean pain reduction by the FDC was stronger than with placebo (adjusted means: 5.132 vs. 2.174 points; <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001). Mobility on Day 1 was in favor of the FDC when compared to placebo (odds ratio [95% confidence interval {CI}]: 7.200 [3.609, 14.363], <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001).

The trial was conducted in 6 investigational sites (5 of them recruiting) located in the Russian Federation and 3 investigational sites located in Ukraine.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Prior to the start of the study, the clinical trial protocol, the patient information, the informed consent form, and other locally required documents were reviewed and approved by the respective ethics committees (EC) and regulatory bodies of the respective countries. The study was designed as a phase III trial and approved as such by The Ethic Council of the Ministry of Healthcare of the Russian Federation.</p><p>The constitution of each of the EC met the requirements and definitions of International Conference on Harmonization of Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) and of the respective country. The study was carried out in compliance with the Clinical Trial Protocol, the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the ICH-GCP, with applicable regulatory requirements, and Boehringer Ingelheim standard operating procedures. Prior to the enrolment, patients gave their written informed consent according to the local regulatory and legal requirements and the ICH-GCP.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient population</title><p>After providing informed consent, a total of 138 adult patients of either gender, aged 21&#x02013;65 years with diagnosis of acute low back pain (ICD-10 code: M54.5) for &#x0003e;2 days and &#x0003c;21 days, with reported low back pain &#x02265;5 on an 11-point (0&#x02013;10) numerical rating scale (NRS) were screened by the investigators. All the enrolled patients were randomized and treated. Women of childbearing potential had to have a negative urine pregnancy test and had to be using a highly effective method of birth control.</p><p>The following exclusion criteria were defined: multilocular pain or panalgesia; history of more than 3 low back pain episodes in the previous 6 months; patients with low back pain due to neurological causes; neurogenic bladder and/or rectum dysfunction; acute low back pain due to vertebral collapse or neoplastic, inflammatory (ankylosing spondylitis), traumatic, or infective origins; any condition, disease, or concomitant treatment that in the judgment of the investigator affected the patient&#x02019;s ability to participate in the clinical trial or that influenced the test methodology used; negative experience in the past with heat treatment for muscle complaints; history of treatment of back pain with centrally acting analgesics (eg, opioids) and muscle relaxants; surgery due to back pain or rehabilitation due to back pain in the previous 12 months; spinal injection back pain treatment within 6 months prior to enrolment; intake of antidepressant/antipsychotic medication within 4 weeks prior to enrolment; treatment of the recent low back pain period with oral analgesics for more than 4 consecutive days; locally applied medication to the back within 48 hours prior to enrolment; administration of other analgesics within 24 hours prior to enrolment (exception: acetylsalicylic acid up to 100 mg/daily for anti-platelet aggregation therapy); non-pharmacological low back pain treatment (physiotherapy, heat treatment [eg, hot water bottle, and heat patch], or massages) within 12 hours prior to enrolment ; participation in an investigational drug or device trial within 4 weeks prior to enrolment; hypersensitivity to nicoboxil, nonivamide, or paracetamol; known hypersensitivity to any other ingredient; skin lesions (eg, rash, dermatitis, bruising, and laceration) in the back region; drug dependence and/or alcohol abuse; severe hepatocellular insufficiency; patients who were pregnant or breast-feeding.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatments</title><p>A total of 138 patients were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with nicoboxil/nonivamide cream (69 patients) or matching placebo cream (69 patients). A validated system using a pseudorandom generator was used to generate the randomization list, so that the resulting treatment was both reproducible and non-predictable. The patients were randomized in blocks to double-blind treatment to ensure that equal numbers of patients were allocated to each treatment group. A random block size of 4 was used. Access to the treatment codes was controlled and documented. Each patient received blinded treatment for the overall treatment period lasting up to 4 days. Each medication kit consisted of 2 tubes, each containing either nicoboxil/nonivamide cream or matching placebo cream. To guarantee the double-blind design of the study, all treatments were indistinguishable for the patient as well as for the investigator.</p><p>Except the absence of active ingredients, the placebo cream had the same composition as the nicoboxil/nonivamide cream, including the same amount of fragrance mixture. Thus, both creams were identical concerning look, feel, and smell.</p><p>The patients had to administer the cream up to 3 times a day for a maximum of 4 days. The first 2 doses were to be applied at baseline (time point 0 on Day 1) and after 4 hours on Day 1. After the second application on Day 1, the patients could administer study medication as needed but not earlier than 8 hours after the first application for up to a total of 4 days. The intervals between each application of study medication had to be at least 4 hours; a maximum of three applications in a 24-hour period was allowed. A 2-cm long cream line was applied to an area of ~20 cm&#x000d7;20 cm on the patient&#x02019;s low back where he/she felt the pain to be most pronounced.</p><p>With regard to the &#x0201c;warming effect&#x0201d; of the nicoboxil/nonivamide, it was considered that the blindness will be hold in an acceptable way because the individual sensitivity to cutaneous application of capsaicinoids varies considerably from person to person, and that the lower back is generally less sensitive to thermal stimulus. This assumption was confirmed by the heat perception assessments at times relevant for the primary endpoint (0&#x02013;8 hours), with 4%&#x02013;48% of the FDC patients perceiving no heat at all, whereas 10%&#x02013;45% of the patients in the placebo group perceiving at least mild heat.</p><p>Paracetamol tablets were allowed as rescue medication (1 to 2 tablets of 500 mg, up to a maximum of four times per day). The first dose of rescue medication was allowed after 8 hours following the first dose of study medication and after having the patient completed the pain intensity (PI) and heat score assessments at the 8-hour time point. The patients were instructed to record the dose, time, and reason of paracetamol intake in the patient diary as often as deemed convenient but at minimum at the end of each treatment day.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy endpoints</title><p>The patients were asked to rate the degree of their PI on an 11-point NRS ranging from 0 = &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; to 10 = &#x0201c;worst pain possible&#x0201d; in a diary.<xref rid="b15-jpr-9-1221" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Time points of assessment were pre-dose (i.e., directly before the first application of study drug on Day 1) and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours after the first cream application on Day 1. The pre-dose PI score was used as baseline PI. Moreover, the patients assessed the average pain intensity (API) of their low back pain on the same rating scale in the diary at the end of each treatment day.

The &#x0201c;per-protocol set&#x0201d; (PPS) was composed of all patients who were part of the FAS and complied with the protocol without any important protocol violations (IPVs). Efficacy endpoints were to be analyzed primarily with the FAS and safety endpoints with the TS.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary endpoint</title><p>The analysis for the primary endpoint PID<sub>8h</sub> used a restricted maximum likelihood-based repeated measures approach and included all available longitudinal PI observations at each post-baseline time point up to 8 hours. The statistical model was applied to the analysis of change from baseline in PI at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 hours and included the fixed, categorical effects of country, treatment, time, and treatment-by-time interaction, the continuous covariate of baseline PI, and the residual error term. Within-patient errors were modeled by unstructured covariance. The Kenward&#x02013;Roger approximation was used to estimate the denominator degrees of freedom. Differences between the treatment group effects with regard to the primary endpoint of PID<sub>8h</sub> were estimated by reference to the adjusted least square means and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Patient assessment of efficacy on the last individual treatment day was analyzed by a cumulative logit model fit to the underlying ordinal data with treatment and country as fixed effects and baseline PI as a continuous covariate. Odds ratios together with 95% CIs were used to quantify the effect of treatment and to compare the treatment groups. For the endpoint &#x0201c;time to onset of pain relief,&#x0201d; a Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis was performed, and the log-rank test was used to determine the differences between the treatment groups. The time was censored at 9 hours post-dose and displayed as &#x0003e;8 hours. The mobility score on each treatment day was analyzed correspondingly to the assessment of efficacy on the last individual treatment day (LID), but adding the fixed factors day and treatment-by-day interaction.

The &#x0201c;Global Burden of Disease Study 2013&#x0201d; ranked low back pain to be the top cause of years lived with disability worldwide.<xref rid="b1-jpr-9-1221" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-jpr-9-1221" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Patients suffering from acute pain expect fast onset of action and pronounced reduction of PI from analgesic treatment.<xref rid="b16-jpr-9-1221" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-jpr-9-1221" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>The results of a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial investigating the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of a topical FDC consisting of nicoboxil 1.08% and nonivamide 0.17% cream in the treatment of acute nonspecific low back pain are presented in this paper. A pronounced reduction of PI was achieved in this trial in the active treatment arm: PI compared to baseline was reduced fast by the nicoboxil/nonivamide cream combination, and increased further over the entire treatment period of up to 4 days. Comparison of the pain-related endpoints with the parameters defined by Moore et al<xref rid="b18-jpr-9-1221" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> showed that the FDC provided &#x0201c;moderate clinical benefit&#x0201d; (&#x02265;30% PI reduction) already at 4 hours and 8 hours post-treatment, and &#x0201c;significant clinical benefit&#x0201d; (&#x02265;50% PI reduction) at the last individual day, as well as after 4 days of treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-jpr-9-1221">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>According to the treatment guidelines for nonspecific low back pain, it is desirable to get patients back to their normal life as soon as possible; this includes work and everyday physical activity.<xref rid="b8-jpr-9-1221" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Patients in this trial rated their improvement of low back pain mobility on each treatment day higher for the FDC, compared to placebo. Thus, it can be suggested that analgesic efficacy and improvement of low back mobility jointly contribute to well-being and functional recovery of the patients. This could explain the high percentage of patients assessing the efficacy of the combination as &#x0201c;very good&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;good.&#x0201d; Similar effects were observed in a randomized, placebo-, and active-controlled clinical trial investigating another topical FDC (2.5% nicoboxil/0.4% nonivamide ointment formulation) in the treatment of acute low back pain.<xref rid="b13-jpr-9-1221" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Both nicoboxil/nonivamide ointment and cream combinations have been in clinical use for decades and their efficacy in the indication of acute nonspecific low back pain has now been confirmed in two state-of-art clinical trials.</p><p>Limitations of the presented study include no evaluation of durability of endpoints beyond several days for a more prolonged use of the nicoboxil/nonivamide cream.</p><p>What other treatment options for acute low back pain exist? In a review of national and international clinical low back pain guidelines, one of the common recommendations is that patients should stay as active as possible and gradually increase their activity levels (including returning to work even in the presence of back pain).<xref rid="b8-jpr-9-1221" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Regarding pharmacological treatment options, the guidelines recommend paracetamol as first choice analgesic and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in case paracetamol would not work. All of these drugs require systemic application.</p><p>In the meantime, some interesting relevant new studies and reviews have been published. Remarkably, a large clinical study on acute low back pain run in Australia did report no treatment effect for paracetamol in comparison to placebo.<xref rid="b9-jpr-9-1221" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> A meta-analysis of treatments for nonspecific low back pain found only small effects of NSAIDs (using their categories, nicoboxil/nonivamide would have been rated having &#x0201c;large treatment effects&#x0201d;).<xref rid="b19-jpr-9-1221" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This was confirmed by another meta-analysis investigating the effects of over-the-counter medications for acute low back pain.<xref rid="b20-jpr-9-1221" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The centrally acting muscle-relaxant cyclobenzaprine has been shown to be effective; however, up to 68% of the patients reported drowsiness as adverse event.<xref rid="b21-jpr-9-1221" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> NSAIDs (lornoxicam and diclofenac at prescription only doses) provided some acute low back pain relief.<xref rid="b22-jpr-9-1221" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Besides the fact that systemic treatments have not provided a pronounced pain relief, one should bear in mind that agents such as NSAIDs or centrally acting muscle analgesics are prone to cause systemic adverse effects, which might limit their use. Such adverse effects are less likely to occur with topical treatments like the one investigated in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, this study demonstrates that nicoboxil/nonivamide cream is an effective, tolerable, and safe treatment option for acute nonspecific low back pain. Literature comparison of the data in acute low back pain suggests that the clinical efficacy of this topical treatment could be comparable or superior with that of systemic over-the-counter or prescription analgesics and muscle relaxants; however, this has to be further investigated in well-designed, controlled, parallel-group studies.<xref rid="b18-jpr-9-1221" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19-jpr-9-1221" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Thus, the topical combination of nicoboxil/nonivamide adds a promising option for the treatment of acute nonspecific low back pain.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The skilled editorial assistance by Jessica Krysa is highly acknowledged.</p><p>This study was sponsored by Boehringer Ingelheim.</p><p>This research was presented as a poster at World Congress on Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases, Malaga, Spain, on April 14&#x02013;17, 2016, and the abstract has been published in World Congress on Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases (WCO-IOF-ESCEO 2016): Poster Abstracts, Osteoporosis International, April 2016, Volume 27, Supplement 1, pp. 79&#x02013;548.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>ZB, JCH, TW, ER, and MT are employees at Boehringer Ingelheim.
