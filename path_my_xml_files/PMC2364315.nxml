Twenty-six patients were randomly allocated to treatment with anastrozole 1&#x02009;mg (<italic>n</italic>&#x0003d;13) or 10&#x02009;mg (<italic>n</italic>&#x0003d;13), once daily. Before and after 12 weeks' treatment, patients were infused with <sup>3</sup>H-&#x00394;<sub>4</sub> androstenedione (20 MBq) and <sup>14</sup>C-oestrone (E<sub>1</sub>) (1 MBq) for 18&#x02009;h. Oestrogens were purified from excised tumours and plasma samples taken after each infusion. Peripheral and tumour aromatase activity and tumour E<sub>1</sub> uptake were calculated from levels of <sup>3</sup>H and<sup> 14</sup>C in purified E<sub>1</sub> fractions from tumour and plasma.

This effect is associated with both anti-oestrogens that block oestrogen receptors (e.g. tamoxifen) and inhibitors of oestrogen biosynthesis. The latter may be most specifically achieved by targeting the aromatase enzyme, which catalyses the final step in the oestrogen biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib17">Miller, 1996</xref>).</p><p>There are two major types of aromatase inhibitors (AIs): Type I inhibitors are androgens or androgen analogues that block the substrate binding site on the enzyme; Type II inhibitors are non-steroidal agents that interfere with the cytochrome P450 moiety in the aromatase molecule (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib17">Miller, 1996</xref>). Although the agents inhibit peripheral aromatase activity, the relationship between potency in lowering plasma oestrogen levels and clinical effectiveness in treating breast cancer is poorly defined and it has been suggested that effects on circulating oestrogens do not entirely account for anti-tumour influences (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib2">Bajetta <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). Levels of oestrogens in the breast tissue (including tumours) of postmenopausal women may be higher than those in the circulation, and this may result from both increased local synthesis and/or active uptake from the circulation (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib17">Miller, 1996</xref>). It is therefore of interest to investigate the effect that AIs have on aromatase activity and oestrogen levels in breast tissue.</p><p>Anastrozole is a potent, orally active, selective, non-steroidal AI that markedly reduces the levels of circulating oestrogens in postmenopausal women with breast cancer (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib21">Plourde <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib8">Geisler <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>). As a second-line agent for adjuvant therapy in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, anastrozole has been shown to offer significant clinical benefits when compared with the progestin, megestrol acetate (MA) (Buzdar <italic>et al</italic>, 1996, <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib5">1998</xref>). Anastrozole shows significant benefit over tamoxifen with respect to TTP (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib3">Bonneterre <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib4">Buzdar <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>) when given as first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced hormone-sensitive breast cancer. Finally, anastrozole is highly effective in reducing tumour volume in the neoadjuvant therapy of breast cancer in postmenopausal women (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib7">Dixon <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). Indeed, 16 out of 18 patients in this trial who were originally registered for a mastectomy at the trial onset, were suitable for breast conservation following anastrozole treatment. However, the effect of anastrozole on tumour aromatase has not been reported to date.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Patients and treatments</title><p>The eligibility criteria for patients participating in this study have been described previously (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib7">Dixon <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). In brief, subjects were postmenopausal women with oestrogen-receptor (ER)-rich breast tumours (&#x02a7e;20&#x02009;fmol&#x02009;mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> protein). All breast tumours were operable and either larger than 3&#x02009;cm (T<sub>2</sub> &#x0005b;&#x0003e;3&#x02009;cm&#x0005d;, T<sub>3</sub>, N<sub>0&#x02013;1</sub>, M<sub>0</sub>), or locally advanced (T<sub>4b</sub>, N<sub>0&#x02013;1</sub>, M<sub>0</sub>).</p><p>Twenty-six patients were recruited into a randomized, double-blind, single-centre study in which they received anastrozole either 1 or 10&#x02009;mg orally once daily for 12 weeks, to be followed by definitive surgery. The random scheme and associated sealed envelopes were produced by computer software that incorporates a standard procedure for generating random numbers.</p></sec><sec><title>Infusion of radiolabelled steroids</title><p>Before initiation of anastrozole, each patient was infused with 20&#x02009;MBq <sup>3</sup>H-&#x00394;<sub>4</sub> androstenedione and 1&#x02009;MBq <sup>14</sup>C-oestrone (E<sub>1</sub>) in 50&#x02009;ml of 95&#x00025; plasma protein solution and 5&#x00025; ethanol. The infusion was given as an initial 10&#x02009;ml bolus followed by an 18-h infusion at 2&#x02009;ml&#x02009;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Delivery was by a 50&#x02009;ml syringe attached to a Teflon-coated tubing and transmitted through a 21-gauge venflon into a peripheral vein. The infusion was immediately followed by an open wedge biopsy to sample the tumour. Peripheral blood (40&#x02009;ml) and residual infusion fluid were also taken for analysis.</p><p>The process was repeated after 12 weeks of anastrozole therapy, with breast tissue being removed during definitive surgery at this time.</p></sec><sec><title>Extraction and purification of radiolabelled steroids</title><p>The method used to extract and purify radiolabelled oestrogens from tissue samples was essentially that described by other workers (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib11">James <italic>et al</italic>, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib22">Reed <italic>et al</italic>, 1989</xref>). Tissue (0.4&#x02013;0.6&#x02009;g) was finely sliced and pulverised in liquid nitrogen using a microdismembrator (Braun). The resultant powder was vortexed with radioinert E<sub>1</sub> (500&#x02009;&#x003bc;g in alcohol) in distilled water and left at room temperature for 30&#x02009;min. The extract was then added to ethanol&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;acetone (1&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;1) and left at room temperature for 30&#x02009;min before centrifugation. The supernatant was decanted and the pellet resuspended in ethanol&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;acetone (1&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;1) and recentrifuged. The resultant supernatant was pooled with the first sample and evaporated down to the aqueous residue, to which methanol (70&#x00025; in water) was added and left overnight at &#x02013;20&#x000b0;C. The mixture was then centrifuged and the supernatant evaporated down to the aqueous residue, which was partitioned between acetate buffer (0.1&#x02009;<sc>M</sc>, pH&#x02009;4.5) and diethylether. Ether extracts were dried, reconstituted in hexane&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;chloroform (80&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;20) and resolved by chromatography on Lipidex using serial elution with hexane&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;chloroform (80&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;20, 50&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;50, 40&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;60). Fractions containing E<sub>1</sub> (hexane&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;chloroform &#x0005b;50&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;50&#x0005d;) were evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in ethanol for further purification using thin layer chromatography for 1&#x02009;h on silica gel plates using cyclohexane&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;ethyl acetate (55&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;45). The E<sub>1</sub> fraction was eluted and read at 280&#x02009;nm on a spectrophotometer to monitor recovery. The radioactivity in the fraction was then measured (in disintegrations per min, d.p.m.) using a scintillation counter. Plasma samples (10&#x02009;ml) were extracted with diethylether, reconstituted in 70&#x00025; methanol and further processed as above.</p><p>Each sample was counted for 5&#x000d7;50&#x02009;min, together with vials containing known levels of <sup>3</sup>H and <sup>14</sup>C alone and in combination and representing the range of absolute d.p.m. and ratio of isotopes encountered in the study. Control vials were also counted comprising &#x02018;blank&#x02019; areas from the plates and plasma/tumour extracts from patients not receiving radioisotopes. Additionally, random samples were cross-checked on a separate scintillation counter designed and set up for low counts as in <sup>14</sup>C dating. The cross-over of <sup>14</sup>C in the <sup>3</sup>H channel was &#x02212;0.4&#x00025; to 0.1&#x00025; and no <sup>3</sup>H was counted in the <sup>14</sup>C channel.</p><p>Random samples were also subject to chemical derivative formation and shown to have consistent specific radioactivity throughout the procedure, thus confirming purity of oestrone fractions (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib15">Miller and Forrest, 1976</xref>).</p><p>Tumour uptake of E<sub>1</sub> was calculated as the ratio of the level of <sup>14</sup>C-E<sub>1</sub> in the tumour to that in the plasma following its infusion. Aromatase activity was measured by the synthesis of <sup>3</sup>H-E<sub>1</sub> from the infused precursor <sup>3</sup>H-&#x00394;<sub>4</sub> androstenedione. Plasma <sup>3</sup>H-E<sub>1</sub> synthesis therefore represents peripheral aromatase activity. However, tumour aromatase activity cannot simply be taken as tumour <sup>3</sup>H-E<sub>1</sub> synthesis, since it is likely that some of the <sup>3</sup>H-E<sub>1</sub> found in the breast is formed peripherally, secreted into the circulation and then taken up by breast tissue. A correction factor is derived from the level of <sup>14</sup>C-E<sub>1</sub> taken up by the tumour, since any <sup>3</sup>H-E<sub>1</sub> present in the breast in excess of that expected from uptake represents tumour E<sub>1</sub> synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref><fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Tumour uptake and <italic>in situ</italic> synthesis of oestrogens as estimated by measurement of radioactivity.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" mime-subtype="gif" xlink:href="87-6600587f1"/></fig>).</p><p>Therefore:

One further patient (from the 10&#x02009;mg group) withdrew from the study because of adverse events (headaches, depression, and tiredness). Thus, the data from 23 patients were available for analysis.

Thus, to achieve optimal benefit in postmenopausal patients with breast cancer it may be necessary for an AI to block local aromatase activity within breast tumours as well as peripheral aromatase. Indeed, there is some evidence to suggest that tumours with aromatase activity are more likely to respond to inhibitors than those without detectable aromatase (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib16">Miller and O'Neill, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib19">Miller and Dixon, 2001</xref>).</p><p>The present study has demonstrated that 3 months of neoadjuvant anastrozole therapy in women with postmenopausal ER-rich breast cancer markedly suppressed peripheral aromatase activity in all patients. Similarly, treatment with anastrozole was associated with a clear decrease in activity in 16 of 19 tumours that demonstrated <italic>in situ</italic> aromatase activity pre-treatment. It is worth considering the reason for the inability to detect a clear reduction in activity in certain tumours. The fact that, in each of the patients, peripheral aromatase was profoundly influenced by treatment excludes the possibility that either the women were not compliant to taking the drug or that aromatase activity was in general resistant to anastrozole. The lack of effect would seem therefore either to be artefactual or specific to the local environment of the breast. In these respects, it is worthy of note that a decrease in activity was lacking in the paired non-malignant breast sample (from the single patient in whom material was available), whereas the expected inhibition was seen in all non-malignant samples from patients whose tumours were also affected (data not shown). This would seem to exclude the possibility that the tumours differentially possessed mutant aromatase which was resistant to the inhibitor (although such phenotypes have been constructed experimentally (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib12">Kadohama <italic>et al</italic>, 1992</xref>). The most likely explanation for the results is that, at the level of the breast insufficient drug accumulated to inhibit aromatase activity locally. Whilst this hypothesis is testable by measuring drug levels within the breast, these were not performed in the present study. Because aromatase activity is assessed by measuring <sup>3</sup>H oestrone within the tissues, it is possible that the assessments are compromised by the presence of <sup>3</sup>H oestrone remaining from the initial perfusion performed before administration of drug. Whilst this cannot be totally excluded (no tissue was collected immediately before the second perfusion) no radioactive oestrogen was detected in plasma taken either 14 days after the initial infusion or immediately before the second infusion; furthermore in a single patient from a separate study who declined a second perfusion, no radioactivity was detected in oestrogen fractions derived from breast tissue (data not shown).</p><p>Therapy was also associated with a marked reduction in tumour levels of endogenous oestrogens. Although the study was primarily set up to measure effects on <italic>in situ</italic> aromatase within the breast and not designed to determine quantitative changes in endogenous oestrogens (which would be complicated by the infusion of exogenous oestrogen), it was of interest to note that the median decrease in tumour E<sub>2</sub> was 67&#x00025; and in E<sub>1</sub> was 70&#x00025;. These figures are similar to those of another study involving postmenopausal patients (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib9">Geisler <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>) in which 12 weeks of neoadjuvant therapy with anastrozole 1&#x02009;mg daily, was associated with a geometric mean decrease in tumour levels E<sub>2</sub> of 89&#x00025; and E<sub>1</sub> of 73&#x00025;. These two studies demonstrate the potent inhibitory effect of anastrozole on tumour aromatase resulting in decreased <italic>in situ</italic> oestrogen synthesis.</p><p>Whilst consistent effects of anastrozole were noted in tumour aromatase activity and endogenous oestrogens, a more variable influence on tumour oestrogen uptake was apparent. Thus, whilst in general all tumours displayed the ability to concentrate oestrone from the circulation both before and during treatment, occasionally therapy was associated with marked changes. The possibility that these reflect methodological artefact cannot be completely excluded since replicate measurements were not possible on account of the limited size of the sample; however, replicate samples from other patients not on drug treatment never showed this degree of variation. It seems likely that the effects are a consequence of the changes in endogenous oestrogens following treatment with anastrozole and the different direction of effects reflect the differing mechanisms by which tumours may sequester oestrogen from the circulation.</p><p>The present study was also able to illustrate the clinical benefit of inhibiting aromatase activity as monitored by the marked reduction (&#x0003e;50&#x00025;) in tumour volume (assessed by ultrasound) in 18 of the 24 patients (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib7">Dixon <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). It should be noted that changes in tumour aromatase following treatment did not always correspond with clinical behaviour. Thus, two of the three tumours in which anastrozole did not markedly reduce <italic>in situ</italic> activity, nevertheless responded to the drug. Presumably, the marked inhibitory effects on peripheral aromatase were sufficient to reduce tumour oestrogens and cause tumour response. Similarly, responses in tumours without aromatase activity are probably a consequence of inhibitory effects in other peripheral tissues. It is also of importance that as a result of anastrozole treatment in this study, only two patients required a total mastectomy. The remaining 16 of the 18 patients who were originally registered for a mastectomy only required wide local excision of the tumour.</p><p>The endocrinological effects of neoadjuvant anastrozole in the present report are entirely consistent with its anti-oestrogenic and anti-proliferative effects on tumour pathology, which have been reported previously in this group of women (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib1">Anderson <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>), and are also consistent with the clinical efficacy of the compound in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib5">Buzdar <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib3">Bonneterre <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib20">Nabholtz <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). The results provided no evidence of any difference in the therapeutic effects of the two doses of anastrozole (1 and 10&#x02009;mg) indicating that the currently recommended clinical dose of 1&#x02009;mg daily is appropriate for obtaining adequate suppression of oestrogen levels within the breast.</p><p>It is of interest to compare the results of the present analysis with investigations into the effects of two other newer, potent, selective non-steroidal AIs (vorozole and letrozole) on breast tumour aromatase activity. In one study, eight previously untreated postmenopausal women awaiting mastectomy for breast cancer were treated with vorozole 2.5&#x02009;mg daily. After 7 days, median <italic>in vitro</italic> tumour aromatase activity was 89&#x00025; lower than in matched, control tumour specimens; similarly, median tumour levels of E<sub>1</sub> and E<sub>2</sub> in treated patients were 64 and 80&#x00025; lower than in controls, respectively (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib6">de Jong <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>). In another study that employed identical design and analytical methods to those reported here, similar levels of decreased tumour aromatase activity and tumour oestrogen concentrations were found following the use of neoadjuvant letrozole 2.5&#x02009;mg daily for 3 months (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib18">Miller <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). Therefore, anastrozole, vorozole, and letrozole appear to have similar effects on tumour aromatase activity and tumour oestrogen levels in women with postmenopausal breast cancer.</p><p>In conclusion, anastrozole (1 or 10&#x02009;mg daily) effectively suppresses aromatase activity, and thereby oestrogen levels, within the breast of postmenopausal women with large or locally advanced, operable, ER-rich breast cancers.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="bib1"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>TJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Dixon</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Stuart</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Sahmoud</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>WR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of neoadjuvant treatment with anastrozole (&#x02018;Arimidex&#x02019;) on pathological markers of tumors in post-menopausal women with large operable breast cancer</article-title><source>Am Assoc Cancer Res</source><year>2000</year><volume>41</volume><fpage>741</fpage><!--PubMed citation query: 'Am Assoc Cancer Res||41|741||bib1|'--></citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bajetta</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Zilembo</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Bichisao</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Aromatase inhibitors in the treatment of postmenopausal breast cancer</article-title><source>Drugs Aging</source><year>1999</year><volume>15</volume><fpage>271</fpage><lpage>283</lpage><!--PubMed citation query: 'Drugs Aging||15|271||bib2|'--><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10582774</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bonneterre</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Thurlimann</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Robertson</surname><given-names>JF</given-names></name><name><surname>Krzakowski</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Mauriac</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Koralewski</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Vergote</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Webster</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Steinberg</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>von Euler</surname></name></person-group><article-title>Anastrozole versus tamoxifen as first-line therapy for advanced breast cancer in 668 postmenopausal women &#x02013;
