However, the eradication rates of standard triple therapies have been decreased to less than 80% in many countries recently and the eradication failure is mainly due to poor compliance, antibiotic resistance, and CYP2C19 metabolism.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Thus, the Maastricht-2012 Consensus Report recommended bismuth-containing quadruple therapy as 1st-line treatment for the eradication of <italic>H pylori</italic> infection in regions with a high clarithromycin resistance rate.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> As the clarithromycin resistance rate has been reported to be higher than 15% to 20% in China, bismuth-containing quadruple therapy has been strongly recommended as the treatment in China.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Although some studies have shown that eradication rate of bismuth-containing quadruple therapy could be improved by extending the duration of treatment from 7 days to 10&#x02013;14 days,<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> other studies have found that there is no significant difference between 7 day and 10&#x02013;14 day regimens in terms of the efficacy and safety.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup></p><p>Levofloxacin-based triple therapy has been shown to be effective as the 2nd-line and 3rd-line rescue regimens for those who have failed to the standard treatment, with an eradication rate ranging from 75% to 90%.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> Recent studies have also shown that levofloxacin-based triple therapy is effective as the 1st-line treatment, which has also been confirmed in China.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Success of eradicating <italic>H pylori</italic> infection largely depends on the susceptibility of <italic>H pylori</italic> to the antibiotics used in the regimen.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> However, most studies did not perform antibiotic susceptibility tests and thus their results cannot be globally generalized due to the varying antibiotic resistance rates among different countries. In addition, host CYP2C19 polymorphisms affect the clinical efficacy of PPIs used in the eradication regimen.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup></p><p>Therefore, the present open-label, randomized control trial was designed and conducted to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of two 1-week bismuth-containing quadruple regimens and one 1-week levofloxacin-based triple regimen for the eradication of <italic>H pylori</italic> infection in treatment-naive patients. The influence of susceptibility and host CYP2C19 polymorphisms on the efficacy was also evaluated.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This study was conducted at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from March 2013 to October 2013. Consecutive patients with dyspeptic symptoms undergoing upper endoscopy were enrolled. Eligible patients were those aged &#x0003e;18 years who were positive for <italic>H pylori</italic> infection as determined by histology, rapid urease test, serology or <sup>13</sup>C-urea breath test, and diagnosed with gastritis or duodenal ulcer disease at upper endoscopy. Patients with previous <italic>H pylori</italic> eradication treatment, a history of gastrectomy, gastric ulcer, contraindication or previous allergic reactions to the study drugs, antibiotic administration with the previous 4 weeks, or severe concurrent diseases or malignancy were excluded. Pregnant or lactating women were also excluded.</p><p>The primary endpoint of the study was <italic>H pylori</italic> eradication rates in the intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses. The secondary endpoints were the frequency of adverse events, treatment compliance, antibiotic resistance rate in <italic>H pylori</italic>, and CYP2C19 polymorphisms.</p><p>Participants provided written informed consent before entry to the trial. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. This trial was registered with Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, Number: TRC13003256.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Randomization and treatment procedures</title><p>Patients who met the inclusion criteria were randomized (1:1:1) assigned to receive one of the following regimens: colloidal bismuth pectin 200&#x0200a;mg, clarithromycin 500&#x0200a;mg, amoxicillin 1000&#x0200a;mg, and esomeprazole 20&#x0200a;mg, all twice daily (EBCA); colloidal bismuth pectin 200&#x0200a;mg twice daily, levofloxacin 500&#x0200a;mg once daily, amoxicillin 1000&#x0200a;mg twice daily, and esomeprazole 20&#x0200a;mg twice daily (EBLA); and levofloxacin 500&#x0200a;mg once daily, amoxicillin 1000&#x0200a;mg twice daily, and esomeprazole 20&#x0200a;mg twice daily (ELA). All drugs were taken for 7 days. For patients with duodenal ulcers, additional 2 weeks&#x02019; esomeprazole 20&#x0200a;mg twice daily was needed after the 1-week eradication regimens. Randomization was carried out using a permuted block with a size of 6, and the random number sequence was generated by the computer and was concealed in an opaque envelope until the intervention was assigned.</p><p><italic>H pylori</italic> infectious status was reassessed by <sup>13</sup>C-UBT at least 4 weeks after the completion of the treatment. Patients were asked to stop PPIs or H<sub>2</sub> blocker for at least 4 weeks before follow-up testing. The urea kit (which contained 75&#x0200a;mg <sup>13</sup>C-urea) was dissolved in water and mixed with orange juice. Baseline and 30&#x0200a;minutes breath samples were assayed with a mass spectrometer (KYKY Technology Development Ltd, Beijing, China). Positive results were defined when the &#x00394; value was 4 units or higher.</p><p>Patients were asked to record any adverse events occurred during therapy in a diary, which included diarrhea, taste disturbance, nausea, bloating, loss of appetite, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, headache, and skin rash. Serious adverse events were defined as those symptoms patients considered as disrupting their daily life and must stop the treatment. In the 1st week after the completion of therapy, a telephone interview was also arranged to assess the adverse events and compliance. Compliance was recorded as low when less than 80% of pills were taken.</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>CYP2C19 genotyping</title><p>CYP2C19 genotyping was performed for each of the treated patients. Briefly, blood sample (2&#x0200a;mL) was collected into a vacuum tube with EDTA. DNA was isolated from the blood using the RelaxGene Blood DNA System (Tiangen Biotech Co, Ltd, Beijing, China). Then, PCR restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP)-based analysis was carried out with following primers designed by the Hua Gene Biotech Company (Beijing, China). The forward and reverse primers of mutation1 (m1) were 5&#x02032;-CAACCAGAGCTTGGCATATTG-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-CACAAATACGCAAGCAGTCAC-3&#x02032;, respectively. The forward and reverse primers of mutation 2 (m2) were 5&#x02032;-CACCCTGTGATCCCACTTTC-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-CTAATGGGCTTAGAAGCCTG-3&#x02032;, respectively. The amplified PCR products, which were 301 and 376&#x0200a;bp gene fragments for m1 and m2, respectively, were digested with enzyme, <italic>Sma</italic>I for m1 and <italic>BamH</italic>I for m2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Then, the digested PCR products were analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Because CYP2C19 m1 lacks <italic>Sma</italic>I site and CYP2C19 m2 lacks <italic>BamH</italic>I site, the mutant alleles are resistant to endonuclease digestion. Meantime, we chose 70 samples for direct sequencing (Hua Gene Biotech Company) to verify the accuracy of PCR-RFLP. Studied patients were categorized into 3 groups, based on the existence of m1 or m2 on CYP2C19 genotyping: homozygous extensive metabolizers (wild type, wt/wt); heterozygous extensive metabolizers (wt/m1 or wt/m2), and poor metabolizers (PM) (m1/m1, m1/m2, or m2/m2).</p></sec><sec><label>2.4</label><title>Antibiotic susceptibility test</title><p>Antibiotic susceptibility in <italic>H pylori</italic> was tested by genotyping 23S rRNA for clarithromycin and <italic>gyrA</italic> for levofloxacin. Fecal samples were collected from the patients prior to the treatment. Genomic DNA from stool specimens was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (QIAGEN, China). The <italic>H pylori</italic> 23S rRNA gene fragment was amplified by nest PCR with following primers described by Noguchi.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> The forward and reverse primers were 5&#x02032;-GGTCTCAGCAAAGAGTCCCT-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-CCCACCAAGCATTGTCCT-3&#x02032;, respectively, in the 1st-round, and 5&#x02032;-AGGATGCGTCAGTCGCAAGAT-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-CCTGTGGATAACACAGGCCAGT-3&#x02032;, respectively, in the 2nd-round. The PCR products were then purified and digested with restriction endonucleases <italic>Bsa</italic>I, <italic>Bbs</italic>I, and <italic>BceA</italic>I, and the fragments were cut off when the mutation was determined as A2143G, A2142G, or A2142C, respectively. The PCR products were also sent to Shanghai Sangon Biotech Corporation (Shang, China) to conduct the DNA sequencing. Similarly, the <italic>gyrA</italic> fragment was amplified by nest PCR with the following primers: forward and reverse: 5&#x02032;-GATCATAGGGCGCTTTACC-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-TTCCCACTGGTGGGATCAT-3&#x02032;, respectively, in the 1st-round, and 5&#x02032;-GCTTAAAGCCCGTGCATAGG-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-GACGCTTTAGCGCATGTCT-3&#x02032;, respectively, in the 2nd-round. The PCR products were also sent for DNA sequencing. Nucleotide sequences were aligned and analyzed using the DNA Star software package. The gene sequence of <italic>H pylori</italic> strain 26695 (ATCC) was used as the quality control strain.</p></sec><sec><label>2.5</label><title>Sample size estimation and statistical analysis</title><p>Previous studies have suggested that the eradication rates of EBCA would be about 80%.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Consequently, our initial estimation of the sample size was at least 73 individuals in each group to determine the 10% difference in the clinical efficacy, considering a power of 90% and a 0.025 two-sided type 1 error, assuming 10% loss to follow-up. Finally, we decided to increase our sample size to 90 individuals each group to allow a more drop-out rate.</p><p>ITT and PP analyses were performed to calculate the eradication rate. The ITT analysis included all randomized patients. Individuals who did not taking at least 80% of the drugs, or with unknown posttreatment <italic>H pylori</italic> status were excluded from the PP analysis. Chi-square test was used to determine the difference among and between the three groups; odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated where appropriate. Patients who did not return for a follow-up <sup>13</sup>C-UBT were defined as being lost to follow-up. To assess factors affecting eradication rates, univariate analyses and multiple logistic regression analyses with the following predictors of interest: age, sex, body-mass index (BMI), clarithromycin resistance, levofloxacin resistance, CYP2C19 genotype, peptic ulcer disease, smoking, and drinking were performed. SPSS Software (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL) was used for statistical analyses.

However, the regimen is relatively complex requiring the patient to switch from a dual to a triple therapy at middle point.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> Moreover, some studies from China did not show any advantages of sequential therapy over the standard triple therapy.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup></p><p>Bismuth has an established history in the treatment of <italic>H pylori</italic>, which has a synergistic effect with antibiotics and decreases the bacterial load to increase the eradication rate. Importantly, there is no resistance to bismuth in <italic>H pylori</italic>, which makes bismuth a preferred antimicrobial agent for <italic>H pylori</italic> eradication.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> Bismuth-containing quadruple therapy has usually been used as an optimal rescue regimen in guidelines and achieved a high eradication rate in the past.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> In Maastricht IV Consensus Report, it is reported that in areas of high clarithromycin resistance, bismuth-containing quadruple treatment is recommended for 1st-line empirical treatment.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> A recent study showed an eradication rate of 90.7% for a 14-day bismuth-containing quadruple therapy as 1st-line therapy in Turkey.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> In the present study, the eradication rate of 2 bismuth-based quadruple regimens was almost 85%, although it is lower than the previously reported which may be due to the shorter treatment duration. Given the wide indications for <italic>H pylori</italic> eradication and the importance of choosing the optimum duration of therapy, it is necessary to further determine whether longer treatment duration would be beneficial to obtain better eradication rate. Although the 14-day regimen has been generally preferred for the 2nd-line or subsequent treatment, studies evaluating the duration of bismuth-containing quadruple therapy as 1st-line treatment are rare. A recent study found that the 14-day bismuth-containing quadruple regimen led to a significant increase of <italic>H pylori</italic> eradication compared with 7-day regimen in the ITT analysis (93.7% vs 80.0%; <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.01).<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> A recent Cochrane review of 6 randomized controlled trials and 4763 patients assessed the eradication rates of different bismuth-containing quadruple regimens with different durations and found no significant difference among 7, 10, and 14 days.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> Thus, considering the assumption that prolonged treatment duration is more expensive, and may lead to increased drug-related adverse reactions and poor compliance, we adapted 7-day duration in the present study and showed that 7-day bismuth-containing quadruple regimens with levofloxacin achieved an eradication rate of 86.7% as 1st-line treatment. In addition, 7-day bismuth-containing quadruple regimens with clarithromycin and levofloxacin-based triple regimen also achieved an eradication rate above the accepted threshold of 80%.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> Moreover, all these 3 regimens were associated with relatively low rates of adverse events.</p><p>Levofloxacin, a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone agent, has been postulated as an efficient alternative to clarithromycin for triple, quadruple, or sequential regimens.<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> When used in a triple 1st-line regimen, it has been evaluated to achieve higher eradication rates than clarithromycin-containing triple therapy.<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> Two studies from China demonstrated that the eradication rates of a 7-day levofloxacin-based triple treatment ranged from 80.9% to 86.7%.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> A randomized, blind, multicenter study from Middle East showed that 7-day levofloxacin-based triple treatment was superior to the standard triple therapy in terms of the eradication rate (84.7% vs 74.7%).<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> In the present study, the overall eradication rate of the 3 regimens was 84%, which was similar to previously reported. Moreover, the combined eradication rate of the 2 levofloxacin-based regimens was 86%, which is well above the acceptable rate.</p><p>Antibiotic resistance is the main factor that contributes to the eradication failure of <italic>H pylori</italic> infection. A large-scale multicenter European study revealed resistance rates of 17.5% for clarithromycin, 14.1% for levofloxacin, and 34.9% for metronidazole, with a significant association between outpatient antibiotic use and the proportion of antibiotic resistance.<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> In China, resistance rates to clarithromycin, metronidazole, and levofloxacin were 21.5, 95.4, and 20.6%, respectively,<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> which are similar to our study. There is almost no resistance to amoxicillin in <italic>H pylori</italic> strains in China. In the present study, we found that <italic>H pylori</italic> resistance to clarithromycin or levofloxacin affected the efficacy of 3 therapy regimens in which clarithromycin or levofloxacin was used. The high prevalence of clarithromycin resistance (19.5%) and levofloxacin resistance (30.8%) in the present study accounted for the relevantly low eradication rate of all the 3 treatments. In addition, in the present study, the levofloxacin-based quadruple and triple regimens appear more efficacious than the clarithromycin-containing quadruple regimen as 1st-line treatment after excluding the factor of antibiotic resistance; the eradication rates were 83.7% in EBCA, and 92.3% and 90.9% in groups EBLA and ELA).</p><p>The strength of our study included comparison of 3 different 1st-line treatments, extensive analysis of factors that might affect treatment efficacy. In addition, we proved that 1-week bismuth-containing quadruple therapy and levofloxacin triple therapy could achieve an acceptable eradication. Nevertheless, there are also some limitations in this study. First, antibiotic susceptibility data were available in only 59% of patients, which might raise the possibility of selection bias. This was because not all patients could provide fecals since they came for and also related to the fact that the culture rate of <italic>H pylori</italic> is less than perfect. Second, we did not research their efficacy when they were used as rescue regimens. Because of our small samples, we could not enroll enough patients in 2nd ground treatments. Third, our study was open label. Although we recorded no substantial difference between the baseline characteristics of the ITT and PP study population, patients who are lost to follow-up or noncompliant might be as a direct result of their treatment allocation so that the PP population had higher eradication rates for each group.</p><p>In conclusion, 1-week bismuth-containing quadruple regimen with levofloxacin or clarithromycin and levofloxacin-based triple regimen achieved an acceptable eradication rate for <italic>H pylori</italic> infection, with the bismuth-containing quadruple regimen with levofloxacin exhibiting the highest eradication rate. The resistance to clarithromycin or levofloxacin is associated with decreased efficacy. In addition, BMI, not sex, age, smoking, drinking, and CYP2C19 polymorphism, is an independent factor affecting the efficacy of the regimens (TRC13003256).</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81270476 and 81470830) and the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (JX10231801) for the support.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: BMI = body mass index, CI = confidence interval, ITT = intention-to-treat, PP = per-protocol, PPI = proton pump inhibitor.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>JS, XZ, and HC contributed equally to this work.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Authorship: GZ takes responsibility for the integrity of the work as a whole, from inception to published article.
