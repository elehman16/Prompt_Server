Patients aged 20 to 64 years who met the American College of Rheumatology 1990 diagnostic FM criteria and had stably high pain scores during a placebo run-in period were randomly assigned (1:1) by a computer-generated allocation sequence (block size 4) to receive mirtazapine orally (15 mg/d for 1 week and then 30 mg/d) or matching placebo for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in mean numerical rating scale (NRS) pain score from baseline to endpoint (week 12 or early discontinuation). Of the 430 patients randomized (n = 215 each group), 422 (n = 211 each group) were analyzed for the primary endpoint. At the study endpoint, mirtazapine caused a significantly greater reduction in the mean NRS pain score compared with placebo (difference, 0.44; 95% confidence interval, &#x02212;0.72 to &#x02212;0.17; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0018). The reduction by mirtazapine remained significantly greater compared with placebo from week 6 onward. More patients treated with mirtazapine had their NRS pain score reduced by &#x02265;30% from baseline (45.5% vs 30.8%). Mirtazapine also improved pain-related quality of life assessed by the Japanese version of the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire and the Short-Form 36 Questionnaire. Adverse events were more common with mirtazapine than placebo (68.8% vs 56.7%), including somnolence (32.1% vs 7.4%), weight gain (17.7% vs 0.9%), and increased appetite (11.6% vs 3.3%). In conclusion, mirtazapine was an effective and safe treatment for Japanese patients with FM.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords:</title><kwd>Fibromyalgia</kwd><kwd>Mirtazapine</kwd><kwd>Pain treatment</kwd><kwd>Placebo-controlled study</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>OPEN-ACCESS</meta-name><meta-value>TRUE</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>SDC</meta-name><meta-value>T</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Fibromyalgia (FM) is a severely disabling condition characterized by widespread, often intense bodily pain. This condition often coexists with sleep disturbances, depression, fatigue, and headaches, which further impair patients' quality of life (QOL).<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Estimates from the Japan College of Fibromyalgia Investigation indicate that FM affects more than 2 million Japanese individuals (approximately 1.7% of the Japanese population). FM has a distinct predominance for women (male-to-female ratio 1:4.6) and mainly affects individuals aged between 30 and 70 years.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Currently, there is no cure for FM and the available treatments are merely symptomatic (eg, analgesics, antidepressants, antiepileptics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and hypnotics).<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p>In Japan, pregabalin (an antiepileptic drug) and duloxetine (a serotonin&#x02013;noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor) have been approved for the treatment of FM. In addition to these 2 drugs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants are commonly used for patients with FM.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Descending noradrenergic and serotonergic pathways in the spinal cord are involved in the inhibitory control of nociceptive responses in the spinal dorsal horn.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> The above-mentioned antidepressants seem to suppress the abnormal nociceptive responses in FM by activating these descending antinociceptive pathways.</p><p>Mirtazapine promotes the release of noradrenaline and serotonin by blocking &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic autoreceptors and &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic heteroreceptors, respectively. It also enhances serotonin neurotransmission, mainly through 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors, and blocking postsynaptic 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors. Based on these pharmacological mechanisms, mirtazapine is classified as a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Because mirtazapine increases the extracellular levels of noradrenaline and serotonin (an effect similar to serotonin&#x02013;noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants, albeit via different mechanisms), mirtazapine is expected to have analgesic effects<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and improve sleep disturbances<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> in patients with FM. Evidence from several studies on animal models indicates that mirtazapine reduced experimentally induced pain.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Its anti-FM efficacy in non-Japanese patients has been evaluated in 2 clinical studies. One was an open-label study (n = 26) that provided preliminary evidence for the effects of mirtazapine on FM pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbances.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The other was a randomized placebo-controlled study (n = 40), which showed that the drug significantly relieved FM pain and had a favorable tolerability profile.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Furthermore, evidence from a randomized placebo-controlled study (n = 281) showed the efficacy and safety of mirtazapine in Japanese patients with depression.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>We previously conducted a double-blind study (JapicCTI-101,176) in Japanese patients with FM and compared the efficacy of mirtazapine (15-45 mg/d) (n = 92) with that of placebo (n = 44). The change in the mean numerical rating scale (NRS) value for strongest pain (the primary endpoint) from baseline to the end of the study was greater in the mirtazapine group than in the placebo group, although the difference was not statistically significant (unpublished data). Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the efficacy and safety of a fixed dose of mirtazapine (30 mg/d). The primary endpoint in the present study was the NRS value for the mean pain. In the present study, we also excluded patients with depressive symptoms, according to the guidelines of the European Medicines Agency,<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> to avoid potential confounding effects of depression on the efficacy evaluations.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>2.

Treatments</title><p>To maintain blinding, mirtazapine 15-mg tablets and placebo tablets with the same appearance as the study drug were used. All subjects enrolled were given placebo tablets for 2 weeks in a single-blind manner during the run-in period. At the end of the run-in period, subjects with confirmed eligibility were randomized in blocks of 4 at 1:1 to receive double-blind treatment with mirtazapine (15 mg/d for 1 week and then at 30 mg/d) or matching placebo for 12 weeks. Both treatments were given orally once daily at bedtime. Subjects and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. The randomization was done by a computer-generated allocation sequence, which was delivered by a telephone randomization service (randomization manager) not involved in subject recruitment or treatment to ensure allocation concealment. The randomization manager securely kept the randomization list and confirmed that the blinding was maintained until the official decoding of the randomization list. The manager also checked and confirmed the similarity between the active and placebo tablets regarding appearance, shape, size, packaging, and labeling.</p><p>Subjects were prohibited from using any nonstudy drug (eg, antidepressants, antiepileptics, pregabalin, narcotics, and narcotic analogs) or nonpharmacological treatment (eg, surgery, electroconvulsive therapy, electrostimulation therapy, acupuncture and moxibustion, and nerve block) that might affect pain scoring. Patients using analgesics discontinued these drugs in the washout period, and concomitant analgesics were prohibited during the treatment period. As-needed use of acetaminophen (up to 1.5 g/d), aspirin (up to 300 mg/d), any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (up to 3 days), and dextromethorphan was permitted. Subjects were allowed to receive a drug to treat any stably controlled concomitant condition without modification of its dosage throughout the treatment period if the drug had been instituted before the start of the run-in period. Subjects were also allowed to receive any nonpharmacological anti-FM treatment, such as physical (eg, exercise and hyperthermia) and psychological therapy (eg, biofeedback treatment and cognitive behavioral therapy), without modification of its protocol, provided that the treatment had been instituted at least 30 days before the start of the run-in period.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>2.4. Efficacy evaluations</title><p>Each subject self-rated average pain over the last 24 hours on arising everyday using an 11-point NRS (0 = no pain to 10 = worst imaginable pain) and recorded the score in a pain diary. At each of the 9 visits from visits 2 to 10, the investigator determined NRS pain score by averaging the scores assigned by the subject after the previous visit (or the scores assigned on the last 7 days before discontinuing the treatment). At each specified time point, the mean NRS pain score was determined for each treatment group. To assess the impact of treatment on QOL, the Japanese version of Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (JFIQ)<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> was administered at weeks 0 (baseline), 4, 8 and 12, and the Japanese Short-form 36 Questionnaire (SF-36) version 2<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> was administered at baseline and at week 12.</p><p>The primary endpoint of this study was change in mean NRS pain score from baseline to week 12 or early discontinuation (endpoint).

Safety evaluation</title><p>During the double-blind treatment period, subjects in both groups were asked about their symptoms in an open-ended fashion. Symptoms collected in this way and abnormal physical and laboratory findings observed were reported as adverse events (AEs). AEs other than those considered unrelated to the treatment were regarded as treatment-related AEs. The frequencies of AEs and treatment-related AEs during the treatment period were determined by treatment group.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>2.6. Statistical analyses</title><p>To determine the target sample size, we assumed that the difference between the 2 groups in the primary endpoint (change in mean NRS pain score from baseline to endpoint) would be 0.7 with a standard deviation of 2.4 based on the results of previous studies.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Therefore, 200 patients were required in each group to detect this difference with &#x02265;80% power at the 5% (2-sided) level.</p><p>The primary efficacy population comprised of subjects who received at least 1 dose of double-blind treatment and had evaluable primary endpoint data at baseline and at 1 or more postbaseline time points.

Disposition of subjects</title><p>From November 2012 to February 2014, 514 patients were enrolled in the placebo run-in period at one of the 57 Japanese tertiary care hospitals. Of these, 84 were excluded before entering the double-blind treatment period, leaving 430 patients randomized to receive mirtazapine (n = 215) or placebo (n = 215) (see the online-only Figure, available online as Supplemental Digital Content at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/PAIN/A300">http://links.lww.com/PAIN/A300</ext-link>). All the randomized patients received the respective treatments assigned. Of the randomized patients, 422 were included in the primary efficacy population. The reasons for excluding the 8 patients from the efficacy analysis set were (1) lack of evaluable on-treatment primary endpoint data (mirtazapine, n = 4; placebo, n = 1), (2) placebo responder (placebo, n = 2), and (3) prior treatment with mirtazapine for pain control (placebo, n = 1). Whether each subject was included in the primary efficacy population was determined in a case conference before officially decoding the randomization list (ie, before unblinding).</p><p>During follow-up, treatment was discontinued in 25 patients (11.6%) randomized to mirtazapine and in 23 patients (10.7%) randomized to placebo. In both groups, the most frequent reason for discontinuation was withdrawal of consent (n = 9 in each group), followed by any AE (mirtazapine, n = 6, which includes 1 patient with a serious AE [SAE]; placebo, n = 5). Other reasons for treatment discontinuation were noncompliance with medication (mirtazapine, n = 3; placebo, n = 1), ineligibility (placebo, n = 3), worsening of FM (mirtazapine, n = 1), use of any prohibited drug (placebo, n = 1), worsening of the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview Module C&#x02013;Suicidal ideation score (mirtazapine, n = 1), and miscellaneous (mirtazapine, n = 5; placebo, n = 4). Three patients in the mirtazapine group and 2 in the placebo group were lost to follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>3.2.

Discussion</title><p>In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we evaluated the efficacy of mirtazapine (30 mg/d) for the treatment of Japanese patients with FM by assessing its analgesic effect and its impact on their QOL. Therefore, the efficacy analysis set used in this study was considered an appropriate representation of the Japanese FM population with regard to male-to-female ratio (1:4.8) but was younger than the general FM patient population (51.5 [16.9] years).<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>In this study, we observed a significantly greater reduction of mean NRS pain score from baseline to the end of treatment with mirtazapine compared with placebo. The difference in the effect size between mirtazapine and placebo in this study was similar to that of pregabalin (&#x02212;0.44)<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and duloxetine (&#x02212;0.38),<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> which are approved for FM in Japan, and is therefore considered clinically meaningful. The reduction of mean NRS pain score with mirtazapine was significantly greater than that with placebo from week 6 onward. Moreover, mirtazapine significantly improved the QOL of patients with FM compared with placebo in terms of JFIQ total and subscale scores for job ability, pain, anxiety, and depression as well as SF-36 role/social component and subscale scores for bodily pain and emotional role functioning. The improvement of QOL observed in pain-related subscales/components after treatment with mirtazapine supports its analgesic effect as assessed by NRS pain score. Antidepressants are often used to manage chronic pain associated with various conditions and exert an analgesic effect for chronic pain independent of their antidepressant effect.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The anti-FM efficacy of mirtazapine observed also seemed to be independent of its antidepressant activity and its ability to improve sleep because this study did not include patients with depression, which often coexists with FM. Additionally, the subjects of this study generally had fair quality of sleep at baseline as assessed by the Japanese Sleep Impairment Index and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.</p><p>In a placebo-controlled pilot study, Yeephu et al.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> found that there were no significant between-group differences in most efficacy endpoints between the placebo (n = 13) and mirtazapine 15 mg/d (n = 13) or 30 mg/d (n = 14) groups; however, the authors reported that pain VAS, total FIQ, and Jenkins sleep scale scores significantly improved from baseline in each group, particularly the 30 mg/d mirtazapine group. These findings support the results of our study.</p><p>Our previous placebo-controlled study suggested that mirtazapine might relieve pain in Japanese patients with FM but failed to show its superiority over placebo (JapicCTI-101,176; unpublished data). Thus, we planned the current larger study (n = 200 per group planned), which randomly assigned Japanese patients with FM at 1:1 to receive either mirtazapine or placebo to increase the sensitivity for detecting the treatment effect and the precision for estimating the effect size. Additionally, to minimize the placebo effect during double-blind treatment, we included a longer placebo run-in period to identify and exclude subjects responsive to placebo. Assuming that the expected treatment difference in mean NRS pain score was 0.7 (SD, 2.4) with placebo, as had been assumed for pregabalin in evaluating its anti-FM efficacy,<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> the planned sample size would provide a power &#x02265;80% for detecting the expected effect of mirtazapine. The duration of the double-blind treatment was 12 weeks according to the European Medical Agency Guideline recommendations to continue maintenance dose therapy for 12 weeks with a drug intended for neuropathic pain.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> This also falls within the range of treatment durations of pregabalin or duloxetine (8-15 weeks) used to evaluate their efficacy for FM.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>In this study, the difference between mirtazapine and placebo with regard to change from baseline in mean NRS pain score increased gradually from week 2 and remained constant from week 8 onward. This pattern of response indicates a slower onset of analgesic effect for mirtazapine than for pregabalin<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> or duloxetine.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> In contrast, the treatment difference with regard to change from baseline in JFIQ total score increased serially from weeks 4 to 12. As the JFIQ is a validated Japanese version of the FIQ and it is a condition-specific instrument that allows a comprehensive assessment of the impact of FM on the patient's health, this finding indicates that mirtazapine further suppressed disease activity of FM from weeks 8 to 12.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Mirtazapine was also more effective than placebo in improving health-related QOL as assessed by the SF-36. Taken together, mirtazapine 30 mg/d administered for 12 weeks was shown to be an effective treatment for FM.</p><p>With regard to safety, the AE profile of mirtazapine observed in this study was similar to that reported in the double-blind placebo-controlled study of 12-week treatment with 15, 30, or 45 mg/d of mirtazapine in Japanese patients with depression (Study 001),<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> with somnolence being the most frequent AE in both studies. The AEs in our study were also similar to those of the earlier randomized study of mirtazapine in patients with FM,<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> the most common of which were increased appetite and weight gain. In the present study, somnolence of mild or moderate intensity generally occurred in the early phase of treatment (on days 1-14 in 76.8% patients). Weight gain, a specific safety concern with mirtazapine, and increased appetite, a well-known cause of weight gain (60.0% of the mirtazapine recipients with increased appetite gained weight), were more frequent than in Study 001 (17.7 vs 7.1% and 11.6 vs 4.3%, respectively). The mean body weight of patients treated with mirtazapine increased serially from baseline (by 2.1% at week 4 and by 3.7% at week 12) but to a similar extent to that in Study 001 (by 2.3% at week 6). All episodes of weight gain and increased appetite reported in this study were of mild intensity and considered to have little influence on the subjects' health. Elevated liver enzymes, another category of common AEs with mirtazapine, occurred as often in this study as in Study 001 (elevated ALT [13.8%], elevated AST [8.6%] and elevated GGT [7.6%]). All episodes of elevated liver enzymes reported in this study were of mild intensity and considered to have little influence on the subjects' health.</p><p>Intestinal obstruction in 1 patient treated with mirtazapine was the only SAE reported in this study. Because this patient had previously developed intestinal obstruction, the reported AE was considered to indicate spontaneous recurrence of the previous event, and thus, it was deemed as unrelated to the study drug by the investigator. There were no severe AEs. Additionally, aside from 13 moderate AEs (mirtazapine, n = 12; placebo, n = 1), all AEs were of mild intensity. Fourteen AEs in the mirtazapine group and 7 AEs in the placebo group persisted up to the last follow-up, and the outcome of 2 AEs in the mirtazapine group was unknown. The investigator completed the follow-up of these events after confirming the safety of each subject. Thus, the results of this study raise no new safety concerns related to mirtazapine treatment for FM. The most common AEs observed in Japanese patients with FM treated with mirtazapine in this study were consistent in the nature and frequency with those reported in the Japanese patients with depression treated in Study 001.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>This study has several limitations. First, the study excluded FM patients aged &#x02265;65 years to ensure the subjects' safety and also excluded FM patients with concomitant depression to assess the analgesic effect of mirtazapine independent of its antidepressant effect. Therefore, the study population was not an accurate representation of the Japanese FM population seen in routine clinical practice. Second, this study was overly short in duration (12 weeks) to provide evidence to support the long-term efficacy and safety of mirtazapine in the management of FM. Third, responders during the 2-week placebo run-in period were excluded from this study, which might limit external validity. However, this was deemed clinically appropriate because patients with a valid response while on their current therapy are likely to continue their therapy than add a new drug to their treatment regimen. Fourth, this study was conducted in an exploratory manner to examine the efficacy and safety of a single dose of mirtazapine in Japanese patients with FM, so the results might not reflect those obtained with other doses or in other settings. Hence, the findings from this study need further confirmation.</p><p>In summary, the present double-blind placebo-controlled study showed that mirtazapine (30 mg/d) was effective and safe in the treatment of FM in Japanese patients meeting the American College of Rheumatology 1990 diagnostic criteria for FM.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Compared with placebo, mirtazapine produced a significantly greater analgesic effect and significantly greater improvements in QOL in terms of job ability, anxiety, and role/social functioning. Of note, mirtazapine was found to be effective in controlling FM pain even in patients without coexisting depression, indicating the independence of this drug's anti-FM efficacy from its antidepressant effect. The drug was tolerated well in Japanese patients with FM, having a safety profile similar to that reported in Japanese patients with depression. A further confirmatory study should be designed to establish its benefit for the treatment of FM.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.</p><p>K.
