As cancer patients take multiple drugs as a part of their clinical management, a non-pharmacological self-management (SM) of constipation would be recommended. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a SM program on antiemetic-induced constipation in cancer patients. Thirty patients with breast cancer, receiving 5HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists to prevent emesis during chemotherapy were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. The SM program consisted of abdominal massage, abdominal muscle stretching, and education on proper defecation position. The intervention group started the program before the first chemotherapy cycle, whereas patients in the wait-list control group received the program on the day before their second chemotherapy cycle. The primary outcome was constipation severity, assessed by the constipation assessment scale (CAS, sum of eight components). The secondary outcome included each CAS component (0&#x02013;2 points) and mood states. A self-reported assessment of satisfaction with the program was performed. The program produced a statistically and clinically significant alleviation of constipation severity (mean difference in CAS, &#x02212;3.00; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.02), decrease in the likelihood of a small volume of stool (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.03), and decrease in depression and dejection (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.02). With regards to program satisfaction, 43.6 and 26.4&#x000a0;% patients rated the program as excellent and good, respectively. Our SM program is effective for mitigating the symptoms of antiemetic-induced constipation during chemotherapy.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s10549-015-3652-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Constipation</kwd><kwd>Antiemetic</kwd><kwd>Breast cancer</kwd><kwd>Supportive care</kwd><kwd>Exercise</kwd><kwd>Self-management</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Research on patient-reported outcomes in cancer treatment indicates that constipation is one of the most common and distressing side effects of cancer therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The use of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin; 5HT<sub>3</sub>) receptor antagonist, which is commonly included as part of the pharmacologic treatment of cancer to alleviate emetogenesis, often increases the severity of constipation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Although constipation is a significant health issue related to chemotherapy, the incidences of constipation (defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 or CTCAEv4.0 for short) in clinical trials are frequently under-reported as physicians are often not made aware of this symptom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The incidence of 5HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist-induced constipation increases in conjunction with the emetogenic risk of the chemotherapy medication used. For instance, the incidence rate of constipation with the use of 5-fluorouracil-epidoxorubicin-cyclophosphamide, a regimen with a high emetic risk, is reported to be as high as 84&#x000a0;%, compared to a constipation incidence of 50&#x000a0;% with use of low emetic risk drugs, such as docetaxel and paclitaxel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The combination of a 5HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist and a corticosteroid is recommended as an antiemetic prophylaxis in patients with a high or moderate-to-high emetic risk, whereas 5HT<sub>3</sub> is not routinely prescribed to patients with a low emetic risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Physical exercise facilitates bowel movement and is recommended for patients with chronic constipation or irritable bowel syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Abdominal massage has also been emphasized as a non-pharmacological intervention to improve chronic constipation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Additionally, a proper defecation position can ensure the smooth passage of stool during defecation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. As cancer patients often take multiple medications to alleviate the side effects of chemotherapy, a non-pharmacological intervention to alleviate constipation would be favorable, while avoiding the adverse side effects commonly associated with laxatives, including bloating, increased gas, and abdominal fullness.</p><p>Self-care management and lifestyle education during cancer treatment are important to minimize antiemetic-induced constipation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Therefore, the aim of our clinical trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of a self-management (SM) program in mitigating the symptoms of antiemetic-induced constipation in cancer patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="Sec20"><title>Study design and patients</title><p>A randomized, waiting-list controlled, parallel group, open-label pilot trial was conducted. This trial was approved by the ethics committee of Kyoto University Graduate School and Faculty of Medicine, and was registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network in February 2013 (UMIN000009676).</p><p>Breast cancer patients were recruited from Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan, between February 2013 and March 2014, according to the following inclusion criteria: suitable candidate for chemotherapy; planned prescription of 5HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist, including ondansetron, granisetron, tropisetron, or palonosetron; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 0 or 1; ability to defecate and normal digestive and abdominal functions before study enrollment; and provision of signed informed consent. Prospective patients were further screened on the following exclusion criteria: difficulty communicating due to a mental disorder, cognitive impairment, or physical disability; constipation severity score higher than a CTCAEv4.0 grade 2 before enrollment; pregnancy; restrictions or contraindications to exercise; not suitable for study inclusion based on the primary physician&#x02019;s judgment; and indication of intent to continue taking non-prescribed supplements. Note that the final exclusion criterion was added to the protocol in July 2013 and this change did not affect the measured outcome of the previously enrolled patients as the use of non-prescribed supplements has consistently been strongly discouraged during chemotherapy because of possible drug&#x02013;drug interactions.</p><p>Independent research staff performed block randomization of recruited patients into the intervention or the control group, using a block size of 4 and a computer-generated random-numbers table. Patients were randomized (1:1) into an intervention or waiting-list control group. An occupational therapist verified the allocation by phone and consulted with the patients in the intervention group regarding the SM program.</p><p>Patient-reported outcomes were assessed before chemotherapy (baseline), after the first cycle of chemotherapy (C1) in the hospital and after the second cycle of chemotherapy (C2) through out-patient care. Activity monitors were provided only during C1.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Standard care (provided to all patients)</title><p>On the day before chemotherapy, general self-care information was provided for constipation regarding the use of medication (magnesium oxide, sennoside, and sodium carbonate suppository), and the benefits of food and drink intake, circadian rhythms, a relaxing environment, a bidet, and moderate exercise.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention group was educated on the SM program, which included (a) abdominal massage, (b) abdominal exercise, and (c) information on the proper defecation position, on the day before C1 (Fig. S1). This simple SM program was taught using an illustrated guide that patients could easily learn in approximately 10&#x000a0;min. The waiting-list control group was educated on the program on the first day of C2, before chemotherapy was administered.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Abdominal massage</title><p>Patients were informed that abdominal massage could promote bowel motility throughout the colon (Fig. S1a) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This massage was performed by applying a constant moderate pressure to the abdomen using two or three fingers. Small, clockwise circular movements were performed over the colon. Each pass of the massage required approximately 1&#x000a0;min and patients were instructed to repeat the massage 10 times per day.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Abdominal exercise</title><p>Three abdominal exercises (Fig. S1b, i&#x02013;iii) and abdominal breathing were taught to patients. Based on a number of yoga poses and a cyclic abdominal stretching protocol for irritable bowel syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], these exercises were designed for breast cancer patients to stimulate and increase the movement of bowel content, while avoiding excessive compression or extension of the skin around the breasts. The three exercises are described below.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Wind-relieving Pose: Patients wrapped their hands around one knee and pulled it gently toward their chest and drew their head to their knees. They held the position for 15&#x02013;30&#x000a0;s while taking slow, deep, calm breaths. The position, with end-position static hold, was repeated with the opposite knee.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Knees-to-chest Pose: Patients lay down on their back, drawing their knees toward their chest and interlacing their hands on top of their knees.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Reclined Spinal Twist: Patients lay down on their back with their knee flexed to approximately 90&#x000b0; and their feet resting on a bed. Then, the trunk and pelvis were rotated and held at 80&#x000a0;% of the patient&#x02019;s maximal rotation angle for 1&#x000a0;min. The twisting position was then repeated using the other knee.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Following these exercises, patients performed abdominal breathing by lying on their back, placing their hands on their abdomen, and breathing deeply. These exercises required 5&#x02013;6&#x000a0;min to complete, and patients were instructed to repeat them 10 times per day. Abdominal massage and abdominal exercise were logged by using an Actiwatch<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Cambridge Neurotechnology, Ltd.) and by self-reporting by patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Proper defecation position</title><p>Defecating in a semi-squatting position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] was introduced to patients through an explanation of anorectal anatomy and abdominal and thoracic pressures during defecation (Fig. S1c). To maintain the proper position during excretion, a small step and cushion were provided.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary endpoint was the constipation status, assessed using the constipation assessment scale (CAS). Secondary endpoints were each component of the CAS, mood states measured by the profile of mood states (POMS), and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The frequency of laxative use and defecation, food and water intake, and rest-activity patterns, as well as adherence and satisfaction with the program were also measured. Outcomes were assessed before chemotherapy (baseline), at C1, and at C2.</p><p>The CAS is an eight-item, self-reported measure designed to assess the presence and severity of constipation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The eight items evaluated by the CAS are abdominal distention or bloating; change in amount of gas passed rectally; less frequent bowel movements; rectal fullness or pressure; rectal pain with bowel movements; small volume of stool; inability to pass stool; and oozing liquid stool. The Japanese version of the CAS, which has been modified and validated to assess constipation in Japanese populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], was used. A low score on the CAS is indicative of less severe constipation.</p><p>The POMS is a self-administered test that identifies and assesses transient, fluctuating affective states in individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The test assesses the following six components of mood, with higher scores indicative of greater disturbances: tension-anxiety, anger-hostility, fatigue-inertia, depression-dejection, vigor-activity, and confusion-bewilderment. In this study, the short version of the POMS was used.</p><p>The Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF36) assesses the following eight areas of general health: disease-related limitations in physical activities; limitations in social functioning as a result of physical and/or emotional problems; limitations in participating in a usual role or function (work or other daily activities) as a result of emotional problems; limitations in participating in a usual role or functioning as a result of physical health problems; bodily pain; general mental health (feelings about well-being or depression); vitality (energy and fatigue); and general health perceptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Scores ranging from 0 to 100 were calculated for each of these different health aspects, with a low score indicative of a poor health status. In this study, the standard version of the SF36 was used for baseline assessment, and the abbreviated version was used at the follow-up time points.</p><p>The wrist actigraph, Actiwatch<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, which is designed to provide accurate and objective sleep and wake activity, was used to determine abnormal rest-activity patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. By clicking on the markers, a complete list of the times when the marker button on the side of the Actiwatch<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> has been pressed is provided. Patients wore the Actiwatch<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> continuously on their non-dominant forearm, and they pushed the marker when they slept and woke up to log their subjective rest-activity patterns. Patients in the intervention group were also required to push the marker when they started and finished the SM program to assess adherence objectively.</p><p>Laxative use, food and water intake, and frequency of defecation, nausea, or vomiting were also self-reported by patients. The daily use of laxatives (magnesium oxide, sennoside, or sodium carbonate suppository); amount of food and water intake; and frequency of defecation, nausea, or vomiting (CTCAEv 4.0) were reported throughout the trial.</p><p>The self-report satisfaction questionnaire included (1) ease of use; (2) perception of whether it was effective; (3) desire to continue; and (4) timing of the intervention. Patients were asked to respond to each question with a grade of &#x0201c;bad,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;poor,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;fair,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;good,&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;excellent.&#x0201d; A free writing space was also provided to obtain subjective feedback. This questionnaire was added to the protocol in July 2013.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Sample size and data analysis</title><p>All the data were double checked by a third-party beneficiary.

The severity of constipation was approximately 40&#x000a0;% lower in the intervention group, compared to the control group, with a mean CAS score of &#x0003c;5 points in the intervention group, which is indicative of mild constipation not requiring medical intervention. With regard to the mood states, depression-dejection was less frequently reported by the intervention group than by the control group. Over half of the patients in both groups were satisfied with the program and preferred to continue the program during chemotherapy. These findings indicate the clinical applicability of the program; moreover, the intervention does not require costly resources and is not labor extensive.</p><p>The limitations of our study should be noted in interpreting outcomes of our trial and clinical application. First, only short-term effects of the SM program on constipation were evaluated (i.e., 4&#x000a0;days of the first cycle of chemotherapy). Although a longitudinal analysis was not performed, the duration of assessment used in our trial was appropriate for assessing the effects of 5HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist and excluding the late effects of chemotherapy, including docetaxel-induced diarrhea, which would confound the outcomes. Moreover, lifestyle and nutrition were well controlled in the first cycle of chemotherapy, which was administered in the hospital, compared with the second cycle of chemotherapy, which was administered through the ambulatory out-patient department. Second, an open-labeled, non-blinded design was unavoidable. However, this randomized controlled design minimized the effects of unknown confounding factors and we taught general self-care methods patients in both groups to minimize differences in expectancy between groups. Third, our study did not include clinician-reported outcomes in the analysis, such as those assessed by the CTCAE. Patient-reported outcomes were used due to their higher concordance with quality of life, compared to CTCAE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Fourth, the mean difference in CAS score between the intervention and control groups was relatively small. As the CAS uses a checklist for constipation symptoms, the overall scores tend to be lower; for instance, the score for morphine-induced severe constipation was 7.6/16. In general, 5 points on the CAS is indicative of severe constipation requiring medical intervention, compared to 0&#x02013;2 points indicating minor symptoms not requiring intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Hence, even a small difference (5 points on the CAS in the control group vs. 2 points on the CAS in the intervention group) would be significant in clinical situations.</p><p>A recent review reported that exercises or massage are effective to alleviate other types of constipation, although there was previously no evidence that a SM program could help mitigate 5HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist-induced constipation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Bidirectional brain-gut interactions involving 5-HT pathways are important in gastrointestinal functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Although psychological well-being may cause additional expectancy effects in patient-reported outcomes, it is difficult to fractionate constipation and psychological states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. According to a previous study, increases in physical activity or SM skills may stimulate physical functioning, such as the volume of stool, reduce the occurrence of severe depressive symptoms, and promote emotional well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This simple, effective, comfortable, and low-cost program for antiemetic-induced constipation may apply to other types of cancer patients or patients who suffer from other types of constipation, such as opioid-induced or chronic constipation.</p><p>In conclusion, for breast cancer patients who undergo chemotherapy and control nausea and vomiting using 5HT<sub>3</sub>&#x000a0;receptor antagonists, our program offers a precise method for managing abdominal discomfort. Future trials, with a long-term follow-up, a wider population range, and placebo-controlled design are needed to verify the longitudinal and general effect of this SM program.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec16"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="10549_2015_3652_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary material 1 (DOCX 144&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We gratefully acknowledge the help provided by Prof. T.
