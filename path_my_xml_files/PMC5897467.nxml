We included patients with at least one typical reflux symptom despite treatment with a PPI for &#x0003e; 6 months, pathologic esophageal acid exposure, hiatal hernia of size &#x0003c; 2&#x000a0;cm, and endoscopic Hill grade II&#x02013;III. Evaluation of Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI), symptom scores, esophageal manometry, and impedance-pH-monitoring were performed at baseline and at 3 months after surgery. (Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT 01798212.)</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were no intraoperative complications. Four out of forty patients experienced postoperative complications requiring intervention. Seven of forty patients were subjected to laparoscopic fundoplication 3 months after endoscopic plication due to persistent symptoms and were lost to further follow-up. Thirty out of forty patients were available at 3-month follow-up. There was an improvement of the GIQLI score, from a mean of 92.45&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;18.47 to 112.03&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;13.11 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001).

The primary alternative to chronic PPI medication is laparoscopic antireflux surgery (LARS). Although surgery generally results in excellent control of reflux symptoms in the long term, both surgeons and patients are frequently reluctant to proceed to select this option [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Indeed, LARS is associated with short- and long-term dysphagia, gas-bloat syndrome, and bowel dysfunction in a significant proportion of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Hence, there is a broad desire to develop less invasive techniques without the limitations of pharmacologic therapy and the risks of LARS.</p><p>Flexible endoscopic techniques have been evaluated as treatment alternatives in the past; however, several had to be withdrawn from the market because of lack of effectiveness or due to safety concerns. There are currently four devices available for endoscopic treatment of GERD: a transoral incisionless fundoplication device (EsophyX&#x000ae;, EndoGastric Solutions, Redmond, WA), a radiofrequency energy delivery system (Stretta&#x000ae;, Mederi Therapeutics, Inc., Greenwich, CT), the Ultrasonic Surgical Endostapler device (MUSE&#x02122;, Medigus, Omer, Israel), and GERDx&#x02122; (G-SURG GmbH, Seeon-Seebruck, Germany), a recently launched endoscopic plication device. The first short-term outcomes of GERDx&#x02122; suggest an improvement of objective reflux parameters and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The objective of the present report is to present the short follow-up of a larger prospective cohort of patients subjected to endoscopic plication with the GERDx&#x02122; device, aiming at assessing its safety and efficacy in terms of symptom control and functional parameters.</p><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population</title><p>From October 2012 to December 2016, 835 individuals with symptoms of chronic GERD were assessed for eligibility at the Department of General and Visceral Surgery, Ordensklinikum Linz Sisters of Charity Hospital in Linz (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

The GIQLI and symptom scores were calculated at baseline. Gastroscopy, high-resolution esophageal manometry, and 24-h pH-metry-impedance were performed before the intervention. The patients received a PPI treatment on daily basis for 2 weeks after plication. A gastroscopy was performed 6 weeks after the procedure and the GIQLI and symptom scores were calculated at 3-month follow-up, along with functional assessment through manometry and 24-h pH-metry-impedance.</p><p>The primary outcome measure was difference in the GIQLI after the intervention of at least 15 points.

</p><p>All procedures were performed under general anesthesia by the same surgical team with established experience in advanced endoscopic procedures. No peri-procedure antibiotics were given. A standard upper endoscopy was performed and a Savary-guidewire was placed upon gastroscope withdrawal. The GERDx&#x02122; device was introduced over the guidewire and into the stomach.</p><p>A 5.8-mm video endoscope (N-190 Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) was passed through the GERDx&#x02122; device. The distal end of the device was then retroflexed to the anterior gastric cardia approximately 1&#x000a0;cm below the gastroesophageal (GE) junction. The GERDx&#x02122; arms were opened, and an endoscopic tissue retractor was advanced deeply into the gastric cardia. The tissue retractor was drawn back to gather tissue between the open arms of the GERDx&#x02122; device. The arms were closed and a pre-tied transmural pledgeted suture was deployed. At the end of procedure, the GERDx&#x02122; device and the gastroscope were removed, and the gastroscope was re-inserted to evaluate the resulting plication.</p><p>According to study protocol, at least two pre-tied transmural pledgeted sutures were deployed.

This questionnaire has been validated in the German language and has been recommended for use by the European Study Group for Antireflux Surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The GIQLI is divided into 5 domains and 36 items: gastrointestinal symptoms (0&#x02013;76 points), physical functions (0&#x02013;28 points), emotional status (0&#x02013;20 points), social functions (0&#x02013;16 points), and a single item for stress of medical treatment (0&#x02013;4 points), for a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 144 points. Higher scores indicate a better quality of life. Information on daily or on-demand use of PPI or other antacid medication was obtained.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Symptom evaluation</title><p>Symptom evaluation was carried out in a standardized way using a written questionnaire assessing the severity and intensity of 14 symptoms in a 4-point scale (SCL). This questionnaire has been used previously in the context of GERD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Symptoms of heartburn, chest pain, regurgitation, hoarseness, cough, asthma, dysphagia, fullness, diarrhea, flatulence, constipation, belching, bloatedness, and distortion of taste are graded as none (0), once per week (1), several times per week (2), daily (3), and constantly (4). Intensity of the symptoms is graded as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3), and extremely severe (4). In order to obtain the ultimate result, the frequency of each symptom is multiplied by its degree, resulting in scores from 0 to 16 for each symptom, for a total maximum score of 224 and a minimum score of 0 points. Additionally, four different scores were extracted to assess symptoms specific for reflux (heartburn, regurgitation, chest pain), gas-bloat (fullness, bloatedness), bowel-dysfunction (diarrhea, constipation, flatulence), and atypical reflux symptoms (cough, hoarseness, asthma, distortion of taste). Symptoms of dysphagia and belching are evaluated separately.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>High-resolution esophageal manometry (HRM)</title><p>All patients were studied after an overnight fast in the supine position.

The suture had to be removed and the stomach oversewn and covered by a Dor fundoplication. 1 day postoperatively, the patient required placement of a chest tube, due to severe pleural effusion. 3 days later, a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and decortication of a pleural empyema had to be performed. During VATS, a pledget in the pleural cavity was found as presumable cause of symptoms. At 3-month follow-up, the patient had a normal result in 24-h pH-monitoring and did not show consequential damages. The second severe SAE was a Mallory-Weiss-lesion at the GE junction.

</p><p>There was no evidence of association of these adverse events with the learning curve, as the first 15 procedures were uneventful. Some adverse events (3 out of 6) and treatment failures (2 out of 6) might have been related however to a change of the suture material (2.0 monofilament non-absorbable suture to 0.0 braided non-absorbable suture) and suture length (6&#x02013;7.6&#x000a0;mm) introduced by the company. The interim review of these early SAEs resulted in a device change and the next nineteen patients were treated with the original suture material and length again, with only one subsequent SAE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Analysis without those 6 six patients showed no significant difference in objective and subjective measurements (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The technique of endoscopic full-thickness plication has shown to be well tolerated and seems to improve the acid exposure of the distal esophagus, GERD symptoms, as well as QoL, usually without serious adverse events (SAEs) after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Hence, there could be a future market for endoscopic full-thickness plication in well-selected patients.</p><p>The results of the reported trial with the new GERDx&#x02122; device seem to underline this hypothesis.</p><p>Endoscopic full-thickness plication with the GERDx&#x02122; device resulted in excellent symptom control in twenty-eight of thirty patients (93.3%). The amount of total reflux episodes, acid reflux episodes, and weakly acid reflux episodes decreased and a significant reduction of DeMeester score was found. However, only 60% of the patients experienced a normalization of DeMeester score, although all patients (100%) reported a better quality of life after surgery. The fact that not all of patients show a normalization of the distal acid exposure is something that the procedure shares with other endoscopic procedures like MUSE&#x02122; or Esophyx&#x02122; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Hill grade might be associated with treatment effect; however, we did not find significant difference between different grades, although this may be due to a type II error. Long-term data might elucidate this putative association.</p><p>Nevertheless, the significantly reduced rate of patients suffering from esophagitis after the procedure with the GERDx&#x02122; device (65&#x02013;20%) suggests an adequate control of esophageal acid exposure. Furthermore, only 10% of the patients needed a PPI treatment on daily basis and 26.7% on demand at 3-month follow-up, which is comparable to other endoscopic techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Similarly to previous studies endoscopic plication did not have a significant impact on manometric characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This is in accordance to the theoretical framework, suggesting that both the LES and the diaphragm contribute to gastroesophageal sphincter competence and the procedure does not induce structural changes to the esophageal hiatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>The results of our study show a significant improvement of patient&#x02019;s life quality assessed by the Gastrointestinal quality of life index (GIQLI) at 3-month follow-up, which is also comparable to procedures like MUSE&#x02122; or Esophyx&#x02122; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>These data illustrate that the procedure can relieve heartburn symptoms and provide an effective alternative to chronic PPI use. Furthermore, reflux-specific symptom scores, (typical reflux-, and atypical reflux symptom scores) significantly improved after endoscopic full-thickness plication, and the patients showed no side effects like bowel dysfunction, gas/bloating, or dysphagia.</p><p>In addition, the relatively low mean procedural time compared to other endoscopic procedures or laparoscopic fundoplication could be a benefit of the GERDx&#x02122; device, considering aspects of cost-effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Adverse events in this cohort might be related to the suture characteristics temporarily introduced by the company, as was previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Although the safety profile of the device requires further evaluation, current data suggest that endoscopic plication is a safe procedure in experienced hands. The protocol of this study required hospitalization and observation for all patients to ensure patient safety. However, the procedure of endoscopic full-thickness plication may eventually be performed in an outpatient setting as experience increases.</p><p>This is a single-arm study, which limits our confidence on treatment effect estimates. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to compare the outcome of patients treated with PPIs and patients undergoing endoscopic plication with the GERDx&#x02122; device. Paired analyses may provide robust results; however, they cannot eliminate the possibility of placebo effect.</p><p>Furthermore, power calculations were based on the primary outcome measure related to the quality of life. The 25% lost of follow-up-rate is a factor, which potentially affects the validity of the results and the study&#x02019;s power calculation. The study might be therefore not adequately powered to demonstrate significance in treatment outcomes for the secondary parameters. Longer duration follow-up is pending. However, the report of these early results is important since the device is commercially available.</p><p>The outcomes of this study must be observed in the context of the study population. We included only patients with hiatal hernia measuring &#x0003c; 2&#x000a0;cm and excluded individuals with Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus or esophageal motility disorders. We consider reasonable not to recommend this procedure to such patients until further studies assess its safety and efficacy. The learning curve of the procedure could be limiting factor for a widespread application, because high operator expertise is needed to achieve a good procedure outcome. It needs to be discussed, if a preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan to measure the hiatal surface area could be a screening option to increase the procedure outcome by the exclusion of unsuitable patients.</p><p>In conclusion, endoscopic full-thickness plication using the GERDx&#x02122; device improves the distal acid exposure of the esophagus, typical reflux-related symptoms and QoL in well-selected patients. This procedure might constitute an option for patients with mild GERD. Long-term outcomes are required to expand our knowledge on the effects of this procedure.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>Open access funding provided by Paracelsus Medical University.</p></ack><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Disclosures</title><p>Dr. Michael Weitzendorfer, Dr. Georg O.
