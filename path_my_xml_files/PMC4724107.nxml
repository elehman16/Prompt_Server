Multimodal analgesia can also result in reductions in the side effects and complications of analgesia, thereby improving patient safety. Preventive analgesia, treatment before initiation of the surgical procedure, has a potential to be more effective in reducing pain sensitization than treatment initiated after surgery. Multimodal analgesia that includes prophylactic administration of selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors can improve postoperative pain and reduce opioid analgesic consumption after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However COX-2 inhibitors are not approved for use as preventive analgesia in Japan.

Many methods have been used to manage pain after surgery, including various drugs, routes of drug administration and medication methods. Recently, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) has been more widely used because of its therapeutic effects and safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. PCA is a method of allowing a patient with pain to administer his own pain relief. The infusion is controlled by electronically pump, that delivers prescribed amount of analgesic when a patient press a button. Preventing a patient from overdosing analgesics, a dosage and interval of analgesics are programmed. Patients can self-administer drugs whenever they need analgesics, regardless of broad inter-individual differences in demands for analgesia, thus minimizing inter-individual differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.</p><p>Multimodal analgesia is achieved by combining different analgesics and different methods of administration, to provide superior pain relief synergistically compared with conventional analgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Moreover, rates of side effects and complications of analgesics are reduced with multimodal analgesia, improving patient safety. The updated 2012 American Society of Anesthesiologists practice guidelines for acute pain management during the perioperative period recommend multimodal techniques for perioperative pain management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Surgical noxious stimuli sensitize the nervous system to subsequent stimuli that could amplify pain. Preventive blocking of nociceptive stimuli to the central nervous system is beneficial in attenuating postoperative pain and in reducing the severity of postoperative pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Preventive analgesia is a concept for reducing this sensitization before the surgical procedure initiates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Preventive analgesia could be more effective than a similar analgesic treatment initiated after surgery. Surgical trauma induces cyclooxygenase (COX) expression and subsequent synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs), which sensitize peripheral nociceptors and cause nociceptive pain. Since non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can inhibit COX and inhibit the synthesis of PGs, NSAIDs are widely used to reduce postoperative hyperalgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Traditional NSAIDs inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2 isoenzymes. Celecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor shown to be as effective as traditional NSAIDs as an analgesic for acute postoperative pain. Celecoxib has fewer gastrointestinal side effects than traditional NSAIDs, such as loxoprofen, diclofenac and ibuprofen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Moreover, celecoxib has no effects on serum thromboxane and platelet functions, suggesting that it may be an effective postoperative analgesic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Studies have suggested that the administration of selective COX-2 inhibitors for preemptive, multimodal analgesia can improve postoperative pain and reduce the consumption of opioid analgesics after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In Japan, however, celecoxib, as well as other NSAIDs, has not been approved for use as preemptive analgesia, but only for postoperative analgesia. Assessing the effectiveness of COX-2 inhibitors as a constituent of multimodal analgesia during the early postoperative period is important to establish clinical practice guidelines.</p><p>This study was designed to assess the effects of celecoxib administration during the early postoperative period, along with multimodal analgesia, on postoperative pain management after TKA. We hypothesized that the administration of celecoxib immediately after TKA surgery would provide superior postoperative analgesia compared with delayed administration. Our aim is to compare patient-reported visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores, opioid consumption, range of knee motion, sleep quality, rates of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and rescue analgesic consumption in patients who do and do not receive COX-2 inhibitors, as well as to compare overall evaluations by patients and physicians.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This study is a single-center, randomized, prospective, open-label controlled trial, performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the ethics committee of the Tsukuba University Hospital Mito Clinical Education and Training Center, Mito Kyodo General Hospital, University of Tsukuba.

The minimal clinical significance in VAS pain score was defined as the mean difference between current and preceding scores when the subject reported &#x0201c;a little worse&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;a little better&#x0201d; pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

The secondary outcomes including the pain-medication use, adverse reactions, VAS pain scores, range of motion of knee joint, sleep quality, patient satisfaction, and overall evaluation by physicians after surgery will be analyzed by ANOVA or Chi square test. Nonparametric tests may be used for continuous variables if they are not normally distributed. Between-group comparisons of treatment effect for primary and secondary outcomes, except for pain-medication use and adverse events, will also be conducted with the use of a mixed-effects model, with patient as a random effect and time of assessment (baseline and follow-up days), study group, and baseline values of the outcome as fixed effects.</p><p>Significance will be set as <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05. All statistical analyses will be performed by using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>To achieve less postoperative pain, better patient satisfaction, and better rehabilitation after surgery, pain management is very important. Multimodal analgesia for pain management after surgery has been shown effective in controlling postoperative pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Previously, prophylactic administration of a COX-2 inhibitor, as a multimodal analgesia, has been found to reduce postoperative VAS pain score, opioid analgesic consumption, and active ROM of the knee after TKA surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In these studies, a COX-2 inhibitor is administered before surgery.</p><p>COX-2 inhibitors and other NSAIDs have only been approved as postoperative, but not as preemptive, analgesia in Japan. In addition, an appropriate fasting period to empty the stomach prior to anesthesia is essential for patient safety, because the risk of inhaling stomach contents into the lungs is reduced. Thus, to verify the effectiveness of administration of a COX-2 inhibitor during the early postoperative period as part of multimodal analgesia, it is necessary to establish clinical practice guidelines. In addition, this method of administration is safe, convenient and general-purpose way in practice. To date, however, no comparative data are available.</p><p>This randomized controlled trial design will be used to address the hypothesis, that immediate administration of oral celecoxib after TKA surgery provides superior postoperative analgesia when compared with delayed administration.</p><p>The primary outcome of this study is to evaluate the effects of celecoxib administration immediately after surgery on postoperative pain after TKA. Possible benefits of celecoxib include its ease of administration, safety after surgery, its effectiveness and reduction of postoperative opioid consumption. Thus, this study might to identify the influence of immediate administration of oral celecoxib after TKA surgery. This will help to provide clinical management status for patients with TKA surgery.</p><p>Opioid consumption for the secondary outcomes will be determined. Opioid is useful and effective for postsurgical pain control. However, the incidence rates of postoperative nausea and vomiting as its side effects could be increased with large amounts of opioid. By taking medicine for pain relief after the early post-operative period, opioid consumption and its side effects could be reduced. As its other expectations, pain relief after surgery might improve the quality of sleep. When postoperative pain is reduced, the range of knee motion with accelerated physical recovery might be improved. Pain relief, good quality of sleep and early functional recovery could improve satisfaction of patients. These will be very important to establish clinical practice guidelines.</p><p>The limitation of this study is an open label. However our data will come from patient-reported outcomes and participants will not be affected by any other. Patient&#x02013;reported outcome will help to understand practical patients&#x02019; condition. Therefore, we believe that this study will provide some insight into perioperative multimodal analgesia, which helps to improve perioperative clinical practice.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Clinical relevance and importance</title><p>This randomized controlled trial will help to provide insight to optimize perioperative pain management strategies by evaluating the effect of immediately postoperative administration of analgesics for patient after TKA surgery. These results could improve clinical practice for perioperative pain management and also might help to improve patient satisfaction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Trial status</title><p>Patient recruitment started in October 2014.
