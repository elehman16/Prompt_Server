The intervention was based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). It comprised of practice-based education with up to two additional contacts to increase the importance of screening to GP staff and their confidence to offer tests through skill development (including videos). Practical resources (targets, posters, invitation cards, computer reminders, newsletters including feedback) aimed to actively influence social cognitions of staff, increasing their testing intention.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Data from 76 intervention and 81 control practices were analysed. In intervention practices, chlamydia screening test rates were 2.43/100 15&#x02013;24-year-olds registered preintervention, 4.34 during intervention and 3.46 postintervention; controls testing rates were 2.61/100 registered patients prior intervention, 3.0 during intervention and 2.82 postintervention. During the intervention period, testing in intervention practices was 1.76 times as great (CI 1.24 to 2.48) as controls; this persisted for 9&#x02005;months postintervention (1.57 times as great, CI 1.27 to 2.30). Chlamydia infections detected increased in intervention practices from 2.1/1000 registered 15&#x02013;24-year-olds prior intervention to 2.5 during the intervention compared with 2.0 and 2.3/1000 in controls (Estimated Rate Ratio intervention versus controls 1.4 (CI 1.01 to 1.93).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This complex intervention doubled chlamydia screening tests in fully engaged practices. The modified Zelen design gave realistic measures of practice full engagement (63%) and efficacy of this educational intervention in general practice; it should be used more often.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>The trial was registered on the UK Clinical Research Network Study Portfolio database.

The absolute increase in testing across all intervention practices was small increasing from 2.43 to 4.34/100 15&#x02013;24-year-old patients registered. However, these results include those practices that did not accept any visits (17%) from the chlamydia support worker or did not use all components of the intervention offered. The 62% of practices that agreed to three contacts with the support worker attained a 2.33 times relative increase in chlamydia testing.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Strengths</title><p>The greatest strength of our study was the modified Zelen design, which allowed us to deliver a &#x02018;real life&#x02019; evaluation, in which all practices were invited to participate rather than research active practices or those enthusiastic about sexual health. The 62% uptake of three contacts and overall results are likely to be similar if the intervention was used in other areas with similar primary care resources. The modified Zelen design is particularly useful for the pragmatic evaluation of educational interventions <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> as participants can accept or decline components of the intervention as they would in routine practice because participants are unaware they are in a trial and so do not modify their behaviour on that account. The design was feasible as the primary outcome was measured using routinely generated NCSP data and consent for practices to take part was given on their behalf by PCT public and locally respected sexual health leads. After data collection was complete, all practices received a letter about the design and consent; no practices expressed any concerns.</p><p>A further strength was TPB-driven intervention design whereby components (see Web only annex 3) addressed personal attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural controls. Further, our results demonstrate the importance of engaging general practices in all parts of such an intervention, as those practices that only partially engaged or did not use posters, invitation cards or computer prompts, had non-significant increases in testing. Those practices that agreed to three contacts with the support worker, demonstrating a positive personal attitude and practice attitude (subjective norm) to chlamydia testing, had a greater increase in screening. These three contacts also allowed the support worker to discuss testing rates against targets set at the initial workshop; targets influence both personal attitudes and subjective norms. Posters and invitation cards had a significant effect on testing rates and addressed all components of the TPB, normalising screening within the practice and increasing awareness, and acted as prompts for testing invitations for patients, which was demonstrated in the workshop videos. Behavioural controls, including lack of time and forgetfulness, were addressed with the computer prompts used by 45%.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Limitations</title><p>Because of the modified Zelen design we could not make practices use all the components of the TPB; however, our per-protocol analysis allowed us to explore the importance of individual components. Computer reminders were used by 45% of the intervention practices, and therefore, the intention-to-treat analysis for this component is probably valid; however, as all of the 62% fully engaged practices also used posters and testing invitation cards, it is not possible to determine the independent effect of these latter components. GP practices were not asked to deliver chlamydia results or undertake contact tracing. Although NCSP coordinators knew about the study, they were asked not to discuss it and did not know which practices were randomised but awareness may have motivated them to increase their practice support.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>How our work fits in</title><p>A systematic review has shown that a multifaceted workshop approach addressing barriers to screening is more effective than single-component interventions.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Several studies have demonstrated that the long-term support is pivotal to increase testing by maintaining the importance of chlamydia testing (addressing personal attitudes) and for it to become normal practice (a subjective norm). This approach was successfully used both in an American adolescent clinic<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> in which clinicians participated in a four-stage clinical improvement initiative with monthly visits and in two London PCTs where workshops were given with long-term support.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In contrast, a single outreach interactive workshop with several practices together<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> led to a lower increase in testing rates.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Changing the subjective norms at the practice and area level are both important. Our initiative involved single practices across a wide area, and so, they had little influence from peers outside their practice, but the London intervention involved all practices in just two PCTs and gave testing feedback; <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> this localisation of the intervention may have had greater influence on subjective norms and motivated practices to increase tests.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The London intervention continued support for 3&#x02005;years (compared with only 1&#x02005;year in our study) allowing a longer period for testing behaviour change.</p><p>Another reason for the greater absolute increase in testing rates in the London study may have been the financial incentives offered.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Systematic reviews show that financial incentives for providing a prespecified level of healthcare activity are generally effective.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Financial incentives used to encourage chlamydia testing will strongly influence personal attitude and practice subjective norms, but have been shown to be ineffective in isolation<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> or to have a short-term effect<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> as they are unlikely to influence long-term attitudes about the importance of testing unless combined with other interventions, as in Kalwij's initiative.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> We also saw a temporary increase in testing prior to April 2009, 2010 and 2011 (see Web only figure 3), as practices sought to reach local targets.</p><p>Our intervention included a website containing all the presentations, materials and testing rates already provided in direct practice feedback. However, few GP staff in our study reported using it, indicating this was not a key part of the intervention. The need for direct contact with practices is reinforced by the lack of effectiveness of an internet-based intervention based on cognitive theory.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>GP staff considered that giving them the skills and confidence to offer chlamydia tests (overcoming one of the perceived behavioural controls) was an important part of the intervention; this was attained through video clips showing clinicians how to offer chlamydia testing in different consultations. This approach cannot be used in isolation as shown in a Belgian GP study, in which a package using commented video footage on communication skills increased appropriate testing but had no effect on overall testing rates.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>A Cochrane review found that computer reminders achieved a median improvement in targeted behaviour of 4.2%,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> but as the range of change was wide, they suggested further research to identify other factors consistently associated with larger improvements.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Integration of computer alerts to remind Australian clinicians to screen increased chlamydia testing by 30%.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Practices that incorporated computer prompts within our intervention had the greatest increase in testing rates and this was maintained beyond the end of the intervention. We consider this is a very cost-effective way of increasing testing but should not be used in isolation as GP staff may ignore alerts unless education also increases their belief in testing.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Implications of this research nationally and for commissioners</title><p>Our study and the London service evaluation demonstrate that a workshop approach with materials and long-term support will work and is feasible. Although the absolute increase in testing was small, it is important, as other interventions across the NCSP have generally not been able to produce a sustained increase in GP screening and an associated rise in positive tests. We recommend the NCSP and primary care commissioners consider using this intervention more widely in England and other countries with similar primary care services. Our analysis indicates that use of all parts of the intervention that influence different parts of the TPB components and ongoing support are important to attain the greatest increase in chlamydia screening tests. Our modified Zelen design should be considered more often in educational and public health research as it gives a much more realistic indication of take-up of the education and outcomes.
