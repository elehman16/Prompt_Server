Some observational studies and short-term intervention studies suggest that a food pattern mimicking the diet with which humans evolved positively influences glucose control and associated endocrine systems. Such a food pattern mainly differs from other common healthy food patterns in its absence of cereal grains and dairy products. The primary aim of this pilot study is to determine the effect of two healthy diets with or without cereal grains and dairy products on glucose control, while keeping participants&#x02019; weight stable and other food parameters, such as macro/micronutrient composition, dietary fiber and glycemic load, the same in both diets.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>We intend to include 15 adult patients with a medical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus with or without medication and with an increased waist circumference (&#x02265; 80&#x000a0;cm for women and&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;94&#x000a0;cm for men) in a random-order cross-over diet intervention study during two periods of four-weeks separated by a six-week washout period. Patients will be instructed to eat two healthy diets according to official dietary guidelines with respect to macro/micronutrient composition and fiber content, but differing in the type of food included, with one diet being without cereal grains and dairy products. Lunch will be served in a hospital kitchen for control of nutrient intake, while the rest of the meals will be eaten at home according to specific directions. The energy content of the diets will be individually adjusted to maintain a stable body weight during the two four-week intervention periods. Primary outcomes will be change in fasting plasma glucagon and fructosamine, while secondary outcomes include change in fasting glucose and glycated hemoglobin, glucose and glucagon response during oral glucose tolerance test, blood lipids, blood pressure, C-reactive protein, body composition, quality of life, subjective experience with the two diets, satiety scores and changes in medication.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Using these results, we will assess the need to conduct larger and longer studies with similar design.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01891955">NCT01891955</ext-link> and Spanish Agency of Medication and Sanitary Products (AEMPS) registration code: MFV-ADI-2013-01.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Protocol</kwd><kwd>Random-order cross-over trial</kwd><kwd>Type 2 diabetes mellitus</kwd><kwd>Metabolic diseases</kwd><kwd>Dietary intervention</kwd><kwd>Grain-free diet</kwd><kwd>Dairy-free diet</kwd><kwd>Glucagon</kwd><kwd>Fructosamine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has increased dramatically (more than doubled) since 1980, with a global prevalence of 9.8% and 9.25% for men and women, respectively, and affecting 347 million adults in 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In Europe, the prevalence of T2DM is estimated to be 8.1% of the adult population, affecting 52.8 million people in 2011. The estimated prevalence of T2DM for 2030 is 9.5% of the adult population affecting 64.2 million people. T2DM accounts for 85 to 90% of all cases of diabetes mellitus.</p><p>T2DM is one of the world&#x02019;s most important causes of mortality, disability and economic cost due to the associated increase in the risk of micro- [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and macrovascular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] complications. T2DM caused 282,400 and 317,000 deaths in 2011, for men and women, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Estimates indicate that at least USD 131 million were spent in Europe due to T2DM in 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In 2003, the prevalence of T2DM in the archipelago of Canary Islands (Spain) was estimated to be 12% of the population with an economic cost of &#x020ac;38.8 million, which accounts for 2.1% of all the health costs of the Canary Islands&#x02019; Government [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, micro- and macrovascular complications, including end-stage renal disease, are four to five times higher than in the rest of Spain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), lifestyle intervention reduces the incidence of T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], even when compared with insulin sensitizing medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In a study from primary health care in Stockholm, more cardiovascular risk factors were improved after an exercise intervention in people with normal glucose tolerance compared with those with IGT or T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, in these studies the separate effect of exercise versus diet could not be elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Data from systematic reviews regarding the role of food in the prevention and treatment of T2DM indicates that there are some uncertainties with respect to the optimal dietary intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and results from one large interventional dietary study suggest that targeting macronutrient composition by lowering total fat intake and increasing carbohydrate intake from whole grains, may have detrimental effects in women with pre-existing T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A recent intensive diet and exercise program in patients with T2DM was stopped because the intervention did not reduce cardiovascular risk, despite significant weight loss at four years, compared to the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Research on the role of nutrition in T2DM has largely focused on macro/micronutrient composition and fiber intake, while fewer studies have tested the more direct endocrine effects of food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that low-carbohydrate, low-glycemic index, Mediterranean and high-protein diets may be effective in improving cardiovascular disease risk and diabetes management compared to control diets, with no significant difference effect between the different interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Also, the effect of weight loss over macronutrient composition precludes drawing a definitive conclusion derived from this meta-analysis.</p><p>Theoretically, dietary interventions can improve glucagon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and leptin physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Thus, we speculate that the possible effects of the diets in the ADILAN study could be mediated, in part, by improving the action of those hormones.</p><p>Some observational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and two short-term intervention trials from our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] suggest that a food pattern mimicking the diet with which humans evolved, may be an optimal approach for patients with T2DM. Importantly, the short-term trials compared the experimental approach to the recommended dietary treatment in each case, namely the Mediterranean diet for patients with ischemic heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and the American Diabetes Association diet for patients with T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], respectively. In both trials, the experimental approach resulted in better outcomes than in the control diet. A noteworthy finding in those dietary trials is the significant difference in reported macronutrient composition between interventions and controls, specifically, higher energy percentage intake for protein and fat (except in Lindeberg <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] for fat), and lower energy percentage intake for carbohydrate in the experimental versus the control diet, taking into account that the intervention diet was not fixed to any dietary macronutrient ratio. Dietary glycemic load (GL) was also significantly lower.</p><p>Notwithstanding these findings, the beneficial effects shown in the experimental diets in both trials are not fully explained by macronutrient composition or GL after further statistical analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We concluded that food choice, rather than micro-and macronutrient composition, may have been the most important factor leading to the beneficial effects observed. In a recent meta-analysis comparing Mediterranean diets to alternative dietary strategies, the authors stated that the paleolithic diet (a healthy diet without grains and dairy) in the study by Lindeberg <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] demonstrated the most positive effect on fasting blood glucose of all the studies included in the meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><sec><title>The Alimentation and Diabetes in Lanzarote (ADILAN) study</title><p>The major aim of the ADILAN study is to test the direct endocrine effect of food items beyond macro/micronutrient composition, fiber content and glycemic load of the diet. For this purpose, we will try to avoid weight loss in an attempt to isolate the effect of food, as weight loss could have been a confounding factor in the previous studies. Our objective is to run a pilot intervention for a later long-term study with a representative sample in patients with T2DM. The working hypothesis is that food choice rather than macro/micronutrient composition, fiber intake, or GL, is a major determinant for the prevention and treatment of T2DM. Hypothetically, the foods that composed the diet during most of the time of <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>&#x02019; evolution, may be the optimal dietary approach for the prevention and treatment of T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>We aim to enroll 15 participants with T2DM, males and females, &#x0003e; 18 years old based, on the power calculations (see below) estimation of a required minimum of 13 patients, allowing for one or two drop-outs.

We are in collaboration with the <italic>Asociaci&#x000f3;n de Diab&#x000e9;ticos de Lanzarote</italic> (ADILA), a local organization, whose aim is helping patients to deal with the consequences of type 1 diabetes and T2DM. Data from 1996 estimated the prevalence of T2DM in Lanzarote to be 6.6% of the population aged between 15 and 75 years old, with an absolute number of 4,067 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. ADILA will contact the potential participants registered in their database by telephone, Email and advertisement in the association&#x02019;s bulletin board. In addition, we will advertise the study in the local newspapers, radio and in some institutional websites on the island of Lanzarote. Patients interested in participating in the study will receive general oral and/or written information about the study. They will be informed that our objective is to compare two healthy diets because we do not know which, if any, is the better one. If a person is interested, we will register their name and telephone number for further contact. After recruiting 15 potential participants, a meeting will be arranged to provide further details about the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Eligibility</title><p>We will include adults (&#x0003e; 18 years old), males and females, with a medical diagnosis of T2DM and increased waist circumference (&#x02265; 80&#x000a0;cm for women and&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;94&#x000a0;cm for men), with or without medication (including insulin treatment), with stable weight for three months prior to the start of study, who have received no change in dose of beta blocker or thyroxine for three months prior to the start of study, and no anticoagulant or oral steroid treatment.

Later, participants who meet the inclusion criteria will be notified about their final inclusion in the trial and reminded how to perform the four-day weighed food record and satiety score. Participants will borrow an electronic weighing scale with tare function and will be provided with enough sheets for the four-day weighed food record and satiety score. Five to seven days later, they will return the food records. The baseline four-day food record will yield information about the pre-study food choices and nutritional composition. The four-day food record and satiety score will be carried out at the start and end of each intervention period. After receiving the first food records, participants will be appointed for the first laboratory tests and intervention allocation. Based on total energy expenditure, as estimated by a bio-electrical impedance analyzer model BC-545 (Tanita Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), we will provide each participant with a menu plan with the approximate energy intake to avoid changes in body weight.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Four-day weighed food record and satiety score sheet.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-15-2-1"/></fig><p>Regarding insulin titration, the participant&#x02019;s physician will handle insulin titration as needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>The study participants will be randomly allocated to start with either diet A or diet B.

In order to detect, with 80% power and at a significance level of 5%, a 26&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L larger reduction in fructosamine after diet B than after diet A, 12 subjects are estimated to be required. For a 37&#x000a0;ng/L difference in change in fasting glucagon between the diets, 13 subjects are estimated to be required.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention is based on two diets: a) healthy diet A (healthy diet with cereal grains and dairy products), and b) healthy diet B (healthy diet without cereal grains and dairy products). After randomization, there will be no blinding to dietary assignment for study participants, nor for those administering the interventions or assessing the outcomes. Following randomization, all subjects will receive oral and written information about their respective initial dietary intervention. Owing to the fact that all participants in both groups will start the intervention at the same time, information about the specific intervention will be provided in group sessions, one for each group before the study starts. Prior to the beginning of the second dietary period, participants will be instructed about the new dietary intervention, in group sessions. Each session will last one hour and will be performed in the meeting room at the Hospital Insular de Lanzarote after the laboratory tests. The degree of behavioral support will be the same in both interventions in order to minimize differences in motivation. Written information with dietary advice, a seven-day menu plan and food recipes are similarly formulated for both diets. The rationale behind the higher intake of whole grains, dairy and legumes in healthy diet A is based on the possible beneficial effect of those foods in the treatment of T2DM in some studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], and their prominent position in Spanish dietary guidelines for patients with T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The rationale behind the exclusion of grains, dairy and legumes in healthy diet B is based on the observed positive effects in some previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Written information consists of a detailed seven-day meal plan with five meals per day and corresponding recipes (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Participants will be requested to follow the menu plan as much as possible when eating away from home. They will be requested to report (in as much detail as possible, the ingredients) any meal taken which differs from what is stipulated in the menu plan. In that case, they will be encouraged to photograph the meal, and send it to one of the investigators, whenever possible.</p><p>Advice about regular physical activity will be given equally to all subjects. Specifically, they will be recommended not to change their current physical activity during the whole trial.</p><p>One of the objectives of the study is to avoid weight loss during the intervention. In order to accomplish this objective, participants will be weighed once a week in order to check for weight stability. If any participant loses&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;kg compared to baseline, a new meeting will be arranged for that person to adjust his/her meal plan. We have created different versions for both menu plans in order to provide different amounts of energy per day; specifically 1,500, 1,800, 2,000, 2,200, 2,500 and 2,800&#x000a0;kcal/day. All the different menu versions maintain the same macronutrient composition. Depending on body weight as measured every week, each participant will be reassigned to another (with higher or lower energy) menu plan if their body weight changes by&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;kg. The meals will be taken to the lunch room in two trolleys marked with menu A or B, respectively. Each trolley will contain the trays labeled with the participant&#x02019;s name. Finally, the lunch room will be separated in two areas for menu A and B, respectively.</p><sec><title>Improving patients adherence to the meal plan</title><p>Despite the notion that a healthy diet can improve glucose control, adherence to dietary advice is generally poor among patients with T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Moreover, the particular dietary design of this trial could increase the risk of nonadherence. In order to minimize this risk, several strategies will be adopted. To facilitate the participants eating the same approximate amount of equivalent food in every meal (expressed in grams in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>), we will supply a table of equivalence. For example, 56 grams of tinned tuna equates to a small tin of tuna and 20 grams of bread corresponds to a slice of bread. Similarly, food items such as eggs or fruits will be listed as small, medium or large. In the case of more elaborated dishes, such as stewed meat, baked tubers, soups, or creams, we will provide the participants with detailed recipe directions corresponding to four servings, so as to facilitate the task in the family context. On the first day of each intervention, the investigators will review all the assigned meals, together with the participants and their partners, to make sure that the directions are understandable and easy to follow. Previous to starting the study, subjects not included in the trial will test the meals in order to elaborate a meal plan that is understandable and easy. We will ask the participants to call one of the investigators if they have any questions regarding the meal plan. Besides this, one of the investigators will meet the participants in the lunch room at the beginning of each week to give behavioral support. Furthermore, an assistant will be present on a daily basis in the lunch room to ensure that the meals are served as planned. Also, the assistant will be asked everyday to inquire whether the participants have any difficulties following the meal plans.</p></sec><sec><title>Healthy diet A</title><p>Healthy diet A will include fruit, vegetables, fish, shellfish, lean meat, nuts, eggs, olive oil and substantial amounts of whole grains, low-fat dairy products and legumes.

Healthy diet B is termed &#x02018;healthy diet without cereal grains and dairy products&#x02019;. Salt intake will be lower in healthy diet B.

Therefore, we generated two different seven-day meal patterns where macro/micronutrient composition and fiber intake are similar. GL is also similar between both seven-day meal patterns. Furthermore, we aim at creating two healthy food patterns, according to official nutritional guidelines in Canary Islands, utilizing a validated nutritional software package (DIAL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The nutritional composition of the menu plan was analyzed using another validated nutritional software (Dietist XP 3.1; Kost och N&#x000e4;ringsdata AB, Bromma, Sweden) to check for possible errors. Minimal differences were observed in the results from both programs. The distribution of macronutrient energy of diets is 19% protein, 28% fat and 53% carbohydrate, and 18% protein, 28% fat, and 53% carbohydrate for healthy diet A and healthy diet B, respectively. The amount of fiber per 2,000&#x000a0;kcal is approximately 48.5&#x000a0;g and 53.1&#x000a0;g in healthy diet A and healthy diet B, respectively. The GL per 2,000&#x000a0;kcal is 116 and 118 in healthy diet A and healthy diet B, respectively. Regarding micronutrient intake, significant differences between the two diets can be seen in Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. Importantly, and because one goal of the ADILAN trial is to avoid weight loss, dried fruits were regularly included instead of fresh fruits, in healthy diet B, to match the total weight of food between the two food patterns. Two recent studies have shown that substituting cereal grains for fruits and vegetables increases satiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], and therefore it may be challenging for the participants to avoid weight loss while adhering to healthy diet B.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation</title><p>Before and after each intervention period, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) will be performed in the morning after obtaining venous blood samples in the fasting state, and measurements of blood pressure, height (only at the start of intervention 1), weight, waist and hip circumference, sagittal abdominal diameter, triceps, biceps, suprailiac and subscapular skinfolds, at the start and end of both intervention periods will also be taken. The participants will ingest 75 grams of glucose and blood samples will be drawn for glucose and glucagon at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes. Areas under the curve (AUC) for plasma glucose (AUC glucose) and glucagon (AUC glucagon) will be calculated. Of great consequence, and for safety reasons, we will assess capillary glucose, using a glucometer, before performing the OGTT.

The ADILAN study aims at comparing the effects of two healthy diets on the control of blood glucose, with no significant differences in macro/micronutrient composition, dietary fiber and GL, only different food choice. Importantly, we will try to eliminate weight loss as a confounding factor.</p><p>Of paramount importance, the nutritional software package (DIAL) used to create the seven-day menu plan generates a &#x02018;Healthy Alimentation Index&#x02019; that classifies both diets as &#x02018;very healthy&#x02019;. Due to its specific design, constructed on evolutionary principles, the grain/dairy-free diet scored zero in two items, &#x02018;Cereals and legumes&#x02019; and &#x02018;Dairy&#x02019;, but in spite of this, it was classified as very healthy owing to the fact that it scored the maximum (except for &#x02018;Variety of foods with a score of 7/10) in the rest of items&#x02019;, namely &#x02018;Vegetables&#x02019;, &#x02018;Fruits&#x02019;, &#x02018;Meat, Fish and Eggs&#x02019;, &#x02018;Energy derived from fat&#x02019;, &#x02018;Energy derived from saturated fats&#x02019;, &#x02018;Cholesterol&#x02019;, &#x02018;Dietary sodium&#x02019; and &#x02018;Variety of foods&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. It can be concluded that the ADILAN study will compare two healthy diets which are similar in macro/micronutrient composition, fiber intake and GL, for the treatment of T2DM but differing in the intake of cereal grains, legumes and dairy products.</p><p>The ADILAN study could serve as a pilot study to run long-term dietary intervention trials in the future, focusing on food choice, which could shed light on a better dietary approach for prevention and treatment of T2DM.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>The ADILAN study is currently under recruitment process at 22 October 2013.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>A1c: Glycated hemoglobin; ADILA: Asociaci&#x000f3;n de Diab&#x000e9;ticos de Lanzarote; ADILAN: Alimentation and Diabetes in Lanzarote; AUC: Area under curve; GL: Glycemic load; IGT: Impaired glucose tolerance; MONICA: World Health Organization&#x02019;s Multinational Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease protocol; OGTT: Oral glucose tolerance test; REDCap&#x000ae;: Research Electronic Data Capture; T2DM: Type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>MFV designed the study, created the meal plans, arranged and participated in meetings with the hospital staff, worked in the web application for data capture, was responsible for obtaining funding for the study, performed the statistical analysis and wrote the manuscript.
