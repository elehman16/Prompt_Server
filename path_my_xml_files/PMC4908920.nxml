CrF is a persistent, subjective sense of physical, emotional and/or cognitive tiredness related to cancer or cancer treatment.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> It is not proportional to recent activity, and interferes with usual functioning.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> It impacts the physical, emotional and/or cognitive functioning of the survivor. Guidelines recommend that if there is no evidence of a somatic condition causing the fatigue, behavioural interventions should also be considered.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> There is no recommended standard non-pharmacological treatment of CrF in those with cancer,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> highlighting a need for effective and accessible treatments.</p><p>CrF persists for months and even years following completion of treatment in about one-third of those with cancer.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Fatigue that persists for 3&#x02005;months or longer after cancer treatment completion is unlikely to decrease of its own accord.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The causes of fatigue after cancer is unclear.</p><p>Theoretical models that aim to explain contributory factors that initiate and sustain fatigue symptoms, or that influence the efficacy of interventions for CrF require testing.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In a Cochrane review of psychosocial interventions for reducing fatigue during cancer treatment, the effectiveness of interventions specifically designed for fatigue was significantly higher compared with interventions not specifically for fatigue.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Bradbury <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> note that deductive approaches (including reviews of the existing literature) are useful to ascertain what is already known about changing a behaviour and inform intervention design. A systematic review of the literature<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> revealed that the most commonly used intervention strategies were cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy (CBT), mindfulness-based interventions and psychoeducation. No single intervention type emerged as superior in this review, and a decision was made to base the current intervention on CBT. This decision was based on the quality and quantity of existing literature, as well as clinical expertise. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has published guidance on supporting patients with CrF following treatment. Recommendations include the use of CBT.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> CBT is also recommended by the American Cancer Society/American Society of Clinical Oncology Breast Cancer Survivorship Care Guidelines.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>In line with the person-centred approach developed by Yardley <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> qualitative focus group research was carried out to explore the experience of CrF in post-treatment cancer survivors. Four focus groups were held with 18 cancer survivors who reported &#x02018;significant fatigue or reduced energy&#x02019;. A theoretical thematic analysis indicated that the participants' descriptions mapped onto the self-regulation model (SRM) of health and illness.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This theory proposes that the representation of a symptom, such as fatigue, involves a cognitive pathway (ie, the creation of a knowledge-based conceptualisation of CrF) and an emotional pathway (ie, emotional response to CrF). Coping behaviours are guided by the representations of the symptom.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> This is an iterative feedback process of appraising coping efforts and representations of the problem, leading to further coping attempts. The study demonstrated the complexity of the individuals' meaning-making processes, and identified specific factors that were important issues for those with CrF. Participants did not always understand unexpected persistent fatigue after cancer and were left confused, isolated and frustrated as a result. This qualitative research indicated that the SRM could be applied to CrF in post-treatment cancer survivors, and provides a theoretical framework for understanding individuals' representations and coping strategies, and thus identifying targets for intervention.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The intervention will incorporate Leventhal's self-regulation theory as a framework for conceptualising the process of adjustment.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>A CBT model of fatigue<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> was used to apply SRM theory in a treatment model. CBT models focus on similar cognitive, emotional and coping/behavioural factors like those outlined by Leventhal <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Andrykowski <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> proposed that biological insults such as the cancer or its treatment may precipitate the initial experience of fatigue during cancer, whereas a cognitive&#x02013;behavioural model of fatigue may predict the persistence of fatigue in survivorship. Using the SRM to describe fatigue after cancer provides an integrated theoretical model for developing interventions for fatigue based on cognitive&#x02013;behavioural principles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016011485F1">figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2016011485F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>From theory to practice: applying the self-regulation model to a cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy treatment model.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2016011485f01"/></fig><p>As CrF is a multidimensional and complex symptom,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> an intervention mode that can incorporate multiple and complex behaviour change techniques (BCTs) was required.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Chou <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> encourage using internet to better serve survivors' needs as it is increasingly being used as a resource by cancer survivors.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Online interventions have been found to be at least as effective as face-to-face therapies for a wide range of issues.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> This mode of delivery affords the opportunity to reach a wider range of patients compared with face-to-face interventions, especially severely fatigued patients or those with limited mobility. Although online interventions for fatigue after cancer have been tested elsewhere (eg, the RESTORE trial in the UK),<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> little research has been conducted in regions that do not offer free universal healthcare. Owing to the lack of universal healthcare provision in Ireland, many individuals pay at the point of delivery.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The cost of seeking care (reported in most cases to be &#x020ac;50 per visit) may be a deterrent to seeking primary care.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The perceived &#x02018;need&#x02019; of treatment for fatigue may influence an individual's willingness to pay for a general practitioner (GP) consultation.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>Many fatigued individuals do not discuss their symptoms as they perceive fatigue as an untreatable symptom to be endured as a normal part of cancer.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Many also believe that interventions for fatigue are not available, and cite this as a barrier to opening a conversation about CrF.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>The home-based setting of an online intervention may be particularly beneficial to Irish participants, given reported inequity in care provision.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Some survivors report wanting to move on with their lives, and no longer to identify as a patient with cancer.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Therefore, the anonymity and privacy of an online program may be appealing. Participants can practice and incorporate new skills more readily into their daily lives when the intervention is incorporated into their current routine.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>

<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> while applying a novel theoretical approach that addresses both individuals' understanding of and coping with CrF. The &#x02018;Health Navigation&#x02019; trial by Yun <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> incorporated the transtheoretic model of health behaviour change and social cognitive theory, as well as CBT. However, this trial did not assess the theoretical framework that was applied. Therefore, the mechanisms of the intervention are unclear. The current study will employ Roth and Pilling's<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> competence framework for CBT for those with persistent physical health conditions. Adjustment to fatigue will be a primary focus of the intervention, with cognitive, behavioural, affective and social responses being addressed.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> This evidence-based online program is the first intervention of its kind based on the SRM, with the primary aim of targeting the representations of fatigue and enhancing self-management of CrF speci&#x0fb01;cally.
