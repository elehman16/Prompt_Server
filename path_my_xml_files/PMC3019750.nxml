The results reveal that the wear of blocks submitted to saliva (&#x02212;0.0016) was similar to the wear of blocks submitted to saliva associated with fluoride (&#x02212;0.0074) (P=0.6196).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Most investigations of the wear caused by professional methods for dental plaque removal have an <italic>in vitro</italic> design 18&#x02013;20 and do not consider the protective properties of the oral environment, mainly related to the action of saliva. The <italic>in situ</italic> models suggested by Kolourides et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-dent05_p0040">24</xref> for investigations on dental caries present great advantages compared to laboratory studies. The <italic>in situ</italic> model may simulate intraoral events and simultaneously standardize the experimental conditions; at a short time period, they allow for the development of enamel alterations or recovery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-dent05_p0040">25</xref></p><p>Bovine incisors was used in this study because they have been widely used in dental research,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-dent05_p0040">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-dent05_p0040">28</xref> especially because of their structural similarity to human tooth,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-dent05_p0040">29</xref> homogeneous and reproducible surface,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-dent05_p0040">30</xref> and lower biological variability,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-dent05_p0040">30</xref> since they are not exposed to high concentrations of fluoride.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-dent05_p0040">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-dent05_p0040">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-dent05_p0040">28</xref></p><p>The 4-hour period for duration of each step was based on the findings of Ribeiro et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-dent05_p0040">20</xref> These authors demonstrated that, after one hour in an <italic>in vitro</italic> study, saliva can recover previously abraded bovine enamel. Moreover, this period of time is the maximum mean period during which the oral cavity is not subjected to other stimuli after professional prophylaxis, such as contact with food.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-dent05_p0040">20</xref></p><p>In the present study, after professional prophylaxis with sodium bicarbonate <italic>in vitro,</italic> there was a reduction in surface enamel hardness. Since this exposed surface was less mineralized, saliva had a remineralizing action, with a significant increase in surface hardness, which was not different from baseline hardness. Similar results were observed by Ribeiro et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-dent05_p0040">20</xref> who conducted an <italic>in vitro</italic> study to investigate the action of saliva on enamel previously submitted to professional prophylaxis. They observed an increase in surface hardness after one hour.</p><p>Conversely, analysis of wear did not reveal any reparative action of saliva. After the <italic>in situ</italic> stage, during which the blocks were submitted to the action of saliva for 4 hours, there was no significant reduction in wear. On the other hand, during investigations on demineralized enamel by artificial caries solution, the authors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-dent05_p0040">20</xref> observed reduction in wear, in agreement with Hon&#x000f3;rio et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-dent05_p0040">18</xref> These results may be explained by the fact that the enamel with white spot lesions is especially more prone to chemically receiving minerals (calcium and phosphate) from saliva, since the enamel crystals are altered and consequently have lower mineral content, which are still present in the tooth structure, thus allowing recovery and a slight gain in height.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-dent05_p0040">36</xref> Conversely, sound enamel submitted to mechanical wear completely loses the surface crystals, precluding recovery and structure gain in height, since there is no matrix for deposition of ions from the saliva.</p><p>In the present study, care was taken to assure the homogeneity of experimental groups by random division according to initial surface enamel hardness. Notwithstanding, G1 exhibited statistically higher wear than G2 after <italic>in vitro</italic> professional prophylaxis, which was performed equally for both groups, even though hardness values after prophylaxis were not different between the groups. There is no explanation for such an outcome; however, to overcome this problem, the difference in wear should be considered to allow actual comparison of influence of the <italic>in situ</italic> stage between G1 and G2.</p><p>The action of fluoride on a structure previously submitted to professional prophylaxis was investigated because no studies have addressed its effect on exclusively abraded surfaces, even though the remineralizing effect of this element on surfaces previously demineralized by dental caries is well established. The 0.2% NaF solution was selected due to the demonstrated clinical action for caries remineralization and easy utilization.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-dent05_p0040">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-dent05_p0040">33</xref> A solution was employed because utilization of dentifrice might promote further wear, since its utilization is related to toothbrushing (abrasion).</p><p>The results revealed that the action of saliva (G1) was not different from saliva associated with 0.2% sodium fluoride (G2) for both surface enamel hardness and wear variables. Both promoted an increase in surface enamel hardness (G1, 329 and 354 KHN; G2, 312 and 340 after prophylaxis and after the <italic>in situ</italic> stage, respectively), yet none could reestablish the enamel in height (G1 &#x02212;0.0016 and G2 &#x02212;0.0074 of mean difference).</p><p>Initially, it was assumed that utilization of fluoridated dentifrice before the <italic>in situ</italic> stage might promote a residual effect of fluoride, thus masking the effect of fluoride mouth rinse. This phenomenon hardly occurred, since care was taken to assure a one-hour interval between toothbrushing and onset of the <italic>in situ</italic> stage, to avoid the action of fluoride from dentifrice in the study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-dent05_p0040">34</xref> However, Bruun, Givskov, and Thylstrup<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-dent05_p0040">35</xref> found residual fluoride in saliva for more than one hour after toothbrushing with fluoridated dentifrice, compared to saliva of the placebo dentifrice. Thus, future studies should ideally evaluate the fluoride in saliva before onset of the <italic>in situ</italic> stage, increase the washout period of dentifrice, or employ non-fluoridated dentifrice.</p><p>The type of fluoride may also influence the outcome. High concentration fluorides, such as fluoridated varnishes, have demonstrated greater effectiveness in remineralization.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-dent05_p0040">36</xref> In addition, some authors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-dent05_p0040">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-dent05_p0040">38</xref> observed that concentrations above 500 ppm of fluoride did not produce significant increase in remineralization. Similar studies should be conducted to compare several concentrations of fluoride to promote r a better understanding of the action of fluoride on abrasion. Moreover, its action should be evaluated not only on &#x0201c;intact&#x0201d; enamel, but also on previously demineralized enamel.</p><p>Thus, considering the importance of mechanical biofilm removal as a caries preventive measure, regardless of the effectiveness of the <italic>in situ</italic> action of saliva associated or not with fluoride to recover the enamel structure lost during prophylaxis with sodium bicarbonate, the wear produced by this procedure was very slight. Therefore, professionals may safely perform prophylaxis without concern regarding the adverse effects of significant loss of intact tooth structure.
