Due to increasing life expectancy in Japan and elsewhere, an effective vaccine which offers the possibility of prolonged protection is required. Protein conjugated pneumococcal vaccines, which have the ability to boost immunity (immunologic memory) on natural exposure or revaccination, may meet these requirements. An unconjugated 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) has been available for decades; however data on protection against pneumonia are inconsistent. For the first time, a randomized, modified double-blind trial comparing the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) with PPSV23 was conducted in PPSV23-naive adults &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years of age in Japan. This study showed that statistically significantly greater functional antibody responses as measured by opsonophagocytic assays 1&#x000a0;month after vaccination were elicited in the PCV13 group (n = 366) compared with the PPSV23 group (n = 367) for 9 of the 12&#x000a0;serotypes in common with both vaccines and for serotype 6A, unique to PCV13. Local reactions collected within 14&#x000a0;days of vaccination were more frequent in the PCV13 (57.5%, 211/367) than PPSV23 (44.9%, 166/370) group, although severity was generally mild to moderate; systemic and adverse events were similar across groups. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events. Consistent with global studies comparing PCV13 with PPSV23, PCV13 use in Japanese subjects was safe and well-tolerated and elicited greater functional immune responses than PPSV23 for the majority of PCV13-serotypes. PCV13 has the potential to protect against pneumococcal disease in Japanese elderly adults.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>elderly</kwd><kwd>immunogenicity</kwd><kwd>Japan</kwd><kwd>safety</kwd><kwd>13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine</kwd><kwd>23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="2"/><ref-count count="46"/><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p>adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CAP</term><def><p>community-acquired pneumonia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CAPiTA</term><def><p>Community-Acquired Pneumonia Immunization Trial in Adults</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRM<sub>197</sub></term><def><p>cross-reactive material 197</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GMFR</term><def><p>geometric mean fold rise</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GMT</term><def><p>geometric mean titer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IPD</term><def><p>invasive pneumococcal disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LLOQ</term><def><p>lower limit of quantitation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OPA</term><def><p>opsonophagocytic activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCV13</term><def><p>13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PPSV23</term><def><p>23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine</p></def></def-item></def-list></sec><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Disease caused by <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> is a major cause of mortality worldwide, with incidence highest among the elderly.<sup><xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> In Japan, <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> is the most common etiologic agent of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), associated with 24%&#x02013;39% of all cases.<sup><xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2-4</xref></sup> In 2012, pneumonia was the third leading cause of death among the Japanese elderly &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years of age (98.8&#x000a0;cases per 100,000).<sup><xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Adult invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) surveillance was initiated in Japan in 2013.<sup><xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> From April 2013 to March 2014, the incidence rate of IPD in Japanese adults aged &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years was 2.43/100,000&#x000a0;person-years, with a mortality rate due to IPD of 10.39%.

The secondary objective was to demonstrate that the immune responses induced by PCV13 were statistically significantly higher than the immune responses induced by PPSV23 for at least some of the 12 common serotypes and serotype 6A. The safety objective was to assess the safety profile of PCV13.

The percentages of subjects who experienced any AE were similar among PCV13 and PPSV23 recipients (6.8% vs 7.1%, respectively). During the study, one AE was assessed as serious (pancreatic carcinoma) in the PCV13 group; this was not considered vaccine related.

</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s0005"><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first study in Japan comparing immunogenicity and safety of PCV13 and PPSV23 administered to pneumococcal vaccine naive adults aged &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years. The current study addresses limitations of a prior study in Japan that did not include a comparison of PCV13 and PPSV23; results of this previous study showed that PCV13 elicited similar or somewhat higher immune responses in Japanese adults aged &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years than those observed in the present study.<sup><xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> A limitation of the current study was that there were no clinical endpoints comparing the effectiveness of these 2 vaccines. However, the recently completed Community-Acquired Pneumonia Immunization Trial in Adults (CAPiTA) 65&#x000a0;years of age and older in the Netherlands with approximately 85,000 subjects partially addressed this limitation by examining the clinical efficacy of PCV13 compared to placebo, demonstrating PCV13 is efficacious against vaccine-type CAP, including non-bacteremic CAP and vaccine-type IPD.<sup><xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20-22</xref></sup></p><p>In the current study, PPSV23 was chosen for comparison as it is currently licensed and part of the NIP in Japan for adults &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years of age.<sup><xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> PPSV23, a free polysaccharide vaccine which elicits T cell&#x02212;independent immune responses, has demonstrated efficacy against IPD, and in some settings, pneumonia;<sup><xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> however, the duration of protection of PPSV23 is limited to approximately 2&#x02013;5&#x000a0;years.<sup><xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> The limited duration of protection of PPSV23 is associated with waning antibody concentrations and the T cell&#x02212;independent nature of the PPSV23 immune responses, with little or no memory response on natural exposure; revaccination is required. Some studies have observed that immune responses of some PPSV23 serotypes are significantly reduced upon revaccination at a 6-month to 4-year interval, which raises the question of hyporesponsiveness.<sup><xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25-29</xref></sup> Other studies in the United States<sup><xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30,31</xref></sup> and in Japan<sup><xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> demonstrated that when subjects were revaccinated with PPSV23 after an interval longer than 5&#x000a0;years, the serotypes studied were immunogenic when compared with prevaccination levels. Antibody responses on revaccination, although lower, were generally sustained when compared with those after the initial vaccination. Based on these findings, it was concluded that significant hyporesponsiveness on revaccination was not observed when the time interval between vaccinations is extended.<sup><xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26,28,30-32</xref></sup> However, it is still unclear if revaccination with PPSV23 at intervals longer than 5&#x000a0;years is adequate to maintain persistant antibody levels sufficient for extended protection against pneumococcal disease, as there is no threshold of protection defined for adults, and no efficacy studies to support this.</p><p>On the other hand, PCV13, a conjugated pneumococcal vaccine, elicits memory B cells indicating a T cell&#x02212;dependent response.<sup><xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9,10</xref></sup> This memory response may have the immunologic advantage of sustaining protective antibody responses upon subsequent natural exposure or revaccination. One US study showed that when PCV13 recipients received a second dose of PCV13 after approximately 4&#x000a0;years, immune responses were generally sustained compared to responses after the initial PCV13 vaccination, with many of the PCV13 serotypes showing statistically significantly higher responses.<sup><xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Although the duration of protection provided by PCV13 is not known, the CAPiTA study recently demonstrated a reduction of vaccine-type CAP cases in PCV13 vaccinated individuals that lasted at least 4&#x000a0;years.<sup><xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20,21</xref></sup> However, if protection from initial vaccination should wane, the US study on the impact of PCV13 on subsequent vaccination<sup><xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> clearly demonstrates the ability to revaccinate with PCV13 after an appropriate interval, thereby maintaining or increasing antibody levels; this may optimize protection. Surveillance data from many countries will continue to monitor IPD incidence to assess the need for revaccination.<sup><xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6,33-36</xref></sup></p><p>In the current study, functional antibody responses as measured by OPA were noninferior for all serotypes and statistically significantly higher for the majority of serotypes after PCV13 compared with PPSV23. For both serotypes 1 and 14, immune responses to PCV13 were similar to PPSV23; the reason why responses were not higher is unknown. Regardless, these serotypes in PCV13 are expected to be as effective as PPSV23 in adults against pneumococcal disease.<sup><xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Only serotype 3 elicited statistically significantly lower responses after PCV13 compared with PPSV23; the underlying immune mechanism and the clinical relevance is unknown. Nevertheless, serotype 3 elicited a 9-fold increase in immune response from baseline to 1 month after PCV13 vaccination. This increase in immune response, together with the ability of PCV13 to elicit a memory response, suggests that serotype 3 may have the potential to protect against pneumococcal disease. The CAPiTA study, as described above, demonstrated a reduction of vaccine-type CAP cases, including cases caused by serotype 3, in PCV13 vaccinated individuals when compared with placebo;<sup><xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20,21</xref></sup> surveillance data will continue to be monitored for PCV13 effectiveness in adults.<sup><xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6,33-36</xref></sup></p><p>In addition, PCV13 elicited a statistically significantly higher response for serotype 6A, contained only in PCV13. Of note, the functional OPA antibody response against serotype 6A is cross-reactive with serotype 6C,<sup><xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> a serotype that was recently demonstrated to cause IPD.<sup><xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6,38,39</xref></sup></p><p>Of interest, prevaccination antibody titers were similar across vaccine groups, but fold rises were numerically higher after PCV13 compared with PPSV23 for all serotypes except serotype 3. Although a specific level of OPA antibody responses has not been shown to correlate with protection against pneumococcal disease in adults, OPA functional antibody responses are generally accepted as a correlate of vaccine-induced protection.<sup><xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Furthermore, the reverse cumulative distribution curves showing proportion of responders for a given titer provide reassurance that, whatever the correlations of OPA responses and protection are, the proportion of responders after PCV13 administration is equivalent or higher than the proportion of responders after PPSV23.</p><p>Similar results were observed in studies in the United States and Europe conducted in PPSV23-naive adults 60 to 64&#x000a0;years of age and PPSV23 pre-immunized adults &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years of age. In these studies, immune responses were noninferior for all serotypes and significantly higher for 8&#x02212;10 of the 12 common serotypes and for serotype 6A after PCV13 compared with after PPSV23. For serotypes 3 and 14, the differences in responses between vaccines post vaccination were consistent with those observed in the current study.<sup><xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12,13,27,41</xref></sup> As discussed above, a US study clearly demonstrated the ability to revaccinate PCV13 recipients with PCV13.<sup><xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> PCV13 was also shown to enhance responses to PPSV23.<sup><xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12,27</xref></sup> This allows for PPSV23 to be given after PCV13 if broader serotype coverage is required. In the United States, for example, the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices currently recommends that adults aged &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years who are naive to pneumococcal vaccines receive a dose of PPSV23 by 6&#x02212;12 months after PCV13 to cover the 11 additional serotypes not included in PCV13.<sup><xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Given the similarity of the results in these studies with the current study, it is likely that studies examining the sequence of vaccine administration in Japanese adults would elicit similar responses. Finally, a study in subjects &#x02265;80&#x000a0;years of age in Japan showed that PCV7 serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F elicited higher functional antibody responses in PCV7 compared with PPSV23 recipients; these differences were significantly higher for serotypes 4, 9V, 18C, and 23F.<sup><xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> It is particularly reassuring that elderly Japanese subjects &#x02265;80&#x000a0;years of age are able to mount higher functional antibody responses after PCV7 compared with PPSV23, despite reports of immunosenescence in the elderly.<sup><xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup></p><p>As in other studies with PCV13,<sup><xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12,19,45</xref></sup> in the current study, PCV13 was shown to have an acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile. Local reactions were mainly mild to moderate in severity and self-limiting, although they were statistically significantly higher among PCV13 recipients than PPSV23 recipients, possibly reflecting the higher immune responses observed after PCV13.<sup><xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> There were no related SAEs or deaths in this study.</p><p>In conclusion, taking into consideration the potential for the T cell&#x02013;dependent immune response of PCV13 to establish immunologic memory (thereby enhancing subsequent responses to natural exposure), the generally higher immune responses for the PCV13 vaccine serotypes elicited by PCV13 compared with PPSV23, and the data from the CAPiTA study which support efficacy of PCV13,<sup><xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20,21</xref></sup> this study supports the perspective that PCV13 has the potential for improved clinical efficacy against the substantial burden of IPD<sup><xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and pneumonia<sup><xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> caused by PCV13-associated serotypes in Japan.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s0006" sec-type="other"><title>Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest</title><p>CJ, YS, MY, BB, DC, WCG, DAS, BS-T, are all employees of Pfizer and may have stock or stock options.
