Calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>] apexification or artificial apical plug application using mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) has been traditionally used to treat necrotic teeth with incomplete apices.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> However, these approaches require a long time to complete treatment and do not reinforce the thin and weak roots of immature teeth.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Indeed, it has been suggested that the long term use of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> during apexification procedures significantly reduces fracture resistance of the root.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Endodontic regeneration (ER, pulp revascularization) has been used as a treatment option to manage necrotic immature teeth.<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In a recent study, ER was proposed to significantly increase the thickness and length of immature roots compared to teeth treated with Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> apexification or MTA.<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, some cases treated with ER have been associated with suboptimal clinical outcomes where there is an apical closure with no increase in immature root thickness.<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>The clinical ER procedure suggested by the American Association of Endodontists (AAE) recommends the irrigation of the necrotic immature root canal with 1.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), followed by application of intracanal medicament for 1 - 4 weeks during the first visit.<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In the next visit and upon the confirmation of the absence of clinical signs and symptoms, irrigation with 17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is recommended to release dentin endogenous proteins followed by induction of bleeding to produce natural scaffold and deliver stem cells into the canal.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The final treatment steps include application of MTA for the coronal root canal seal and completion of the final coronal restoration.</p><p>Root canal irrigants and intracanal medicaments used during ER procedure may negatively affect the physical and mechanical properties of radicular dentin. The use of NaOCl, EDTA, triple antibiotic paste (TAP), or Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> was found to significantly reduce dentin flexure strength, microhardness and root resistance to fracture.<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Furthermore, previously mentioned irrigation solutions and medicaments were also found to affect the chemical structure of dentin.<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Exploring the combined effect of these irrigants and medicaments on dentin could be more representative of the actual clinical scenario and essential to understand which one of these chemicals has the most detrimental effect. No previous studies have explored the effect of intracanal medicaments and irrigants within the context of ER on mechanical and chemical properties of dentin. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of various intracanal medicaments used during ER on microhardness and chemical integrity of human dentin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Sample preparation</title><p>Fifty caries-free human third molars were selected for this study after obtaining Indiana University Institutional Review Board approval. The molars were stored at 4&#x02103; in 0.1% thymol and used within six months after extraction. A 1.5 mm coronal dentin disc was cross-sectioned from each molar using a low-speed saw (IsoMet, Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL, USA) with a diamond disc (15LC Diamond Wafering Blade, Buehler) under deionized running water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The non-pulpal outer sides of the dentin discs were flattened to a uniform thickness using an automatic polishing machine (Struers Rotopol 31, Struers, Cleveland, OH, USA) with 500 grit silicon carbide grinding paper (Struers). The deep pulpal side of each dentin disc was polished with 1,200, 2,400 and 4,000 grit papers (Struers) and finally using a 1 &#x000b5;m diamond polishing suspension (Struers). As a final cleaning step, the polished specimens were sonicated in de-ionized water for 3 minutes.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of medicaments used in the study</title><p>To prepare the clinically used concentration of TAP (1 g/mL), 1 g of United States Pharmacopeia grade antibiotic powders compounded of equal portions of metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and minocycline (Champs Pharmacy, San Antonio, TX, USA) was mixed with 1 mL of sterile water.<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> To prepare a diluted pasty consistency of methylcellulose-based triple antibiotic paste (DTAP), 100 mg of United States Pharmacopeia grade antibiotic powders compounded of equal portions of metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and minocycline was dissolved in 100 mL of sterile water. Then, 8 g of methyl cellulose powder (Methocel 60 HG, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to the 100 mL of 1 mg/mL solution of TAP and mixed for 30 minutes using a magnetic stir bar to obtain a homogenous DTAP with 1 mg/mL concentration of TAP. A commercial Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> intracanal medicament (UltraCal XS, Ultradent, South Jordan, UT, USA) was also used in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment procedure</title><p>The dentin discs were randomized into three treatment groups and two control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). For the first control group, the pulpal side of each dentin disc was irrigated with 20 mL of sterile water for 5 minutes using a 27 gauge needle and 5 mL syringes. Then, each sample was stored for four weeks at 37&#x02103; in a sealed 2 mL conical sample cup (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) containing a cotton pellet saturated with distilled water. After four weeks, the pulpal side of each dentin disc was irrigated with 20 mL of sterile water for 10 minutes. For the second control group (no medicament), the pulpal side of each dentin disc was slowly irrigated with 20 mL of 1.5% NaOCl for 5 minutes. Then, each sample was stored for four weeks at 37&#x02103; in a sealed 2 mL conical sample cup containing a cotton pellet saturated with distilled water. After that, the pulpal side of each dentin disc was irrigated with 20 mL of 17% EDTA for 10 minutes. For each of the three treatment groups, the pulpal side of each dentin disc was slowly irrigated with 20 mL of 1.5% NaOCl for 5 minutes. Then, 0.1 mL of TAP, DTAP, or Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> paste was applied on the pulpal side of each specimen using a disposable syringe (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The treated dentin disks were kept for four weeks at 37&#x02103; in a sealed 2 mL conical sample cup containing a cotton pellet saturated with distilled water. After four weeks, the treated side of each dentin specimen in all treatment groups was irrigated with 20 mL of 17% EDTA for 10 minutes. The amount of intracanal medicaments applied in the three treatment groups (0.1 mL) was just enough to cover the pulpal surface of dentin discs with the medicament to avoid application of excessive amount of paste. The four weeks of intracanal medication and the time and volume of both EDTA and NaOCl irrigation used in this study were based on the current ER protocol recommended by AAE.<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Microhardness measurement</title><p>The treatment side of each dentin disc was bisected by an imaginary line into two halves and labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). One half of each treatment side was randomly selected and subjected to microhardness measurements using a Vickers microhardness tester (LM247, Leco, St. Joseph, MI, USA). Three indentations, spaced 200 &#x000b5;m apart, were made on each specimen using a 50 g load and a 10 second dwell time. The indentations were precisely measured using an optical microscope equipped with a digital camera and image analysis software. The representative hardness value for each specimen was obtained as the mean of the results from the three indentations.</p></sec><sec><title>Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurement</title><p>The chemical integrity of treated dentin was evaluated using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer (Jasco Inc., Tokyo, Japan) with a diamond attenuated total reflectance accessory. Five dentin disc samples were randomly selected from each group for FTIR measurement. Three different areas were selected from the other half, not subjected to microhardness testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). FTIR spectra were then collected from the three selected areas in each sample between 800 and 2,000 cm<sup>-1</sup> at 4 cm<sup>-1</sup> resolution using 100 scans. Each obtained spectrum was processed by smoothing, baseline correction and normalization to the amide I peak using Spectra manager software (Jasco Inc.). The ratio of integrated areas of the phosphate v1 and v3 peaks to the amide I peak was quantified to calculate the relative contents of these inorganic and organic components. The representative final ratio allocated for each dentin sample was obtained as the mean of the ratios obtained from the three single scans. Larger phosphate/amide I ratios compared to untreated dentin samples corresponded to a higher collagen deproteinization, whereas smaller phosphate/amide I ratios compared to untreated dentin samples corresponded to a higher dentin demineralization.</p></sec><sec><title>Scanning electron microscopy</title><p>Two dentin samples were randomly selected from each group for scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis to detect any morphological changes in the treated dentin side after experimental treatments. Each selected specimen was irrigated with 10 mL of de-ionized water, sonicated for 5 min in de-ionized water, and air dried for 48 hours using low vacuum pressure desiccator (Bel-Art, Wayne, NJ, USA) and silica gel crystals. Then, samples were sputter coated for 70 seconds with gold/palladium using a sputter coater (POLARON Sputter Coating System, Energy Beam Sciences, Agawam, MA, USA) and images were taken from the treated side of the dentin samples with an SEM (JEOL 7800F, JEOL, Peabody, MA, USA) in secondary electron imaging mode.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All data were checked for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the normality assumptions were satisfied. The differences in microhardness and phosphate/amide I ratios among experimental groups were examined using one-way ANOVA followed by Fisher's least significant difference. Pearson correlation coefficients overall and by group were calculated to determine the correlations between phosphate/amide I ratios and microhardness measurements. A 5% level of statistical significance was applied for all analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> shows a significant reduction in mean microhardness values in NaOCl + EDTA treated dentin as well as dentin treated with TAP, DTAP and Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> compared to untreated dentin (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001).

Dentin erosion was observed among NaOCl + EDTA treated dentin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7b</xref>) and TAP treated dentin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7e</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>ER has gained popularity in the last 15 years.<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> However, it is still questionable to get optimal treatment outcomes such as continued root development with normal pulp-dentin complex.<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Therefore, it is essential to preserve the mechanical, physical and chemical properties of root dentin from any negative effects of chemical agents used in ER.</p><p>In this study, dentin treated with NaOCl + EDTA, DTAP, and Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> caused significant reduction in microhardness ranging from 20% to 27% compared to untreated control dentin. However, dentin treated with TAP caused significant reduction in microhardness compared to all other groups. Furthermore, dentin treated with TAP caused 75% reduction in microhardness compared to untreated control dentin. This could be explained by the strong demineralization effect of TAP reported in a previous study as well as the negative effect of both NaOCl and EDTA irrigants on microhardness of dentin.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Hardness testing is not usually used to predict root fracture. However, the main advantage of performing a hardness test on dentin is that it is a well standardized indentation test that might be related to other mechanical properties such as tensile strength, compressive strength and modulus of elasticity.<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> A recent study found that a significant decrease in microhardness of roots treated with TAP for one month was followed by significant reduction in root fracture resistance after three months treatment with TAP.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Our study also showed no significant differences in microhardness between dentin treated with NaOCl + EDTA, DTAP, and Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>. This indicates that both DTAP and Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> medicaments can be used in ER without causing any additional reduction in microhardness compared to the use of the essential irrigation solutions alone. However, additional mechanical tests should be performed in future studies to confirm the findings of this study. It is also noteworthy to mention that both Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> and lower concentrations of TAP (0.1 - 1 mg/mL) has been recommended in the recent ER literatures to avoid the toxic effect of the currently used 1,000 mg/mL TAP on stem cells of the apical papillae.<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Additionally, these low concentrations of TAP were also found to be effective against endodontic pathogens.<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> However, the recommended low concentrations of TAP are usually in a liquid form, which makes its use challenging. Therefore, DTAP used in the current study was mixed with a methyl cellulose vehicle to create a clinically applicable intracanal medicament.</p><p>The chemical integrity of dentin after various ER protocols was also investigated in this study. A significant reduction in phosphate/amide I ratio was found in dentin treated with NaOCl + EDTA, TAP, DTAP, and Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> compared to untreated control dentin, which indicates a net superficial demineralization effect of medicaments and/or irrigation solutions tested in this study. Furthermore, dentin treated with TAP caused significant reduction in phosphate/amide I ratio compared to all other groups. This could be explained by the strong acidic nature of TAP (pH = 2.9) as well as the chelating effect of both EDTA and minocycline present in TAP.<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> One of the limitations of studying the chemical structure of dentin with FTIR approach is that the depth of penetration of infrared radiation in the FTIR technique is limited to a few microns. Therefore, the spectral data and the phosphate/amide I ratios reported in our study may only represent the net chemical change of superficial dentin after various treatment protocols rather than the whole chemical change across the total thickness of the dentin specimens. The overall high correlation between phosphate/amide I ratios and microhardness values of dentin implies that the reported reduction in dentin microhardness among all treatment groups could be explained by the superficial demineralization effect following the ER protocols (reduction in phosphate/amide I ratios). These findings generally agree with previous studies, which also suggested that dentin microhardness depends on mineral concentration.<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>In the current study, TAP treated dentin showed advanced superficial erosion in SEM analyses, which could be explained by the strong acidic nature of TAP. This might be the consequences of demineralization process accelerated by acidic TAP and calcium-chelating EDTA, resulting in the significant reduction in microhardness of TAP treated dentin.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The final irrigation step with EDTA is expected to wash out the residual medicaments in case of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> and DTAP treated dentin instead of causing excessive dentin erosion. Therefore, no prominent erosion was observed in our study among dentine treated with Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> or DTAP. On the other hand, the observed dentin erosion in NaOCl + EDTA treated dentin could be explained by the direct contact of EDTA with dentin surface in the absence of any intracanal medicament. It is worth noting that the 10 minutes irrigation with 20 mL of EDTA used in this study has been recommended by AAE during ER procedures.<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> This relatively long EDTA irrigation time was proposed to wash out the remaining intracanal medicaments, open dentinal tubules and expose various growth factors during the ER procedure.<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> However, prolonged EDTA irrigation for 10 minutes was suggested to cause excessive dentin erosion and shorter EDTA irrigation time is usually recommended during routine endodontic therapy.<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>In this study, deep coronal dentin were used instead of radicular dentin to guarantee enough dentin surface area to perform both microhardness and FTIR measurement on the same samples and obtain a valid correlation analyses between the two outcomes. A recent report suggested no significant differences in tubular density and tubular cross section area between deep coronal and radicular dentin, regardless of the acidic challenge used.<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Within the limitations of this <italic>in vitro</italic> study, the use of TAP in ER caused significantly higher dentin demineralization and reduction in dentin microhardness compared to DTAP or Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>. The use of DTAP or Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> rather than TAP as intracanal medicaments during ER may minimize the reduction in dentin microhardness and the change in chemical structure of superficial
