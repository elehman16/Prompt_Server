Nonadherence leads to poor disease control with a burden on patient quality of life and healthcare systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Research shows that, on average, 50&#x000a0;% of patients with a chronic condition are not adherent, with adherence estimates ranging from 17 to 80&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Drugs for asymptomatic chronic conditions are found to have especially low adherence rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In several studies, the risk for nonadherence was shown to be highest in the first year after the start with chronic medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Consequently, interventions to warrant adherence are expected to be most effective at the initiation of a chronic medication treatment.</p><p>Various causes have been demonstrated to hamper adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Conventional models distinguish between intentional and nonintentional barriers as causes for poor adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Intentional barriers develop because of patients&#x02019; beliefs and perceptions about their medications and diseases. These barriers can be further subdivided into cognitive and emotional barriers. Nonintentional barriers depend on capacity, resources, and practical barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Besides personal beliefs, adherence depends on the type of disease but may also vary within patients over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The multifaceted nature of the adherence problem illustrates that improving adherence is complex and needs interventions tailored to the individual patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A recent Cochrane review showed that current methods of improving medication adherence for chronic health problems are mostly complex and not very effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The effectiveness of nonadherence interventions can be improved by targeting the underlying barriers related to nonadherence for a specific patient. Interventions can focus on cognitive and emotional barriers (intentional nonadherence) or on practical barriers (nonintentional nonadherence), each with their own specific intervention ingredients tailored to patients&#x02019; needs. Depending on the character of the intervention, different primary healthcare providers can be involved. For instance, the pharmacist may be better equipped to implement aids to overcome practical barriers, and general practitioners (GPs) and nurses may be better able to help the patient overcome cognitive and emotional barriers. Though there are several instruments assessing actual medication adherence and various programs to improve adherence, at present, no tool is available for healthcare providers to predict the risk and potential causes for nonadherence at the start of chronic medication with a tailored approach to overcome the individual barriers detected. Such a tool would enable them to address potential barriers to nonadherence and prevent early cessation of chronic medication. Therefore, a predictive tool is needed at the start of chronic medication to assess the risk of future nonadherence and to address the assessed causes of the nonadherence for a patient at high risk.</p><p>Furthermore, an implementation strategy is needed to provide tailored interventions in primary healthcare settings. For the efficient implementation of effective interventions in existing primary healthcare workflows, a good cooperation between pharmacists, GPs, practice nurses, and assistants is required. Technology-based systems that enable easy communication between healthcare providers about the progress of interventions and agreement about the allocation of time and resources need to be in place.</p><p>At Philips Research, a questionnaire was developed that creates a barrier profile based on an online assessment. The questionnaire consists of two parts: the Probabilistic Medication Adherence Scale (ProMAS), which is an 18-item questionnaire to assess nonadherence risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and an additional 23 questions that assess the underlying barriers related to nonadherence. The resulting barrier profile provides insight into the extent to which eight cognitive, emotional, and practical barriers may hamper a patient&#x02019;s adherence. For each of the identified barriers, a set of recommendations was formulated in a manual for healthcare providers on how to address the barriers in an intervention. Consequently, in patients starting chronic medication and at high risk for nonadherence, as assessed by ProMAS, the barrier profile provides an intervention strategy to overcome cognitive, emotional, and practical barriers to adherence at an early moment and thereby promotes adherence.</p><p>The primary objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of using the medication-adherence tool in starters with cardiovascular medication, which includes antiplatelets, antihypertensives, and lipid-lowering drugs (<xref rid="Sec22" ref-type="sec">Appendix</xref>), and oral blood glucose-lowering medication in the improvement of medication adherence as measured by pharmacy dispensing data. A second objective is to evaluate the implementation strategy to reduce barriers identified in patients at risk for nonadherence for a primary care setting relating to the acceptability of the workflow for all stakeholders (pharmacists, general practitioners, and patients).</p><p>The primary research question is as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>What is the benefit of using the medication-adherence tool for medication adherence of patients starting with cardiovascular or oral blood glucose-lowering medication identified as being at high risk for nonadherence at a follow-up of 8&#x000a0;months compared to usual care?</p></list-item></list></p><p>Secondary questions are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>a) What is the association between the ProMAS score at 8&#x000a0;months and the adherence after 8&#x000a0;months?</p><p>b) To what extent can the identified barriers at 8&#x000a0;months predict medication adherence after 8&#x000a0;months?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What are the predictive values of the ProMAS score and the barrier profile, measured at drug initiation, in relation to medication adherence after 8&#x000a0;months for all patients in the control group who started with cardiovascular of diabetes medication?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What is the adherence of the subgroup of patients with a longer follow-up period of at least 1&#x000a0;year after drug initiation?</p></list-item></list></p><p>Process evaluations will address the following question:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>What are the barriers and facilitators, as experienced by pharmacists and patients, regarding the implementation of the medication-adherence tool in their daily practice?</p></list-item></list></p><p>The aim of this study protocol is to describe the design and methods of a study to assess the effectiveness of using a medication-adherence tool in starters with cardiovascular or oral blood glucose-lowering medication to improve medication adherence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This study is a cluster-randomized trial with an intervention group of pharmacies (using the adherence tool) and a control group of pharmacies (providing usual care).

In the Netherlands, patients with a first dispensing of a chronic drug usually receive only an amount for 2&#x000a0;weeks. Treatment is continued after 2&#x000a0;weeks according to the experiences of the patient. Thus, patients starting with the study medication will have to have contact with the community pharmacy within approximately 2&#x000a0;weeks. This makes it convenient to ask eligible patients to participate in the study at the first dispensing, let them fill in the medication adherence assessment before the second dispensing, and apply the intervention when necessary at the second dispensing. The feasibility of implementing the use of the adherence tool in the daily pharmacy workflow was piloted in two pharmacies. During the pilot period, researchers regularly contacted the pilot pharmacists in order to track their experiences and any developments and to solve any issues. After the pilot period, a meeting between the research team and the two pilot pharmacists was planned for evaluation of the pilot. Based on the experiences during the pilot period, workflow adaptations leading to an increase in convenience and efficiency were made. Small changes in study information for patients, pharmacists, and GPs were made after the pilot period.</p><p>For further clarification of this study protocol, we reference the study flow diagram (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and the SPIRIT checklist (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2016_1393_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Recruitment of pharmacies, general practices, and patients</title><p>The trial will be carried out with pharmacists, general practitioners, and their patients with a first prescription of cardiovascular medication, including antihypertensives, antiplatelets, and lipid-lowering drugs, or oral blood glucose-lowering medication made by their GP within the study period (see <xref rid="Sec22" ref-type="sec">Appendix</xref> for drug classes and ATC codes). A first prescription is defined as no drug dispensing from a drug class issued to the patient in the preceding year. For example, a patient who used a beta-blocking agent in the preceding year is not eligible when starting another beta blocker but will be eligible when starting a statin.</p><p>The primary care cooperation De Ondernemende Huisarts (DOH), or The Innovative General Practitioner, will play a key role in the recruitment of pharmacies and general practices for this study. DOH is a general practice collaborative, i.e., approximately 70 GPs working in 16 group practices in the southeastern part of the Netherlands who that share an overarching management structure and develop and implement structured care for several prevalent chronic conditions, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Pharmacies</title><p>The DOH cooperates closely with a number of community pharmacies (so-called CaZo cooperation). In total, 25 pharmacies have joined the cooperative. A representative of DOH will contact all 25 pharmacies connected to the DOH cooperation and provide them an invitation and an information leaflet about the study. Three members of the research team will visit all pharmacists who express their intention to participate. After a detailed explanation of the study aims, methods, and expected outcomes to the pharmacists, written informed consent for both participation and collection of de-identified patient data from the pharmacist&#x02019;s database will be obtained.</p><p>The participating pharmacies are randomized for the intervention or control group, which implies that the patients are clustered within pharmacies. Pharmacies are stratified into small or large depending on their number of patients registered with DOH GPs. After the randomization procedure (drawing from a hat by an independent research assistant and consecutive allocation) has been performed, the pharmacies will be informed of their assignment to either the intervention group or the control group. Only pharmacists and pharmacy assistants from the intervention group are being trained to interpret the barriers to adherence profile and to provide tailored care. This prevents contamination between the intervention and control patients. Because patients in the Netherlands predominantly visit one pharmacy for all their medication, pharmacists are assumed to have complete medication dispensing information for their patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Due to the test of the medication-adherence tool, both pilot pharmacies will have to participate in the intervention group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>General practices</title><p>Participating DOH general practices will receive written information on the study.

As an alternative, participants who prefer the online questionnaire but do not have access to a computer or Internet at home can fill out the questionnaire at the pharmacy during their visit for the second dispensing.</p><p>At the second dispensing moment, pharmacists in the intervention group will initiate a tailored intervention for patients with an increased risk for nonadherence. The intervention will be tailored to the patient&#x02019;s emotional, cognitive, and practical barriers, as identified by the barriers assessment. Patients without an increased risk for nonadherence, receive usual care (delivery of medication only).

When cognitive or emotional barriers (e.g., attitude with regard to medication, concerns about medication usage, and fear of side effects) are present for the specific patient, the pharmacist starts to discuss the relevant issues in the profile using the recommendations of the manual and the patient-centered communication techniques to try to take away or diminish these barriers. The manual proposes the following main intervention strategies: for patients with an insufficient awareness of the need to use the medication, self-assessment of clinical measures (blood pressure and blood glucose) will be proposed, since this has been shown to increase medication adherence. When agreed on by the patient, this will be initiated in the pharmacy by providing the patient the relevant devices. When barriers mainly appear to be practical for the specific patient (inconvenience and/or knowledge about medication scheme), the pharmacist offers one or several practical solutions, e.g., suggestion for medication change, pill organizer, use of a Baxter system, reminders, seek the help of the patient&#x02019;s social network, or simplification of dosage scheme. The pharmacist registers the intervention.</p><p>Since the pharmacist as well as the GP and the nurse practitioner are involved in supporting their patient with their medication use, a good communication and cooperation among all these parties is needed.</p><p>Technology-based systems that enable easy communication between healthcare providers about the progress of interventions and agreement about allocation of time and resources are required for optimal functioning of the medication-adherence tool. The chain information system Care2U is the preferred way to communicate all information about the interventions. Currently, the system needs some adaptations in order to enable such communication between pharmacy and general practice. In case such communication is not possible by the time of the start of the study, other ways of communication (telephone, email, or fax) between pharmacists and GPs will be agreed upon.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Implementation of the medication-adherence tool</title><p>To deliver the tailored intervention, training on a patient-centered communication technique will be offered to the pharmacists, and one of the pharmacy assistants of the pharmacies assigned to the intervention group. Intervention pharmacists and their pharmacy assistants will receive a three-hour training session before starting the trial, consisting of a brief introduction to the proposed communication technique, demonstration of a second dispense moment with a barrier profile, and skills practice using role play. The pharmacists and pharmacy assistants will be specifically instructed on discussing the profile with the patients in order to offer a tailored intervention to overcome cognitive, emotional, or practical barriers.</p><p>Intervention pharmacies will also receive a manual containing instructions for discussing and overcoming the various potential barriers for medication adherence. In this manual, potential barriers are categorized into cognitive, emotional and practical nonadherence barriers. Furthermore, intervention pharmacies will receive a follow-up group session from the trainer on the patient-centered communication technique to provide support and exchange experiences on discussing the barrier profiles. In addition, three members of the research team will visit all participating pharmacists. At least the pharmacist and one experienced pharmacy assistant of a pharmacy will be present during that appointment. We will explain the study in detail and provide them with an easy-to-understand explanation of the workflow concept and subsequently discuss how the workflow concept can be optimally tailored to existing routine work procedures in the pharmacy. One of the researchers will be available during working hours to answer questions arising from the study. Finally, pharmacists will be offered the opportunity to contact one of the pilot pharmacists to ask questions and advices about the study procedures.

For the purpose of this study, the questionnaire will be slightly adapted for use with patients who do not take any other chronic medication and who have a first prescription of cardiovascular or oral blood glucose-lowering medication. The cut-off value for being at risk for nonadherence is 13: patients with a score of&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;13 are considered to have an increased risk for nonadherence, whereas patients with a score below 13 are not at risk for nonadherence. The ProMAS will be applied at baseline and at 8&#x000a0;months follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Scale on underlying barriers related to nonadherence</title><p>This questionnaire measures to what extent the following emotional, and practical barriers for nonadherence are present: feelings with regard to medication, fear of side effects, concerns about medication usage, necessity beliefs, attitude with regard to medication, self-efficacy, inconvenience, and knowledge about medication scheme.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Adherence</title><p>Medication adherence is calculated as the percentage of days covered by medication (PDC) based on pharmacy dispensing of one drug group since the start of the therapy until the end of the study period.

The assessment on barriers and facilitators will be based on the Tailored Implementation for Chronic Diseases&#x02019; (TICD) checklist. This is a comprehensive, integrated checklist with 57 potential determinants of practice grouped in seven domains: guideline factors, individual health professional factors; patient factors; professional interactions; incentives and resources; capacity for organizational change; and social, political, and legal factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Patients will also be interviewed about their experiences with the medication adherence assessment and interventions. Informed consent for these interviews will be obtained. Interviews will aim at gaining a better understanding of how patients and healthcare providers have experienced the intervention in terms of effort, time investment, and benefits. The purposive patient sample size will be determined based on theoretical saturation (data collection until no new information is obtained). Therefore, data review and analysis will be done in conjunction with data collection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Sample size</title><p>For the sample size calculation, the following assumptions are made: we assume that a percentage of 60&#x000a0;% is nonadherent in our sample of patients at high risk based on their ProMAS score. This assumption is reasonable according to published studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. We assume that the intervention will increase the 80&#x000a0;% PDC in the intervention group by 20&#x000a0;% compared to the control group. As patients are clustered within pharmacies, the evaluation will be performed by multilevel analysis to adjust for clustering. For the effect of clustering, an intracluster correlation (ICC) of 0.05 was assumed.</p><p>In agreement with conventional power calculations, a power of 80&#x000a0;% to detect a true difference and a chance of 5&#x000a0;% of a type 1 error to wrongly conclude on a difference are assumed. For this trial, in the DOH/CAZO setting, we assume that there are at least 14 community pharmacies willing to participate. The sample size calculation results in 39 patients needed per pharmacy. PASS software version 11 was used to determine the appropriate sample size. Considering 30&#x000a0;% lost to follow-up during the study period, 56 patients need to be included per pharmacy to achieve the power needed. If only 50&#x000a0;% of the patients agree to join the study, 112 patients need to be invited per pharmacy.</p><p>In the potentially participating 25 pharmacies, a total of at least 6,081 single patients with primary dispensings of cardiovascular or oral blood glucose-lowering medications were detected within 12&#x000a0;months (as observed in historical data). This means that, on average, 20 subjects started with cardiovascular or oral blood glucose-lowering medication monthly per pharmacy. Assuming 40&#x000a0;% of the starters at risk for nonadherence (determined by a ProMAS score&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;13), this means, on average, that eight patients are available monthly per pharmacy for an intervention. The period to have 112 starters on cardiovascular or blood glucose-lowering medication per pharmacy will be approximately 14&#x000a0;months.</p><p>A measurement period of at least 8&#x000a0;months is preferred in order to get valid information from dispensing data. A first prescription is usually dispensed for 14&#x000a0;days, followed by a prescription for 90&#x000a0;days. After 8&#x000a0;months, at least two repeat prescriptions after the second dispensing must have had occurred to meet a PDC of 100&#x000a0;%. As we assume a PDC of 80&#x000a0;% is sufficient, at least (14&#x000a0;days&#x02009;+&#x02009;180&#x000a0;days =) 196&#x000a0;days * 1.2&#x02009;=&#x02009;234&#x000a0;days&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.8&#x000a0;months are needed to detect nonadherence. If the last patient was included after 14&#x000a0;months, together with the measurement period, this ends up the total study period with 22&#x000a0;months needed for follow up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The primary analysis will be an intention-to-treat analysis to test whether patients starting with cardiovascular or oral blood glucose-lowering medication who are at high risk for nonadherence and who received a tailored intervention based on the patient&#x02019;s identified emotional, cognitive, and practical barriers will be more adherent compared to patients who did not receive the intervention, expressed as PDC. We will compare differences in medication adherence between the intervention and control group both as a dichotomous (PDC&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;80&#x000a0;% versus PDC&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;80&#x000a0;%) and continuous outcome measure (mean PDC). Because patients are clustered in pharmacies, we will perform multilevel analyses, with adjustment for potential confounders (patient age, gender, diagnosis, and number of medications). Secondary analyses will test the hypothesis that patients who received the tailored adherence intervention will be more adherent compared to patients who did not receive this intervention, expressed by the ProMAS score. We will compare differences in the ProMAS score between intervention and control group both as a dichotomous (score&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;13 versus&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;13) and continuous outcome measure (mean score). To assess differences between groups, we will perform linear and logistic mixed models. Further secondary analyses will assess the frequency of different barriers for medication adherence. We will compare differences in the profile score between intervention and control group both as a dichotomous (per barrier, present, or absent) and continuous (mean number of barriers present) outcome measure. Finally, the predictive values of the ProMAS score and the score on the eight identified barriers on patient adherence, based on dispensing data, will be quantitatively assessed. All statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS software (version 20, IBM Corp.) or MLWIN (version 2.28, University of Bristol).</p><p>We will qualitatively analyze the interviews with pharmacists and patients. The interviews will be transcribed verbatim. The transcripts will be analyzed by open coding at macro level using predefined main codes.

A trial provides an optimal design to elucidate the effectiveness of interventions tailored to the underlying cognitive, emotional, and practical barriers to nonadherence identified for the patient. The results will provide insight in both the effectiveness of applying the medication-adherence tool and the predicting value of the ProMAS and the identified barriers for medication nonadherence. The effect of interventions to increase adherence depends on many factors. However, many approaches to improve adherence apply the one-size-fits-all-principle. By discussing the barrier profile with the patient, pharmacists can provide personalized support. An important and unique component of this study is the provision of an intervention tailored to the patient&#x02019;s emotional, cognitive, and practical barriers. Not only the intervention itself, but also the implementation of the intervention will be tailored. The research team will visit all participating pharmacies to tailor the workflow concept as much as possible to existing work procedures. As the information on the barriers and the intervention is shared among the healthcare providers, all information supplied to the patient is consistent. A limitation of our study is that the questionnaire on barriers related to nonadherence has not been extensively used and validated in earlier studies. Furthermore, randomization occurs at the pharmacy level. Therefore, GPs may have patients in both the intervention and control group, which could lead to contamination. However, the barriers are discussed with the patients in the intervention pharmacies only. As the GPs will only follow a part of the intervention from the implementation guide for those patients that are announced by the intervention pharmacists, this limitation is presumably not severe. This study will be carried out in the DOH/CAZO care groups. These care groups have innovative mindsets. Consequently, the implementation of the intervention in other care groups might need additional guidance. Within these care groups, recruitment bias may be caused by the response of patients with certain characteristics, including medication adherence. Due to privacy legislation, the characteristics of nonresponders will not be analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Trial status</title><p>At the time of submission of this study protocol, we are recruiting pharmacies and patients for the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CSN, Citizen Service Number; DOH: De Ondernemende Huisarts; GP, general practitioner; ICC, intracluster correlation; PDC, percentage of days covered; ProMAS, Probabilistic Medication Adherence Scale; TICD: Tailored Implementation for Chronic Diseases.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec22"><title>Appendix</title><sec id="Sec23"><title>ATC codes for cardiovascular or oral blood glucose-lowering medication</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>ATC code A10B: oral antihyperglycemic drugs</p></list-item><list-item><p>ATC code B01AC: platelet aggregation inhibitors</p></list-item><list-item><p>ATC code C01A: cardiac glycosides</p></list-item><list-item><p>ATC code C01D: vasodilators</p></list-item><list-item><p>ATC code C03: diuretic drugs</p></list-item><list-item><p>ATC code C07: beta-blocking agents</p></list-item><list-item><p>ATC code C08: calcium channel blockers</p></list-item><list-item><p>ATC code C09: agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system</p></list-item><list-item><p>ATC code C10: lipid-lowering drugs</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec></app><app id="App2"><sec id="Sec24"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2016_1393_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>SPIRIT checklist.
