Unfortunately, a large proportion of patients with type 1 diabetes are unable to achieve A1C guideline targets for various reasons, including non-adherence to antidiabetic treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Ideally, insulin treatment should be adaptable to changes in daily activities (e.g., varying working hours, irregular eating patterns, or traveling) rather than requiring patients to adjust their lifestyle. Adherence might be improved by providing patients with the option of a dosing schedule tailored to their individual, dynamic, and busy lifestyles.</p><p>Another issue of great clinical concern that can both compromise adherence to insulin therapy and act as a major barrier to insulin titration and effective glycemic control is hypoglycemia, and the fear of it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The increased risk of hypoglycemia that comes with attempts to reduce A1C to target levels using intensive insulin regimens has long been recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). A recent study using continuous glucose monitoring suggested that patients whose type 1 diabetes was &#x0201c;well controlled&#x0201d; (as defined by A1C &#x02264;7%) could spend an average of as much as 90 min per day with a blood glucose level &#x0003c;70 mg/dL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). It is therefore not surprising that the hypoglycemia rates reported for type 1 diabetes average two symptomatic episodes per week and one severe episode per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Insulin regimens with the potential to improve adherence and glycemic control by offering greater flexibility and a reduced risk of hypoglycemia are therefore required. Another potential barrier to patient acceptance of insulin therapy is concern over the likelihood of weight gain. In this respect, insulin detemir (IDet) has consistently shown reduced weight gain compared with other basal insulins in trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>Insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) is a new insulin combination product in clinical development for the treatment of diabetes. The basal component, insulin degludec (IDeg), is formulated in the pharmaceutical product so as to form soluble, stable di-hexamers that reorganize, after injection, into multi-hexamer chains, forming a subcutaneous depot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The multi-hexamer subsequently releases monomers at a slow and steady rate, and these are readily absorbed into the circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The resulting ultra-long and stable action profile is characterized by a duration of action beyond 40 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) with a terminal half-life exceeding 25 h at a dose of 0.4 units/kg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). IDeg has a lower day-to-day and hour-to-hour variability in glucose-lowering effect compared with insulin glargine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). This distinct pharmacodynamic (PD) profile translates clinically into the ability to optimize glycemic control with a lower risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia compared with currently available basal insulins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), as well as into the possibility of adjusting the injection time of both IDeg and IDegAsp from day to day to accommodate individual needs.</p><p>Another unique pharmacological property of IDeg is that it can be combined with insulin aspart (IAsp) without the risk of hybrid hexamers (mixed hexamers containing monomers of both IDeg and IAsp) forming, which lead to unpredictable and suboptimal pharmacokinetic/PD profiles being produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). IDegAsp is therefore designed to produce a PD profile that reflects the prandial insulin profile of IAsp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) superimposed on the long-duration and stable profile of IDeg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). A clear separation of the PD effects of the bolus and basal components of IDegAsp was hypothesized to carry a lower risk of hypoglycemia than can be achieved with conventional premixed insulin products, and a proof-of-concept study has indeed demonstrated lower rates of confirmed and nocturnal hypoglycemia comparing IDegAsp to biphasic IAsp in type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>IDegAsp is the first analog co-formulation that contains both long- and rapid-acting insulins, thereby providing the total daily basal insulin requirement as well as the bolus insulin requirement for one main meal. Administration of IDegAsp at a single meal, with additional bolus injections at the remaining meals, facilitates a treatment regimen that requires fewer daily injections than standard basal-bolus therapy, which typically requires 4&#x02013;5 daily injections. The current study was therefore undertaken to confirm the efficacy and tolerability of basal-bolus therapy with IDegAsp administered once daily (OD) at a main meal in combination with IAsp at other meals in patients with type 1 diabetes compared with full basal-bolus therapy using IDet and IAsp.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Trial design</title><p>This was a 26-week, multinational, multicenter, open-labeled, two-arm, parallel, randomized, treat-to-target trial comparing the efficacy and safety of OD IDegAsp plus mealtime IAsp for remaining meals to OD IDet with mealtime IAsp in patients with type 1 diabetes. This trial was conducted at 79 sites in nine countries (Denmark, Poland, Romania, France, U.K., Russian Federation, Israel, Australia, and U.S.) between 25 August 2009 and 31 May 2010.</p><p>The protocol, protocol amendments, consent form, and patient information sheet were reviewed and approved by health authorities, according to local regulations, and by the local independent ethics committee prior to trial initiation. The trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Written informed consent was obtained from patients prior to entry and any trial-related activities.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Trial population</title><p>Men and women (&#x02265;18 years of age) with type 1 diabetes for at least 12 months, A1C 7.0&#x02013;10.0% (inclusive), BMI &#x02264;35.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and currently treated with insulin (using basal-bolus, premixed insulin, or self-mix regimens) for at least 12 months were eligible for inclusion. Patients were excluded if they were using insulin regimens other than those listed above within 3 months of trial initiation or a basal-bolus regimen with a basal insulin injected twice daily (BID). Other exclusion criteria included anticipated change in concomitant medications known to interfere with glucose metabolism, recurrent severe hypoglycemia or hypoglycemic unawareness, proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy requiring treatment, pregnancy, breast-feeding, renal or hepatic dysfunction, significant cardiovascular disease or cancer, and other conditions considered by the investigator as likely to interfere with the trial results.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Randomization</title><p>Eligible patients were randomized 2:1 to receive OD IDegAsp (100 units/mL, 3 mL FlexPen; Novo Nordisk) or OD IDet (100 units/mL, 3 mL FlexPen; Novo Nordisk), both in combination with IAsp (NovoRapid/NovoLog; 100 units/mL, 3 mL FlexPen; Novo Nordisk). Randomization was stratified based on previous insulin regimen at screening: basal-bolus regimen or another insulin regimen. The unequal randomization ratio was to ensure an adequate number of patients were exposed to IDegAsp to fulfill regulatory requirements. An open-label trial design was chosen as the two treatment regimens required a different number and timing of daily injections. In addition, trials conducted with an insulin-pen injection device cannot be blinded.</p><p>A safety committee from Novo Nordisk performed ongoing safety surveillance and was blinded to treatment but could recommend unblinding of the data to be assessed by an independent ad hoc group, if appropriate. The external cardiovascular Event Adjudication Committee was masked to treatment. The titration of insulin doses was monitored by Quintiles and reviewed by a blinded titration committee.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Treatment administration and titration</title><p>IDegAsp is a soluble co-formulation consisting of 70% ultra-long-acting basal insulin, IDeg, and 30% rapid-acting insulin, IAsp. IDegAsp was administered OD with a main meal, and the dosing time could be moved to another main meal at any time during the trial at the patient&#x02019;s and/or physician&#x02019;s discretion. IAsp was administered at the remaining meals with the instruction given to inject immediately before commencing the meal (both treatment groups).</p><p>Patients randomized to IDet plus IAsp were prescribed the same number of basal and bolus units as prior to randomization. IDet was administered OD at the evening meal or at bedtime, according to local practice, and at the same time each day. In the case of inadequate glycemic control after 8 weeks of treatment, the investigator could add a second morning dose of IDet. Consideration of this was recommended if mean pre-dinner plasma glucose (PG) was &#x0003e;6.0 mmol/L (108 mg/dL), and when patients with baseline A1C &#x0003c;8% showed any deterioration of A1C, or when patients with baseline A1C 8&#x02013;10% inclusive showed less than a 0.5%-point drop in A1C. The second dose of IDet was to be started at 4 units at breakfast. Insulin aspart was administered at all meals.</p><p>Patients randomized to IDegAsp plus IAsp from a basal-bolus regimen received the same number of basal units as prior to randomization. For the meals not covered by IDegAsp, similar bolus doses were prescribed as given prior to randomization. Patients switching from a premix/self-mix regimen were instructed to start treatment with IDegAsp at a dose corresponding to 70% of their total daily insulin dose prior to randomization. The remaining 30% was split and given as IAsp at the other meals.</p><p>Insulin dose adjustments were performed once weekly according to protocol-specified titration guidelines, with the overall treatment goal of achieving an A1C of &#x0003c;7%. A treat-to-target approach was applied, which is expected to result in parity between treatment arms in glycemic control. The IDegAsp and IDet doses were adjusted to a pre-breakfast PG target of 4&#x02013;5 mmol/L (72&#x02013;90 mg/dL), whereas morning doses of IDet were titrated based on the mean pre-dinner PG levels, again aiming for 4&#x02013;5 mmol/L. Adjustments were based on the mean self-measured PG (SMPG) value from the preceding 3 days.</p><p>Titration of bolus insulin (IAsp) aimed to achieve a pre-meal PG target of 4&#x02013;5 mmol/L at the following meal; hence, the breakfast bolus dose was titrated based on mean pre-lunch PG values, the lunch bolus dose was titrated based on mean pre-dinner PG values, and the dinner bolus dose was titrated based on the mean bedtime PG values.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Trial end points</title><p>The primary end point was the change from baseline in A1C after 26 weeks of treatment. Secondary end points included percent of patients reaching A1C &#x0003c;7.0%, change from baseline in fasting PG (FPG), 9-point SMPG including pre- and postprandial values and the prandial PG increment, time to meet pre-breakfast SMPG titration target, and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) (Short-Form 36 [SF-36] Version 2) questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). The SF-36 has eight domains (physical functioning, bodily pain, role-physical, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health) that can be combined to give two summary component scores. The first four domains give a physical component score representing predominantly physical well-being, with the latter four providing a mental component score comprising aspects of mental health.</p><p>Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), hypoglycemic events, insulin doses (total insulin dose and basal and bolus doses), body weight, laboratory tests, and vital signs. Confirmed hypoglycemia was defined as those events with a PG value &#x0003c;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) (regardless of symptoms) or considered severe (patient requiring assistance). Hypoglycemic events that occurred between midnight and 6:00 <sc>a.m.</sc> (inclusive) were classified as nocturnal.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>This trial&#x02019;s primary objective was to confirm the non-inferiority of IDegAsp to IDet, as assessed by change in A1C from baseline after 26 weeks, with a non-inferiority limit of 0.4%. If non-inferiority was confirmed, the trial also aimed to show superiority of IDegAsp on selected end points based on a hierarchical testing procedure.</p><p>The full analysis set included all randomized patients. These patients were included in all analyses of efficacy end points, including HRQoL and hypoglycemia. Safety end points were evaluated for all patients exposed to treatments (safety analysis set). Missing values were imputed using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method. Change from baseline in A1C after 26 weeks of treatment was analyzed using an ANOVA model, with treatment, antidiabetic therapy at screening, sex, and region as fixed factors, and age and baseline values as covariates. Change from baseline in FPG, body weight, prandial increments, PG, and HRQoL were analyzed using an ANOVA method similar to that applied to the primary end point. The number of hypoglycemic episodes was analyzed using a negative binomial regression model including treatment, antidiabetic therapy, sex, and region as fixed factors, age as a covariate, and exposure as offset. Other AEs are presented as descriptive statistics.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s8"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s9"><title>Baseline characteristics and patient disposition</title><p>A total of 548 patients were randomized to IDegAsp (<italic>n</italic> = 366) or IDet (<italic>n</italic> = 182).

Overall, IDegAsp comprised 61% of the total daily insulin dose.</p><p>At 26 weeks, the basal insulin dose was numerically higher in patients treated with IDet BID (47 units [0.56 units/kg]) compared with the subgroup using IDet OD (33 units [0.43 units/kg]). The bolus insulin dose, however, was numerically lower in IDet BID users (37 units [0.44 units/kg]) compared with IDet OD users (45 units [0.58 units/kg]); hence, the total insulin dose was similar between the IDet subgroups.

Treatment with once-daily IDegAsp plus IAsp at remaining meals improved glycemic control and was non-inferior to a standard basal-bolus regimen, comprised of IDet + IAsp, in terms of lowering A1C. The efficacy of IDegAsp was established with fewer daily injections (3 vs. 4&#x02013;5) and a lower insulin dose, and IDegAsp was also associated with a significantly lower risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia.</p><p>Taking into account the similar effectiveness of the two regimens, the 37% lower risk of nocturnal hypoglycemic episodes observed with IDegAsp seems to be a very important finding. It is all the more remarkable given that the ratio of the evening bolus and basal components is fixed with IDegAsp, and that the comparator basal insulin, IDet, has itself been consistently shown to reduce the risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia versus NPH insulin in trials in both type 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) and type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). It should be noted that risk differences between basal insulins are expected to be greater with regard to nocturnal hypoglycemic episodes, because their influence on risk is less confounded during the night by other factors, such as inadequate carbohydrate intake or exercise. IDet is characterized by a reduced intra-patient variability in the PD action profile compared with earlier basal insulins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). This is thought to be mediated via its solubility and reversible plasma albumin binding, and it is also thought that this contributes to a low risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). It is therefore encouraging that this risk appears to be further reduced with IDegAsp, and this finding is also consistent with comparative studies of IDeg (the basal component of IDegAsp) versus insulin glargine when used in basal-bolus therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) or as initial basal insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>).</p><p>It is reassuring to note that the absolute rates for overall and nocturnal hypoglycemia in our study were numerically similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) or reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) compared with previous treat-to-target studies in type 1 diabetes in which less ambitious glycemic targets have been used for both basal and bolus insulin titration. This difference in bolus titration and the fact that this global study included study participants with diverse eating patterns might account for the lower final ratios of basal-to-bolus insulin dose in our study: 43:57 and 46:54 for IDegAsp and IDet, respectively. Although these values do not differ greatly from the 50:50 split generally recommended with basal-bolus therapy, previous treat-to-target studies in adult type 1 diabetes cohorts of similar BMI to ours have tended to report 50&#x02013;60% of the total insulin dose constituting basal insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). In these studies, bolus insulin was titrated to 2-h postprandial glucose targets (&#x02264;7.7 or &#x02264;9 mmol/L), whereas our study targeted preprandial normoglycemia. Another study involving IDeg in type 1 diabetes also titrated bolus insulin to a preprandial glucose target of 4&#x02013;5 mmol/L, and here the basal-to-bolus ratio was 47:53 for both IDeg and insulin glargine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p>The lower overall insulin dose used by the IDegAsp group was primarily driven by a lower basal insulin dose. The observation that 26% of patients in the IDet treatment arm changed to BID dosing is consistent with previous reports that a substantial proportion of patients with type 1 diabetes achieve improved glycemic profiles when they switch from once- to twice-daily use of IDet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>).</p><p>The IDet treatment arm had, on average, 1 kg less weight gain than the IDegAsp treatment arm. This weight advantage of IDet has been a consistent finding in many clinical trials versus NPH insulin and insulin glargine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Previous comparisons of IDegAsp or IDeg versus insulin glargine have not observed differences in weight outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Therefore, despite some structural similarities between IDeg and IDet (notably the presence of a fatty acid chain acylated to the B29 amino acid residue), this effect appears to be unique to IDet. The underlying mechanism responsible for this remains unproven although a number of pharmacological hypotheses have been articulated in previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>As well as lowering the PG values over the study, both insulin regimens caused a flattening of the 9-point SMPG profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>). It is possible that these profiles reflect titration of the basal insulin against a low FPG target, and/or that the ambitious titration algorithm used for IAsp was successful in suppressing postprandial increments in glucose. In the case of IDet, the rather flat profile partly reflected the PG level being sustained at the post-breakfast value across the remainder of the daytime, whereas with IDegAsp, PG declined after breakfast to a significantly lower pre-lunch value. This subtle between-treatment disparity in the glucose profiles is difficult to explain, but it is noteworthy that some patients were taking IDet BID, some patients were taking IDegAsp at meals other than dinner, and the total and basal insulin doses were lower in the IDegAsp group; hence, minor differences in the glucose trajectories might be expected. Similar flat SMPG profiles have been reported previously with insulin analog basal-bolus therapy using a titrate-to-target approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), and therefore this observation is worth investigating further.</p><p>The ambitious FPG target applied in this study was &#x0223c;1 mmol/L lower than that of most previous treat-to-target type 1 diabetes studies, and both insulin regimens lowered FPG substantially. The proportions of patients achieving the target of 4&#x02013;5 mmol/L (and A1C &#x0003c;7%), however, were low, but it should be noted that the achievement of such excellent levels of glycemic control is expected to be uncommon in type 1 diabetes cohorts. Thus, the target achievement results are consistent with previous studies in type 1 diabetes where treat-to-target protocols (using less ambitious FPG targets) have been applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>).</p><p>In summary, OD treatment with the new insulin combination IDegAsp at any main meal plus IAsp for the remaining meals is as efficacious and well tolerated as a standard basal-bolus regimen, with the added benefits of a significantly lower risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia and fewer daily injections in patients with type 1 diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
