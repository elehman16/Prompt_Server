The study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments for biomedical research involving human subjects and the principles of the Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The clinical trial was approved by the State Food and Drug Administration of China (approval No. 2010L01969), and the clinical protocol and the informed consent form were approved by the local ethics committee at Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (approval No. [2012]046).

Then subjects were administered, under the supervision of study investigators, a single diclofenac sodium sustained-release tablet orally with 250 mL water. Intake of food and beverages (other than water, which was allowed after 2 hours) was not permitted until 4 hours after drug administration; a standardized lunch and dinner (200 g cooked rice, 200 g vegetables, 50 g pork, and 50 mL tomato soup) were provided at 4 and 9 hours after administration, respectively.</p><p>Additional blood samples were drawn at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 12, 14, 24, and 36 hours after drug administration.

The concentration of diclofenac in plasma was measured using a validated LC-MS/MS method. The LC-MS/MS system was a Shimadzu LC-30AD pump (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), and a SIL-30AC autosampler (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) coupled to an API QTRAP 5500 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization source (AB/MDSSciex, Concord, Ontario, Canada). The tandem mass spectrometer was operated under the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) using an electrospray ionization source in negative ion mode. The optimized condition consisted of a collision-activated dissociation gas of the medium, a curtain gas of 25 psi, a nebulizer gas of 50 psi, a TurboIonSpray gas of 30 psi, an ionspray voltage of &#x02013;4500 V, a source temperature of 550&#x002da;C, and an entrance potential of &#x02013;4 V for diclofenac and &#x02013;5 V for the internal standard (ie, indometacin). Quantification was operated in MRM of the transitions m/z 294.0 &#x02192; m/z 250.0 for diclofenac, and m/z 356.1 &#x02192; m/z 312.1 for indometacin.

After vortex mixing for 10 seconds, 500 &#x003bc;L acetonitrile was added to the mixture to precipitate protein and the sample was vortex mixed for 30 seconds and centrifuged at 13,000 revolutions/min at 4&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes; 150 &#x003bc;L of the upper layer was transferred to an injection bottle, which was loaded into an autosampler cabinet and 5 &#x003bc;L aliquot was injected into the LC-MS/MS system.</p><p>Chromatographic separation was performed on a Ultimate XB-CN column (150 mm&#x000d7;2.1 mm, 5&#x000b5;m, Welch Materials, Potomac, MD). The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile: 10 mM ammonium formate containing 0.05% formic acid (70:30 <italic>v/v</italic>) at an isocratic flow rate of 0.3 mL/minute, the injection volume was 5 &#x000b5;L, and the run time was 4 minutes. The temperatures of the analytical column and autosampler were set at 35&#x000b0;C and 4&#x000b0;C, respectively. Under these conditions, the retention times for diclofenac and indometacin were 2.5 minutes and 2.6 minutes, respectively.</p><p>The method was shown to be suitable for the determination of diclofenac in human plasma over the range of 8.3122 to 997.464 ng/mL (<italic>r</italic> &#x02265; 0.996). Using weighted least-squares regression, the lower limit of quantitation was 8.3122 ng/mL plasma. Accuracy measured at three concentration levels was acceptable (varied from 95.23% to 99.97%) and the relative SD values were all &#x0003c;5.67%. Precision was likewise acceptable (between 3.58% and 7.09%). The values of intraday and interday precision were &#x0003c;7.08% at 3 concentration levels.

However, the study was limited by its short duration; its inclusion of only healthy male volunteers under fasted conditions; and by its single- and multiple-dose, open-label design. The mean age of these healthy subjects was 24.2 years (range, 20&#x02013;30 years) and, therefore, the study results cannot be extrapolated to an older population. The results also cannot be used to predict performance in patients in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s0075"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our single- and multiple-dose study found that the test and reference formulations of diclofenac sodium met the regulatory criteria for bioequivalence in these fasting, healthy Chinese male volunteers. Both formulations appeared to be well tolerated.</p></sec><sec id="s0080"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>This research was sponsored by Shenzhen Zhijun Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd, Shenzhen, China.
