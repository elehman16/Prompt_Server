Its importance is being realized more and more by pediatricians and general public in developing as well as developed countries. Enuresis is defined as the voluntary or involuntary repeated discharge of urine into clothes or bed after a developmental age when bladder control should be established. The present clinical study was planned to evaluate the effect of Divyadi Yoga along with counseling in the management of Shayyamutra. Total 40 selected cases were divided into two groups, i.e. 20 in each group. One group of children were given the trial drug Divyadi Yoga (D<sub>1</sub>) with counseling and other group of children were given placebo Divyadi Yoga (D<sub>2</sub>) with counseling. Divyadi Yoga was given in the dose of 3-6 gms. twice a day with luke warm water. The result of the study showed that groups provided a highly significant.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Nocturnal enuresis</kwd><kwd><italic>Shayyamutrata</italic></kwd><kwd>Divyadi Yoga</kwd><kwd>Psychotherapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Child health has assumed great significance in all over world.
