Acupuncture is used to treat it in traditional Chinese medicine, and generally, the L120, ST2 and ST36 acupoints are selected in clinical practice. We report a new method of acupuncture at the sphenopalatine acupoint (SPA) for treatment of persistent allergic rhinitis (PAR). The effect of this treatment was investigated using two different needling depths. The efficacy of this treatment was associated with accurate stimulation of the sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p id="Par2">A total of 61 patients diagnosed with PAR were randomly allocated to either the acupuncture or the sham acupuncture group. The difference between the groups was the needle depth when acupuncture was administered, which was 50&#x000a0;mm and 20&#x000a0;mm. Alteration in total nasal symptom score (TNSS) was the primary outcome. Quality of life, medication dosages and adverse events were secondary outcomes, measured using the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ). Confidence assessment was performed to evaluate data from the treatment and follow-up periods.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Results were: (1) average TNSS in the treatment group was significantly lower than in the control group at week 4 (median and 25th and 75th percentiles were 5.00 (4.00, 7.00) and 8.00 (7.00, 10.00), respectively (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001)). However, scores in the two groups were not significantly different at week 12; (2) quality of life (RQLQ) was significantly improved at week 2 in the treatment group compared to the control group (scores of 35.47&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8.20 and 45.48&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8.84; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001); (3) during the follow-up period, the medication dosage in the treatment group was much lower than in the control group (3.64&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.45 and 6.14&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.34; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05); and (4) no adverse events were observed in either group during treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">This pilot study revealed a profound effect of acupuncture at the SPA on prevention of PAR development. The TNSS in the treatment group (needle depth 50&#x000a0;mm), was significantly lower than in the control group (needle depth of only 20&#x000a0;mm). Our result demonstrates that performing acupuncture directly at the SPA to stimulate the SPG is an effective method to treat PAR.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">Acupuncture Clinical Trial Registry, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.acmctr.org/showproj.aspx?proj=55">AMCTR-OOR-16000014</ext-link> and Chinese Clinical Trial Register, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=15596">ChiCTR-IOR-16009211</ext-link>.

Persistent allergic rhinitis (PAR) has onset duration of more than 4&#x000a0;weeks per year and more than 4&#x000a0;days per week. Standard treatment for PAR includes allergen avoidance, effective symptomatic treatment, standardized immunotherapy, and patient health education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Despite the clinical efficacy of these conventional treatments, there is concern over adverse effects. Treatment combining complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) improves clinical efficacy and reduces the incidence of adverse reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Acupuncture, as one of the important therapies used in CAM, is based on the meridian theory, which targets certain specific acupoints to improve the body microenvironment and thus effectively treat certain diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Recent research suggests that acupuncture may exert anti-inflammatory effects to prevent the development of AR via multiple neuroendocrine and immune network pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Recent studies in the fields of neuroscience and immunology suggest an effect of neural reflexes in regulating the immune system, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] especially in pathways involving the vagus nerve and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">However, acupuncture was not widely recommended for the treatment of AR in the past due to a lack of solid clinical and experimental evidence supporting its efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Since 2015, accumulated evidence, especially from multicenter randomized controlled clinical trials, has demonstrated the efficacy of acupuncture in treating PAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. As a result, acupuncture is now listed on the AR guidelines in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">The sphenopalatine acupoint (SPA) is located in the cheek [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] near ST7 (Xiaguan) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], which is generally used as the needling point for local nasal anesthesia. Technically, the needle is inserted through this acupoint to reach the pterygopalatine fossa (PPF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] to stimulate the sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) and the other nasal nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], increase nasal ventilation and decrease the glandular secretion. The use of acupuncture at the SPA to treat AR was initially reported in 1990 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The author has long been engaged in acupuncture research and has proved its clinical efficacy in the treatment of AR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">The curative effect of acupuncture on PAR is mediated by anti-inflammatory effects via the regulation of the interaction between the vagus nerve and macrophages. These generic anti-inflammatory effects directly prevent the development of AR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. As the SPG is a parasympathetic ganglion capable of nasal function adjustment, we hypothesized that acupuncture at the SPA may lead to better efficacy because SPA stimulation can directly act on the SPG and can consequently yield an improvement in nasal function. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of acupuncture at the SPA for preventing PAR and to compare the efficacy and adverse effects of acupuncture at different needle depths in a randomized controlled trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par25">This randomized, controlled and double-blinded study was designed as a first step to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture for PAR treatment. The study was conducted at the Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) Department of the 5<sup>th</sup> Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU) in China. The study was sequentially conducted as follows.</p><p id="Par26">During a run-in period of 14&#x000a0;days prior to randomization, the patients stopped taking medication and were instructed on how to use the score card. During the following week, the patients recorded symptom scores every day to establish an individualized 7-day baseline score. At the end of the run-in period, participants were randomized into either the treatment group or control group by a computer-generated random number allocation scheme.</p><p id="Par27">The treatment lasted 4&#x000a0;weeks, and acupuncture was performed twice a week. Then, patients underwent a 12-week follow-up period. The interval from the beginning of treatment to the end of follow up was 16&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p id="Par28">The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the 5th Affiliated Hospital of SYSU. Signed informed consent forms (ICFs) were obtained from participants before they were assigned into the study groups. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (2004) and in accordance with the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO). The study was registered in the Acupuncture Clinical Trial Registry (AMCTR-OOR-16000014) and in the Chinese Clinical Trial Register (ChiCTR-IOR-16009211) on 1 September 2016.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Subjects</title><p id="Par29">Patients suffering from PAR were selected from the ENT Department between June 2010 and March 2015.

The ENT physicians were responsible for the diagnosis and therapeutic assessment of the patients. The acupuncturists were responsible for the acupoint localization and acupuncture performance. Once the patient met the inclusion criteria, the person in charge of the envelopes gave the specified envelope to the acupuncturist. To preserve masking, only the acupuncturists had access to the treatment allocation. The acupuncture practitioners were informed of this due to the nature of the intervention, but they were asked to not communicate with the participants or assessors about the treatment procedures and responses. In this study, neither the patients nor the ENT physicians were aware of the list of patients in the RAG and SAG before data decoding.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Intervention</title><p id="Par32">The intervention was conducted as follows: (1) based on earlier reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and the authors&#x02019; clinical experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], the SPA was located under the zygomatic arch and between the coronoid process and mandibular condyle; (2) the GLOBAL acupuncture needles measuring 0.3*75&#x000a0;mm were purchased from Suzhou Acupuncture Supplies, Ltd.

The acupuncturist placed his/her left index finger immediately above the acupoint, held the needle between his/her right thumb and index finger, and quickly pierced the skin of the patient. The slow inward pressure and twisting of the needle introduced a sensation of De Qi, a radiating numb sensation and acid bilge feeling in the upper teeth. The acupuncturist then twisted the needle repeatedly at a speed of 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;r/s without the use of an electrical or laser instrument. While the needle was pulled out, sterilized cotton was pressed to the cheek for 5&#x000a0;minutes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>); (4) the treatment time period was 4&#x000a0;weeks, and needling was performed twice a week; (5) the needle depths were approximately 50&#x000a0;mm in the RAG and 20&#x000a0;mm in the SAG.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Acupuncture needle point.

The SPG is a parasympathetic ganglion in the PPF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] that contains branches of the trigeminal nerve and sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers and regulates nasal function as the trigger point or sensitive area.</p><p id="Par46">The SPA is different from the traditional acupoint in that it is a single acupoint rather than a grouped acupoint. As the acupoint is located in the bone gap, a needle is used to access the pathway and obtain a sensation of &#x0201c;De Qi&#x0201d;, therefore, only acupuncture can achieve curative effects.</p><p id="Par47">PAR is an IgE-mediated chronic inflammatory nasal disease. Allergies cause inflammation of the nasal mucosa, sensitization of the nasal sensory nerve, activation of the parasympathetic nervous system, and inhibition of sympathetic nerve function. The dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system is an important trigger for the onset of nasal diseases and escalation of clinical symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par48">The efficacy of modern acupuncture is related to its anti-inflammatory effects via a complex neuroendocrine and immunological network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A negative feedback loop between the autonomic nervous system and innate immunity modulates the body&#x02019;s immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">The effect of acupuncture at the SPA may be mediated via the autonomic nervous system and innate immunity. Acupuncture affects nasal function by the regulation of neural reflexes in the immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Experimental evidence suggests that the electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve inhibits the activation of macrophages and reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Insertion of the needle at the PPF affects neural function through the SPG, attenuates the sensitivity of sensory nerves, balances the autonomic nervous function in the nose and downregulates the sensitization of the central nervous system. Wang conducted a series of objective tests to confirm the change in concentration of inflammatory factors and improvement in nasal ventilation with acupuncture at the SPG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], which may reasonably explain why the treatment can reduce nasal hyper-responsiveness and the frequency of onset of symptoms.</p><p id="Par50">Dust mites are the most common allergens in Southern China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The allergen density in the air constantly varies in the subtropical climate. Patients with PAR are allergic to dust mites, and the onset of the disease is perennial. The investigators of this study are experts who are trained in TCM. All acupuncture therapists were certified, ensuring the quality of treatment in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">Based on the clinical data, the observations were divided into three periods using the author&#x02019;s method to maintain quality control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. When a patient under medication visited the ENT physicians, he/she was immediately requested to cease antihistamine medication and to start using the symptom score card record during the second week. Loratadine is fully metabolized within 7&#x000a0;days. The therapeutic effect of acupuncture was obtained within 10&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and the effect was still present after 12&#x000a0;weeks in the RAG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Although medication was allowed during the follow-up period, the dosage in the RAG was significantly lower than that in the SAG. Therefore, it did not affect the treatment outcome.</p><p id="Par52">The SPG in the PPF modulates nasal inhalation, nasal sensation, vasomotor responses of the nasal mucosa, and glandular secretions. Disorders in nerve function lead to nasal symptoms, among which nasal congestion is a common symptom. Fleckenstein&#x02019;s study showed significant effects of acupuncture treatment compared to a sham treatment on the nasal sickness score for symptoms of vasomotor rhinitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Our study showed that acupuncture relieved symptoms of nasal congestion and runny nose. However, significant differences between the two symptoms were observed. The relief of nasal congestion occurred earlier than that of runny nose, which is likely due to the different sensitivities to neurotransmitters of the target organs. Blood vessels are more sensitive to nerve responses than glandular tissues, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and the nasal symptoms were more significantly relieved in the RAG than in the SAG. Nasal congestion could be relieved immediately in some of the patients when needling was performed at the SPA. The nerve reflex may be related to the efficacy time via the regulation of the vagus nerve and macrophages.</p><p id="Par53">Evaluation of quality of life was performed using the RQLQ, which contains four major entries. The sleep entry was the most important factor because nasal congestion mostly affects sleep. The patients reported their quality of life to be much improved after the treatment compared to that before the treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par54">The onset of PAR is related to allergy and nasal neurological disorders. Acupuncture at the SPA is an effective treatment for PAR, as it may ameliorate nasal symptoms, improve quality of life, and reduce the dosage of medicine. The responding area of the SPA is located at the PPF. By stimulating the SPG and trigeminal nerve, acupuncture lowered the sensitivity of the nasal sensory nerves, balanced the autonomic nervous system, downregulated the central nervous system sensation, and attenuated the overall nasal hyper-responsiveness. The SPA is a single acupoint that is used to treat PAR, and repeated acupuncture sessions produced no adverse effects, thus strengthening its appeal and potential clinical application. The results from this study were obtained from a small sample. Therefore, further validation of these results with larger-scale, multicenter clinical trials using more objective indicators could be decisive. Our study results are reasonable due to the mechanistic interaction between the reflexive nerve loop and inflammation-related immune cells.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AR</term><def><p id="Par6">Allergic rhinitis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CAM</term><def><p id="Par7">Complementary and alternative medicine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ENT</term><def><p id="Par8">Ear, nose and throat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IL</term><def><p id="Par9">Interleukin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICFs</term><def><p id="Par10">Informed consent forms</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAR</term><def><p id="Par11">Persistent allergic rhinitis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PPF</term><def><p id="Par12">Pterygopalatine fossa</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RAG</term><def><p id="Par13">Real acupuncture group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RQLQ</term><def><p id="Par14">Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAG</term><def><p id="Par15">Sham acupuncture group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SPA</term><def><p id="Par16">Sphenopalatine acupoint</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SPG</term><def><p id="Par17">Sphenopalatine ganglion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TNF</term><def><p id="Par18">Tumor necrosis factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TNSS</term><def><p id="Par19">Total nasal symptom score</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>We acknowledge the help from Dr. Shengqiao Li, who is from the Department of TCM at the 5th Affiliated Hospital of SYSU, for his assistance in editing and proofreading the manuscript.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par55">The study is supported by a grant from the Zhuhai Scientific and Technological Project Fund: 2015A0009.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par56">Data are available in &#x0201c;Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>&#x0201d;.
