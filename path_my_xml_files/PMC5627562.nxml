While, general anesthesia is used in urgency patients and regional contraindications under spinal anesthesia. Pulmonary aspiration and failure in intubation are causes to 75% of maternal mortality from anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The incidence of relevant hypotension was more frequent with spinal anesthesia than with epidural anesthesia. The clinicians have used from various preventive methods such as crystalloids or colloid preloading and uterine displacement along with the fluid and vasopressor to prevent or minimize hypotension after spinal anesthesia for the cesarean delivery.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] However, despite those methods, the favorite method was not approved.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Most studies are recommended for the use of colloids compared to crystalloid fluid loading to prevent hypotension following spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery. However, some studies support the use of crystalloid comparison to colloid is same.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Hypotension is generally considered if systolic blood pressure &#x0003c;90&#x02013;100 mmHg or a 20% fall in blood pressure from the baseline.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Unfortunately, there has not been established any fluid therapy alone effectively prevent hypotension after spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Crystalloids have a shorter half-life intravascular and hence that their ability to expand the intravascular volume is limited and this reason of why hypotension after spinal anesthesia is less successful in the patients that received the preloading with crystalloids. The high volume of crystalloids related to decreased oxygen carrying capacity and increased risk of pulmonary edema and peripheral edema during giving birth. Colloids remain in blood circulation for longer periods and can be a more effective alternative. Hetastarch is colloids which have been used in shock, sepsis, and trauma patients as intravascular volume expander.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The aim of the current study was to compare Hetastarch solution (with Voluven brand) with crystalloids (normal saline) as preloading to prevent hypotension after spinal anesthesia for cesarean section in Iranian healthy women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><p>We designed a randomized clinical trial in which 120 healthy term parturients, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Class I&#x02013;II that scheduled for elective cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia from April 2015 to February 2015 were included consecutively. This study was carried out in Baqiyatallah Hospital, Tehran, Iran. This study was approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee. Ethics committee approval was received along with the informed consent of each patient. Parturients were randomly divided into two groups (control or case group). Randomization was stratified using a random table number. Information regarding subjects&#x02019; demographics such as age, weight, and stature was recorded. Inclusion criteria were gestational age &#x0003e;31 week, weight between 50 and 110 kg, no history of allergy to local anesthetics drugs, lack of using anticoagulation, no existence of spinal anesthesia contraindications and no history of diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, vascular and kidney diseases, and blood or coagulation disorders. Furthermore, the ages of participants were between 18 and 35 years.</p><p>Participants with history of diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease coagulation disorder, and inadequate level of spinal anesthesia that is led to the intervention or acting general anesthetic were excluded in this study.</p><p>In each group, 60 participants were included in the study. The control Group (A) received 15 cc/kg normal saline and case Group (B) received 7 cc/kg hydroxyethyl starch 6% (Voluven). In the present study, double blinding was not impossible, for the lack of simulation in Normal saline and Voluven solution with respect to appearance. After the patients lying on the operating bed, systolic, diastolic, mean arterial blood pressure, and heart rates were recorded.

Furthermore, before doing spinal anesthesia, vital signs were registered in the questionnaire. Then, placed the parturients in the sitting position and spinal anesthesia has performed with 12&#x02013;15 mg bupivacaine 0.5% respect to stature. Needle number 26 were used in L3&#x02013;L4 or L4&#x02013;L5 levels. The patient immediately placed in the supine position and embedded oxygen with the face mask. Then vital signs were recorded.</p><p>Then, all parturients receive normal saline serum as preservative fluid. Surgery was performed after patient anesthesia level assessed with pin prick method that reaching the level of anesthesia to T4&#x02013;T6 and by removing the inclination of 15&#x000b0;. Vital signs are recorded in 3, 6, 9, 15, and 20 min of after anesthesia. If parturients were hypotensive (systolic pressure &#x0003c;100 mm Hg, or more than 20% systolic pressure falling from initial blood pressure) depending on the severity, were given 5&#x02013;10 mg Ephedrine. If necessary, the amount of half a milligram of atropine was used in the case of bradycardia did not respond to injections of ephedrine. During Process, total ephedrine or atropine dose was being recorded. The occurrence of every allergy signs, such as itches, hives, or red skin were recorded after doing spinal anesthesia or at the end of recovery. Finally, with the birth of the newborn, Apgar score recorded at the 1<sup>st</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> min. Furthermore, data refer to the hemodynamic condition of the parturients such as heart beat, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure was recorded during the operation.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS 20 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
