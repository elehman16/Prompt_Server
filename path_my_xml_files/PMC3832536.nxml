The responsiveness of allergic reactions to psychological factors is also reflected by high placebo response rates in clinical studies with allergic patients, in which placebos are routinely employed to test the effectiveness of a drug or a treatment <xref rid="pone.0079576-Eccles1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0079576-Sastre1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. During the last decade experimental studies demonstrated that the placebo response is mediated primarily via distinct but interrelated mechanisms <xref rid="pone.0079576-Finniss1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Cognitive factors such as patient expectations of the benefit of a treatment as well as associative learning (conditioning) procedures are steering the placebo response across different diseases and physiological systems <xref rid="pone.0079576-Price1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0079576-Enck2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.

After five days of desloratadine intake patients in the conditioned group showed the expected reduction of wheals sizes and symptom scores. In addition, a significant reduction in symptom scores was also observed in the sham-conditioned group. During the evocation phase, patients in the conditioned group showed a significantly reduced wheal size after the 1<sup>st</sup> but not after the 5<sup>th</sup> evocation. In contrast, symptom scores were significantly reduced after the 1<sup>st</sup> as well as after the 5<sup>th</sup> evocation trial in comparison to the natural history group. Interestingly, sham-conditioned patients also showed significant reductions in wheal sizes and symptom scores and did not statistically differ from patients in the conditioned group, indicating a placebo response primarily induced by expectation rather than via associative learning processes.</p><p>Cognitive factors such as expectation of patients towards the benefit of a forthcoming treatment and associative learning processes have been demonstrated as crucial neuropsychological factors steering the placebo response <xref rid="pone.0079576-Price1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0079576-Vits1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, which of these two factors is mediating the placebo response in various clinical conditions is largely unknown. Expectation is mediating placebo effects in many clinical conditions such as pain or Parkinson <xref rid="pone.0079576-Kotsis1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0079576-delaFuenteFernandez1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> and expectation induced placebo analgesia can be maximized through prior learning experience <xref rid="pone.0079576-Colloca1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. However, autonomous functions such as hormone release or peripheral immune functions are believed to be primarily affected by associative learning processes and not by mere cognitive factors such as expectation <xref rid="pone.0079576-Benedetti3" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079576-Albring1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In allergic diseases, data on the effects of expectation-induced placebo responses on objective and clinical relevant measures are somewhat controversial. A pronounced placebo response was observed in bronchial hyper-reactivity in asthma patients <xref rid="pone.0079576-Kemeny1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. More recently, expectation-induced placebo effects improved the subjective well-being in asthma patients, however did not affect the forced expiratory volume analyzed by spirometry <xref rid="pone.0079576-Wechsler1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In patients with house dust mite allergy, the subjective total symptom rating as well as the skin prick test was significantly reduced by placebo responses induced by a learning protocol as well as via expectation; however, <italic>ex vivo</italic> basophile activation was significantly suppressed only in patients undergoing the learning protocol but not by mere expectation <xref rid="pone.0079576-Goebel2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In our study, the mere expectation of receiving an active drug with a probability of 50% induced a placebo response in wheal size and symptom score during the evocations in the sham-conditioned group that was as pronounced as the learned placebo response in the conditioned group. These results confirm earlier observations of an expectation-induced placebo response in objective and clinical relevant measures as a component of allergy treatment <xref rid="pone.0079576-Eccles1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079576-Mansfield1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>The sustainability and reproducibility of placebo responses in different clinical conditions is still an open question <xref rid="pone.0079576-Enck1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079576-Enck2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079576-Schedlowski1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. We could recently demonstrate that a learned placebo response on the inhibition of cytokine release in healthy subjects can be reproduced by mere re-exposure to the taste stimulus used as a CS <xref rid="pone.0079576-Wirth1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In this study, a significant inhibition in symptom score was observed after the 1<sup>st</sup> but also after the 5<sup>th</sup> unreinforced re-exposure to the CS in the conditioned but also sham conditioned patients, indicating that the placebo response in house dust mite allergy is not restricted to a single event. However, how long-lasting this placebo response on the allergic reaction is has to be analyzed in further studies.</p><p>When designing this study we intended to test the effectiveness of the learning protocol under partial &#x0201c;natural conditions&#x0201d;. Thus, during acquisition and evocation phases patients were asked to take the drink (CS) as well as the drug or placebo respectively at home. On the one hand this design increased the external validity of our data, on the other hand, this might have also limited the effect size in the conditioned group. The hospital environment and medical atmosphere together with the doctor who delivers the pill and the drink might have been important contextual cues further augmenting the conditioned effect <xref rid="pone.0079576-Bouton1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. In addition, although all patients confirmed drug and CS intake at home, the lack of control of patients&#x02019; compliance is certainly limiting the interpretation of these data.</p><p>In this study, we induced the expectation of a 50% probability to receive an active drug during each pill intake. Since experimental and clinical studies show that the likelihood of being in a treatment group increases the size of placebo responses <xref rid="pone.0079576-Lidstone1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079576-Pollo1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0079576-Elsenbruch1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> it remains to be investigated whether the employment of a deceptive paradigm that induces a 100% expectation of receiving an active drug although actually a placebo is given <xref rid="pone.0079576-Colloca1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079576-Kemeny1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079576-Klinger1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079576-Wise1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> will induce a more pronounced placebo response in allergic reactions. Also, an interesting approach with regard to the applicability of placebos in clinical routine for the benefit of the patient, is the administration of open-label placebo <xref rid="pone.0079576-Kaptchuk1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079576-Kelley1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, which remains to be tested for its effectiveness in allergy.</p><p>In summary, these data demonstrate placebo responses on wheal sizes after skin prick test and symptom scores in patients with house dust mite allergy which are induced by behavioral conditioning as well as cognitive expectation. These data might have implications for clinical trials in allergic patients and might provide a basis for systematically employing placebo responses in combination with pharmacological treatment with the aim to maximize treatment outcome for the patient benefit.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0079576-KiecoltGlaser1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
