This Phase Ib study investigated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics of intravenous (i.v.) atacicept in patients with mild-to-moderate SLE. Patients (<italic>n</italic> = 24) were randomised (5:1) to receive atacicept (single dose: 3, 9 or 18 mg/kg; or multiple dose: 2 &#x000d7; 9 mg/kg) or matching placebo. Patients were followed for 6 weeks after dosing (9 weeks in the 2 &#x000d7; 9 mg/kg cohort). Local tolerability of atacicept was comparable with that of placebo, with only mild injection-site reactions reported with atacicept. Atacicept i.v. was generally well tolerated, both systemically and locally, in patients with mild-to-moderate SLE. Atacicept displayed non-linear PK, which was predictable across doses and between single and repeat doses. The biological activity of atacicept was demonstrated by its marked effect in reducing B-cells and Ig levels in patients with SLE. This supports the utility of this therapeutic approach in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, such as SLE.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>APRIL</kwd><kwd>atacicept</kwd><kwd>biological agents</kwd><kwd>BLyS</kwd><kwd>systemic lupus erythematosus</kwd><kwd>TACI-Ig</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-0961203309102803"><title>Introduction</title><p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune disease that primarily affects women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203309102803">1</xref></sup> The symptoms of SLE affect many different parts of the body, including the joints, skin, blood, brain and kidneys, and its effects can be fatal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203309102803">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203309102803">2</xref></sup> Historically, hydroxychloroquine sulphate and corticosteroids, together with varying combinations of immunosuppressants, have been the main treatments for SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203309102803">3</xref></sup> These therapies have been associated with poor safety profiles and/or low response rates, leading to a high unmet therapeutic need among patients with SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203309102803">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203309102803">4</xref></sup> Recent developments in genetic and immunological techniques have advanced our understanding of the basic molecular and cellular processes underlying the pathogenesis of SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203309102803">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203309102803"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203309102803">7</xref></sup> This has led to the development of a new generation of SLE therapies designed to target specific steps in the disease process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203309102803">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203309102803"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203309102803"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203309102803"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203309102803"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203309102803">13</xref></sup> It is hoped that these new, targeted therapies, when compared with conventional SLE treatments, will have improved safety profiles and similar or improved efficacy.</p><p>SLE is characterised by the production of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203309102803">2</xref></sup> which are thought to play a central role in the disease, targeting healthy tissues throughout the body.

Median disease duration was 6.0 years, and patients generally showed characteristics of mild-to-moderate SLE, with signs and symptoms affecting a wide range of organ systems. Overall, all patients (100%) satisfied at least four of the 11 ACR criteria for SLE; 38% of patients satisfied four ACR criteria, 42% satisfied five criteria, 13% satisfied six criteria and 8% satisfied seven criteria. Baseline SLE clinical manifestations based on the ACR criteria included: arthritis (91.7%), photosensitivity (66.7%), malar rash (58.3%), oral ulcers (16.7%), serositis (12.5%), haematological manifestations (33.3%), discoid lupus (41.7%) and renal involvement (25.0%).

Results showed that atacicept was well tolerated by patients with SLE, both systemically and locally, at a total dose of up to 18 mg/kg (as either a single dose or 2 &#x000d7; 9 mg/kg injections). Few AEs were observed and they were mild or moderate in severity. Decreased WBC counts occurred in two patients from the 2 &#x000d7; 9 mg/kg atacicept dose cohort. However, both patients had low WBC counts at baseline, and no significant decreases in WBC count were observed in the other patients in the study. Nevertheless, the number of patients is too small to draw any conclusions with respect to the use of multiple i.v. doses of atacicept in patients with pre-existing leucopenia. Local tolerability of atacicept was good with only transient, mild injection-site reactions reported. Overall, our results confirmed the favourable safety profile of atacicept that was observed previously with subcutaneous administration in healthy volunteers and in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0961203309102803">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0961203309102803">32</xref></sup> Notably, there did not appear to be any safety concerns associated with concomitant administration of atacicept and medications commonly used in the management of SLE.</p><p>The PK profile of atacicept was non-linear but was predictable across doses and between single and repeat doses. Maximum free atacicept concentrations were achieved at a median of 0.25&#x02013;0.5 hours post-dose. The slight delay in the maximum (relative to the instantaneous input assumption related to i.v. administration) is probably due to initial mixing into the central compartment.</p><p>Treatment with atacicept resulted in a reduction of B-cells and Ig levels in patients with SLE indicating biological activity consistent with its MoA. Specifically, reductions in mature B-cell counts and decreases in Ig levels are consistent with inhibition of BLyS and APRIL activity. Overall, PD effects were most marked in the 2 &#x000d7; 9 mg/kg group. This group showed a 55% reduction from baseline in mature B-cells 7 weeks after the second dose. In this study, we also observed marked reductions in IgM (&#x02013;40%), IgA (&#x02013;33%) and IgG (&#x02013;20%) in the 2 &#x000d7; 9 mg/kg group 6 weeks after repeat dosing. Taken together, these data show that atacicept has a potent effect on B-cells and Ig levels in patients with SLE. These findings are consistent with those of a recent study of subcutaneously administered atacicept in patients with SLE that demonstrated sustained reductions in total and mature B-cells and in Ig levels at all doses, which were particularly marked in the repeat-dose groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0961203309102803">35</xref></sup> This supports the utility of this therapeutic approach in the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as SLE.</p><p>Atacicept is one of a number of agents designed specifically to target B-cells in patients with SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203309102803">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203309102803">13</xref></sup> Rituximab, epratuzumab, atacicept and belimumab are all at various stages of clinical development for SLE. All of these agents bind to B-cell surface molecules, but affect B-cell activity in different ways. The monoclonal antibodies rituximab and epratuzumab bind to CD20 and CD22 cell-surface antigens, respectively, causing B-cell death,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0961203309102803">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0961203309102803">37</xref></sup> whereas atacicept and belimumab (anti-BLyS monoclonal antibodies) prevent ligands from binding to cell-surface receptors, inhibiting B-cell growth and development, and reducing Ig production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0961203309102803">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0961203309102803">38</xref></sup> These differential MoAs are likely to result in different benefit-to-risk profiles for each agent. For example, the ability of atacicept to bind to both BLyS and APRIL may lead to a greater efficacy compared with belimumab, which binds only to BLyS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0961203309102803">38</xref></sup> Safety profiles may also differ according to the mechanism by which B-cell activity is reduced. While rituximab and epratuzumab may increase the risk of AEs associated with B-cell depletion, this may not be the case for atacicept and belimumab, which reduce B-cell activity but have a less profound effect on B-cell numbers. With this in mind, it is encouraging that none of the infection-related events we report here were considered to be related to atacicept and that atacicept did not compromise vaccine immunisation status.</p><p>In conclusion, i.v. atacicept was well tolerated, both systemically and locally, in patients with mild-to-moderate SLE at the doses investigated and demonstrated clear biological activity consistent with its predicted MoA. PK and PD results from this study will aid dose selection in larger studies that will further investigate the safety and efficacy of atacicept in patients with SLE.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Imogen Horsey for medical writing assistance during the preparation of this manuscript (supported by Merck Serono S.A.
