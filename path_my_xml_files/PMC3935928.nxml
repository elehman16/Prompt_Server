Three different RUTI doses and placebo were tested, randomized both in HIV-positive (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;47) and HIV-negative subjects (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;48), after completion of one month isoniazid (INH) pre-vaccination. Each subject received two vaccine administrations, 28 Days apart. Five patients withdrew and 90 patients completed the study. Assessment of safety showed no deaths during study. Two subjects had serious adverse events one had a retinal detachment while taking INH and was not randomized and the other had a severe local injection site abscess on each arm and was hospitalized; causality was assessed as very likely and by the end of the study the outcome had resolved. All the patients except 5 (21%) patients of the placebo group (3 HIV+ and 2 HIV&#x02212;) reported at least one adverse event (AE) during the study. The most frequently occurring AEs among RUTI recipients were (% in HIV+/&#x02212;): injection site reactions [erythema (91/92), induration (94/92), local nodules (46/25), local pain (66/75), sterile abscess (6/6), swelling (74/83), ulcer (20/11), headache (17/22) and nasopharyngitis (20/5)]. These events were mostly mild and well tolerated. Overall, a polyantigenic response was observed, which differed by HIV&#x02212; status. The best polyantigenic response was obtained when administrating 25 &#x000b5;g RUTI, especially in HIV-positive subjects which was not increased after the second inoculation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This Phase II clinical trial demonstrates reasonable tolerability of RUTI. The immunogenicity profile of RUTI vaccine in LTBI subjects, even being variable among groups, allows us considering one single injection of one of the highest doses in future trials, preceded by an extended safety clinical phase.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p> ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01136161">NCT01136161</ext-link>

In 2011, there were 8.7 million incident cases of TB, almost 1 million deaths from TB among HIV-negative people and an additional 0.43 million deaths from HIV-associated TB <xref rid="pone.0089612-World1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. One third of the world&#x02019;s population is infected with latent TB, and at risk of developing the active disease. Latently infected <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> individuals have the possibility to develop active TB throughout their lives. Progression to active TB is relatively low in HIV-negative subjects (from 5 to 25% of infected people), although even this low percentage represents 9 million new TB cases every year <xref rid="pone.0089612-Parrish1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Moreover, in HIV infected subjects, reactivation of TB disease incidence can be 10 to 100 times higher <xref rid="pone.0089612-HarrisA1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Standard treatment for latent TB infection (LTBI) requires the administration of isoniazid (INH) from 6 to 9 months, which results in important compliance problems. Moreover, this treatment does not ensure the complete cure of the patient and it is not exempt of adverse effects <xref rid="pone.0089612-Comstock1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Current knowledge of latent bacilli and of the lesions with which they are associated suggests that these bacilli survive inside granulomas. In particular within the central necrotic core and inside the neighbour layer of foamy macrophages (FM). Following its natural evolution, FM drain from the granuloma to alveolar spaces and release dormant bacilli into the airways that can reinfect healthy parenchyma. A new therapeutic vaccine, RUTI, was designed to generate a polyantigenic immune response that targets bacilli that persist after isoniazid preventive therapy and to activate naive macrophages that are phagocyting the necrotic tissue that contains them <xref rid="pone.0089612-Cardona1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0089612-Cardona3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>RUTI is a polyantigenic liposomal vaccine made of detoxified, fragmented <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> cells (FCMtb), for the prevention of active TB in subjects with LTBI. It is developed in Badalona (Catalonia, Spain) by Archivel Farma.

AEs detected by the investigator through interrogation or reported by the subject during the defined period of collection of AE were recorded. Adverse events were classified using the System Organ Class (SOC) of MedDRA. Participants with SAEs were followed-up until events resolved.</p><p>Safety monitoring of hematological and biochemical parameters were measured at screening at days 21, 28, 35, 49, 56, 63 and 84. Trends in viral load and CD4 counts in HIV-positive patients were also assessed.</p><p>An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) &#x02013; was established to supervise the study and to monitor the trial subjects, and to assess the progress of the clinical trial and the safety data.

PBMC processing was done at most 4 hours after bleeding.</p><p>Cellular mediated immunity was assessed using ELISPOT and ELISA techniques. IFN &#x003b3; Spot Forming Units were measured in the trial subjects&#x02019; peripheral blood after stimulation with up to five stimuli [ESAT 6, CFP10 16 kDa, Ag85B and 38 kDa <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> antigens, and protein purified derivative (PPD)] for 18 hours. A long-term interferon- &#x003b3; assay (WHO assay) was performed by stimulating the whole blood for seven days with PPD (reference). A commercial T cell Interferon gamma release assay (TSPOT TB assay) was also performed. Humoral response were studied using the commercial kitt Pathozyme TB Complex Assay (Omega Diagnostics, Ltd. Alva, Scotland, UK) to detect IgG against 16 kDa and 38 kDa <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> antigens. Time points were Days 0, 28 (pre-1<sup>st</sup> dose), 35, 56 (pre-2<sup>nd</sup> dose) and 63. All the samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and analyzed at the end of the trial to minimize inter assay variability.</p><p>Individual data were listed by subject and time point including changes from baseline and whether or not the subject was classified as a responder. Responders at each time point were defined as those subjects for whom the change from baseline induced by vaccination for the specific stimulus and time point was higher than the median of the change from baseline obtained in the placebo group (for a given HIV-status) at the same time point and stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>Given that this was a phase II safety and immunogenicity trial a formal sample size calculation was not made. In any case, the numbers in each group (12 subjects), are comparable with the standard sample sizes used in these types of studies.</p><p>Changes from baseline were analysed using a repeated measures ANCOVA with treatment and time point as fixed effects and the baseline measurement (Day 28, pre-inoculation) as a covariate in the analysis. A separate analysis was performed for each of the measured immunogenicity variables for TB ELISPOT (CFP10, HPHA, ESAT 6, 16 kDa, Ag85B and 38 kDa <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> antigens, PPD, PHA and a negative control), IFN-&#x003b3; (PPD, PHA and negative control), and TB Complex (pathozyme) assay. Confidence intervals for the change from baseline versus placebo were obtained for each dose and day. The placebo subjects were pooled for the purpose of the analysis. The analysis was repeated for the population as a whole and stratified by HIV status.</p><p>An additional non-parametric analysis was also performed. The same analysis of variance (ANOVA) model was used (without the baseline covariate); however the change from baseline (dependent variable) was substituted by a rank transformation. The rank transformation was performed by ordering all the changes from baseline in consecutive, ascending order, separately for each parameter and group (i.e., overall, HIV negative and HIV positive) and then ranking these from 1 to &#x02018;n&#x02019;. The ranked values were included into the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Ethics</title><p>The study was carried out in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.

More skin reactions were observed in HIV-negative and HIV-positive groups at the higher doses (25 &#x000b5;g and 50 &#x000b5;g) of RUTI. The 23 subjects of the group of 5 &#x000b5;g group reported 117 occurrences (22%), 65 (26%) in HIV-negative and 52 (19%) in HIV-positive; the 24 subjects of the 25 &#x000b5;g group reported 194 occurrences (37%); 89 (36%) in HIV-negative and 105 (38%) in HIV-positive; the 24 subjects of the 50 &#x000b5;g group reported 211 occurrences (40%), 93 (38%) in HIV-negative and 118 (43%) in HIV-positive. It should be noted that there was a high number of local nodules (twenty-five subjects had 43 occurrences of local nodules), which occurred more frequently in HIV-positive subjects and worsened after the second injection. Of the 25 participants with injection site local nodules, four subjects underwent incision, surgical drainage and culture of local abscess. The cultures&#x02019; results were indicative of sterile abscesses. 11 subjects had 15 occurrences of ulcers. In general, the occurrences of ulcers were assessed as mild and moderate in intensity.</p><p>The highest pain scores on the visual analogue scale (VAS) were reported on Day 31, being the median score value of 3, 3.5 and 20 in the 5 &#x000b5;g, 25 &#x000b5;g and 50 &#x000b5;g RUTI dose groups respectively in HIV-positive group, and with less intensity on Day 59.

Whilst these events were assessed as moderate and mild in intensity, fecaloma was assessed as severe in intensity; causality was assessed as not related, according to the investigator criteria.

The RUTI safety profile was considered acceptable since only two subjects had SAEs; most AEs reported were mild in intensity, which means the event did not interfere with daily activities, and were well tolerated. The most frequent local reactions at the injection site were local nodules, erythema, induration, swelling and pain as have been recorded in other clinical trials <xref rid="pone.0089612-Hoft1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089612-vanDissel1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. There were no deaths during the study. It is important to stress the high number of local nodules observed, and that in four subjects who developed abscesses, drainage was required. A proportion of local self-resolving nodules at the site of vaccination was previously reported in TB vaccinated subjects with previous or latently TB infection <xref rid="pone.0089612-vanDissel2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. We have not been able to discern what the origin of such reaction was because it was not related with the intensity of the specific immune response monitored. Related to the higher number of local nodules at the injection site reported in HIV-positive subjects, as this group of patients showed a lower immunological response than in HIV-negative ones, local nodulation cannot be correlated with the systemic immunological response. The hypothesis to explain this occurrence of local self-resolving nodules at the site of vaccination could be because HIV infection promotes local inflammation of adipose tissue, thus increasing the inflammatory response caused by the subcutaneous delivery of the vaccine <xref rid="pone.0089612-Giralt1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This local reactogenicity should be closely monitored in future trials by doing extra visits considering the time when these events occurred in this trial.</p><p>The injection site pain was also a common local adverse event, which spontaneously resolved one week after vaccination (data not shown). The intensity of pain was considered by the subjects as mild and was similar to the intensity of pain demonstrated in the Phase I trial <xref rid="pone.0089612-Vilaplana1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Of note, one of the most frequently occurring local adverse events observed in the Phase I trial was twitching at the injection site, occurring in all the treatment groups (RUTI and placebo) <xref rid="pone.0089612-Vilaplana1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. One of the objectives of RUTI development was to avoid this adverse event; twitching was not observed in any of the three doses of the vaccine used in this trial, reinforcing the idea that the addition of a stabilising excipient (i.e., sucrose) in the RUTI vaccine formulation has proven to be essential.</p><p>No clinically significant changes in laboratory biochemistry and/or haematology were observed. Safety results are in line with those obtained in previous studies carried out, in similar conditions (i.e. vaccinating with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> antigens in already infected subjects) even if it is difficult to compare results because there are differences in vaccines&#x02019; origin, different regimens and target population <xref rid="pone.0089612-Hoft1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089612-vanDissel1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089612-VonEschen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>RUTI vaccine did not cause any variation in the HIV viral load or CD4 counts, thus the vaccination did not affect the evolution of HIV infection, unlike some other vaccines which induced a transient increase of the viral load concurrently associated to the loss of CD4 counts <xref rid="pone.0089612-Castro1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, although this must be interpreted with caution as the number of subjects were relatively low.</p><p>The mechanisms of immune protection against human TB are not fully known, however, it is recognized a protective immunity against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> mainly due to the generation of Th1-type cellular response characterized by interferon-gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;) production <xref rid="pone.0089612-Agger1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0089612-Hanekom1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Therefore, the current TB vaccine (BCG), and most new vaccines under development aim to induce this immunity <xref rid="pone.0089612-Hanekom1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>Different experimental models of TB in mice have demonstrated that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> grew again after short-term chemotherapy, and this was not followed by an immediate stimulation of immunity. One of the aims of this vaccine was to fill the immunological gap left by short-term therapy for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. Therefore, the original idea of introducing this vaccine was to &#x0201c;boost&#x0201d; the dominant immunological response against growing <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> that already exists in the host. Moreover, this vaccine was also designed to trigger a new immunological response against antigens of the latent bacilli <xref rid="pone.0089612-Cardona2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>All the pre-clinical and phase I clinical trials conducted with the vaccine RUTI showed (as it has been published elsewhere) that it is able to generate a cellular immune response measurable as IFN-&#x003b3; secretion. In the present study, ELISPOT results in HIV-negative individuals with 5 &#x000b5;g or 25 &#x000b5;g RUTI showed a good immune response, with a slight increase after the second vaccination. However, the injection of 50 &#x000b5;g RUTI loses the polyantigenic response, favouring the response towards ESAT-6. How this response can also influence the memory immunity is difficult to explain, as it seems that there is an excessive response of effectors cells that may compromise the memory response. The immunological response in HIV-positive subjects displayed a similar polyantigenic profile after the first injection of 25 or 50 &#x000b5;g RUTI which was not increased after the second injection. It is interesting to stress that even when we do expected an increase of the cellular immune response as a consequence of a vaccine intake, we detected a decreased response to CFP10 (in both HIV-positive and HIV-negative groups). This fact is of importance as CFP-10 decreased response is linked to protection <xref rid="pone.0089612-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Although a variable pattern of responses has been seen, the immunological results from this study showed that a polyantigenic response was triggered by RUTI vaccination against structural and secreted <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> antigens, and suggest that only one vaccination will be needed to increase the immune response after short term chemotherapy <xref rid="pone.0089612-Cardona2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089612-Guirado1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>The memory immune response using the WHO test assay showed a dose response relationship in the HIV-positive subjects after a single inoculation which lessened after the second inoculation. The best response was obtained using 50 &#x000b5;g RUTI vaccine and a good response was also observed in 25 &#x000b5;g RUTI. Related to the HIV-negative subjects, it is noticed a response peak with 25 &#x000b5;g RUTI dose after the first inoculation which was sustained after the second inoculation. Intriguingly, we have observed a decrease in this response after the 50 &#x000b5;g RUTI dose, caused by a sort of saturation phenomenon, that would require further studies to be confirmed. The percentage of responders was assessed as a post-hoc analysis, and was done in order to have an overall picture of the global immunologic response. Results obtained were consistent with the ones obtained when analysing the intensity of the immune response, as previously mentioned.</p><p>The intensity of the immune response, which is of a magnitude of about 2 log variation, is significantly lower than that reported in other clinical trials in subjects with LTBI <xref rid="pone.0089612-vanDissel2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However the magnitudes of responses are similar to those seen with BCG and SSI H1 vaccines in adults <xref rid="pone.0089612-Hoft1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089612-VonEschen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The antigens used in this study are an extract of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> containing several antigens but all in low concentrations, which are less reactive than peptides used for peripheral blood mononuclear cell stimulation <xref rid="pone.0089612-Hawkridge1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089612-Sander1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>All the attempts to compare the immune responses between different studies must be viewed with caution since there are differences in origin of vaccines, dosing regimens and the diverse populations studied and assays used <xref rid="pone.0089612-Hoft1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089612-vanDissel1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089612-VonEschen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Until now, none of the current vaccines against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection are tested as therapeutic agents after short-term chemotherapy; therefore no real comparison could be made with the results obtained in this CT. Overall, these results are consistent with our preliminary phase I results <xref rid="pone.0089612-Vilaplana1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, where the administration of 25 &#x000b5;g RUTI achieved the best cellular polyantigenic response, and where no relevant humoral response was detected.</p><p>In summary, these results show a relative acceptable safety, however the induction of local abscess requires further research. Equally, the immunogenicity profile of RUTI vaccine in LTBI subjects, even being variable among groups, allows us considering one single injection of one of the highest doses in future trials, preceded by an extended safety clinical phase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0089612.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
