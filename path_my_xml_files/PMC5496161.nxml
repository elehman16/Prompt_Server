Many transfusions are given to stable and non-bleeding patients despite no clear evidence of benefit from clinical studies. Audit and feedback (A&#x00026;F) is widely used to improve the quality of healthcare, including appropriate use of blood. However, its effects are often inconsistent, indicating the need for coordinated research including more head-to-head trials comparing different ways of delivering feedback. A programmatic series of research projects, termed the &#x02018;<underline>A</underline>udit and <underline>F</underline>eedback <underline>IN</underline>terventions to <underline>I</underline>ncrease evidence-based <underline>T</underline>ransfusion practIcE&#x02019; (AFFINITIE) programme, aims to test different ways of developing and delivering feedback within an existing national audit structure.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The evaluation will comprise two linked 2&#x000d7;2 factorial, cross-sectional cluster-randomised controlled trials. Each trial will estimate the effects of two feedback interventions, &#x02018;enhanced content&#x02019; and &#x02018;enhanced follow-on support&#x02019;, designed in earlier stages of the AFFINITIE programme, compared to current practice. The interventions will be embedded within two rounds of the UK National Comparative Audit of Blood Transfusion (NCABT) focusing on patient blood management in surgery and use of blood transfusions in patients with haematological malignancies. The unit of randomisation will be National Health Service (NHS) trust or health board. Clusters providing care relevant to the audit topics will be randomised following each baseline audit (separately for each trial), with stratification for size (volume of blood transfusions) and region (Regional Transfusion Committee). The primary outcome for each topic will be the proportion of patients receiving a transfusion coded as unnecessary. For each audit topic a linked, mixed-method fidelity assessment and cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted in parallel to the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">AFFINITIE involves a series of studies to explore how A&#x00026;F may be refined to change practice including two cluster randomised trials linked to national audits of transfusion practice.

The most frequently transfused blood component is red cells, but audits of practice continue to document administration of red cells to groups of stable and non-bleeding patients despite the lack of clear evidence of benefit from clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Unnecessary transfusion exposes patients to risk, well described by haemovigilance systems such as Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT) in UK, with impacts on mortality and morbidity, through errors in administration and processing, transfusion transmitted infections, acute lung injury and circulatory overload [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">Active strategies are usually needed to close the gap between recommended and actual clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Audit and feedback (A&#x00026;F) is one such widely used approach, defined as a summary of the clinical performance of healthcare providers over a specified period of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In England, the National Health Service Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) National Comparative Audit (NCA) programme has supported a series of national audits designed to assess whether blood components are used appropriately and safely across clinical specialties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although participation is voluntary, there are high levels of participation in NCABT audits. Two or three times a year an audit-writing group is assembled, usually comprising an audit lead (typically a consultant haematologist with an interest in transfusion), statistician and clinical staff representatives from the clinical specialty being audited (e.g. orthopaedics). This group agrees upon audit standards against which clinical practice will be compared, the data to be collected and the findings and recommendations to be included in feedback reports. Resulting feedback reports are subsequently made available to the hospital transfusion team (i.e. transfusion practitioner, consultant haematologist, transfusion laboratory manager) via a hospital-specific NCABT audit webpage. Each team is subsequently responsible for disseminating reports within its hospital and, where feedback indicates discrepancies between current practice and audit standards, leading action to improve practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">Despite this rolling programme of national audits, around 20% of transfusions continue to fall outside recommended practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], consistent with other international experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Amongst several possibilities, one likely key explanation for this lack of progress is the variable effectiveness of A&#x00026;F as an intervention. A Cochrane review of 140 randomised trials found that A&#x00026;F had modest effects on patient processes of care, leading to a median of 4.3% absolute improvement in compliance with recommended practice (interquartile range 0.5 to 16%). One quarter of A&#x00026;F interventions had a relatively large, positive effect on quality of care, while another quarter had a negative or null effect. The reasons behind this variation are only partially understood, and further research is needed to improve the consistency and magnitude of the effects of A&#x00026;F. Furthermore, the relative paucity of head-to-head comparisons of different methods of providing feedback makes it difficult to recommend the use of one feedback strategy over another on empirical grounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">The AFFINITIE programme, &#x02018;<underline>A</underline>udit and <underline>F</underline>eedback <underline>IN</underline>terventions to <underline>I</underline>ncrease evidence-based <underline>T</underline>ransfusion practice,&#x02019; aims to develop and evaluate different ways of delivering feedback embedded in the existing series of audits conducted by the NCABT. The overarching goal is to promote the uptake of evidence-based transfusion guidance and to reduce the unnecessary use of blood components. The AFFINITIE programme follows the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) Framework for the design and evaluation of complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and comprises four work streams with the following objectives:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par28">To develop, pilot and refine two feedback interventions, referred to as &#x02018;enhanced content&#x02019; and &#x02018;enhanced follow-on support&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>];</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par29">To evaluate effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the two enhanced feedback interventions compared with current standard feedback practice;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par30">To investigate the intervention fidelity, including mechanisms of change, for the evaluated interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>];</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par31">To develop general implementation recommendations and tools for relevant A&#x00026;F programmes in the wider NHS.</p></list-item></list>

The two transfusion topics, transfusions in surgical and haematological patients, respectively, were identified and planned by the usual processes conducted by the NCABT. Alongside each audit, we will evaluate two multi-component feedback interventions (enhanced content or enhanced follow-on support) which may be applied singly or in combination; these will be compared with standard feedback, where neither intervention is delivered. Enhanced interventions were developed and piloted in Work Stream 1 of the AFFINITIE Programme based on relevant theory and evidence related to A&#x00026;F [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. All feedback, whether enhanced or standard, is directed at clinical teams within hospital trusts and health boards across the UK. The effects of feedback will be assessed using a range of clinical, cost, safety and process end-points.

</p><p id="Par34">NHS Trusts and Health Boards can consist of more than one hospital which is covered by a single Hospital Transfusion Team. In addition, several NHS Trusts may share the same Hospital Transfusion Team. Therefore, the unit of randomisation (i.e. cluster) is NHS trust or health board, or group of NHS trusts, to minimise the contamination risk resulting from feedback being directed at a Hospital Transfusion Team that may work across hospitals or NHS Trusts. We adopted, by necessity, a cross-sectional design in which different patients (i.e. cases) are audited at baseline and follow-up (given that it is unlikely that the same patients will receive transfusions during both periods). While there may be some overlap in clinical staff involved in transfusing patients within a cluster over time, a cross-sectional design is assumed here too. Eligible clusters may take part in one or both transfusion audits and associated trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Trial participants</title><p id="Par35">Inclusion criteria are: (i) provision of an NHS service relevant to an audit topic and (ii) acceptance of the invitation by the NCA to participate in the audit. Independent hospitals are not eligible for participation in AFFINITIE, as clinicians involved in transfusion decisions at the NHS trusts and health boards are also likely to practice at independent hospitals, potentially leading to contamination. We will also exclude four NHS trusts that participated in earlier intervention development work. They will still be invited to take part in the national audits and will receive both enhanced feedback interventions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Clusters</title><p id="Par36">The NCABT will invite NHS trusts and health boards to participate in the audit. The AFFINITIE team will subsequently contact the appropriate transfusion or haematology clinical lead at all sites participating in the audit. This letter will explain that the AFFINITIE program is conducting research to enhance existing quality improvement methods and that involves randomising sites to different types of feedback from the NCABT. We will further explain that the research team will contact the relevant research and development department to seek necessary permissions and that the clinical lead need take no further action. Sites declining participation in the randomised evaluation will be excluded but continue to participate in the NCABT. If the clinical lead has not declined participation within 2&#x000a0;weeks, we will assume that they wish to be included in the study. The AFFINITIE team will seek to obtain permission from the sites that have expressed an interest, or have not declined to participate in the research.</p><p id="Par37">We will document and report reasons for non-participation. Where at least one hospital site within a trust or health board is eligible, the trust or health board will be regarded as eligible. Where multiple hospital sites are eligible within a trust or health board, or where multiple hospitals are known to share a Transfusion Team, the NCABT may treat them as separate but we will regard them as a single cluster for the purposes of randomisation and analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Randomisation</title><p id="Par38">As part of the 2&#x000d7;2 design, participating trusts and health boards will be randomised to one of four arms: (i) &#x02018;standard content&#x02019; and &#x02018;standard follow-on support&#x02019;; (ii) &#x02018;standard content&#x02019; and &#x02018;enhanced follow-on support&#x02019;; (iii) &#x02018;enhanced content&#x02019; and &#x02018;standard follow-on support&#x02019;; and (iv) &#x02018;enhanced content&#x02019; and &#x02018;enhanced follow-on support&#x02019;. The randomisations will follow baseline data collection in the two audits. The Clinical Trials Research Unit (CTRU) will use an automated system to randomise eligible, consenting trusts and health boards on a 1:1:1:1 basis. A computer-generated minimisation programme, incorporating a random element, will be used to ensure intervention arms are balanced for the following cluster-level characteristics:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par39">Trust or health board size based on number of audit cases. For each audit, we will review the number of cases submitted to baseline audit per cluster, break these down into thirds (large, medium and small) and later report the final cut-off points used.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par40">Regional Transfusion Committee (RTC). These cover geographical regions and undertake activities to promote good transfusion practice and to oversee local Hospital Transfusion Committees.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="Par41">The second transfusion topic (haematology patients) will be used to guide whether the results from the first audit (surgical patients) evaluation can be generalised. We will randomise the four trial arms to clusters separately for each transfusion audit topic, using a &#x0201c;split-block&#x0201d; design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], rather than keep the allocations the same across topics within trusts/health boards. This design separates the effects of the feedback interventions from time and topic to produce unbiased estimates of effects across trials, increasing the robustness of conclusions drawn from the second trial. The randomised allocation to the first trial will be an additional stratification factor in the randomisation to the second trial. If trusts or health boards merge following randomisation in each trial, they will continue to be regarded as separate and distinct clusters for the intervention, data collection and analysis of that trial. Clusters that merge between trials will be reviewed and a decision made on whether to continue to regard them as distinct clusters in the second trial. Changes will be accounted for in a sensitivity analysis.</p><p id="Par42">Following each randomisation, the CTRU will inform the NCABT, the Chief Investigators and the intervention delivery team of allocations so that appropriate arrangements can be made for intervention delivery as soon as feasible. Other personnel involved in the trial will only be informed of the trial allocation if this is required to undertake their role. We will maintain a log of who is unblinded at specific points in the research process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Feedback interventions</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Standard feedback</title><p id="Par43">Current practice is defined as the standard feedback content and follow-on support delivered by the NCABT following completion of an audit, targeting clinical teams within organisations. Feedback is typically in the form of a written clinical audit report made available via a hospital-specific NCABT audit webpage, a regional PowerPoint presentation and (sometimes) action plan templates. The content of the written report varies, depending on the audit (and will be described in detail). How these clinical teams and organisations respond following receipt of the feedback is regarded as a consequence of the trial interventions&#x02014;but is presently considered to be variable. We expect them to respond in the context of their clinical governance arrangements. Standard follow-on support involves dealing with data queries from hospitals and is provided by the NCABT Programme Manager. No restrictions will be imposed on current practice or on trusts or health boards undertaking additional development or training in the provision of feedback, with the exception that we will request that the staff who receive the feedback do not share it with colleagues external to their own trust or health board. We will assess and describe the detail of standard feedback content and follow-on within each trial as part of the process evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Enhanced content</title><p id="Par44">The enhanced content intervention for each trial has been developed using the current evidence base for A&#x00026;F [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and behaviour change theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">The enhanced content concerns the content and format of feedback reports delivered to hospitals and consists of two components.

For these endpoints, we will present the panel with summary information on baseline achievement of the endpoint and the sample size of the final candidate endpoints to ensure that the selected endpoint does not unacceptably reduce the sample size or power below levels allowed for in sample size calculation.

Existing NCABT procedures for developing a topic-specific audit tool for data collection will be followed. These include convening an Audit Writing Group supported by the NCABT Programme Manager to develop evidence-based audit criteria, ensuring the objectivity of data items collected to minimise observation bias, and incorporating appropriate logic and use of compulsory fields into the online audit tool to maximise the return of complete datasets. The data items collected will depend on the standardised decision algorithm developed for each topic and will include basic patient demographic variables. In line with standard practice, case identification and data collection will be piloted and refined as necessary. Best practice NCABT guidance will be given to trusts and health boards on case identification and data collection, with training recommended and available via the NCABT website.
