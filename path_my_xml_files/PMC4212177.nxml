Even experienced nurses may struggle with such calculations. Learning flexibility and cost considerations make e-learning interesting as an alternative to classroom teaching. This study compared the learning outcome and risk of error after a course in drug dose calculations for nurses with the two methods.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In a randomised controlled open study, nurses from hospitals and primary healthcare were randomised to either e-learning or classroom teaching. Before and after a 2-day course, the nurses underwent a multiple choice test in drug dose calculations: 14 tasks with four alternative answers (score 0&#x02013;14), and a statement regarding the certainty of each answer (score 0&#x02013;3). High risk of error was being certain that incorrect answer was correct. The results are given as the mean (SD).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>16 men and 167 women participated in the study, aged 42.0 (9.5) years with a working experience of 12.3 (9.5) years. The number of correct answers after e-learning was 11.6 (2.0) and after classroom teaching 11.9 (2.0) (p=0.18, NS); improvement were 0.5 (1.6) and 0.9 (2.2), respectively (p=0.07, NS). Classroom learning was significantly superior to e-learning among participants with a pretest score below 9. In support of e-learning was evaluation of specific value for the working situation. There was no difference in risk of error between groups after the course (p=0.77).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The study showed no differences in learning outcome or risk of error between e-learning and classroom teaching in drug dose calculations. The overall learning outcome was small. Weak precourse knowledge was associated with better outcome after classroom teaching.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION &#x00026; MANAGEMENT</kwd><kwd>MEDICAL EDUCATION &#x00026; TRAINING</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Medication errors are often considered to be due to stressful working situations, lapses in attention or disturbances.

The majority of medical students are unable to calculate the mass of a drug in solution correctly, and around half the doctors are unable to convert drug doses correctly from a percentage concentration or dilution to mass concentration.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Nurses carry out practical drug management after the physicians&#x02019; prescriptions both in hospitals and primary healthcare. In Norway, a faultless test in drug dose calculations during nursing education is required to become a registered nurse.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Both nursing students and experienced nurses have problems with drug dose calculations, and nursing students early in the programme showed limited basic skills in arithmetic.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;10</xref> We have shown a high risk of error in conversion of units in 10% of registered nurses in an earlier study.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>E-learning was introduced with the internet in the early 1990s, and has been increasingly used in medical and healthcare education. E-learning is independent of time and place, and the training is easier to organise in the health services than classroom teaching, and at a lower cost. A meta-analysis from 2009 summarised more than 200 studies in health professions education, and concluded that e-learning is associated with large positive effects compared with no intervention, but compared with other interventions the effects are generally small.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> There is a lack of drug dose calculation studies where different didactic methods are compared.</p><p>The objective of this study was to compare the learning outcome, certainty and risk of error in drug dose calculations after courses with either self-directed e-learning or conventional classroom teaching. Further aims were to study factors associated with the learning outcome and risk of error.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design</title><p>A randomised controlled open study with a parallel group design.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants</title><p>Registered nurses working in two hospitals and three municipalities in Eastern Norway were recruited to participate in the study. Inclusion criteria were nurses with at least 1&#x02005;year of work experience in a 50% part-time job or more. Excluded were nurses working in outpatient clinics, those who did not administer drugs and any who did not master the Norwegian language sufficiently. The study was performed from September 2007 to April 2009.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Interventions</title><p>At inclusion, all participants completed a form with relevant background characteristics, and nine statements from the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ 30).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Quality of Life tools are often used to explore psychological well-being. The GHQ 30 contains the dimensions of a sense of coping and self-esteem/well-being, and was used to evaluate to what extent the nurses&#x02019; sense of coping affected their calculation skills. The nurses performed a multiple choice (MCQ) test in drug dose calculations. The questions were standard calculation tasks for bachelor students in nursing at university colleges. The test was taken either on paper or on an internet website. The time available for the test was 1&#x02005;h, and the participants were allowed to use a calculator.</p><p>After the test, the nurses were randomised to one of two 2-day courses in drug dose calculations. One group was assigned to a self-directed, interactive internet-based e-learning course developed at a Norwegian university college. The other was assigned to a 1-day conventional classroom course and a 1-day self-study. The content of the two courses was the same: a review of the basic theory of the different types of calculations, followed by examples and exercises. The topics covered were conversion between units; formulas for dose, quantity and strength; infusions; and dilutions. The e-learning group continued with interactive tests, hints and suggested solutions. They had access to a collection of tests with feedback on answers, and a printout of the compendium was available. The classroom group had 1&#x02005;day lecture covering the basic theory; exercises in groups; discussion in a plenary session and an individual test at the end of the day. The second day was self-study, with a textbook including exercises used at the same college.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Two to four weeks after the course, the nurses were retested in drug dose calculations with a similar MCQ test as the pretest.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Sample size</title><p>Studies testing drug dose calculations in nurses have shown a mean score of 75% (SD 15%).<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;17</xref> In a study with 14 questions, this is equivalent to a score of 10.5 (SD 2.1). To detect a difference of one correct answer between the two didactic methods with a strength of 0.8 and &#x003b1;&#x0003c;0.05, it was necessary to include 74 participants in each group. Owing to the likely dropouts, the aim was to randomise 180 participating nurses.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Randomisation</title><p>At inclusion, each nurse was stratified according to five workplaces: internal medicine, surgery or psychiatric wards in hospitals, and nursing home or ambulatory care in primary healthcare.

Further educational background was recorded (yes/no): mathematics beyond the first mandatory year at upper secondary school; other education prior to nursing; postgraduate specialisation and courses in drug dose calculations during the past 3&#x02005;years. The participants registered motivation for the courses in drug dose calculations, rated as 1=very unmotivated, 2=relatively unmotivated, 3=relatively motivated, 4=very motivated.</p><p>In addition, the participants were asked to consider statements from GHQ 30, in the context of performing medication tasks: five regarding coping (finding life a struggle; being able to enjoy normal activities; feeling reasonably happy; getting scared or panicky for no good reason and being capable of making decisions), and four regarding self-esteem/well-being (overall doing things well; satisfied with the way they have carried out their task; managing to keep busy and occupied; and managing as well as most people in the same situation). The ratings of these statements were 0&#x02013;3: 0=more/better than usual, 1=as usual, 2=less/worse than usual and 3=much less/worse than usual; &#x02018;as usual&#x02019; was defined as the normal state.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Outcomes</title><sec id="s3b1"><title>Drug dose calculation test and certainty in calculations</title><p>A drug dose calculation test was performed before and after the course: 14 MCQs with four alternative answers.

Both methods resulted in improvement of drug dose calculations after the course, although the learning outcome was smaller than what was defined as clinically relevant. Adjusted for other contributing factors for learning outcome in the multivariable analysis, the classroom method was statistically superior to e-learning, and so was the case for a subgroup with a low pretest result. This finding from the post hoc analysis was probably the only outcome that could have a meaningful practical implication for choice of learning strategy, if reproduced in new studies. These results were in accordance with a meta-analysis of 201 trials comparing e-learning with other methods.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The review summarised that any educational action gives a positive outcome, regardless of the method. E-learning works compared with no intervention, but tested against conventional methods it is difficult to detect any differences.</p><p>Drug dose calculations are not advanced in a mathematical sense. The basic arithmetic functions of addition, subtraction, multiplication or division are needed to decide decimals and fractions. What seems to be challenging is to conceptually understand the difference in information from the concentration denomination: per cent or mass per unit volume, or the ability to set up the right calculation for the relationship between dose or mass, volume or amount and concentration or strength. A standard labelling to mass per unit volume has been strongly recommended.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>

In a study by McMullan, only 5% of the nurses achieved 80% correct calculations.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Although statistically significant, the limited overall learning outcome after the courses was somewhat disappointing, with only 2 out of 10 with faultless tests. It seemed that the incorrect calculations were more frequent in conversion of units, the least complex task in the mathematical sense. The conversion of units improved the most after the course, while the learning outcome in the arithmetic tasks of infusions and dilutions were unchanged. This has also been observed by other investigators, and supports the view that the challenges in drug dose calculations are more likely due to a poor conceptual understanding.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Recent papers address the importance of including conceptual (understanding the problem), calculation (dosage computation) and technical measurement (dosage measurement) competence in teaching nurses in vocational mathematics, with models to help them understand the &#x02018;what&#x02019;, the &#x02018;why&#x02019; and the &#x02018;how&#x02019; in dosage problem solving.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>

Asking for certainty in each calculation made it possible for the nurses to express whether they normally would have consulted others or not when doing the calculation. Being certain that an incorrect answer was correct was regarded as an adequate estimate for a high risk of error. To the best of our knowledge, such a method for estimating a risk of error from a test situation is not described by others, and may be a contribution to future research. Owing to the low learning outcome, one could fear that increased certainty would lead to an increased risk of error. Therefore, it was satisfying that the overall risk of error declined after the course with both methods. Although a proportion of 22% with an increased risk of error after taking the course seemed alarming, it was within the limit of what could occur by chance, due to the small learning outcome. However, one may speculate that taking courses may increase the risk of error, if the feeling of being secure is increased without a corresponding improvement of knowledge. This might have implications for the need of follow-up after courses.</p><p>The factors that were associated with a reduced risk of error after the calculation course could indicate who might benefit from training like this: being a man; working in hospital; low pretest score and low pretest certainty score. This supports the finding in the auxiliary analysis that nurses with weak drug dose calculation skills benefit the most from taking courses. Nevertheless, the risk of error demonstrated in the study did not necessarily reflect the real risk of adverse events affecting patients, as the test situation cannot measure how often miscalculations were performed or how serious the clinical implications might be for any patient. Such studies still need to be done.</p></sec><sec id="s5c"><title>Importance for practice</title><p>The fact that 48% of the participants in the study performed drug dose calculations at least weekly was more than anticipated. It has been a common perception that the need for most nurses to calculate drug doses is small in today's clinical practice. The reported extent of calculations underscores the importance of good skills in this field.</p><p>When the need for continuous improvement and maintenance of skills is identified, the time and resources available will be decisive for the possibility to implement further training activities. E-learning is more often a preferred choice in health services institutions, as it is both flexible and cost-effective. In our study, the e-learning group stated a higher specific value of the course for working situations, although the course content was similar in both methods. However, this method also had more dropouts and a lesser learning outcome for those with low skills. In a review article commenting on the results of a meta-analysis of e-learning and conventional instruction methods, Cook claims that rather than more comparative studies, further research should focus on conditions (how and when) under which e-learning is a preferable method.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>An implication of the findings can be to let nurses regularly attend an e-learning course followed by a screening test to uncover the weak calculation topics. Those who need further training should be offered a more tailored follow-up. Others have also documented that a combination of different learning and teaching strategies do result in better retention of drug calculation skills compared with lectures alone.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Further studies of the effect of the introduction of drug dose calculation apps would also be of interest, as well as more authentic observation studies in a high fidelity simulation environment, as reported from a Scottish HHS study.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>Interestingly, the e-learning group stated a higher specific value of the course for working situations, although the course content was similar in both methods. This may be explained by the flexibility of the e-learning course, which allowed the participants to concentrate on the items that were considered difficult and relevant for their work, while the classroom group had to follow through the whole programme. Nearly all the nurses themselves realised that they needed more training in drug dose calculations, and an important factor was that motivation for the course was associated with a good learning outcome in the study. This indicates that the professional leadership in health institutions should facilitate and encourage the nurses to improve their skills further in drug dose calculations.</p><p>In addition to regularly training in calculations, written procedures for specific dilutions and infusions used in the wards would be of importance as a quality insurance for improved patient safety. This must be a part of the management responsibility.</p></sec><sec id="s5d"><title>Study limitations</title><p>The participants in this study were recruited through the management line, and the study population represents a limited part of the total nurse population. We assume that nurses with low calculation skills would, to a lesser degree, volunteer for such a study, and hence presume that the calculation skills in clinical practice would be lower than shown in this study. External validity might be an issue in studies with voluntary participation, and extrapolation of the findings of the study to all registered nurses should be performed with caution.</p><p>Some may question the quality of the course content and duration or teaching conditions of the courses, especially since the learning outcome of the courses were not convincing. However, the main aim for the study was to compare the two didactic methods. Also, to ensure a fair comparison and similar content of the courses, the subject teacher, who was a part of the group that developed the e-learning course, was also responsible for the classroom lectures. Since the teacher had an interest in both didactic methods, the probability for her to affect the course arrangements in favour of one of them was regarded as small. The questionnaire used was the same as that used to test the nursing students, and the calculation tasks were considered to be in accordance with the tasks that were performed in the nursing practice.</p><p>Another limitation could be the controlled test conditions, without time pressure and interruptions that are often the case in a stressful work situation, which tend towards better results than in reality. On the other hand, the calculation test situation itself may be stressful for the nurses, since many have struggled to pass a similar test during their studies.</p><p>Selecting two dimensions from the GHQ 30 questionnaire may also be a methodological limitation. Although no correlation between the outcomes and coping or well-being/self-esteem was detected, the usage of only parts of the tool excluded the possibility of detecting an association between physiological well-being in general and drug dose calculation skills.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The study was not able to demonstrate any differences between e-learning and classroom teaching in drug dose calculations, with respect to learning outcome, certainty or risk of error. The overall learning outcome was without practical significance, and conversion of units was the only topic that was significantly improved after the course. An independent factor in favour of classroom teaching was weak pretest knowledge, while factors suggesting use of e-learning could be the need for training in relevant work specific tasks and time effective repetition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e212" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-006025.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e213" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-006025.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Innlandet and Oestfold Hospital Trusts and the healthcare administrations of Gjoevik, Hamar and Lillehammer municipalities for letting the nurses participate in the trial during work hours, and the Faculty of Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology for preparing the CRFs for optical reading of the data.
