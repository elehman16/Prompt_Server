Introduction</title><p>Vulvovaginal candidiasis is one of the gynecological problems in womenand common fungal infection in adult women in reproductive age (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Abdelmonem, Rasheed, &#x00026; Mohamed, 2012</xref>). Around the world women with any races and at any ages would infected to Vulvovaginal candidiasis and this disease is one of the most repeated diseases (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Babic &#x00026; Hukic, 2010</xref>). This infection is responsible for about 13 million vaginitis in women in North America and 64 million women atreproductive age are affected in Brazil (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Achkar &#x00026; Fries, 2010</xref>) the prevalence of Candida in Iran have been reported 18/5-26% (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Pakshir, Akbarzad, Batul &#x00026; Mohaghegh Zade, 2010</xref>). Recently this infection has increased dramatically in term of severity and incidence that is mainly due to the increase in cases of immunodeficiency, such as AIDS, cancer, chemotherapy and replacing members (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Behmanesh, Pasha, Sefidgar, Moqadam Nia, &#x00026; Ebrahimi, 2010</xref>). It is estimated that 75% of women experience the infection at least once in their lifetime, 40% -50% of patients with recurrence ofVulvovaginitisrefereed to clinics and about 5-8% of infections are frequent in their lifetime. Candida albicans is responsible for 80-95% of VulvovaginitisCandidalattacks around the world.Some research have reported the increased prevalence of other Candida species, especially C. glabrata, krusei and Parapsilosis (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Levin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Samaranayake &#x00026; Samaranayake, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Sobel et al., 2004)</xref>. Predisposing factors of this disease are including pregnancy, high-dose oral estrogen use, Contraceptives pills, diabetes, broad-spectrum antibiotics use, corticosteroids, immune cell deficiency and obesity. Infection of the vagina or vulva may be associated with symptoms such as severe itching, burning, pain and white or whitish Cottagelike and cheese form secretions (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Warren, 2010</xref>) The clinical characteristics of patients with vulvovaginal candidacies are nonspecific and their misdiagnosis is common and leads to delays in the initiation of antifungal therapy. However, it is rarely life-threatening infections. Yet it is usually associated with symptoms such as discomfort in sexual disorders, dryness, pain and finally high cost of treatment (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Marot-Leblond et al., 2009)</xref>. VulvovaginitisCandidal annual cost in the United States of America in 1995 was $ 18 billion and is expected that rise to $ 3.1 billion in 2014 (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Foxman, Barlow, D&#x02019;arcy, Gillespie, &#x00026; Sobel, 2000</xref>). A common treatment for this disease includes high doses of oral or vaginal antifungal azole group followed by weekly or monthly long-term maintenance therapy.Despite the high cost of treatment many women get a little relief from these treatments and some of the women have experienced the side effects of these treatments such as headache, gastrointestinal disorders. The lack of effective treatment result in many women and azole resistance and their consequences and limited number of new antifungal drugs cause high demand to discover new antifungal drugs that are more effective and less toxicity toward available drugs (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Sobel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Watson &#x00026; Calabretto, 2007</xref>). Honey as a medicine is being used thousands of years. If it is used alone or in combination with other substances in vaginatoinhibit the growth of Candida (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Molan, 1992</xref>).</p><p>Laboratory and clinical results of honey in inhibiting the growth of various fungi such as Candida has been promising (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Devkatte, Zore, &#x00026; Karuppayil, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Wahdan, 1998</xref>). This effect is due to the high acidity and osmolarity (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Namias, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Theunissen, Grobler &#x00026; Gedalia, 2001</xref>) as well as hydrogen peroxide, small amounts of enzymes; diastase, invertase, glucose oxidase, Catalase and phosphatase (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Allen, Molan, &#x00026; Reid, 1991</xref>).</p><p>The existence of herbal derivatives such as flavonoids in honey and stimulating the immune system by stimulating cytogenesis through activating neutrophils and T and B lymphocyteswould lead to increased antibiotic properties of honey (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">K&#x000fc;&#x000e7;&#x000fc;k et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Theunissen et al., 2001)</xref>.</p><p>Some studies have investigated the ability of orally administered lactobacilli in the colonization of vaginaorcolonization reduction of vagina with Candida infections (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Falagas, Betsi, &#x00026; Athanasiou, 2006</xref>).

Yogurt and Probiotics are commonly used by women when they are infected with vaginal infection and can be used as a cheap and effective treatment for vaginal Vulvovaginal candidiasis. If the lactobacilli in the yogurt directly applied in the vagina can inhibit the growth of fungi in infected women (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Ehrstr&#x000f6;m et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Falagas et al., 2006)</xref>. Adding the yogurt and honey increased their antifungal effect and make them to inhibit the growth of Candida Albicans.Other studies also support the synergy of honey in combination with other drugs to prevent candida growth (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Boukra&#x000e2; &#x00026; Bouchegrane, 2007</xref>). Sissons and et al 2004 have reported that Monica honey may be useful in oral fungal infections caused by Candida albicans (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Sissons, Anderson, &#x00026; Molan, 2004</xref>). Also Irish and et al(2006) in their study have shown the antifungal effect of honey onCandida albicans, C. glabrata and C. dubliniensis (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Irish, Carter, Shokohi &#x00026; Blair, 2006</xref>). Several studies have indicated the effect of yogurt or foreign species of lactobacillus on improvement ofvaginitis candida symptoms vaginitis candida (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Osset, Garcia, Bartolome &#x00026; Andreu, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Haihong and et al.

Discussion</title><p>Vulvovaginal candidiasis is the most common clinical protests of Candida species that 70-75% women will experience it at least once in a lifetime. The study is conducted in order to compare the effect of vaginal cream mixed of yogurt and honey on the symptoms of Vulvovaginal candidiasis. The obtained results indicate that signs and symptoms of vaginal candidiasis after taking 7 day a vaginal cream yogurt and honey mixed is reduced significantly. Results of the study showed that recovery in term of itches in 7 days after treating with mixed of yogurt and honey happened in more than &#x000be; samples and in clotrimazole group occurred in almost two-thirds of the cases. In this regard, the result of study of Fazel and et al have reported the Itching recovery in the honey group alone and in combination with clotrimazole was 100% and clotrimazole group less than a quarter of the samples which demonstrated the alignment with present study. The difference between the symptoms of the current study may be related to the use of different measuring instruments (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Fazel, Hashemian, Ramezani &#x00026; Akaberi, 2011</xref>).</p><p>In addition to study results of Allam and et al n 129 pregnant women with Vulvovaginitiscandidiasissuggests that the use of yogurt and honey mixture in comparison with itraconazole group (87.8 percent vs. 72.3 percent) improves symptoms of Vulvovaginitiscandidiasis. So that itching, secretions, and redness of the vulva and vagina, has significantly decreased in consumer group of vaginal cream, yogurt and honey compared to itraconazole group (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Abdelmonem et al., 2012)</xref>. In the study of Hilton and et al also the vaginal symptoms of women who had used the Jay intravaginal Lactobacillus for 1 or 2 months have recovered (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Hilton, Isenberg, Alperstein, France &#x00026; Borenstein, 1992</xref>). Also the study result of Ehrstrom and et al indicated that the effect of supplements and probiotic lactobacillus capsules in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis and Vulvovaginitiscandidiasis (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Ehrstr&#x000f6;m et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>It is assumed that antifungal and anti-inflammatory effect of honey and being rich of lactobacilli and lactic acid in yogurt is that make vaginal environment unsuitable for the growth of candidiasis. Also the honey through producing the prostaglandins reduces the edema and pain in the inflammatory tissues. In the present study yogurt and honey mixture cause inhabitation of colonization of Candida species which is consistent with the findings of the study of Irish and et al. (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Pirotta et al., 2003)</xref>. This effect is likely related to the antimicrobial effect of honey is due to its Osmolality.</p><p>In the present study, the combination of honey with yogurtcauses a synergistic effect of honey against candidiasis which is consistent with the finding of Boukraaand et al based on the synergistic effect of honey and starch against Candida albicans (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Boukra&#x000e2; &#x00026; Bouchegrane, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The present findings Demonstrates the effectiveness of honey and Yogurt on Negative cultures of samples within 7 days after the intervention, while no effect was observed in the study of <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Shalev and et al. (1996)</xref>. It is assumed that difference is due to using honey in mixture with Yogurt and the antimicrobial effect of honey is due to its chemical composition and PH of honey is acidic in the present study. Since one of the criteria for inclusion in the study was the lack of use of antibiotics in the sampling, therefore the results of the present study was inconsistent with the study result of Pirotta and et al about the role of oral or vaginal lactobacilli strains in the prevention of Vulvovaginal candidiasis after use of antibiotics.</p><p>In summary, the present study showed that prescribing the honey in mixture with yogurt in from of vaginal is effective in reducing symptoms of Vulvovaginal candidiasis And also had a negative impact on the results of microscopy and culture fluids while taking any of these serious side effects have been reported.</p><p>The limitations of this study can be mentioned as Differences in immune systems of subjects and relatively short follow-up period. And also Sample loss during the investigation, lack of reference of some subjects for culture after treatment were other limitation of the study which leads to the removal of above mentioned cases and re-sampling and subsequently increasing the research time. The strengths point of present study is having a control group, designing the study in Triple-blind and randomized into two groups of samples.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>In the present study administration of honey in combination with yogurt has desired effect in the treatment of vaginal candidiasis. And cause the reduction and recovery of vaginitis candida. Also it is more economical in terms of costs. And don&#x02019;t have the synthetic drugs side effects. Therefore, their use in combination with topical formulations for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis wouldbe useful.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This article is part of a master&#x02019;s thesis (Midwifery Education), School of Nursing and Midwifery, Tehran University of Medical Sciences (92/D/130/3005).
