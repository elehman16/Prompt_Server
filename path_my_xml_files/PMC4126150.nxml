Originally, 41 patients received training with SCP-neurofeedback. A control group of 12 patients received respiratory feedback while another group of 11 patients had their anticonvulsant medications reviewed. Nineteen patients in the experimental group participated at least in parts of the long-term follow-up, but only two patients from each control group agreed to do so. The follow-up participants completed the same seizure diaries as in the original study. Patients of the experimental group also took part in three SCP-training sessions at the follow-up evaluation. Due to the small sample size, the results of participants in the control groups were not considered in the analysis. A significant decrease in seizure frequency was found about 10&#x02009;years after the end of SCP treatment. The clinical significance of this result is considered medium to high. All patients were still able to self-regulate their SCPs during the feedback condition. This success was achieved without booster sessions. This is the longest follow-up evaluation of the outcome of a psychophysiological treatment in patients with epilepsy ever reported. Reduced seizure frequency may be the result of patients continued ability to self-regulate their SCPs. Given such a long follow-up period, the possible impact of confounding variables should be taken into account. The small number of patients participating in this follow-up evaluation diminishes the ability to make causal inferences. However, the consistency and duration of improvement for patients who received SCP-feedback training suggests that such treatment may be considered as a treatment for patients with intractable epilepsy and as an adjunct to conventional therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>epilepsy</kwd><kwd>long-term follow-up</kwd><kwd>neurofeedback</kwd><kwd>slow cortical potentials</kwd><kwd>seizure reduction</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="24"/><page-count count="7"/><word-count count="5315"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>About one-third of patients with epilepsy do not respond to anti-epileptic drugs (AED). New AED and surgery are the standard treatment for those patients but still a considerable percentage of patients are left being drug resistant. The majority of these patients suffer from focal seizures. Especially for these kind of seizures feedback of brain activity (EEG-feedback, mostly called neurofeedback) has been developed and evaluated since last decades of the last century independently by two different research groups. A decrease of seizures after enhancement of the sensory motor rhythm in patients with poorly controlled epilepsies was reported in 1972 for the first time (Sterman and Friar, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">1972</xref>). This treatment was motivated by earlier animal studies. Here, it was shown that cats being trained to enhance their SMR were more resistant to the exposition to a rocket fuel called monomethylhydrazine. Compared to cats that had not undergone SMR-training these cats showed elevated seizure thresholds and longer latencies (Sterman et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">1969</xref>; Sterman, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">1976</xref>). It was concluded that SMR-training decreased seizure susceptibility. Protocols for increasing SMR-activity and in some studies decreasing slow rhythms (delta and theta) of EEG have been used in the following years for research and practice mainly in the United States (for a review see Tan et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). In parallel to this development, Rockstroh et al. (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>) were able to reduce seizures after feedback of slow cortical potentials (SCPs).</p><p>Slow cortical potentials are very slow phenomena of the EEG with a frequency near 0.01&#x02009;Hz; their duration is up to several seconds. Negative shifts reflect low excitation thresholds that precede epileptic seizures (Ikeda et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). As the above mentioned trial by Rockstroh et al. (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>) was not controlled Kotchoubey et al. (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) wanted to replicate the results in a controlled study. Patients being diagnosed as having focal epilepsies were referred to the study centers (University of Tuebingen, Neurological Clinic Weissenau, and Center for Epilepsies (Epilepsiezentrum Kehl-Kork) by their neurologists or general practitioners. The study centers did the additional screening with regards to the following selection criteria: partial epilepsy being diagnosed at least 2&#x02009;years ago; no reduction of seizures after 2&#x02009;years of pharmacological treatment (i.e., the epilepsy was declared as pharmaco-resistant); age between 14 and 50&#x02009;years; IQ above 80; no change in medication beginning from baseline until 1&#x02009;year after the end of treatment (SCP and RESP groups); no psychogenic seizures, no psychiatric disease according to DSM IV (American Psychiatric Association, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>).</p><p>To maximize effects of expectancy patients were allowed to choose 1 out of 3 treatments: while 41 patients received feedback of SCPs, 11 were trained to self-regulate breathing rate and amount of exhaled CO<sub>2</sub> (respiratory feedback &#x02013; RESP) and another group of 12 patients had their medications reviewed (MED). All groups were provided with the same amount of psychosocial treatment: while the feedback groups (SCP and RESP) were trained to apply the self-regulation skills in real-life situations, the MED group received sessions of art therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, and training of social competence.</p><p>It was shown that patients acquired the SCP self-regulation skill, which even improved during the follow-up period (Kotchoubey et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). A 1&#x02009;year follow-up showed that seizure frequency decreased significantly in the SCP and MED groups, only (Kotchoubey et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Psychological variables (depression, locus of control) improved in all treatment groups (Strehl et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) but IQ changed in the SCP group only (Strehl et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). About 9&#x02009;years after the end of treatment, we wanted to know whether the seizure control was maintained in the SCP group and to compare their results with the results of the other two groups. The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Tuebingen and all patients signed informed consent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Patients</title><p>All patients that had finished the 12&#x02009;months follow-up were asked whether they would like to take part.

In addition to the feedback sessions, patients of both groups received daily sessions aiming at transferring the self-regulation skill from the lab into everyday life and improving psychosocial well-being.

These authors concluded their multinational patient&#x02013;physician survey with the statement that successful treatment depends on communication over the long-term. For the group of patients treated with SCPs feedback in the main study (Kotchoubey et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) who improved although diagnosed as &#x0201c;intractable&#x0201d; the long-term outcome is of special interest. Reduction of seizures after neurofeedback in 74% of patients has been already reported in a meta-analysis (Tan et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) but long-term data are not available, except the 1&#x02009;year follow-up of the study reported from our group before (Kotchoubey et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). A long-term outcome after a period of 9&#x02009;years after the end of treatment presented in this paper was assessed for the first time. While the original study compared SCPs feedback with two different treatments (review of medication regime and respiratory feedback) only patients of the SCP group were willing to take part in a number sufficient for analysis. One-third of those patients who started the treatment (and 47% of those who completed the 1&#x02009;year follow-up) again completed seizure diaries and took part in three sessions of neurofeedback. A statistically significant continuous decrease of seizures from the first baseline to the last estimation of seizure frequency was observed. The effect sizes were large for the linear trend and medium for the general linear model. Pairwise comparisons revealed that the decrease did not depend on the assessment instrument (specific diaries to be sent to the lab; regular diaries as usual, estimation in the COE questionnaire). Participants were still able to self-regulate their SCPs as shown by a significant differentiation between negativity and positivity tasks in the feedback condition. Compared with the self-regulation skills during both feedback and transfer demonstrated 6&#x02009;month after the end of treatment (Kotchoubey et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>) the achievement 10&#x02009;years later were more moderate, which might partially attributed to the small number of participants. Taking into account the long period without any booster sessions in between it appears surprising that the self-regulation skill was still existent at all. We therefore may assume that participants have successfully acquired a self-regulation skill, which is available for retrieval in their implicit memory. The longest follow-up that showed sustained SCP self-regulation skill reported so far was 2&#x02009;years in a neurofeedback-study in children with Attention-Deficit-/Hyperactivity-Disorder (Gani et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p><p>It would be of interest to analyze a possible correlation between self-regulation performance and reduction of seizures. In an earlier paper with 18 patients at the 6&#x02009;month follow-up of the main study, it was shown that patients with larger amplitudes of positivity and especially during transfer trials experienced greater improvements (Kotchoubey et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). A power analysis as regards to the small number of participants in the long-term follow-up revealed that a correlation coefficient of 0.6 would be needed in order to obtain a significant result, which is not realistic to expect.</p><p>A comparison with the outcome of other treatments is hardly possible. Long-term follow-up-studies that exceed 3&#x02013;5&#x02009;years are rather rare. The longest follow-up we retrieved was 12&#x02009;years done by Tanriverdi et al. (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) with patients after temporal lobe surgery (Kunieda et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), 10&#x02009;years after resective surgery (Stigsdotter-Broman et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), and after callosotomy (Ardesch et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) and 6&#x02009;years after vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) (Tang et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Besides these interventions medication treatments are mostly followed up for a maximum of 3&#x02013;5&#x02009;years. For psychobehavioral treatments, long-term results are missing and the sustainability of outcomes are uncertain (Shorvon and Goodridge, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Another difference to our study concerns the method of recording seizure frequency. While we used prospective measures, which were similar before and after treatment, many follow-up studies assessed seizure frequency by phone calls. It is questionable whether this method is adequate, and if yes, whether those results are comparable to ours. Finally, a comparison does not make much sense because the patients in our study had refractory epilepsy, i.e., with no response to medication treatment and not being willing or eligible for surgery. However, a comparison with the results of VNS for medically refractory epilepsy seems to be more justified. Ardesch et al. (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) report seizure reduction increasing from 14% after the first year to 50% after 6&#x02009;years follow-up in a group of 19 patients (Tang et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Contrary to other studies (e.g., Sperner et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), which state that the early response predicts the long-term outcome, in the VNS study, the improvements were small at the beginning, increasing in the following years (Tang et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). A similar development was observed in our study, but percentages increased from 40 to 76%. According to a pilot study (Brodie, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) both VNS and SCP treatment might have a common mechanism of effect, namely, the increase of excitation thresholds of cortical neurons. An advantage of SCP-feedback compared to VNS is not only the bigger decrease of seizures but also the absence of side effects. Taking these results into consideration, it may be suggested that SCP-feedback might be recommended as a novel approach, which may meet the demands in treating patients with refractory epilepsies (Hoppe et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).</p><p>Of course several limitations have to be acknowledged. First of all, we were not able to compare with the control groups of the original study as not enough patients from these groups were willing to take part. One reason why only 17% (MED) and 18% (RESP) patients responded could be that these patients had been contacted before only by their study centers but not by the University of Tuebingen, now asking for their participation. Due to constraints set up by the Ethics Committee, we were not allowed to ask for reasons for no participation. Therefore, we cannot exactly estimate the impact of these missing data on the results but it is worth noticing that we did not find any difference in demographic and seizure characteristic between those who took part and those who did not. Another limitation may concern the reliability of the number of seizures as indicated by the patients. Several authors who tried to obtain greater accuracy by ambulatory or in-patient EEG assessment report that around 50% of seizures are not declared (e.g., Kerling et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Tanriverdi et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). This problem is not unique to our study. Instead, it has to be taken into account by any study (and any report in the doctor&#x02019;s office) that relies on patients&#x02019; statements. It is all the more important that we used identical forms to record seizures in three of five assessment points. Finally, the impact of confounding variables throughout all the years that passed by since the end of the treatment has to be considered (which is also true for other studies). Due to the small number of patients we were not able to assess these variables on a systematic basis. We do not know what impact possible positive changes in the quality of life, education, occupation, or family status might have had on the seizures. Neither do we know what impact the reduction of seizures can have on the aforementioned variables. An exact control of the effect of everyday life would require a huge number of patients at the beginning of a study. If this would be a condition <italic>sine qua non-the</italic> majority of long-term studies done so far are done in vain.</p><p>To summarize the main limitation of this study is the small number of patients that do not allow us to draw causal conclusions. Notwithstanding this small sample size, statistically significant long-term reduction of seizures and sustained self-regulation of SCPs were observed. It has to be noted that this success was achieved without booster sessions. Future research should not only try to replicate these promising results but also include SCP-feedback treatment as an option in the treatment of patients with (intractable) epilepsies.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work is based on the MD thesis from Sarah Birkle (Langzeit-Follow-up Untersuchung eines psychophysiologischen Behandlungskonzepts zur Selbstkontrolle epileptischer Anf&#x000e4;lle, Tuebingen 2011).
