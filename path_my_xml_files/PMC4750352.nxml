The mean age of diagnosis is 71 years for men and 75 years for women. The age-standardized incidence and mortality rates are almost constant, but the absolute number of cases is increasing as a result of the aging population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. At the time of initial diagnosis, only 15&#x02013;20 % of patients with pancreatic cancer present with a resectable disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Despite the improved treatment options, the relative 5-year survival rate has improved only from 2 % in 1975 to 8 % in 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>The clinical and scientific interest in the quality of life (QOL) of patients with cancer has been increasing since the 1990s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Intensified physical training has been shown to measurably increase QOL and reduce fatigue levels of patients with cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. So far, there are only a few studies that have dealt with the issue of QOL and developed concepts to improve the QOL of patients after pancreatic resection. Yeo et al. found that patients with pancreatic and periampullary cancer who have undergone resection benefit from a structured home-walking program with respect to fatigue, pain, physical functioning, and mental health. They modified the Every Step Counts graduated walking program to suit patients with pancreatic and periampullary cancer who underwent resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>We have modified the walking program used by Yeo et al. with respect to length. Our program is designed to last 12 months after surgery instead of 3 months. Moreover, we combine the walking program with muscle force exercises, as we believe that the patients will benefit from a combination of endurance and muscle force exercises.</p><p>Health-related QOL is often assessed using the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). In this questionnaire, eight columns are used to assess QOL: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social functioning, and psychological well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>The Short Form-8 Health Survey (SF-8) was developed as a shorter form of the SF-36. It was used in the Telephone Health Survey 2003, and it provides results that are comparable with those of the SF-36, the most widely used instrument internationally. Every item of the SF-8 presents one of the above-mentioned eight columns of the SF-36 questionnaire. The SF-8 questionnaire has two domains: the physical component score and the mental component score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>To specifically assess the QOL of patients with pancreatic cancer, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) developed and validated the QLQ-PAN26 questionnaire, which contains the domains &#x0201c;disease specific symptoms,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;functional status,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;psychosocial components.&#x0201d; This is to be used in conjunction with the QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The QLQ-C30 questionnaire was also developed by the EORTC. It was validated to determine the QOL of patients with cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Both sheets are available in validated German translations.</p><p>High-quality physical therapy and a motivating workout schedule could be key parameters for increasing the QOL of patients with pancreatic cancer. Thus, the main aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a new workout scheme on QOL and to ascertain the general feasibility of the planned approach (i.e., patient&#x02019;s compliance with the workout schedule). In addition, a more outlined definition of clinically relevant improvement will be identified as part of this trial. The patient&#x02019;s compliance might have an especially strong impact on the outcome of any later studies. Thus, it is important to ensure that the chosen schedule does not overstrain the patients and instead increases their QOL and overall motivation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><p>The study protocol has been approved by the Commission for Impact Assessment Research and Ethics, Carl von Ossietzky University, Oldenburg, Germany (Drs. 59/2014).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population</title><p>The study population will consist of patients scheduled for pancreatic resection for resectable pancreatic cancer, distal bile duct carcinoma, neuroendocrine tumor, periampullary carcinoma, duodenal carcinoma, and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. Further inclusion criteria are age (&#x02265;18 years) and surgery and initial postoperative hospitalization at the Department of General and Visceral Surgery, Pius-Hospital, Oldenburg, Germany.</p><p>Exclusion criteria are lack of written consent, physical inability to participate in the intensified physiotherapy program, illiteracy, inability to communicate in the German language, physical or mental disability that precludes participation in the intensified physiotherapy program, and lack of compliance.</p><p>Individual criteria for discontinuation include withdrawal of the patient&#x02019;s consent, a new cardiac risk profile in the form of myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure, complications after pancreatic resection in the form of postoperative mechanical ventilation past the first postoperative week, and physical or mental inability to participate in the intensified physiotherapy program.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The primary aim of this study is the assessment of QOL in the intervention group after intensified physiotherapy 12 months postoperatively, using the SF-8 and the disease-specific EORTC QLQ-C30/QLQ-PAN26 questionnaires in the validated German translations. The longitudinal development of QOL will be measured using the SF-8 and the QLQ-C30/PAN26 questionnaires. The different domains of the questionnaires will be evaluated separately.</p><p>The secondary aims of this study include assessment of study dropouts, assessment of physical performance using the Short Physical Performance Battery and ergometry, and assessment of nutritional status using metabolic blood levels and the seven-site skinfold method. If possible, influence on 1-year survival rate, effects of potential adjuvant therapy on QOL, and tumor recurrence rate after 6 and 12 months will be investigated as well. This depends on the actual number of patients and the heterogeneity of the two study groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Design and trial flow</title><p>Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the flowchart of this study.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flowchart for the progressive postresection program. <italic>CT</italic> computed tomography, <italic>QOL</italic> quality of life, <italic>pPRP</italic> progressive postresection program</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2016_1200_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>For participation in this prospective randomized controlled intervention study, informed written consent is mandatory.

The complexity of the molecular biology underlying pancreatic cancer makes a breakthrough in the treatment options in the near future highly unlikely. For this reason, and because the rates of traditional outcome parameters such as progression-free survival and overall survival are low, it is very important to develop concepts to improve the QOL of patients with pancreatic cancer in their remaining lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. There are indications that an improved QOL is associated with an improved overall survival rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>As mentioned above, intensified physical training has been shown in particular to measurably increase QOL and reduce the fatigue level of patients with cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. There are only a few studies that have dealt with the issue of QOL and developing concepts to improve the QOL of patients after pancreatic resection. Yeo et al. described a benefit for patients with resected pancreatic and periampullary cancer from taking part in a home walking program based on the Every Step Counts graduated walking program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. They found significant improvements in fatigue levels, physical functioning, and health-related QOL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. We believe that our patients will profit from muscle force exercises in addition to endurance exercises. For this reason, we combine a modified version of the Every Step Counts graduated walking program with muscle force exercises. Furthermore, we use the general questionnaire SF-8 as well as the disease-specific questionnaires EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PAN26 to evaluate the QOL of our patients.</p><p>The aim of this study is to investigate whether intensive physiotherapy, consisting of a combination of endurance and muscle force exercises, improves the QOL of patients after pancreatic resection for pancreatic cancer, distal bile duct carcinoma, neuroendocrine tumor, periampullary carcinoma, duodenal carcinoma, or intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm.</p><p>Our hypothesis is that, with the exception of tumor recurrence, QOL should increase more for the intervention group than for the control group, regardless of the reason for surgery, if the type of physical therapy really has an impact on QOL. To be considered clinically relevant, this should be visible even in the heterogeneous study groups employed here.</p><p>The main objective criterion is a potential improvement in QOL in the intervention group after intensified physiotherapy 12 months postoperatively as measured by the SF-8 and the EORTC QLQ-C30/QLQ-PAN-26 questionnaires. This pilot study should help us to find an outlined definition of improvement, which may then be implemented in a larger (multicenter) study with appropriate statistical power.</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>Trial status</title><p>Enrollment of the first patient is planned for February 2016.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CA 19-9</term><def><p>cancer antigen 19-9</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CEA</term><def><p>carcinoembryonic antigen</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CT</term><def><p>computed tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EORTC</term><def><p>European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Hb</term><def><p>hemoglobin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HbA1c</term><def><p>glycated hemoglobin A1c</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HDL</term><def><p>high-density lipoprotein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LDL</term><def><p>low-density lipoprotein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QOL</term><def><p>quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF-8</term><def><p>Short Form-8 Health Survey</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF-36</term><def><p>Short Form-36 Health Survey</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TTE</term><def><p>transthoracic echocardiography</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>SR and DW designed the study.
