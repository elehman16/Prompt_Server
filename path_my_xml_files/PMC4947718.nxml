In 2012, the state average for EDB use was 46.5%; however, there was broad variation within the state, ranging from 15% to 82.7% depending on region and hospital.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>

The term integrative medicine is used when referring to incorporating CM or complementary therapies (CT) into mainstream healthcare.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Recent Australian data suggest that 74.4% of women used some form of CM during pregnancy, and 66.7% of these women also used non-pharmacological pain relief in labour.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The Cochrane Systematic Review on pain management for labour finds some evidence to suggest that acupuncture, relaxation, massage and water immersion may assist in the management of labour with few side effects; however, more research is needed to establish efficacy of these techniques.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>In response to the need to establish the evidence base for CM interventions for pain management in labour, we undertook a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to test the hypothesis that nulliparous women who undergo a CM antenatal education course, in addition to usual antenatal care, would use less EDB than nulliparous women who receive usual antenatal care alone. Trials of complex interventions are difficult to conduct and do not have linear models, and require a pragmatic approach to implementation.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>

The study was an assessor-blinded, open-label pragmatic RCT.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Women attending antenatal clinic were eligible to participate in the study from 24 to 34&#x02005;weeks' gestation. They were provided with a participant information sheet for themselves and their birth partner. If they were interested and eligible to participate, women and partners signed individual consent forms. Women were eligible to enter the trial if they had a singleton pregnancy with a cephalic presentation, were low risk (no pre-existing medical complications or existing obstetric complications), were first-time mothers (nulliparous) and had knowledge of sufficient English to participate in a course. Women were excluded from entering the trial if they had preidentified risk factors, were enrolled or intending to enrol in a &#x02018;continuity of care&#x02019; midwifery programme or in a private birth preparation course, were unable to attend a weekend course, knew insufficient English for participation, or had been previously randomised to the trial. Recruitment was undertaken at two public hospitals in Sydney, Australia, that reflected diverse socioeconomic areas. Recruitment was also conducted through the affiliated Western Sydney University (WSU) in response to newspaper and magazine advertisements. Participants who were recruited through WSU attended the courses at either of the two hospital study sites. All eligible women were approached in the antenatal clinic at site 1 as this was a smaller unit and individual contact was possible; all clinics were attended regularly by the researcher. At site 2, the hospital was much larger and more diverse with regard to structure of the clinics. Different clinics were attended, and eligible women at these clinics were approached. It was not possible to attend all clinics at this larger unit, and a range of clinics were selected on different weeks to achieve a representative sample of women. For site 3, where flyers and newspaper advertisements were used for recruitment, the response rate was quite low. All eligible women who contacted us through these means were randomised to the study. We do not have data on the women who were not eligible to participate. The randomisation target was achieved quite quickly, and participation was popular.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Randomisation</title><p>We used a web-based computer-generated randomisation sequence prepared centrally via the &#x02018;Sealed Envelope&#x02019; website (https://<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sealedenvelope.com">http://www.sealedenvelope.com</ext-link>), and concealed centrally.

Women were randomly allocated to either the study group or usual care alone. Randomisation occurred on a 1:1 allocation ratio to ensure equal numbers in each group at each hospital.

A total of 20 courses were conducted during this time. Participants attended prior to 36&#x02005;weeks' gestation with a birth partner, and there was a maximum of 12 couples and a minimum of 2 couples at each course, with an average of 8 couples per course.

These clinically and statistically significant results are important in establishing an evidence base for the use and effectiveness of antenatal education programmes incorporating CM techniques for the management of pain during childbirth as an adjunct to parent education offered as usual care. This programme has the potential to provide a cost-effective method for antenatal education. A costing and economic analysis of this programme will be undertaken and reported elsewhere, providing a measure of relative benefit for outcomes saved. Reorienting antenatal education classes towards supporting normal birth, and providing techniques to help women manage pain is an important contribution for reducing interventions in labour and birth.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Interpretation</title><p>Our study helps to address the question of whether antenatal education using CM techniques are effective in reducing rates of EDB in first-time mothers.

<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24&#x02013;26</xref> These findings are in contrast to the parent education literature, hypnosis and psychoprophylaxis training literature for reduction of EDB during labour.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>

<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55&#x02013;57</xref> The outcome of increase in positive attitude towards birth in the antenatal period and increased feelings of influence during labour and birth are supportive of the antenatal education literature.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>

<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>
<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> The finding that no individual technique was associated with reduced rates of EDB highlights the concept that these techniques form a &#x02018;toolkit&#x02019; of techniques and represent an overall holistic approach towards labour and birth. The combination of active birth techniques with relaxation techniques is unique to this programme.</p><p>The primary outcome measure of EDB was used for this study rather than pain scores which are frequently used in other CM studies.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The objective measure of EDB has been identified as a mediating factor and is shown to influence labour interventions and mode of birth, which is described in the literature as the cascade of interventions.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>

<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> The literature highlights the mechanism whereby an initial intervention during labour triggers subsequent interventions to manage the effects of the prior intervention. EDB has been shown to mediate this effect and is associated with outcomes such as augmentation during labour, instrumental vaginal birth and CS.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> This study demonstrates an impact on rates of EDB, as well as on rates of augmentation, perineal trauma and CS, and therefore may have an effect on the cascade of interventions. Therefore, caution is required when interpreting secondary outcome measures.</p><p>It remains important that methods used during labour are suitable for women's individual requirements and circumstances, and also account for conditions that may arise in the woman or infant during labour.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> This study demonstrates the capacity for a novel integrative antenatal education programme using CM techniques to reduce interventions in normal labour.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Future research</title><p>Policy initiatives supporting normal birth require novel solutions, and this study provides good evidence for such an initiative, including the potential for a revision of clinical practice in antenatal education. Future health services research should include translation of study outcomes into clinical practice, involving a priori cost-effectiveness analysis, exploring key stakeholders' views about changing practice and undertaking a multicentred international study to assess the impact of the study in a broader context and beyond Australia. This article reports on the first implementation of this antenatal education programme, and evaluates feasibility of conduct. We are seeking to establish a larger trial in a broader national and international setting whereby issues of implementation and generalisability may be addressed. As a first stage, these results are promising and further investigation is warranted.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The rise in interventions rates in labour and birth need to be addressed as a matter of priority as outlined by reviews of maternity services<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>

<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> This study highlights the effectiveness of a novel integrated antenatal education approach, incorporating evidence-based CM techniques to reduce rates of EDB and leading to a reduction in other interventions in labour and birth, including CS. This programme is novel in its approach and forms a unique toolkit for women and partners to use in their labour and birth.</p><p>The reorientation of antenatal education and the promotion of birth as a normal physiological event is critical if we are to reduce interventions in birth. This shift requires education and support to help women manage challenges faced during labour and birth. The results from this study demonstrate the potential effectiveness of the CT for labour and birth in providing an individualised, evidence-based, woman-centred, integrated approach to care that reduces medical interventions and morbidity in labour.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>She Births provided background intellectual property, including concept, course materials and training.
