Approximately 36% of Ecuadorians live in rural areas, and nearly 35% of rural households live below the national poverty line (compared to only 16% of urban households) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In addition, rural provinces display the highest rates of child malnutrition and illiteracy while also demonstrating the lowest rates of access to clean water and sanitation infrastructure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It is estimated that 27% of all Ecuadorians do not have access to health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The unequal distribution of these social determinants of health is further exacerbated by an unequal distribution of health care providers. Ecuador reports approximately 20 physicians, 10 nurses, and 3 dentists per 10,000 Ecuadorians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]; but the geographic disparity in number of physicians ranges from less than five to over 26 per 10,000 Ecuadorians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">In 1970, in an effort to address the gap in health determinants and outcomes between rural and urban populations, the government of Ecuador legislated one year of compulsory medical service for all new health professionals upon graduation (known as <italic>medicatura rural</italic> or <italic>A&#x000f1;o de Salud Rural</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Additionally, the more recent <italic>Ley Org&#x000e1;nica de Educaci&#x000f3;n Superior</italic> (LOES) requires all students seeking higher education degrees to complete a community service internship or community improvement project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. As a result, the curriculum for health science degrees at many learning institutions includes service-based learning courses and internships with rural communities and vulnerable populations. Students seeking degrees in healthcare in Ecuador participate in community improvement projects and provide free health services under the supervision of faculty health professionals, thus conforming to the standards under LOES and to Ecuador&#x02019;s National Plan for Wellbeing (<italic>Plan Nacional del Buen Vivir</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. For example, nursing students in the Family Nursing rotation at Pontificia Universidad Cat&#x000f3;lica del Ecuador (PUCE) provide health education, increase access to health services, and develop family-specific plans of care to populations in rural communities near Quito, the country&#x02019;s capital. The purpose of this service-based learning course is not only to meet the requirements of national legislation but also to improve the overall welfare and quality of life in these rural communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Although the rural health practice of students in service-based learning courses is believed to improve the quality of life in these communities, empirical evidence has yet to be established. Much research exists that assesses the educational and professional benefits of rural medical service for the provider [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; however there is a startling lack of investigation on the effects of such programs on the recipient population. A handful of studies in high-income countries undertake a qualitative approach to describe the benefits of service-based learning for the recipient population, reporting that nursing students have the potential to effectively fill service gaps and can improve health-related behaviors in underserved populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. One study quantitatively analyzed the impact of interprofessional teams of students, finding that a student-based home visitation program effectively increased preventive health measures among recipient households [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The results of these studies are encouraging; however, no studies have been conducted to-date that assess the impact of nursing student home visits on the health outcomes of a rural population in a low- or middle-income country.</p><p id="Par9">The aim of this study was to determine the impact of the Family Nursing rotation of Pontificia Universidad Cat&#x000f3;lica del Ecuador on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and perceived social support of a rural population in Ecuador. HRQoL, while not a direct indicator of health, is a well-established proxy measure that reflects the impact of health status on overall quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Assessing an individual&#x02019;s HRQoL gives insight into both physical and mental wellbeing, and changes in HRQoL over time can be used to describe the impact of personal experiences and/or health-related interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Perceived social support is directly linked to quality of life and refers to an individual&#x02019;s interpersonal network and the emotional, instrumental, and informational resources that network interactions provide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Assessments of individuals&#x02019; perceived social support over time can reveal changes in social function and interpersonal support, factors which can impact quality of life and disease severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. For this study, we conducted pre- and post- evaluations of HRQoL and perceived social support in order to measure the impact of a nursing student intervention on a rural population in Ecuador.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Intervention</title><p id="Par10">Nursing students at Pontificia Universidad Cat&#x000f3;lica del Ecuador (PUCE) complete the Family Nursing rotation (Fundamentals of Family and Community Nursing) during their sixth semester of study. The primary objective of the rural family service learning experience is to train the nursing students to be able to provide comprehensive care in the community through a combination of clinical intervention, health promotion and education, and linkages with the local public health facilities. The intervention was provided only to the experimental community and was supervised by nursing faculty at PUCE. Faculty at PUCE provided the students with a checklist of interventions from the Nursing Intervention Classification (NIC) to be administered to each family that were appropriate to the students&#x02019; level of competency and in-line with the course objectives. The checklist included 63 intervention activities from 10 of the 30 NIC classes: Self-Care Assistance, Exercise Promotion, Active Listening, Coping Enhancement, Self-Esteem Enhancement, Family Support, Socialization Enhancement, Support System Enhancement, Risk Identification, and Health Education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The students were also instructed to develop customized plans of care according to the individual family&#x02019;s needs.</p><p id="Par11">Each nursing student was assigned two families in the experimental community to visit each week for 8&#x000a0;weeks. At the initial home visit, the students conducted a needs assessment and developed a plan of care for the family. At each subsequent home visit, the students carried out specific objectives relating to the plan of care, including vital sign monitoring, educational talks, chronic disease management support, and basic clinical interventions. The students provided the families with health promotion materials, basic medical supplies, and customized nutrition plans. When necessary, the nursing students made referrals to local public health facilities and/or communicated directly with the family&#x02019;s primary care provider to ensure continuation of care. While all nursing students were expected to complete the checklist of NIC items for each family, the remaining aspects of the intervention varied widely according to the families&#x02019; needs. Examples of interventions provided included diabetes management, prenatal care, childhood immunizations, sexual health education, and mobility exercises.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design and setting</title><p id="Par12">This study is a quasi-experimental non-equivalent control group design (NCGD). Research partners at the Universidad San Francisco de Quito identified two rural communities in Tumbaco, Ecuador, to receive the intervention over the course of the academic semester. Tumbaco is a rural parish (<italic>parroquia</italic>) located within the Metropolitan District of Quito (DMQ).</p><p id="Par13">Rural populations in the DMQ are fitting candidates for community health interventions, as the area is experiencing an increasing trend of private health facilities and a reduction in public facilities accessible to the poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The community receiving the intervention during the course of this study was designated as the experimental group, while the community scheduled to receive the intervention in the following semester was designated as the control group. Because assignment to the experimental group was not random, the researchers chose a control community similar in size and containing a population of comparable family type, age, and socioeconomic status, as determined by statistical tests for independence (see Results). Though the intervention was delivered at the household level, the unit of analysis for this evaluation is the individual study participant, as HRQoL and perceived social support are concepts measured at the individual level. Thus, individual members of families receiving the intervention were selected for the study.</p><p id="Par14">Members of both communities were invited to participate in the study through a door-to-door recruitment process in which each community was divided into sectors, and a data collection team made up of one public health researcher and one nursing student was assigned to each sector. Each team attempted to approach every home in the sector during days of the week when most families would be at home in an effort to recruit one member of each household into the study. Eligibility criteria for study participation included the ability to read and write in Spanish and an age of 18&#x000a0;years or older. Families or individuals who had participated in similar interventions within the last 18&#x000a0;months were excluded. Informed and written consent was obtained for all study participants, and all study procedures were approved by the institutional review boards at the Universidad San Francisco de Quito and the University of Georgia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data collection and instruments</title><p id="Par15">Pre-intervention data collection occurred in June and July 2015 for both the experimental and control groups. Four surveys were administered to participants at this time: 1) a family health questionnaire; 2) a measure of socioeconomic status; 3) a HRQoL survey; and 4) a measure of perceived social support. Post-intervention data collection occurred December 2015 &#x02013; January 2016 in both groups and included the HRQoL survey and the measure of perceived social support.</p><p id="Par16">The family health questionnaire was developed by a team of researchers at PUCE and served as a needs assessment for the nursing students as they developed their plan of care for the family. It contained questions on demographic information, health behaviors, and healthcare utilization. This questionnaire has been used in multiple communities throughout Ecuador [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Socioeconomic status was derived using a questionnaire developed by Ecuador&#x02019;s Instituto Nacional de Estad&#x000ed;stica y Censos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The INEC questionnaire obtained information about the family&#x02019;s living conditions, access to technology, consumer behavior, and level of education and translated these answers into a score between 0 and 1000. This score then corresponded to one of five socioeconomic groups, labeled &#x0201c;Low&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;High&#x0201d;.</p><p id="Par18">HRQoL was measured at the individual level using version two of the 12-item short-form health survey (SF-12v2). The SF-12v2 has demonstrated adequate validity and reliability in the United States and internationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and the Spanish language version has been used successfully in Latin America and with Spanish-speaking populations in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The survey measures HRQoL across eight health domains: physical function (PF), physical role (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), social function (SF), emotional role (RE), and mental health (MH). Domain scores were used to calculate two component summary scores: the physical component summary (PCS) and the mental component summary (MCS). Questionnaires were scored and raw scores were transformed to a norm-based 0&#x02013;100 scale according to Quality Metric guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The final norm-based scores correspond to a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10, meaning that scores above 50 are higher than the average score of the reference population. For this study, a 1998 general United States population was used as the reference population because population coefficients for Ecuador were not available, and US-derived scores are the recommended international standard for comparison [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Perceived social support was measured at the individual level with the 12-item short-form Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL-12) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The ISEL-12 comprises a series of Likert scale items, and scoring the instrument involved summing all of the items to obtain an overall score of perceived social support. Individual items are designated as part of one of three social support domains that may be scored to provide corresponding subscale scores: appraisal (instructional support/advice), belonging (emotional support/acceptance), and tangible (material support/assistance). Scores range from 0 to 36, but there is no general population coefficient available for norm-based scoring. The Spanish language version of the ISEL-12 has been validated and used among Latino populations in the United States and in Latin America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study sample</title><p id="Par20">Members of 54 households in the experimental community were enrolled in the intervention, and 74 households in the control community participated in baseline data collection. Eleven intervention participants (20.4%) and 19 control participants (25.7%) were lost to follow-up. Additionally, one intervention participant and five control participants were missing SF-12 data and were excluded from the SF-12 analysis, while three intervention participants and one control participant were missing ISEL-12 data and were excluded from the ISEL-12 analysis.

To our knowledge this is the first study to examine the impact of nursing student service provision on the population served instead of on the student providers in a low- or middle-income country. Overall, this analysis demonstrated that students completing their rural Family Nursing rotation have the potential to improve the health-related quality of life and perceived social support of rural residents in Ecuador. The statistically significant impact of the intervention was limited to small improvements in the physical function domain of the SF-12v2 and the overall physical component summary score of the SF-12v2, but mean improvements across nearly every health-related quality of life and interpersonal support measure were realized for the experimental group.</p><p id="Par28">Additionally, this study introduces HRQoL as an outcome measure for health sciences students completing their LOES community internship requirements. More traditional measures, such as body mass index or blood pressure, may not be appropriate target outcomes for an 8-week student intervention, as significant changes in these measures are difficult to achieve in such a short time period. HRQoL is more amenable to short-term interventions and, if assessed repeatedly and in a variety of settings, could serve as an indicator of the success of Ecuador&#x02019;s LOES community improvement objective as well as other service-based learning programs.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par29">Certain limitations should be considered when examining the results of this study. First, the study participants were not randomized into experimental and control groups; randomization into study group was not feasible, as the intervention administrators lacked the capacity to deliver the intervention simultaneously across multiple communities. One consequence of this non-randomization is the higher mean age of the experimental group. Although HRQoL is often associated with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], the <italic>change</italic> in HRQoL from pre- to post-intervention was not found to be significantly correlated with age in this sample. Difference in differences analysis was chosen in an effort to mitigate the effects of non-randomization, but the potential for selection bias remains. Second, the decision to limit study eligibility to participants who could read and write in Spanish mitigated the potential effect of interviewer bias at the expense of introducing selection bias, as those in the study area who could not meet the literacy requirements were excluded from participation in the surveys. Illiterate members of participating households were not precluded from receiving the intervention, but their exclusion from the surveys is likely to have reduced the generalizability of our results. Third, the study sample was small, and many were lost to follow-up after baseline data collection due to participants leaving the community, a work schedule that precluded them from participating in the intervention, or being otherwise unavailable during follow-up data collection. Similarly high rates of loss to follow-up are not uncommon in low resource settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Despite the small sample size, however, statistically significant differences between experimental and control conditions existed, suggesting that effects could have been even greater if the study was better powered.</p><p id="Par30">Additionally, the use of a 1998 United States population as the reference group for the norm-based scoring of the SF-12v2 limits the conclusions that can be drawn about the study sample&#x02019;s scores relative to other populations. The baseline SF-12v2 scores for this sample were below average for nine of ten summary measures, but it is unclear whether this actually signifies a lower quality of life or is instead a factor of inappropriate population weights. Despite this limitation in comparisons with other populations, use of the US population weights did not limit the conclusions drawn from differences between pre and post for our experimental and control groups.</p><p id="Par31">Finally, the intervention was not fully standardized across the experimental group. The nursing students were required to complete a checklist of NIC activities for each family, but the remaining aspects of the intervention were customized to each family&#x02019;s needs. Measuring the impact of an intervention that provides prenatal care and childhood immunizations to one family and chronic disease management to members of another precludes a measurement tool that is precise and narrow in scope. Instead, a broad intervention requires a general measure; thus, we chose the SF-12v2 and the ISEL-12 in an effort to capture general improvements in our experimental population, but it is possible that the chosen measurement tools were not equipped to recognize additional manners in which the intervention may have improved the quality of life and wellbeing of the participants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par32">The results of this study are promising regarding the potential for health sciences students in a service-based learning course to contribute to improved health outcomes in a rural population. This study fills a gap in the literature by examining the impact of nursing student service provision on the HRQoL and perceived social support of the population served. Additionally, this study contributes to the evaluation of Ecuador&#x02019;s LOES community improvement objective by introducing HRQoL as a potential indicator of health sciences students&#x02019; success in service-based learning programs. Further studies of this kind are necessary to determine if similarly positive findings are realized for other rural populations in Ecuador and globally.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported in part by a grant to author PC in 2015 from the US Fulbright Scholar Program.
