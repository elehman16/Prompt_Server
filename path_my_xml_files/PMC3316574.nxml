Cumulative evidence suggests that nicorandil has several beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system; however, its effects on the pulmonary vasculature under PAH remain undetermined.</p><p>On this basis, we evaluated the efficacy of nicorandil in an experimental rat PAH model induced by monocrotaline (MCT). Also, the mechanisms of action of nicorandil were investigated in vivo and in vitro. Here, we show that nicorandil attenuates MCT-induced endothelial damage and apoptosis in pulmonary vasculature under PAH through production of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and anti-apoptotic factors; the production is mediated by the cell survival signaling cascades, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways, which are mainly activated via the opening of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. The results suggest that nicorandil may have a therapeutic potential for PAH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Animals</title><p>Wild-type Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Japan SLC.

Although the effects of nicorandil in PAH have remained undetermined, a few reports based on animal studies <xref rid="pone.0033367-Hongo1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and clinical experience <xref rid="pone.0033367-Sahara2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> have suggested its potential efficacy for PAH treatment. In contrast to our results, Hongo et al. <xref rid="pone.0033367-Hongo1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> reported that late treatment with nicorandil could not prevent further development of PAH nor prolong survival in rats with established PAH. The reason for this discrepancy remains unclear, but it may be attributable to the difference in the injection method of nicorandil (drinking water or subcutaneous osmotic pumps).</p><p>MCT, a pyrrolizidine alkaloid toxin, induces selective pulmonary endothelial injury and apoptosis, followed by severe inflammatory responses and medial hypertrophy <xref rid="pone.0033367-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033367-Lame1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In our study, nicorandil protected the endothelium of the pulmonary vasculature from MCT injury by both restoring eNOS expression and inhibiting the induction of endothelial cell apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. Cumulative evidence suggests that endothelial cell apoptosis in pulmonary vasculature might trigger pathological vascular remodeling, leading to the progression of PAH <xref rid="pone.0033367-Voelkel1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0033367-Farkas1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033367-Sahara1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Consistent with the findings of a previous report <xref rid="pone.0033367-TarasevicieneStewart1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, the broad caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fmk also attenuated the development of MCT-induced PAH in the present study, accompanied with a decrease in endothelial cell apoptosis in the pulmonary microvasculature. It is plausible that the anti-apoptotic effects of nicorandil and ZVAD-fmk on the pulmonary vascular endothelium might contribute to the blocking of development of pathological pulmonary vascular remodeling induced by MCT and therefore lead to the improvements on pulmonary hemodynamics and survival in rats with MCT-induced PAH. On the other hand, medial hypertrophy itself by proliferation of vascular SMCs is also a major histopathological finding in pulmonary vasculature under PAH <xref rid="pone.0033367-Archer1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0033367-Rabinovitch1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, and nicorandil seems to have the direct and/or indirect effects on SMCs in the media of PAs as nicorandil markedly reduced the number of proliferating SMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033367-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Our results are consistent with the report demonstrating that nicorandil has anti-proliferation effects on rat aortic SMCs <xref rid="pone.0033367-Fujiwara1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Intriguingly, a specific anti-apoptotic reagent ZVAD-fmk also attenuated proliferation of medial SMCs in the remodeled PAs in the similar manner as nicorandil. Since we found no TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells among proliferating medial SMCs in PAs of the MCT-injured lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033367-g002">Figure 2D&#x02013;E</xref>), it would appear that ZVAD-fmk exerted anti-apoptotic effects on pulmonary vascular endothelial cells, not on medial SMCs, in this setting, resulting in the indirect anti-proliferation effects on medial SMCs. Taken together, nicorandil might attenuate medial hypertrophy of PAs in this model by not only the direct effect on PA-SMCs but also the indirect effect through blocking the induction of apoptosis on the pulmonary vascular endothelium. This notion is supported by the results of the recent report that has revealed that the absence of normal immune regulation results in an inappropriately exuberant inflammatory response and accelerated endothelial cell apoptosis, leading to smooth muscle hypertrophy and increased pulmonary vascular resistance <xref rid="pone.0033367-Tamosiuniene1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>Although the anti-apoptotic effects of nicorandil on vascular endothelial cells have not been reported so far, nicorandil is known to exert anti-apoptotic effects on cardiomyocytes via the activation of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels <xref rid="pone.0033367-Akao1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The protective effects of nicorandil on the pulmonary endothelium in our study were involved in the eNOS production, and this finding is consistent with a previous study <xref rid="pone.0033367-Horinaka1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> that revealed that nicorandil enhanced eNOS expression in the myocardium via the opening of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. In our study, the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel closer glibenclamide inhibited the nicorandil's protective effects, including the enhanced expression of eNOS on the pulmonary endothelium, suggesting that eNOS production induced by nicorandil appeared to be a downstream event after the opening of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. The notion is supported by the findings of a previous report <xref rid="pone.0033367-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> that showed that a K<sub>ATP</sub> channel opener protected the myocardium against lethal ischemia via NOS production.</p><p>The production of anti-apoptotic factors and eNOS by nicorandil was associated with the activation of both the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Indeed, the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways play a crucial role in cell survival and regulation of apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0033367-Datta1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033367-Segar1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Many downstream effectors in the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways, including Bcl-2, Bad, and the caspase family members, function as inhibitors of apoptosis. Intriguingly, the ERK1/2 pathway has been reported to undergo activation in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS) <xref rid="pone.0033367-Guyton1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, and the opening of mitochondrial K<sub>ATP</sub> channels has been shown to generate mitochondria-derived ROS in cardiomyocytes <xref rid="pone.0033367-Pain1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Thus, owing to its K<sub>ATP</sub> channel-opening property, nicorandil may activate the ERK1/2 pathway via the generation of ROS in the mitochondria in vascular endothelial cells, although not addressed in this study; the notion is supported by evidence from the literature that has shown that another K<sub>ATP</sub> channel opener diazoxide also triggers ERK activation through mitochondria-derived ROS in cardiomyocytes <xref rid="pone.0033367-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. On the contrary, the opening of mitochondrial K<sub>ATP</sub> channels has been reported to activate the PI3K/Akt pathway in the cardiomyocytes of rodents as well <xref rid="pone.0033367-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033367-Ahmad1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In addition, NO has been shown to induce the activation of both the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways through a cyclic guanosine monophosphate-dependent pathway <xref rid="pone.0033367-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033367-Kasuno1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Taking into consideration that the degree of the in vitro effects induced by diazoxide in our study was lesser than that induced by nicorandil, not only the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel-opening effect but also the NO-releasing property itself of nicorandil may contribute to the activation of the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 pathways, resulting in the beneficial protective effects against serum starvation in vitro and MCT injury in vivo.</p><p>NO is known to dilate the pulmonary vessels and used in the short-term treatment of patients with severe PAH derived from a variety of origins, although there is limited experience with the long-term use of inhaled NO as a treatment of PAH <xref rid="pone.0033367-Archer1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033367-Humbert1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033367-Malhotra1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In the present study, a slow NO-releasing drug, sr-ISDN, also attenuated MCT-induced PAH in rats to some degree; however, the effects without changing systemic blood pressure and heart rate were modest compared with nicorandil. Given that a K<sub>ATP</sub> channel closer glibenclamide inhibited approximately 60&#x02013;70&#x00025; of the nicorandil's protective effects for deteriorated pulmonary vasculature and hemodynamics in rats with MCT-induced PAH, it seems that the major beneficial effects of nicorandil are attributed to its K<sub>ATP</sub> channel opening property, while its NO donor property functions adjunctively in this setting. Alternatively, the feature as being a unique hybrid drug with the 2 vasodilator actions may be a crucial advantage of nicorandil, at least in the context of treatment of PAH.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study has revealed that nicorandil attenuates MCT-induced vascular endothelial damage and apoptosis and PAH through the production of eNOS and anti-apoptotic factors, which is mediated by the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. These results strongly supports the notion that nicorandil has a promising therapeutic potential for PAH.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>This study was supported in part by a grant from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan to M.
