breathing exercise and expiratory pursed-lip breathing exercise on chronic stroke
patients&#x02019; respiratory muscle activation. [Subjects and Methods] All experimental subjects
performed exercises five times per week for four weeks. Thirty chronic stroke patients
were randomly assign to an experimental group of 15 patients and a control group of 15
patients. The experimental group underwent exercises consisting of basic exercise
treatment for 15 minutes and inspiratory diaphragm breathing exercise and expiratory
pursed-lip breathing exercise for 15 minutes and the control group underwent exercises
consisting of basic exercise treatment for 15 minutes and auto-med exercise for 15
minutes. The activation levels of respiratory muscles were measured before and after the
experiment using MP 150WSW to obtain the results of the experiment. [Results] In the
present study, when the pulmonary functions of the experimental group and the control
group before and after the experiment were compared, whereas the experimental group showed
significant differences in all sections. In the verification of intergroup differences
between the experimental group and the control group before and after the experiment.
[Conclusion] The respiratory rehabilitation exercise is considered to be capable of
inducing positive effects on stroke patients&#x02019; respiratory muscles through diaphragm
breathing exercise and lip puckering breathing exercise.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Strokes</kwd><kwd>Diaphragm breathing exercise</kwd><kwd>Pursed-lip respiratory exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke patients&#x02019; respiratory functions are directly/indirectly affected by declines in the
oxygen transport related cardiovascular system functions and heart beat functions and
decreases in paretic side breast wall movements and electrical activities<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup> and the cardiovascular system functions
decline remarkably due to reduction on the frequency of physical activities<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, respiratory efficiency and
changes in respiratory mechanism of patients reflect damage and asymmetry of thoracic wall
movement and muscular paralysis. In order to resolve these problems, chest wall expansion
and ventilation and pulmonary volume and capacity should be appropriately maintained<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> and evaluation of functional ability of the
lungs through precise measurement of pulmonary functions, and diagnosis, prognosis, and
degree of a disease may be made to obtain the ground for exercise prescription<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the case of stroke patients, direct/indirect changes in muscle strength appear to
obstruct daily living activities and asymmetric postures or movement forms appear to hamper
the stability of the performance of motions making the performance of elaborate limb
functions difficult. Such muscular weakening appears not only in limb muscles but also in
muscles distributed in the trunk to affect respiratory muscles and accessory respiratory
muscle among trunk muscles<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Since
respiratory muscle weakening causes difficulties in breathing and declines in the ability to
perform movements, therapeutic interventions that can improve respiratory muscle functions
thereby relieving severely labored breathing and enhancing motion resistance such as
ventilatory muscle training are required<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>When stroke patients performed muscle strength exercise along with aerobic exercise,
significant increases in functional muscle strength were reported<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. McCool and Tzelepis<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> advised that when initial stroke patients performed exercise at
sufficient intensity to increase muscle strength, respiratory muscle strength and endurance
increased so that eventual improvement in respiratory functions could be expected. In
addition, it was reported that when intervention methods for respiratory muscles were
compared in inspiratory muscle weakening patients, inspiratory resistance exercise was shown
to be more effective for muscle strengthening than 6 minutes walking or endurance
exercise<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, a study examined
the effects of feedback respiratory equipment exercise on the endurance and quality of life
of chronic obstructive lung disease patients<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stroke patients increased muscle strength and improved postural
stability through direct function strengthening training in a study<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, and Dietz<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that stroke patients improved muscle strength and
coordination through large-scale resistance exercise using PNF.</p><p>Based on these various theoretical grounds, this study is intended to examine the effects
of inspiratory diaphragm breathing exercise and expiratory pursed-lip breathing exercise of
hemiplegia stroke patients manually implemented by therapists on the activation of stroke
patients&#x02019; paretic side respiratory muscles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted in K Hospital located in Daegu Metropolitan City from September 1
to September 30, 2016. The subjects of this study were 30 stroke patients who were diagnosed
with a stroke 6 months or longer before through computed tomography or magnetic resonance,
and they were randomly and equally assigned to an experimental group and a control group.
All the subjects sufficiently listened to explanation on this study and consented to
participate in the experiment. The criteria for inclusion were: those who did not have a
history of pulmonary disease prior to the onset of a stroke, who did not have a damage
accompanying orthopedic disease such as congenital thoracic deformation or rib fracture, who
did not receive special treatment for pulmonary function improvement, who were able to walk
independently, who did not receive drug therapy for the alleviation of stiffness, and whose
mini mental state examination-Korean version score was 24 or higher so that they could
understand and follow what the researcher instructed. This study was approved by the
University institutional review board and was conducted in accordance with the ethical

Both groups received
ordinary physical therapy for 15 minutes consisting of joint mobilization exercise, muscular
strengthening exercise, and extension exercise. Thereafter, the experimental group underwent
breathing exercise that combined inspiratory diaphragm breathing exercise and expiratory
pursed-lip breathing exercise for 15 minutes. First, inspiratory diaphragm breathing
exercise was implemented. To implement this exercise, the therapist placed his/her hands on
the superior rectus abdominis immediately below the anterior costal cartilage and induced
inspiratory diaphragm breathing by instructing the patient to slowly and deeply inhale the
air through the nose. When the rectus abdominis of the subject was raised, the experimenter
applied appropriate resistance to the superior rectus abdominis to induce deep
inspiration<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Immediately after
completion of the inspiratory diaphragm breathing, the patient was instructed to perform
expiratory pursed-lip breathing exercise by continuously exhale the air for a certain time
using adjusted deep expiration while puckering the lips<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. When a patient
complained about fatigue or dizziness during breathing exercise, the patient took a rest and
conducted breathing exercise again. The control group after receiving ordinary physical
therapy comprised of joint mobilization exercise, muscle strengthening exercise, and
extension exercise for 15minutes performed auto-med exercise (RECK-Technik GmbH &#x00026; Co.,
Betzenweiler, Germany) that did not affect breathing exercise at an intensity of no more
than 20% of heart rate reserve for 15 minutes<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As measurement equipment for the experiment, MP 150WSW (Biopac System Inc., CA, USA) was
used. For electromyographic measurement, while a patient in a sitting position was breathing
deeply, data filtering and other signal processing were made using ACqkonwledge 3.8.1
software on a personal computer. Surface electrodes were attached to the lateral middle area
of the acromion from the seventh cervical vertebra on the upper trapezius (UT), the inferior
angle of the scapula from the tenth thoracic vertebra on the latissmus dorsi (LD), 1&#x02005;cm area
upward from the 2&#x02005;cm side from the center of the navel on the rectus abdominins (RA), the
lowest area of the thorax on the external abdominal oblique (EAO), and 1&#x02005;cm medial area in
the central part from the anterior superior iliac spine on the internal abdominal oblique
(IAO). The reference electrode was attached to the spinous process of the seventh cervical
vertebra<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. An EMG surface electrode
Ag/AgCI (Biopac, diameter 2&#x02005;cm) was attached on the muscle belly where muscles developed
most after measurement errors were eliminated and medical alcohol was used to clean the
area<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For electrode analysis of respiratory muscles, muscle contraction of specific motions was
assumed as reference voluntary contraction (RVC) and based on this, standardization was made
(%RVC method)<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> and electrode values on
the effect of respiratory training were observe dusing integrated EMG<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. In order to minimize differences between individuals and
areas with in each individual and observe overall trends, normalization process is
needed<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the
subjects&#x02019;muscle activity during deep respiration prior to and after the experiment was
measured and the entire area of each muscle was calculated and the average value was set at
100% and then muscle activity in accordance with the experimental period was normalized. As
for measurement time, motions for 5 seconds were conducted three times in order to obtain
average values among 5-second measured time and in order to measure average activity,
average values of the middle three seconds excluding the first second and the last second
were obtained<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Sampling rates of
electrode signals were set at 1,024&#x02005;Hz. In order to remove noise from the measured EMG
signals, raw data were band pass filtered at 10&#x02013;20&#x02005;Hz and smoothing filtered at RMS 20&#x02005;ms
through rectification. EMG signals were analyzed using MyoReserch program after measuring
changes in muscle activity and collecting EMG signals<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Data of this study were analyzed using SPSS win 16.0 program. Paired sample t-tests were
conducted to compare the respiratory muscle activity levels of the experimental group and
the control group before and after the experiment conducted through diaphragm breathing
exercise and pursed-lip breathing exercise and independent t-tests were used to compare
differences between before and after the experiment in the experimental group and the
control group. A statistical significance level was set at &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>When the paretic side respiratory muscle activity levels of the experimental group and the

before and after exercise were examined through training for four weeks of an experimental
group that underwent inspiratory diaphragm breathing exercise and expiratory pursed-lip
breathing exercise and a control group. In this study, when the activity levels of paretic
side respiratory muscles before and experiment were compared, the experimental group showed
relatively more significant increases in efficiency in all muscles than the control group.
These results are considered attributable to the therapist&#x02019;s manual resistance directly
applied during the subject&#x02019;s inspiration that increased the activity of diaphragm muscles
while increasing the activity of abdominal respiratory muscles and the patient&#x02019;s expiratory
pursed-lip resistance exercise that increased pressure in the abdomen leading to drastic
increases in lung ventilation that had been reduced and improved the expansive motility of
the breast wall leading to increases in the activity of respiratory muscles.</p><p>Park et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> implemented respiratory

after cerebral palsy children&#x02019;s respiratory muscle control training which increased the
activity of the abdominal muscles in the trunk. In addition, Jo<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup> implemented cerebral palsy children&#x02019;s postural control
exercise programs to find significant differences in the activity of the left and right
trapezius muscle, the left and right latissimus dorsi muscles, and the left and right rectus
abdominis muscles. De Andra et al.<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that when they measured the muscle activity of COPD patients through breathing
exercise, the activity of the trapezius muscle showed significant increases. Zupan et
al.<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the activity of the
abdominal muscles of quadriplegia patients was improved through respiratory muscle training.
Jang<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that normal persons&#x02019;
breathing ability strengthening exercise showed effects on the activation of the left and
right trapezius muscle and the sternocleidomastoid muscle although the effects were not
significant. Saleem et al.<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested an
effect on aerobic muscular strength by improving aerobic capacity in aerobic muscle
strengthening training for patients with idiopathic Parkinson&#x02019;s disease for 4 weeks. Kim et
al.<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup> implemented abdominal breathing
exercise with low back pain patients and found significant increases in the activity of the
oblique muscle of abdomen. Although previous studies did not implement inspiratory diaphragm
breathing exercise and expiratory pursed-lip breathing exercise simultaneously with stroke
patients as with this study, the results of those studies that implemented diverse breathing
exercises are consistent with the results of this study.</p><p>The results of this study are thought to be good enough to be suggested as new breathing
