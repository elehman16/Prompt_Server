steps on average at the post-intervention assessment compared with the baseline. The step counts for the follow-up assessment of this group were less than the post-intervention assessment but still 579 steps higher than baseline. A within-group comparison revealed that the aerobics group significantly improved step counts (post-intervention and follow-up assessments) compared to the assessment at baseline. Step counts differed significantly between the aerobics group and the control group over time. These findings suggest that the aerobics group was more effective than the control group in increasing step counts. Hence, the difference in step counts between the aerobics group and the control group are assumed to be due to the differences in the intervention component (aerobics classes) during the 16-week intervention period. On average, the participants in the aerobics group attended at least 11 out of 16 aerobics class sessions, which is an attendance rate of approximately 69%.</p><p id="p0190">A statistically significant difference was observed between the control group's assessments at baseline, post-intervention and follow-up for step counts. The difference between the post-intervention assessment and that at baseline was 520 steps per day. The difference between the follow-up assessment and the assessment at baseline was 379 steps per day. The step counts were therefore significantly higher for the post-intervention and follow-up assessments compared to the baseline. The use of the pedometers had likely encouraged control participants to increase their step counts, similar to the findings of other studies.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Step counts for the follow-up assessment were less than those of the post-intervention assessment but were still higher than the assessment at baseline.

The step counts for the follow-up assessment of the POD group were less than those for the post-intervention assessment but, on average, each member still achieved 473 more steps than at baseline. A within-group comparison revealed that the POD group significantly improved their step counts (post-intervention and follow-up assessments) compared to the assessment at baseline. The step counts did not differ significantly between the POD group and the control group over time. The study's results corroborated the findings of a great deal of previous research. A review of POD interventions in workplaces revealed little hard evidence of success, particularly in terms of stair climbing. However, the difference between the stairs at workplaces and public access stairs is that the choice in the former is between stairs and elevators rather than escalators.<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> A study showed that the overall average increase in stair climbing was 5.9% for public access settings involving a choice between stairs and escalators.

A truly stage-based physical activity intervention usually encompasses different interventions, in which one intervention for each stage of change. In this study, evaluation of these physical activity interventions involved a single programme for participants from three stages of change (precontemplation, contemplation and preparation). Although interventions that were developed are not truly stage-based, the other dimensions of the Transtheoretical Model (processes of change, decisional balance and self-efficacy) were not neglected.</p><p id="p0245">The accelerometer might not reflect the total physical activity carried out by participants, because it did not capture movement in certain forms of activities, such as cycling, swimming, heavy lifting and household chores.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0250">The findings of this study suggested that physical activity interventions via aerobics classes may be an effective strategy to improve step counts in people with metabolic syndrome compared to point-of-decision prompt.
