The malaria vaccine FMP2.1/AS02<sub>A</sub> is a recombinant protein (FMP2.1) based on apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) from the 3D7 clone of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, formulated in the Adjuvant System AS02<sub>A</sub>. The comparator vaccine was a cell-culture rabies virus vaccine (Rab<italic>Avert</italic>&#x000ae;). One hundred healthy Malian children aged 1&#x02013;6 years were recruited into 3 cohorts and randomized to receive either 10 &#x000b5;g FMP2.1 in 0.1 mL AS02<sub>A</sub>, or 25 &#x000b5;g FMP2.1 in 0.25 mL AS02<sub>A</sub>, or 50 &#x000b5;g FMP2.1 50 &#x000b5;g in 0.5 mL AS02<sub>A</sub>, or rabies vaccine. Three doses of vaccine were given at 0, 1 and 2 months, and children were followed for 1 year. Solicited symptoms were assessed for 7 days and unsolicited symptoms for 30 days after each vaccination. Serious adverse events were assessed throughout the study. Transient local pain and swelling were common and more frequent in all malaria vaccine dosage groups than in the comparator group, but were acceptable to parents of participants. Levels of anti-AMA1 antibodies measured by ELISA increased significantly (at least 100-fold compared to baseline) in all 3 malaria vaccine groups, and remained high during the year of follow up.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion/Significance</title><p>The FMP2.1/AS02<sub>A</sub> vaccine had a good safety profile, was well-tolerated, and induced high and sustained antibody levels in malaria-exposed children. This malaria vaccine is being evaluated in a Phase 2 efficacy trial in children at this site.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00358332 [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00358332">NCT00358332</ext-link>]</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>A safe and effective malaria vaccine would be a major addition to current malaria control tools and could reinforce hope for malaria eradication.

Parents were invited to bring children aged 1 to 6 years to the research clinic to be screened for eligibility. Children were eligible for inclusion if they planned to remain in Bandiagara for at least 12 months and if their parents or guardians gave written informed consent. Exclusion criteria included: significant current illness as indicated by history, examination and/or laboratory testing including complete blood counts, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and serum creatinine; previous immunization with a rabies vaccine or any experimental vaccine; chronic use of immunosuppressants; receipt of blood products during the previous 6 months; and allergy to substances present in the vaccines.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Ethics</title><p>The trial was conducted in compliance with the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practices, the Declaration of Helsinki and regulatory requirements of Mali. The protocol was approved by institutional review boards of the University of Bamako Faculty of Medicine, University of Maryland Baltimore, and the U.S. Army Surgeon General. Separate written informed consent was obtained for screening and enrollment. Verbal consent of illiterate parents or guardians was administered and then documented using their thumbprints, a process verified by signatures of independent witnesses. Permission to import and administer the investigational products in Mali was granted by the Republic of Mali Ministry of Health. The trial was monitored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases and the United States Army Medical Material Development Activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Interventions</title><p>The FMP2.1 antigen (Lot 1046) is comprised of amino acids #83-531 corresponding to the ectodomain of AMA1 derived from the 3D7 clone of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. The protein was produced in and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteria under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research Pilot Bioproduction Facility (Forest Glen, Maryland, United States) <xref rid="pone.0009041-Dutta3" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The vaccine was provided in vials containing approximately 50 &#x000b5;g of lyophilized protein.</p><p>The AS02<sub>A</sub> Adjuvant System is composed of an oil-in-water emulsion and 2 immuno-stimulants, 3-deacylated monophosphoryl lipid A and QS21, a saponin agent derived from the soap bark tree, <italic>Quillaja saponaria</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0009041-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009041-Soltysik1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. AS02<sub>A</sub> was manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (Rixensart, Belgium) according to cGMP and provided in pre-filled syringes. The whole content of each FMP2.1 vial was dissolved by adding the contents of 0.62 mL pre-filled syringes of AS02<sub>A</sub> to the vial immediately before injection, mixing well, and withdrawing into a new syringe. The RabAvert&#x000ae; rabies vaccine (Chiron Corporation, Emeryville, California, United States) is a sterile freeze-dried vaccine obtained by growing the fixed-virus strain Flury LEP in primary cultures of chicken fibroblasts. It is supplied in pre-filled syringes containing lyophilized antigen to which 1 mL of sterile water was added as diluent before injection. All doses of all vaccines were administered by intramuscular injection preferably in the left deltoid muscle.</p><p>One hundred children aged 1 to 6 years were sequentially assigned to 3 cohorts of 20, 40 and 40 participants with stratification for age by 2-year increments (1&#x02013;2 years, 3&#x02013;4 years, and 5&#x02013;6 years) to ensure that the study groups were balanced by age in case of age-related differences in tolerability or immunogenicity. Within each cohort, participants were randomized in a 3&#x02236;1 fashion to receive 10, 25 or 50 &#x003bc;g of FMP2.1 adjuvanted with a proportionate volume of AS02<sub>A</sub>, or rabies vaccine. After reconstitution, the doses of FMP2.1/AS02<sub>A</sub> were approximately: 10 &#x000b5;g of FMP2.1 in a final volume of 0.10 mL AS02<sub>A</sub> in Cohort 1, 25 &#x000b5;g of FMP2.1 in a final volume of 0.25 mL AS02<sub>A</sub> in Cohort 2, and 50 &#x000b5;g FMP2.1 in a final volume of 0.5 mL in Cohort 3. Because the final injection volumes were slightly smaller than the reconstitution volumes, the doses of the FMP2.1 antigen delivered were slightly less than 10, 25 or 50 &#x003bc;g. Vaccines were given on a 0-, 1- and 2-month schedule. In each cohort, older children were immunized at least one day before younger children so that vaccine responses could be observed first in older children before exposing younger children to potential risks of vaccination. The first vaccination was given in early November 2006 near the end of the peak malaria transmission season; the second and the third doses were given in December - February 2007, when malaria transmission typically declines to virtually undetectable levels at this site. The final study follow-up visit on day 364 coincided with the end of the 2007 malaria transmission season. The cohorts were immunized in a staggered fashion to permit interim safety analyses; each successive immunization of Cohort 1 was followed in approximately 3 weeks by the corresponding immunization of Cohort 2. Immunizations of Cohort 2 were followed in a similar way by immunizations of Cohort 3. Two interim safety analyses were reviewed by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board, which provided written recommendations to proceed before each of the first immunizations of Cohorts 2 and 3.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of 3 injections of 3 different dose levels of the malaria vaccine FMP2.1/AS02<sub>A</sub> in malaria-experienced Malian children. The secondary objective was to measure the magnitude and duration of antibody responses to FMP2.1. Exploratory objectives include measuring vaccine-induced cellular immune responses at baseline and after immunization (results to be presented elsewhere).</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome was safety, measured as 1) occurrence of solicited symptoms during a 7-day follow-up period after immunization (day of immunization and days 1, 2, 3 and 7 after immunization); 2) occurrence of unsolicited symptoms during a 30-day follow-up period after each immunization (day of immunization and 29 subsequent days); and 3) occurrence of serious adverse events (SAE) during the study period.

This Phase 1 trial was thus not powered to detect differences between groups. We used a comparator vaccine group of 25 to permit broad estimates of the incidence of local and general side effects and of immune responses among vaccine recipients compared to controls. We began with a group of 20 children randomized 3&#x02236;1 to receive 10 &#x000b5;g of FMP2.1 in 0.1 mL of AS02<sub>A</sub> or rabies vaccine to rule out a common adverse reaction in children that would preclude further testing. This was not considered a dose level to be evaluated for further clinical development and thus did not warrant the larger sample size of the 25 &#x000b5;g and 50 &#x000b5;g dose level groups.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Randomization&#x02014;Sequence Generation</title><p>Participants were randomized to one of 3 cohorts in the order of enrollment, with stratification for age by 2-year increments (1&#x02013;2 years, 3&#x02013;4 years, 5&#x02013;6 years). Within each of the 3 cohorts, individual participants were randomized in a 3&#x02236;1 ratio to receive either FMP2.1/AS02<sub>A</sub> or rabies vaccine. The randomization sequence was generated by a computer program to ensure a 3&#x02236;1 ratio of vaccine allocation. Randomly generated sequential codes linked each study number to a vaccine assignment (FMP2.1/AS02<sub>A</sub> or rabies vaccine).</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Randomization&#x02014;Allocation Concealment</title><p>The randomization sequence was provided by the study statistician in an opaque sealed envelope to the study pharmacists. In addition the local safety monitor was provided with a sealed envelope to be opened if it was deemed necessary to determine urgently the intervention a participant had received; no such emergency unblinding occurred. The only people at the study site with access to the randomization codes during the study were the 2 study pharmacists, who had no contact with study participants and did not reveal vaccine assignments to anyone else.

On this day, study pharmacists opened the sealed envelope containing the vaccine assignments and prepared the vaccine to be administered to the respective study participant. The vaccine and dose assigned during the first immunization were maintained for second and third immunizations. The study pharmacists prepared the vaccines in a special room with access strictly limited to them and to study monitors. Syringes containing the prepared vaccines were passed through small sliding doors from the vaccine preparation room to separate, private vaccine administration rooms, where the immunizations were administered.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Blinding</title><p>The reconstituted rabies vaccine was a clear to slightly opaque, colorless suspension of 1 mL volume, while FMP2.1/AS02<sub>A</sub> was off-white and 0.10, 0.25 or 0.5 mL in volume. Syringes containing vaccines were covered with opaque tape to conceal their contents from participants and immunizers. The study pharmacists, who were unblinded, had no study-related contact with participants and were not involved in outcome assessment. Because of the difference in volumes, the immunizers could potentially have deduced which vaccine was given to a specific participant, and therefore they did not participate in other study procedures, including follow-up assessments. The presence of both study pharmacists and immunizers at the site was limited to the periods during which immunizations were given, and these individuals did not discuss vaccine allocation with other study staff.</p></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS, Cary, North Carolina, United States). Confidence intervals for geometric mean AMA1 antibody levels (&#x000b5;g/mL) were estimated by using log<sub>10</sub>-transformed values, calculating the 95&#x00025; confidence interval based on the normal distribution, and then converting the limits to the original scale for presentation. T-tests were used to compare log-transformed antibody levels at each study time point. Longitudinal mixed models were also used to estimate the effect of vaccine dose on mean log-transformed antibody levels over time, using a spatial exponential covariance structure to model the correlation between measurements from the same individual while taking into account the number of study days between measurements. Safety and immunogenicity analyses were based on intention-to-treat, such that all available data were included in analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Participant Flow</title><p>Three hundred and one (301) children were screened, and 100 who fulfilled the criteria for inclusion were enrolled in the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009041-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The most common reasons for exclusion were medical illnesses such as anemia, respiratory infections and malaria. Nine parents of screened children subsequently declined to allow their children to participate in the study. In Cohort 1, one participant missed the third vaccine dose due to an episode of anemia. In Cohort 2, the third dose was not given to 5 children due to: hepatitis B infection in one child, hepatitis A infections in 3 children and a new asymptomatic systolic heart murmur in another child, further assessments of whom uncovered no evidence of cardiac disease. In Cohort 3, one child had hepatitis A and was not given the third vaccine dose. In the same cohort, 2 children missed the second and third vaccine doses, in one case because of anemia diagnosed on the day that the second dose was due, and in the other case, because the participant's father withdrew consent for blood collection after first vaccination.

The highest proportion of children with fever was observed in the 25 &#x000b5;g group, in which 30&#x00025; of children had fever of mild to moderate intensity after immunization 1. The proportion of children reporting at least one systemic adverse event was the lowest among those aged 1&#x02013;2 years and 5&#x02013;6 years. Children in the 10 &#x000b5;g malaria vaccine and the rabies vaccine groups experienced the fewest systemic adverse events. All systemic solicited symptoms were of Grade 1 or Grade 2 intensity and all resolved during the 7-day follow-up period.</p></sec><sec id="s3e3"><title>Unsolicited adverse events</title><p>Overall, 1,131 unsolicited adverse events were reported during the 30-day post immunization period. Unsolicited adverse events were balanced by study groups and were representative of local patterns of childhood illnesses. The majority of unsolicited symptoms for all age groups were acute respiratory tract infections, followed by malaria episodes and gastrointestinal disorders. Three unsolicited adverse events were graded as severe; all were instances of abnormal laboratory values in children aged 1&#x02013;2 years old. A white blood cell (WBC) count of 17.7&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup>/&#x000b5;L was detected on the day of the first immunization (prior to immunization) with the 10 &#x000b5;g dose of the malaria vaccine, and a WBC of 22.6&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup>/&#x000b5;L was detected in another child 1 week after the first rabies vaccine immunization. Both of these elevated WBC counts were associated with concurrent minor infections. In the third case, a serum ALT of 364 U/L that was detected 1 week after the third immunization with the 50 &#x000b5;g dose of the malaria vaccine was determined to be due to hepatitis A infection, confirmed by serology. All abnormal lab values resolved within 1 month.</p></sec><sec id="s3e4"><title>Serious adverse events</title><p>Four serious adverse events (SAE) occurred during the study. The first was a WBC elevation to 30.3&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup>/&#x000b5;L (defined according to the protocol as an SAE) that was detected 1 week after the second immunization with the 10 &#x000b5;g malaria vaccine. This leukocytosis occurred contemporaneously with a malaria illness episode and resolved shortly after the end of the malaria episode. The second SAE was an elevation of serum ALT to grade 4 toxicity level at 521 U/L that was detected 1 week after receipt of the second dose of rabies vaccine. The high value was detected at a scheduled clinic visit and was not associated with any concerning clinical symptoms. Serological testing identified hepatitis A infection as the cause of the elevated ALT, which returned to normal after 2 weeks. Nevertheless the third immunization was withheld. The third and fourth SAEs were both ALT elevations that occurred in children with minor clinical symptoms and were determined by serological testing to be caused by a hepatitis B infection. In the first case, a moderate ALT elevation to 53 U/L was reported after the third immunization with the 25 &#x000b5;g dose of malaria vaccine. Thirty days later the ALT level was 1,260 U/L, constituting grade 4 toxicity and an SAE. Given the temporal relationship with vaccination an association cannot be ruled out, in that even with hepatitis B infection as the primary cause of ALT elevation, vaccination could have amplified the rise of ALT. The second case of hepatitis B occurred with a rise in ALT to 1,371 U/L on study day 90, a month after all 3 rabies vaccine immunizations had been completed, and was deemed not related to study products. All 4 SAEs resolved within 3 to 4 weeks of follow up with no sequelae.</p></sec><sec id="s3e5"><title>Laboratory safety tests</title><p>Grade 1 elevated platelet count was the most common laboratory abnormality and was observed in 8, 16, 12 and 15 children in the 10 &#x000b5;g, 25 &#x000b5;g 50 &#x000b5;g and rabies vaccine groups, respectively. The highest platelet counts were reported in a 10 &#x000b5;g malaria vaccine recipient, with values of 1,096&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup>/&#x000b5;L on the day of the second immunization (prior to immunization) and 1,397&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup>/&#x000b5;L a week after the second immunization. These values were observed 5 weeks apart, with a normal platelet count in between. This child experienced several concurrent illnesses, including the SAE with very high WBC, and was not given the third vaccine dose due to moderate anemia.</p><p>Hemoglobin levels remained within or slightly above the normal range (9.8 g/dL to 12.4) for all but 4 participants throughout the study. Four children had grade 1 low hemoglobin levels measured at limited time points, one in the 10 &#x000b5;g group a week after the second immunization; and 3 in the 25 &#x000b5;g group occurring on the days of the first and second immunizations and a month after the third immunization, respectively. One grade 2 low hemoglobin was recorded in the 50 &#x000b5;g group on the day of the second immunization. Laboratory abnormalities detected on days of immunization were seen in blood samples that had been collected just prior to immunization.</p><p>Other abnormal hematology (lymphocyte count) and biochemistry (serum creatinine and ALT) laboratory abnormalities were evenly distributed among study groups. In addition to the 3 ALT abnormalities constituting SAEs described above (1 in the 25 &#x000b5;g group and 2 in the rabies vaccine group), 9 additional elevated ALT values were reported; 2 in the 10 &#x000b5;g group, 2 in the 25 &#x000b5;g group (1 attributed to hepatitis B); 4 in the 50 &#x000b5;g group (2 attributed to hepatitis A) and 1 in the rabies vaccine group (attributed to hepatitis A). No temporal pattern relative to immunizations was apparent in these cases of ALT elevation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Immunogenicity</title><p>Baseline antibody levels were low in all groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009041-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Immunization with the 3 dose levels was followed by a dramatic rise in anti-AMA1 antibodies, significantly higher than in the control group after a single immunization. Antibody levels peaked 4 weeks after the third immunization on study day 90 with 100-fold or greater rise relative to baseline, and remained significantly higher than in the control group throughout the 12 months of the study. In all groups the antibodies waned as the malaria transmission season was ending and rose as the new malaria season began. At all post-immunization time points, mean log antibody levels (&#x000b5;g/mL) were significantly higher in the malaria vaccine groups compared to the rabies vaccine group (t-test p-values &#x0003c;0.0001 at all post-immunization time points for each malaria vaccine dose group compared to rabies vaccine group). Longitudinal models showed the same results, with p-values&#x0003c;0.0001 at all post-immunization time points for each malaria vaccine dose group compared to rabies vaccine. All doses of the malaria vaccine induced similar high levels of antibodies, with overlapping 95&#x00025; confidence intervals among the 3 malaria vaccine dose groups at all time points. Pre-immunization anti-AMA antibody levels tended to be lower in children in the youngest age group (1&#x02013;2 years) than in older children (data not shown).</p><fig id="pone-0009041-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0009041.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Anti-AMA1 antibody levels.</title><p>Geometric mean of antibodies (&#x000b5;g/mL) to homologous recombinant AMA1 for FMP2.1/AS02<sub>A</sub> 50 &#x000b5;g dose, FMP2.1/AS02<sub>A</sub> 25 &#x000b5;g dose, FMP2.1/AS02<sub>A</sub> 10 &#x000b5;g dose and rabies vaccine recipients.

The 3 dose levels of the malaria vaccine had acceptable tolerability. Local reactions were more frequent in malaria vaccine groups than in the comparator group. Pain and/or swelling at the injection site were experienced by most recipients of the malaria vaccine. Although swelling was often classified as grade 3 based on the size of the reaction (&#x0003e;20 mm), these episodes of swelling were short-lived and were usually unnoticed by participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009041-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Nine participants received fewer than 3 vaccine doses. Four SAEs were observed; all were instances of grade 4 laboratory abnormalities. A high follow-up rate (96&#x00025;) was achieved.</p><p>All 3 dose levels of the malaria vaccine elicited high levels of antibodies recognizing the vaccine antigen after a single immunization, peaking a month after the third immunization. The children in this trial had almost 30-fold lower baseline levels of anti-AMA1 antibodies than adults had in a previous trial of this vaccine at this site <xref rid="pone.0009041-Thera1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and this lower baseline likely accounts for the more than 100-fold increase following immunization, compared to a 5- to 6-fold rise in the adult trial. These high levels were sustained for 1 year after the first dose was given. No significant differences in antibody levels were observed between the malaria vaccine groups.</p><p>The peak antibody levels reached a month after the third immunization in these children were similar to, or even slightly higher than, those seen previously in adults at this site. In adults we observed a tendency toward a dose response, with the 50 &#x000b5;g group having the highest antibody levels, while in children the 25 &#x000b5;g antibody levels were slightly higher. None of these differences, however, were statistically significant, and the proportions of children with 4-fold or higher rises in antibody levels was similarly high in all age groups and at all post-immunization time points (data not shown), supporting the conclusion that there was no dose effect. Since data on the duration of these responses were not available at the time the Phase 2 trial began, the highest dose with an acceptable safety profile, 50 &#x000b5;g, was selected for further evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Generalizability</title><p>The safety and tolerability profile of the FMP2.1/AS02<sub>A</sub> vaccine was similar to that seen in previous trials of this vaccine in North American malaria-na&#x000ef;ve volunteers <xref rid="pone.0009041-Polhemus1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and in Malian adults <xref rid="pone.0009041-Thera1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, as well as in trials of a similar recombinant protein blood-stage malaria vaccine with the same adjuvant in this and other African populations <xref rid="pone.0009041-Thera2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009041-Withers1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. As in these other trials, most of the adverse reactions both to the malaria vaccine and to the rabies vaccine were local and transient. There was no evidence of an increased risk of anemia, a concern raised in the report of the Phase 2 trial of the AMA1-C1 vaccine <xref rid="pone.0009041-Sagara1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>
</p><p>All 3 dose levels of the FMP2.1/AS02<sub>A</sub> vaccine resulted in at least 100-fold increases in AMA1 antibody levels. While it is not possible to compare antibody levels measured in this trial with those seen in trials of other AMA1 vaccines, based on the relative fold-rise and duration of antibody responses this profile compares favorably with much lower and shorter-lived increases in antibody levels observed in Malian children immunized with AMA1-C1, an AMA1 vaccine adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide <xref rid="pone.0009041-Dicko1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, which provided no measurable protection in a recently reported Phase 2 trial at another site in Mali. Notably, while baseline antibody levels among children in this trial were about 10-fold to 50-fold lower than pre-immunization levels in adults at this same site, children achieved post-immunization AMA1 antibody levels that were at least as high as those seen in vaccinated adults <xref rid="pone.0009041-Thera1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009041-Sagara1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Moreover, the post-immunization AMA1 antibody levels in children were about 10-fold higher than baseline levels in semi-immune adults who have robust naturally acquired immunity that protects them against clinical malaria disease despite frequent infection.</p><p>Although the strong and sustained antibody responses observed in this trial are encouraging, it is not known whether antibodies raised against AMA1 based on the 3D7 clone of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> will protect against infection with the highly diverse forms of AMA1 found in nature <xref rid="pone.0009041-Takala1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009041-Takala2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009041-Duan1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The AMA1 vaccine that recently failed to demonstrate protection, AMA1-C1, is a bivalent vaccine based on genetically diverse AMA1 sequences derived from two different <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates. It is not yet known whether this lack of efficacy is due to an insufficiently robust immune response, to failure of allele-specific antibodies to protect against the wide array of AMA1 variants, or because immune responses to AMA1 alone are simply unable to prevent clinical malaria. High levels of inhibitory AMA1 antibodies were correlated with protection in a recent trial of AMA1 vaccines in Aotus monkeys <xref rid="pone.0009041-Dutta4" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, supporting the idea that AMA1-C1 could have failed because it was insufficiently immunogenic.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that the FMP2.1/AS02<sub>A</sub> vaccine elicits antibodies that inhibit both parasite growth and AMA1 processing in homologous parasites <xref rid="pone.0009041-Polhemus1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> as well as measurable cellular immune responses <xref rid="pone.0009041-Lyke1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Post-immunization sera from Malian adults who received the 50 &#x000b5;g dose of FMP2.1/AS02<sub>A</sub> (but not sera from those who received the 25 &#x000b5;g dose) of the malaria vaccine had significantly greater growth inhibition activity against both 3D7 and FVO parasites than did post-immunization sera from the rabies comparator group in the previous Phase 1 trial <xref rid="pone.0009041-Thera1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. However, until an AMA1 malaria vaccine demonstrates clinical efficacy against genetically diverse natural parasites, the relevance of growth inhibition assays and other humoral and cellular immunogenicity endpoints for clinical development decisions will remain a matter of reasoned conjecture.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Overall Evidence</title><p>Based on its good safety profile, acceptable tolerability, and very robust antibody responses, the 50 &#x000b5;g dose of the AMA1-based malaria vaccine FMP2.1/AS02<sub>A</sub> was selected for evaluation in a Phase 2 efficacy trial in children aged 1&#x02013;6 years at the Bandiagara Malaria Project in Mali. If the results of this trial are promising, the development pathway for this vaccine could include incorporating the FMP2.1 antigen as one component of a multi-stage, multi-antigen malaria vaccine in combination with RTS,S <xref rid="pone.0009041-Heppner1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, improved adjuvant formulations <xref rid="pone.0009041-Spring1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and/or separate development as a disease-blocking vaccine for use in targeted populations in malaria transmission areas. As AMA1 malaria vaccines are evaluated in efficacy trials, the impact of genetic diversity of parasite antigens on vaccine efficacy is likely to emerge as a critical problem requiring integration of methods and concepts drawn from molecular epidemiology, molecular evolution, immunology and structural vaccinology <xref rid="pone.0009041-Takala1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009041-Takala2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0009041.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial protocol</p><p>(0.39 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0009041.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0009041.s002"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>Completed CONSORT checklist</p><p>(0.19 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0009041.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Abdi Naficy and Lee Hall of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for support and advice; Guindo Mariam Traore and Boubacar Kouyate for serving as Local Medical Monitors; the study monitors, Norbert Tamm and Denise McKinney; Mirjana Nesin and members of the Data Safety Monitoring Board; Mahamadou Traore, Bourama Kane, and Mamadou Demb&#x000e9;l&#x000e9; for clinical assistance; Danzele Coulibaly and Moctar Traore for administrative support; the chief medical officer of the Bandiagara District Hospital Mahamadou Cisse for technical support; Nicole Eddington and Lisa Ware for technical and administrative support; Karen Ball for regulatory support; the team of the Bandiagara Malaria Project in Bandiagara for their dedication; and the community of Bandiagara, Mali.</p><p>The views expressed by the authors are private and not to be construed as official positions of the United States Departments of the Army or Defense.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>SD and DEL hold patents for the FMP2.1 vaccine antigen.
