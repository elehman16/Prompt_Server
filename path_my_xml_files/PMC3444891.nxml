The report of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) <italic>&#x02018;To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System&#x02019;</italic> showed that 3% to 4% of patients hospitalized in the United States (US) were harmed by the care they received. The IOM concluded that poor teamwork and communication was a contributing factor in more than one-half of medical errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Classen <italic>et al.</italic> indicate that adverse events rates may be even ten times higher than previously measured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Teamwork in healthcare is defined as a dynamic process involving two or more health professionals with complementary backgrounds and skills, sharing common health goals, and exercising concerted physical and mental effort in assessing, planning, or evaluating patient care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In industries such as aviation and automobile manufacturing, the value of high-performance teams has long been realized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The Agency for Healthcare and Research Quality (AHRQ) has argued to learn from the experience in these industries and implement various interventions that could improve teamwork as a strategy for enhancing patient safety and reducing medical errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. A meta-analysis on team-training interventions across different settings reported that they account for approximately 20% of the variance in team performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. A RAND report that reviewed 16 healthcare studies found empirical evidence supporting the relationship between teamwork and patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>One of the interventions that can promote teamwork in healthcare is the implementation of care pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Care pathways are widely used quality improvement initiatives for organising and reorganising care processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Compared with other care coordination interventions, such as the chronic care model or integrated care, care pathways are most effective for standardizing low complexity and low uncertainty care processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Uncertainty implies in the context of care coordination that the course of disease or treatment of a particular patient is unpredictable. The use of care pathways supports healthcare teams in implementing evidence-based key interventions and reduce clinical variations in everyday practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, they are high-performing work systems that improve organisational performance by strengthening relationships and coordination among team members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Considering different types of team training, as defined by the AHRQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], we see care pathway development as a behaviour change intervention containing a mix of cross-training, self-correction, and team-building exercises. Through care pathway development, roles and tasks of team members are traded, interprofessional relations are improved, feedback on performance is provided, short- and long-term team goals are set, evidence-based practice increases, an overall team vision and shared mental model is built up, and high-performance teams can be established.</p><p>Looking at most systematic reviews on pathway-effectiveness studies, the primarily focus is on how they affect hospital costs, patient outcomes, and length of stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The way they affect teamwork is seldom documented. This could be explained because the main goal of care pathways is in fact to improve patient processes and outcomes. Improved teamwork is then merely seen as one of the important mediators and facilitators to achieve that goal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, as Thomas <italic>et al.</italic> state, quality improvement initiatives as care pathways, although not always explicitly targeted, could actually improve teamwork and even have better results for patients than other team training interventions that focus solely on teamwork [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. A recent systematic review did find a positive, but cautious, indication that a relationship between care pathways and teamwork does exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Although evidence was of rather low quality, most frequently positive effects of care pathways were found on staff knowledge, interprofessional documentation, team communication, and team relations. The review also identified some negative effects of care pathways, of which most importantly were increased workload and emerging team conflicts through care pathway implementation. Furthermore, as mentioned in their commentary on the review by Salas <italic>et al.</italic>, good teamwork is not only about standardized communication protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Attention in care pathways should be given to create the ability to adapt, innovate, and react efficiently and effectively when the situation calls for it. The review concluded that the absence of high-level evidence is due to the lack of high-quality designs and the failure to use validated team indicators in pathway-effectiveness studies.</p><p>The European Pathway Association (E-P-A) defines a care pathway as &#x02018;a <italic>complex intervention</italic> for the mutual decision making and organisation of care for a well-defined group of patients during a well-defined period&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. As complex interventions, they are built up from a number of components that may act both independently and interdependently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Although they are difficult to specify, these interacting components seem essential to the proper functioning of the intervention. The more it is difficult to exactly define the active components of an intervention, and how these interrelate, the more it is likely that the intervention is a complex one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Care pathways seem to be at the higher end of the complexity spectrum. According to an international survey on use of care pathways, possible active components are increased evidence-based care, improved coordination of the care process, improved communication with the patient, improved teamwork, improved follow-up and increased efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Nonetheless, strong evidence on active components and causal pathways is lacking. Furthermore, knowledge on the process of pathway implementation is sparse and variations in how organisations go about the implementation process are large [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Multiple behavioural and organisational components will influence the extent to which they can be successfully integrated into everyday healthcare practice. Evaluating and implementing care pathways therefore requires understanding on how and in what circumstances they work by exploring the context in which they are implemented and the interrelating mechanisms that define their success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective of the European Quality of Care Pathways (EQCP) study is to evaluate the impact of care pathways on interprofessional teamwork in healthcare teams in an acute hospital setting. A secondary goal is to build up knowledge on the active components of care pathways and on the conditions under which they can be most effective through evaluation of the implementation processes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Setting</title><p>The EQCP study is an international multicentre research project launched by the European Pathway Association (E-P-A) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.E-P-A.org">http://www.E-P-A.org</ext-link>), an international not-for-profit association. The E-P-A is collaborating with the Centre for Health Services and Nursing Research of the Faculty of Medicine of the Catholic University Leuven (Belgium) and the School of Public Health of the Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont (Italy) who take the scientific lead in this study. As explained in more detail in Vanhaecht <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], the overall project consists of three parts: a trial focusing on the impact of a care pathway for exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD-exacerbation) on patient processes and outcomes; a trial focusing on the impact of a care pathway for proximal femur fracture (PFF) on patient processes and outcomes; and a trial we are discussing here focusing on the impact of care pathways on interprofessional teamwork in which both COPD-exacerbation and PFF-clinical teams are included. The study is being performed in four countries: Belgium, Ireland, Italy and Portugal. In each country, a research centre is coordinating the project based on an international agreed protocol and a national coordinator is appointed. Furthermore, each participating team is asked to appoint a study coordinator as local facilitator for the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>To evaluate the effect of the care pathway, a stratified post-test-only cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) is used (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In cRCTs, groups of people, rather than individuals, are randomised into an intervention and a control group. Because care pathways are complex interventions and they are developed for and will affect groups of people, a cluster randomised design is required to evaluate their effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Each cluster consists of all individual members of the interprofessional team caring for patients hospitalized for COPD-exacerbation or PFF in a particular hospital. Stratified randomisation was used to assign the teams to an intervention group (using care pathways) and a control group (usual care). Interprofessional teams were randomised. COPD/PFF was used as blocking factor. To ensure that clusters in both arms are in balance, they are stratified for country-level, hospital type (teaching versus non teaching), size of hospitals (&#x0003c;600 and &#x02265;600 beds), and annual volume of patients (&#x0003c;300 and &#x02265;300 patients). Before the start of the randomisation process, random numbers were assigned to each cluster by a researcher not involved in the study, using the online available tool &#x02018;Research Randomizer&#x02019; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomizer.org">http://www.randomizer.org</ext-link>). Next, the researcher randomly allocated the coded clusters to the intervention or control group using the same online tool. Through this, the randomisation process itself was fully concealed. Afterward, the research team and the participating teams were notified to which group they were allocated just before the start of the intervention. Each team randomised in the intervention group will implement the complex intervention for the development and implementation of a care pathway for COPD-exacerbation or PFF (see in more detail below). The teams randomised in the control group will not implement the complex intervention, and thus will provide usual care. The intervention teams will have about nine months to implement the complex intervention. After this time period, a summative evaluation will be performed in which performance on team indicators will be compared between the intervention and control group.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study design of the EQCP-trial on teamwork.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1748-5908-7-47-1"/></fig><p>To enhance understanding on how the complex intervention, in case the care pathway, was actually implemented and under what conditions this implementation process was successful or not, the use of qualitative methods such as process evaluations alongside randomised controlled trials is advised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. This is because multiple behavioural and organisational factors will influence the extent in which the intervention can be integrated into everyday healthcare practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. These factors will in turn determine their actual effectiveness. Therefore, the context in which the care pathway was developed and the implementation process will be evaluated using process measures during and after pathway-implementation in the intervention group.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Inclusion on cluster level required the written agreement to participate from the hospital management, the medical head of the division, and the head nurse. In addition, they had to agree that they will not develop and implement a care pathway for COPD-exacerbation or PFF within the time frame of the study when randomised in the control group. Finally, the participating hospitals needed an expected volume of more than one hundred COPD-exacerbation or PFF patients annually. To have a comparable sample across all clusters, the following inclusion criteria on individual level are:</p><p>1. All professionals that according to the medical head of the division and head nurse are members of the interprofessional team caring for COPD-exacerbation or PFF patients from admission until discharge out of the acute hospital ward.</p><p>2. To be part of the interprofessional care team is further conceptualized as being part of the group of clinicians and staff who have a shared clinical purpose and direct care responsibilities for the respective patient group during the set time period.</p><p>3. All individual participants need to be member of the team during one specific week&#x02014;chosen by the study coordinator and can be defined as an average week, with normal staff ratios&#x02014;where patients are being followed for the two other trials of the EQCP project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]; Because we want to study interprofessional teamwork, each cluster is asked to minimally include the orthopaedic surgeons/pneumologists, head nurse, nurses, physiotherapists, and social workers in their sample. Based on their own judgment, the medical head of the division, in consensus with the head nurse, can decide to include other professional groups in their sample.</p><p>4. In some hospitals COPD-exacerbation or PFF patients are being admitted at multiple nursing wards, <italic>e.g.</italic>, due to capacity problems or other organisational issues. If that is the case, then the clusters are asked to only include these team members that are working on the ward where the respective patient groups are being admitted most frequently.</p><p>Exclusion criteria are:</p><p>1. All team members that are not working (<italic>e.g.</italic>, on leave) during the chosen week.</p><p>2. All team members who are only temporarily part of the team (<italic>e.g.</italic>, student nurses in training).</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>In each of the four participating countries, hospitals were asked to participate by E-P-A in close cooperation with each national coordinator. In total, 132 teams (65 COPD teams and 67 PFF teams) agreed to participate (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). After the randomisation process, 68 teams were assigned to the intervention group (33 COPD teams and 35 PFF teams). Sixty-four teams were assigned to the control group (32 COPD teams and 32 PFF teams).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Participating teams in the EQCP-trial on teamwork.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1748-5908-7-47-2"/></fig><p>Sample size calculation in a cRCT is based on the expected improvement in the main outcome parameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Our research team decided to use the team process indicator &#x02018;relational coordination&#x02019; as main outcome parameter for the EQCP-trial on teamwork. The concept of relational coordination (RC) describes a mutually reinforcing process of communicating and relating for the purpose of task integration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The following criteria justify our choice: RC describes communication and relations within the type of teams we are focusing on; an international panel of scientific experts and hospital managers identified team communication and relations as highly relevant for follow-up as team indicators (Content Validity Indexes of 89% and 86%, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and both are dimensions measured with the concept of RC; Gittell <italic>et al.</italic> showed that there is a clear mediating relationship between RC and the performance effects of care pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]; and systematic literature review showed a positive relation between care pathways and both team communication and relations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>To calculate the expected improvement, existing data available through the formative evaluation (see below) of the 20 participating Belgian clusters randomised in the intervention arm were used. This set contains the scores on RC of 362 participating individual team members. RC is scored on a scale from 1 (low RC) to 5 (high RC). The range of the average RC-scores on cluster level in the dataset was 2.9 to 3.9. The gap between the highest and lowest score was thus 1.34. We then identified 4 as cut-off score, because this is the average between our top score (3.9) and the top score (4.2) in the nine-hospital study of Gittell <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In our sample, 30% of participants (107/362) scored higher than 4. If we take this actual gap as expected improvement, then we can expect that the percentage of participants scoring more than 4 would increase to 40% after care pathway implementation (30%*1.34). Based on a power of 80% and a significance level of 0.05 (two-sized), we would need up to 364 team members per arm to observe a difference of 10% (case&#x02009;=&#x02009;40%; control&#x02009;=&#x02009;30%) in number of participants scoring higher than 4 on RC. Given an inflation factor (IFF&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.306) using the ICC out of two previous cRCTs on pathway-effectiveness by Panella <italic>et al.</italic> (ICC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.018) and the average sample size of the Belgian clusters in the intervention group during the formative evaluation (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;17) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], the required sample size increased to 475 team members per arm. Considering the average sample size of 17 team members per cluster, we need 28 clusters per arm.</p></sec><sec><title>The complex intervention: care pathway implementation in the intervention arm</title><p>The care pathway intervention contains three active components (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>):</p><p>1. Formative evaluation of the teams&#x02019; performance before implementation: For this, a measure of the teams&#x02019; performance on team indicators and on patient process indicators is planned. The set of team indicators that will be used for this evaluation is described below. The patient process indicators are described in the research protocols of the other two EQCP trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. These process indicators measure the teams&#x02019; compliance to the key interventions in the care process. Key interventions are those that, based on evidence-based medicine, need to be performed to guarantee high-quality care, and that thus will have significant impact on patient outcomes. An evaluation of performance to these process indicators will be performed for 20 consecutive patients. Each team will receive a feedback report with their own results, both on team and on patient level, benchmarked with the results of the other participating teams. Furthermore, a workshop per country will be organised on the interpretation of these results and on how these results should be presented to the teams. These workshops will be lead by an organizational psychologist (M.E.) and experts in care pathway development (K.V. and W.S.). All involved study coordinators will be invited. After a general introduction, the participants will be divided in small groups of five to help them interpret the results. The formative evaluation will help the teams to understand their actual performance, their points for improvement, and their actual level of organisation of the care process.</p><p>2. Evidence-based key interventions: Each team will receive a set of evidence-based key interventions for COPD-exacerbation or PFF. This set is based on an extensive literature review, Map of Medicine&#x000ae; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mapofmedicine.com">http://www.mapofmedicine.com</ext-link>), and on consensus by international clinical experts using a Delphi survey. The key interventions and outcomes include both in-hospital interventions and information for a safe discharge. A workshop will be organised on the content and evidence base of these interventions. These workshops will be lead by clinical experts in COPD and PFF. Next to the study coordinator, three key stakeholders of the participating teams will be invited. A teach-the-teacher based approach will be used.</p><p>3. Training in pathway development: Each study coordinator will be trained to develop the care pathway based on the findings of the formative evaluation. In the training workshop, a care pathway implementation protocol based on the Deming Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle and behavioural change strategies, which is generally accepted as the standard method for care pathway implementation, will be used (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. These one-day workshops will be led by experts in pathway development (W.S. and K.V.) and organizational and team change (M.E.). Again, a teach-the-teacher based approach will be used. Change will be further supported by giving the possibility to exchange best experiences among participating teams.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Active components of the EQCP-complex intervention.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1748-5908-7-47-3"/></fig><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Care pathway implementation protocol based on the Deming-PlanDoStudyAct cycle.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1748-5908-7-47-4"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><p>The set of effect measures is described in Table&#x02009;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Teamwork is traditionally described using systems theory with an &#x02018;input-process-output&#x02019; based approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This implies that effectiveness of teamwork is defined by a complex set of interactions between team inputs (context and structure of the team), team processes, and team outputs. Because we want to study the impact of care pathways on all facets of teamwork, we adopted this multifaceted &#x02018;input-process-output&#x02019; approach in our choice of team indicators. The selection of measures is based on the international expert panel on relevant indicators to follow-up in care processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and the systematic review of the relationship between care pathways and teamwork [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Hence, the research team made a substantiated decision on the measures based both on identified relevance to follow-up and expected effect of care pathways. As mentioned before, relational coordination is our primary effect measure. Next to the effect measures, a set of covariates will also be measured (Table&#x02009;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). All team indicators will be analyzed on individual level, except for some team input indicators that will be measured on cluster level. These data will be collected with the use of both validated tools and structured questionnaires developed by the research team.

As the World Health Organisation (WHO) World Alliance for Patient Safety points out, improving communication and coordination has to be priority number one for patient safety research and practice in developed countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Furthermore, team-directed implementation strategies for change in healthcare are still seldom studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Following Thomas <italic>et al.</italic>, we believe that care pathways, as being interprofessional quality improvement initiatives, can improve teamwork and install high-performing teams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Through their use, care processes are organised, roles and tasks are standardized, clear team goals are set, and a team vision is built. This will lead to improved team communication and will install high quality interprofessional relations, which could in turn improve teamwork in all its facets.</p><p>Quality improvement initiatives as care pathways are strongly linked with behavioural change. Looking at the Theory of Planned Behaviour, effective behavioural change is guided by three kinds of considerations: normative, behavioural, and control beliefs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. With our complex intervention, containing three active building blocks, we expect to affect all three defining factors. The feedback on the actual performance should create normative beliefs and motivation for change. The set of evidence-based key interventions should create behavioural beliefs that comply with these interventions will actually improve patient outcomes and thus team performance. Finally, the training in care pathway development should install beliefs of control over factors that can facilitate or impede pathway implementation. Therefore, we are confident that with these three components, the teams will have the necessary tools to implement real change.</p><p>One strength of the study is the use of a high-quality cRCT design with multilevel analysis, as required to evaluate complex interventions affecting groups of people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Second, we include in our design a realistic evaluation approach by using process evaluations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Third, we study the impact on teamwork in all its facets, using an input-process-output approach. Fourth, the choice of team indicators to follow-up is based on extensive literature review and international expert panel. Fifth, we set clear inclusion criteria for team members, which will enhance the comparability of our clusters. On the contrary, we did give the medical head of the division and head nurse the opportunity to choose additional professional groups that are also members of their team according to them, because &#x02018;team composition&#x02019; is one of our team input indicators. Because we expect that the intervention teams will evaluate the composition of their team, our hypothesis is that they will be composed of more professional groups than the control teams. Sixth, the international nature of the study, and because we both include COPD teams (medicine) as PFF teams (surgery), increases generalisability. Finally, with the large number of participating teams, we should have enough power to find significant effects.</p><p>A challenge for the study is that, although our complex intervention with its three building blocks is standardized, this does not imply that the implementation process will be fully under control. This is a key feature of complex interventions. The teams will have the ability to choose which key interventions they want to include or exclude. Organisational context and team conditions will influence the implementation process, and thus will have an impact on pathway-effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Nonetheless, the implementation processes will be strictly followed-up using the Normalisation Process Model that will enable us to define active components and preferred implementation strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Second, because teams involved in pathway development frequently are newly formed work groups and comprise different professionals with different professional backgrounds and cultures, these teams will have to struggle through the initial formative stages of group development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Professional fragmentation and emerging team conflicts could therefore influence each professions&#x02019; response to the implementation of care pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. These specific conditions could thus influence our study results. Third, because care pathways are primarily used to improve patient processes, the focus during pathway development could center solely on compliance to the key interventions in the process and not on improving teamwork [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Fourth, because this is the first controlled trial that will study the impact of care pathways on relational coordination, no data out of literature were available to define the expected improvement. This increases uncertainty about our sample calculation. Fifth, non-response to surveys could influence the results. Sixth, results will be primarily based on self-reported measures, causing some limitations such as possible social desirability bias. Finally, the summative evaluation will occur at one time point only. Therefore, we will not be able to measure the sustainability of the effect of care pathways.</p><p>Results from our study will allow researchers and healthcare managers to draw conclusions on the interrelations and interactions between care pathway implementation and team inputs, processes, and outcomes. Through this, body of knowledge on the active components and facilitators of care pathway implementation will be further developed, and preferred implementation strategies can be defined. This should guide healthcare teams in actively improving the quality and safety of care processes.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>EQCP-Study, European quality of care pathways study; cRCT, Cluster randomised controlled trial; PFF, Proximal femur fracture; COPD, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; IOM, Institute of medicine; AHRQ, Agency for healthcare and research quality; CP, Care pathways; EPA, European pathway association; RC, Relational coordination; EC, Ethical committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>The study is coordinated by KV.
