Plaque samples from diseased periodontal tissues reveal high percentage of Gram-negative (75%), anaerobic (90%) putative bacteria.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Higher levels of <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> (Pg), <italic>Bacteroides forsythus</italic> and <italic>Treponema</italic> species are associated with chronic periodontitis. These pathogens produce various trypsin-like enzymes that degrade intercellular matrix of periodontal tissues.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Various periodontal therapeutic approaches to purge and kill these microorganisms include invasive or non-invasive methods. Scaling and root planning (SRP) is said to only reduce the bacterial overload from tooth surface and does not necessarily eliminate all pathogens from deep pockets.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Although, administration of systemic antimicrobials are useful in treating recurrent periodontal pockets. However, the doses necessary to achieve sufficient local concentration of antimicrobials in periodontal environment might be associated with undesirable side-effects. Hence, the local administration are considered to overcome these side-effects.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Local administrations of antimicrobial agents in periodontal pockets such as rinsing, irrigation and local injections are adopted previously. Indeed antibacterial mouthwashes are effective in controlling supragingival plaque; however, their effect on the subgingival flora is limited. To overcome these limitations, various local-delivery devices such as monolithic devices, gels and hybrids are recently developed with either sustained-release device or controlled-delivery device platforms.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] By using these devices, antimicrobial agents such as tetracycline, metronidazole, doxycycline, minocycline or chlorhexidine[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] are administered directly into the periodontal pocket sites to inhibit periodontal pathogenic bacteria, associated inflammatory response and periodontal tissue destruction.</p><p>Chlorhexidine being a broad spectrum antibacterial and antifungal agent is a very effectiveness in treating periodontal disease.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Considering the cost and the non-availability of chlorhexidine chip (periochip) in many countries an attempted was made in the present study to evaluate indigenous fish collagen incorporated with chlorhexidine gluconate in chronic periodontitis patients, along with specific microbiological assessment by using a chair side benzoyl-DL-arginine-naphthylamide (BANA) test.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A study was conducted by the Department of Periodontics, Narayana Dental College and Hospital, Nellore; Andhra Pradesh, India to evaluate the clinical and specific microbiological changes associated with chlorhexidine chip (Periocol-CG, Eucare Pharmaceuticals Pvt.

(2) Moisten the upper test strip (salmon color) with distilled water using a cotton swab. Care should be taken not to over wet. (3) Fold the BANA-zyme test strip at the given crease mark so that the lower and upper reagent strips meet. (4) Place the BANA-zyme test strip into either of the slots on the top of the processor. The heating element of the processor will start automatically when strip is inserted into the bottom of the slot, as indicated by the flashing light. When the indicator light remains on, the heating element has reached 55&#x000b0;C and will stay on for 5 min. The BANA-zyme test strips color development will be complete when the indicator light goes off and the bell rings. A second BANA-zyme test strip can be placed into the other slot. Each slot has its own heater and timer and is independent of the events in the other slot. After completion of a cycle it is best to allow at least 10 min cool down time between insertions of a new BANA-zyme test strip into either slot. (5) Remove the BANA-zyme test from the processor and discard the lower reagent strip that had been inoculated with plaque in a manner appropriate for contaminated material. (6) Examine the upper reagent strip for the presence of blue color. If a blue color is a detected mark the site as either weak positive or positive. (7) Recording was done for each sampled site as negative, weak positive or positive.</p><p>Both clinical and microbiological recordings were carried out at baseline and 1 and 3 months post-treatment.

The study was conducted for 3 months period because, effects of controlled release chlorhexidine have been shown to be evident up to 11 weeks after administration of the chip and 3 months study period corresponds to typical recall interval for periodontal patients.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Consistent with previous reports[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] our study did not show any superior effect of chlorhexidine chip when compared with SRP group. This could be due to the reduction in the clinical parameters with SRP, which was equivalent to that of chlorhexidine chip alone by removing subgingival biofilms and other microscopic reservoirs of bacteria residing in the subgingival environment. However, our results are contradictory to other studies[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] reporting superiority of chlorhexidine chip over SRP, which was attributed to a low substantivity of chlorhexidine due to its poor adherence to root surfaces and its high affinity for salivary or serum proteins and blood.</p><p>In the present clinical study, teeth selected were without recession keeping the PPD and CAL on baseline constant. In contrary, the study conducted by Jeffcoat <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] included gingival recession as one of the parameters, which may have contributed to alterations in the clinical outcome of the study.</p><p>When the GI scores were compared, all the groups had greater reduction in the scores (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and showed highly significant differences between baseline to 3 months. No significance was observed between the groups, indicating similar inhibition of bacterial growth and gingival inflammation in both groups. These results are in consistent with previous studies.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In contrast, the studies by Soskolne <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and Jeffcoat <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] showed better results with SRP along with chlorhexidine chip compared with SRP alone attributing it to the beneficial anti plaque properties of chlorhexidine.</p><p>Highly significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) mean PPD reductions at different time intervals were observed, whereas no significance was found between the groups. This is in accordance with Grisi <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Paolantonio <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The PPD reduction was greater in SRP plus chlorhexidine chip, in previous studies conducted by Soskolne <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Jeffcoat <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Grisi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] using periochip. This could be due to the additional antibacterial effects (cationic molecule binding to extra microbial complexes and negatively charged microbial cell walls altering the osmotic equilibrium), during the healing process of tissues that could have enhanced the effect of SRP.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] It also could bind to salivary bacteria thus interfering with their adsorption to teeth.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>In Group 3, the mean CAL reduction was 1.8 mm, whereas in Group 2, the mean reduction was 3.0 mm and was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). No statistical significance was observed when groups were compared at 3 months. This is in accordance with Heasman <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Grisi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and Carvalho <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In contrary Soskolne <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and Jeffcoat <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] reported a significant association between SRP plus chlorhexidine on CALs and attributed to the advantage of having a minimal potential to induce resistant bacterial strains.</p><p>The microbiological assessment was performed using a chair side BANA test showing specific microbiota. <italic>Tannerella forsythus</italic> (Tf), Pg, Td and <italic>Capnocytophaga</italic> species share a common enzymatic profile and have a trypsin-like enzyme in common. The activity of this enzyme can be measured with the hydrolysis of the colorless substrate BANA; hence, all the three BANA positive species are frequently cited as potential periodontal pathogens.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>In our study, the percentage of BANA positive sites for the detection of number of putative periodontal bacteria were reduced significantly from baseline to 1 month and 3 months within the groups. In Group 2, the number of BANA negative sites was comparatively higher than the other two groups. This could be due to more effective control of the periodontal anaerobic microorganisms enhancing the effect of SRP. This is in accordance with previous studies.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In contrary studies conducted by Grisi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and Daneshmand <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] did not show any significant reduction in the microorganisms.</p><p>When BANA test sites were compared between the groups, it did not show significance at 1 month; however, significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.039) differences were observed at 3 months after treatment with Group 2 better over Groups 3 and 1. These results explain that SRP alone will reduce the bacterial load at 1 month, but additional benefits are observed with chlorhexidine chip at 3 months in reducing the microbial load. In addition, inhibition of microbial proteases from potent periodontopathogens such as Pg, Tf, Td is therapeutically favorable. In contrary, it has been reported that the release of vesicles from Pg inactivate chlorhexidine and potentially induce bacterial drug resistance.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Local drug delivery using chlorhexidine chip enhances the benefit of SRP in the treatment of chronic periodontitis.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mizrak</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>G&#x000fc;nc&#x000fc;</surname><given-names>GN</given-names></name><name><surname>Caglayan</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Balci</surname><given-names>TA</given-names></name><name><surname>Aktar</surname><given-names>GS</given-names></name><name><surname>Ipek</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of a controlled-release chlorhexidine chip on clinical and microbiological parameters and prostaglandin E2 levels in gingival crevicular fluid</article-title><source>J Periodontol</source><year>2006</year><volume>77</volume><fpage>437</fpage><lpage>43</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16512758</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Newmann</surname><given-names>MG</given-names></name><name><surname>Takei</surname><given-names>HH</given-names></name><name><surname>Klokkevold</surname><given-names>PR</given-names></name><name><surname>Carranza</surname><given-names>FA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Text Book of Clinical Periodontology</article-title><year>2006</year><edition>10th ed</edition><publisher-loc>Missouri</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Saunders Elsevier</publisher-name><fpage>134</fpage><lpage>1692</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Amalfitano</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>De Filippo</surname><given-names>AB</given-names></name><name><surname>Bretz</surname><given-names>WA</given-names></name><name><surname>Loesche</surname><given-names>WJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The effects of incubation length and temperature on the specificity and sensitivity of the BANA (N-benzoyl-DL-arginine-naphthylamide) test</article-title><source>J Periodontol</source><year>1993</year><volume>64</volume><fpage>848</fpage><lpage>52</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8229620</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Haffajee</surname><given-names>AD</given-names></name><name><surname>Cugini</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Dibart</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Kent</surname><given-names>RL</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name><name><surname>Socransky</surname><given-names>SS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The effect of SRP on the clinical and microbiological parameters of periodontal diseases</article-title><source>J Clin Periodontol</source><year>1997</year><volume>24</volume><fpage>324</fpage><lpage>34</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9178112</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hanes</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Purvis</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Local anti-infective therapy: Pharmacological agents.
