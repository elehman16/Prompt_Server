<italic>Background</italic>. Empirical therapy with antisecretory agents like PPIs and H2RAs has long been the traditional approach in the initial management of uninvestigated dyspepsia. <italic>Aim</italic>. The objective of the study was to examine relief of dyspepsia with lafutidine, a second-generation H<sub>2</sub>-RA, and rabeprazole and to compare their efficacy. <italic>Methods</italic>. This was a randomized, open, comparative trial in adult uninvestigated dyspeptic patients, who had at least moderate severity of symptoms, defined as a score of &#x02265;4 on a 7-point global overall symptom (GOS) scale, and were randomized to receive once daily either lafutidine 10&#x02009;mg or rabeprazole 20&#x02009;mg for 4 weeks. <italic>Results</italic>. A total of 236 patients were enrolled, out of which 194 patients were included in the analysis. At the end of week 4, a significant difference was observed for symptom relief (lafutidine 89.90% versus rabeprazole 65.26%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .01) and symptom resolution (lafutidine 70.71% versus rabeprazole 25.26%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .01). Both the drugs were well tolerated. <italic>Conclusion</italic>. Both lafutidine and rabeprazole provide symptom relief in patients with heartburn-dominant uninvestigated dyspepsia. The present study confirms the appropriateness of lafutidine as an empiric treatment and superior efficacy for primary care practice patients with dyspepsia.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Dyspepsia is believed to be common worldwide [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In the Indian population, dyspepsia was found to be more common in subjects aged 40 years or younger [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is more prevalent in the metros, where it is reported by almost one-third of the population [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. </p><p>The Canadian Dyspepsia Working Group definition states that <italic>&#x0201c;Dyspepsia is a symptom complex of epigastric pain or discomfort thought to originate in the upper gastrointestinal tract, and it may include any of the following symptoms: heartburn, acid regurgitation, excessive burping/belching, increased abdominal bloating, nausea, feeling of abnormal or slow digestion, or early satiety</italic>&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Patients with dyspeptic symptoms who are not candidates for early endoscopy are termed &#x0201c;uninvestigated dyspeptics&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. </p><p>The American College of Gastroenterology Guidelines, and the NICE guidelines from UK, for the management of dyspepsia have among others stated two commonly used strategies, namely test and treat strategy and acid suppression therapy [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. For those in whom the predominant symptoms are thought to be acid related, such as epigastric pain or burning, a trial of acid suppression is often recommended if the patient is under 45&#x02013;55 years of age without obvious organic disease [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. </p><p>Empirical therapy with antacids, antisecretory, and prokinetic agents has long been the traditional approach for most primary care physicians in the initial management of patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Since their introduction in the mid-1970s, H<sub>2</sub>-RA have gained wide acceptance as antisecretory drugs with proven efficacy in the treatment of peptic ulcers and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. There are currently four drugs in this category in use: cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine, and nizatidine [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. </p><p>Lafutidine was developed as a second-generation H<sub>2</sub>-RA with an increased action on the gastric mucosal defensive capacity. It has been reported that the gastroprotective effect of lafutidine is independent of its acid antisecretory activity [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In addition to being a potent H2 receptors antagonist [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], lafutidine also activates capsaicin-sensitive afferent neurons and stimulates the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which inhibits acid secretion and stimulates mucosal blood flow [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The gastro protective action of lafutidine includes increase in mucin biosynthesis via stimulation of nitric oxide production [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], increasing the thickness of the surface mucus gel layer [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and maintaining gastric mucosal blood flow and bicarbonate response [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Lafutidine has been elaborately studied internationally in various indications like gastritis, and gastric and peptic ulcer, while recent focus has also shifted to its use in gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD) [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. </p><p>The objective of the present study was to compare the efficacy of lafutidine and rabeprazole in the management of heartburn-dominant uninvestigated dyspepsia in Indian primary care practice.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Methods</title><p>The current study (study no.: Emc/GASTR/LAFUT/12/2008) was a prospective, multicentric study, carried out at 5 centers in India. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent amendments and in compliance with the ICH-GCP (International Conference on Harmonization-Good Clinical Practice) Guidelines. All patients were required to give their written informed consent before entering into the study. The protocol was approved by &#x0201c;Jagruti-Independent Ethics Committee&#x0201d;, Mumbai, India, for each investigational centre in August 2009.</p><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Patients</title><p>Patients aged 18 years or older were eligible if they had a minimum of 1-month history of dyspepsia (including symptoms of heartburn and/or epigastric pain and/or bloating) with at least one moderate-to-severe symptom (score &#x02265;4 on a 7-point global overall symptom (GOS) scale) on at least three of the 7 days before randomization. The main exclusion criteria were presence of alarm features (unintentional weight loss, persistent vomiting, dysphagia, haematemesis, melaena, fever, jaundice, or anaemia), irritable bowel syndrome or serious concomitant disease, previous history of gastrointestinal disease (including peptic ulcers, malignancy, oesophageal dysmotility, a previous endoscopic or radiological diagnosis of GERD, and Barrett's oesophagus), recent gastrointestinal surgery, that is, within 30 days (except appendectomy, colonic resection, and cholecystectomy), treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetylsalicylic acid (&#x0003e;325&#x02009;mg/day), H<sub>2</sub>-RAs, PPIs, prokinetic agents, misoprostol, or sucralfate 15 days prior to enrollment, and a known history of hypersensitivity to the study medications.</p><p>Patients who had previously been included or who had participated in any other clinical trial within one month before enrollment into the current study were excluded. Women who were pregnant, lactating, or who desire to become pregnant during the study were not enrolled. Patients who were drug or alcohol abusers or suffering from any other condition associated with poor compliance were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Study Design</title><p>The current study was a randomized, comparative-controlled clinical trial, wherein a target sample size of at least 200 patients with clinical signs and symptoms of dyspepsia were to be enrolled. Each investigator of the five participating centers was to enroll 50 patients. Based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria as stated in the protocol, the participant was considered eligible for participating in the study by the investigator. Once enrolled, the patients received treatment for a period of four weeks (28 days) with either lafutidine or rabeprazole, as per the two-treatment computer-generated randomization sequence, using WINPEPI Version 8.6. Each patient was supplied with the medication (lafutidine or rabeprazole) which would suffice for the treatment duration of 4 weeks. The patient's medication supply was divided into two parts, administered at the time of enrollment and on day 14 (after week 2). Thus, each investigator was provided with medication supply for 50 patients: two sealed, tamperproof, labeled, plastic containers containing 14 tablets of lafutidine or rabeprazole for each patient. During this study period, the patients were assessed for the clinical signs and symptoms and the response to the treatment after week 2 (day 14) and week 4 (day 28). Laboratory assessment was performed at the time of enrollment and at the end of the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Treatment</title><p>Patients received the study medications as per the randomization chart for duration of 28 days. The dosage regimen of the investigational drug was one lafutidine 10&#x02009;mg tablet (manufactured by: Emcure Pharmaceuticals Ltd; Batch no: FD/388/09) to be taken once daily for 28 days, while that of the control group was one rabeprazole 20&#x02009;mg tablet (manufactured by: Windlas Biotech Limited; Batch no: ZYB09003) to be taken once daily for 28 days. Adherence to the compliance for medications was calculated using pill count of returned medications after two and four weeks of treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. Assessments</title><p>Patients were asked to indicate the overall severity of their dyspepsia symptoms during the previous two days using the validated 7-point GOS ccale: (1) no problem, (2) minimal problem (can be easily ignored without effort), (3) mild problem (can be ignored with effort), (4) moderate problem (cannot be ignored but does not influence my daily activities), (5) moderately severe problem (cannot be ignored and occasionally limits my daily activities), (6) severe problem (cannot be ignored and often limits my concentration on daily activities), and (7) very severe problem (cannot be ignored, markedly limits my daily activities and often requires rest). </p><p>A patient reporting at least moderate severity (score &#x02265;4) for an individual symptom was considered to be symptomatic for that specific symptom. Reassessment was performed at the end of second week (day 14) and fourth week (day 28).</p><p>The <italic>&#x0201c;overall treatment evaluation&#x0201d;</italic> (OTE) assessed the patient's perspective on symptom relief on a 6-point Likert scale ((1) the treatment made me a lot worse; (2) the treatment made me slightly worse; (3) the treatment made no change to my symptoms; (4) the treatment made me slightly better; (5) the treatment made me a lot better; (6) the treatment completely relieved my symptoms). The &#x0201c;<italic>overall patient satisfaction survey&#x0201d;</italic> (OPSS) evaluated patient satisfaction with treatment using a 6-point Likert scale ranging from completely satisfied (1) to completely dissatisfied (6). Finally, the frequency and severity of adverse events were evaluated at each visit while clinically important changes in the laboratory data during the study were assessed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.5"><title>2.5.

Results</title><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec3.1"><title>3.1. Patient Characteristics and Disposition</title><p>Of the 236 patients cumulatively enrolled by the 5 centres, 194 patients completed the study, of which 99 patients received lafutidine while 95 of them received rabeprazole. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1</xref> shows the consolidated standards of reporting trials (CONSORT) flow chart of patients throughout the study. Thus, the study population comprised 194 patients who were evaluated for resolution of clinical symptoms of dyspepsia and for the incidence of adverse events. Patients were enrolled over a 4-month period, from August 2009 to November 2009. The study was completed by first week of December 2009. Baseline demographic data are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>.

Diarrhea was reported by 1 patient by week 4 in the lafutidine group which was rated as &#x0201c;<italic>mild</italic>&#x0201d; in severity. In case of rabeprazole group, 3 patients reported headache as an adverse event at the end of week 2 which was rated as &#x0201c;<italic>mild</italic>&#x0201d; in severity. Thus, the overall incidence of adverse events reported were headache (2.65%) in rabeprazole group and constipation (1.73%) and diarrhoea (0.86%) in lafutidine group. There were no clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities in either treatment group.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>Dyspepsia is a common problem encountered in general practice. There have been many dyspepsia management strategies and guidelines published in recent years. The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) Dyspepsia Management Guidelines state that it is acceptable to initiate a single course of treatment with an antisecretory agent, for 2 to 4 weeks, in patients under the age of 45 years who are experiencing troublesome dyspepsia but exhibit no alarm symptoms. Endoscopy is not recommended in this group of patients without evidence of the presence of Helicobacter pylori together with persistent symptoms. Treatment without investigation is, therefore, appropriate in many cases [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>The present study focuses on uninvestigated dyspeptics, that is, patients with dyspepsia symptoms who are not candidates for early endoscopy. Endoscopy was not performed at enrolment in the present study; although it would have allowed risk stratification with respect to oesophagitis severity and H. pylori infection, it would also have introduced the potential for bias in a study intended to assess symptom response to empiric therapy in a primary care environment.</p><p>The prevalence of uninvestigated dyspepsia in India has been reported to be 30.4% [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], while in another study, the ethnic prevalence of esophagitis was 8.5% among Indians [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Helicobacter pylori infection is common in the Indian subcontinent. Exposure occurs in childhood and approximately 80% of adults have been infected at some time [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>The GOS scale used in this study is a validated outcome measure and has been used successfully in the CADET (Canadian Adult Dyspepsia Empiric Treatment) Clinical Trials Program. In the validation of the GOS study, it has been shown that a change in GOS from &#x02265;4 to &#x02264;2 is rated as clinically important by patients [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>In this study, both rabeprazole and lafutidine showed positive effects on the symptoms of epigastric pain, heartburn, and abdominal bloating. A statistically nonsignificant difference in response was observed for both the treatments at the end of second week; however, at week 4, the differences were statistically significant. No serious or life-threatening adverse events were observed in either treatment groups and the absence of any significant change in the laboratory parameters confirms the safety of both the drugs.</p><p>Meta-analysis evaluating the efficacy of H<sub>2</sub>-RA in functional (nonulcer) dyspepsia has shown that H<sub>2</sub>-RAs are superior to placebo [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are more potent inhibitors of gastric acid secretion than the first generation H<sub>2</sub>-RAs [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Most clinicians acknowledge the advantage of PPIs over H<sub>2</sub>-RAs, because the former exert stronger and longer acid suppression than the latter [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Clinical trials comparing a PPI (omeprazole and lansoprazole) and H<sub>2</sub>-RA (ranitidine and cimetidine) demonstrates superiority of PPI over H<sub>2</sub>-RA (ranitidine) in dyspepsia [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. </p><p>There are only a few studies currently available evaluating the treatment for uninvestigated dyspepsia in comparisons to those for the treatment of functional dyspepsia or GERD. Empirical treatment of dyspepsia with PPI leads to an acceptable symptom relief in 54%&#x02013;65% of the patients compared with 33%&#x02013;53% with placebo [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Armstrong et al. reported resolution of only heartburn in 36.2% of the patients treated with omeprazole 20&#x02009;mg a day [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In another study, an overall resolution of all the dyspepsia symptoms was observed 22.9% of the patients treated with esomeprazole 40&#x02009;mg once daily [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In the current study, symptom resolution for all the dyspepsia symptoms was observed in 25.26% rabeprazole-treated patients, while in lafutidine-treated patients, this proportion was significantly higher, 70.71%. The better efficacy of lafutidine seen in this study can be attributed to the novel mechanism of action of lafutidine which includes gastric mucosal protective action mediated by capsaicin-sensitive afferent neurons, in addition to a potent antisecretory effect.</p><p>In conclusion, the current study shows that both lafutidine and rabeprazole are effective in relieving the symptoms of dyspepsia.
