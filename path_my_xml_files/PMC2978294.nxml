In addition to exhibiting an antihypertensive effect through vasodilation by blocking L-type calcium channels, efonidipine hydrochloride has also been suggested to regulate heart rate (HR) by inhibiting the T-type calcium channels, which are localized primarily in the sinoatrial node and are involved in the pacemaker mechanism of the heart.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2)</xref></p><p>Furthermore, efonidipine has been reported to have a negative chronotropic effect, which may be involved in controlling tachycardia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3)</xref> Working on sinoatrial node cells by inhibiting T-type calcium channel activation, efonidipine prolongs the late phase-4 depolarization of the sinoatrial node action potential, which suppresses an elevated HR.

Men and women were eligible if they were 18-80 years of age, had mild-to-moderate hypertension with a sitting diastolic BP (SiDBP) between 90 and 110 mmHg, a HR &#x0003c;75 beats/minute, and agreed to participate in the study.

Thus, we planned to evaluate the negative chronotropic effect of efonidipine in patients with a HR &#x0003e;75 beats/minute.</p><p>Patients were excluded if they had severe hypertension {sitting systolic BP (SiSBP) &#x02265;180 mmHg}, a difference in BP between two arms &#x0003e;20 mmHg (SiSBP) or &#x0003e;10 mmHg (SiDBP), a history of stroke or myocardial infarction in the previous 6 months, severe congestive heart failure, sick sinus syndrome or sinus bradycardia (&#x0003c;50 beats/minute), second- or third-degree atrioventricular block, documented hypersensitivity to DHP or efonidipine hydrochloride, hepatic disease with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &#x0003e;2 times the upper normal limit, renal disease with a serum creatinine concentration &#x0003e;2.0 mg/dL, uncontrolled diabetes (hemoglobin A1C &#x0003e;9%), renal artery stenosis, or secondary hypertension. Women who were pregnant or breastfeeding, or who were not using an effective method of contraception, were excluded from the study. All patients gave written informed consent and the institutional review board at each center approved this study.</p><p>The study consisted of initial screening, a 2-week washout period, and a 12-week active treatment period. Complete medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests were evaluated during the initial screening.</p><p>After the 2-week washout period of previous antihypertensive medications, patients were given 40 mg efonidipine at 8:00 a.m. (&#x000b1;2 hours). If the SiSBP was &#x0003e;140 mmHg or the SiDBP was &#x0003e;90 mmHg at 4 or 8 weeks, the dosage of efonidipine was increased up to 60 mg once daily. Clinical follow-up was performed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. At each visit, the SiSBP, SiDBP, and pulse rate were measured. The resting HR was measured manually for 1 minute after the patient had rested in a sitting position for 30 minutes. The BP was measured as follows: the same time of day, before dosing, the same arm, by the same investigator at each center, and using mercury sphygmomanometers manufactured by one company (W.A. Baum Co. Inc., Copiague, NY, USA).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10)</xref> Ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) was performed twice at baseline and at the end of the 12-week treatment.

The treatment schedule is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy and safety variables</title><p>The primary efficacy variable was the mean change in resting HR from baseline to week 12. The secondary efficacy variables included the change from baseline of the mean office trough BP (i.e., 24 hours after the last dosing) and the 24-hour mean BP assessed with ABPM after 12 weeks. The response rate was defined as the proportion of patients in which the SiDBP was &#x0003c;90 mmHg or had decreased by &#x02265;10 mmHg from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment. Tolerability was assessed based on the incidence of AEs. Medical history was updated and laboratory tests were performed at each study visit. All laboratory and clinical AEs were assessed by the investigators in terms of their relationship to the study drug and intensity. Serious AEs were defined as those that were life-threatening, required hospitalization, or were associated with significant permanent disability or congenital malformation.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A sample size of 42 patients was calculated to provide 90% power to detect a 5 beat/minute difference between baseline and 12 weeks at a significance level of &#x003b1;=0.05, assuming a standard deviation of 10 beats/minute. Based on a 20% predicted dropout rate, a sample size of 53 patients was required.</p><p>For the primary and secondary outcomes, intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses were done. The ITT analysis included all patients who received &#x02265;1 dose of study medication, had a valid resting HR and BP measurement at baseline, and had &#x02265;1 valid HR and BP measurements after baseline, with missed observations imputed using the last-observation-carried-forward method. Patients with protocol violations and those with &#x0003c;75% compliance were excluded from the PP analysis. For statistical analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints, a paired t-test was used.</p><p>For a comparison of baseline characteristics, continuous variables were compared using a t-test and analysis of covariance, and discrete variables were compared using a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test.

Efonidipine also decreased the trough systolic and diastolic BP by 11.7 and 8.6 mmHg, respectively. Efonidipine was well-tolerated.</p><p>A significant association between resting HR and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality has been reported in numerous epidemiologic studies and pertains to the general population as well as patients with various cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, acute myocardial infarction, and heart failure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11)</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12)</xref></p><p>In spite of excellent BP-lowering properties, the use of DHP calcium channel blockers is sometimes limited in patients with angina or myocardial infarction due to acceleration of the HR.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17)</xref> DHPs mainly block L-type calcium channels of blood vessels,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18)</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19)</xref> which induces vasodilation, thus quickly reducing the BP, but easily causes compensatory sympathetic activation, increasing the HR and cardiac oxygen demand.</p><p>However, efonidipine, which blocks both T-type and L-type calcium channels, has been reported to decrease the HR in several conditions. Morimoto et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20)</xref> showed that efonidipine inhibits an increase in HR and BP due to stress, presumably by blocking T-type calcium channels rather than by inhibiting the sympathetic nervous system. Tanaka et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4)</xref> showed that efonidipine decreases the HR and plasma aldosterone more than amlodipine in patients with hypertension. Furthermore, this negative chronotropic effect has been suggested to exert an anti-arrhythmic action. Kinoshita et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21)</xref> demonstrated
that efonidipine reduces arrhythmias and sudden death in a mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy by repolarizing the resting membrane potential and normalizing the cardiac autonomic nervous system imbalance. These findings suggest potential therapeutic applications for efonidipine as an antihypertensive agent for patients at high risk for fatal arrhythmias and sudden death, such as patients with severe heart failure.</p><p>Currently, the role of beta-blockers as first-line antihypertensives has been challenged.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22)</xref> A meta-analysis by Lindholm et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23)</xref> suggested that the risk of stroke was 16% higher with beta-blockers than with other drugs and the risk of all-cause mortality was 3% higher. In fact, beta-blockers were excluded from routine initial therapy for hypertension in the 2006 British Hypertension Society guidelines. However, the HR-lowering effect of beta-blockers is still required in certain hypertensive patients, such as those with high sympathetic activity.</p><p>Our findings suggest that efonidipine might be a better alternative to beta-blockers as an initial antihypertensive medication. In this study, once daily efonidipine was effective not only in the control of mild-to-moderate hypertension, but also in the reduction of HR, which is significantly associated with clinical outcome in hypertension.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24)</xref> Finally, a 12-week course of treatment with efonidipine was well-tolerated and no treatment-related serious AEs occurred.</p><p>There were several limitations to this study. First, this was an open-label, single-arm, uncontrolled study. Owing to ethical perspectives concerning non-antihypertensive therapy in patients with confirmed hypertension, we were unable to create a control group. To reduce the observer-dependent bias, we measured not only the official trough BP, but also the ambulatory 24-hour mean BP. Second, the number of enrolled patients was too small to extrapolate to the broader population. However, our results were consistent with the previous pilot study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5)</xref> which was done in 18 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. This finding suggests that the beneficial effects of efonidipine on HR and BP exist.</p><p>In conclusion, efonidipine can safely decrease BP with a reduction in HR in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. There results suggest that efonidipine may be therapeutically useful as an initial agent for essential hypertension.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was
