However, the risk of over-chelation emerges as patients reach low, near-normal body iron levels and dose adjustments may be needed. In the THALASSA study, the threshold for chelation interruption was LIC &#x0003c;3 mg Fe/g dw (LIC&#x0003c;3); 24 patients receiving deferasirox for up to 2 yr reached this target. A <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis was performed to characterize the safety profile of deferasirox as these patients approached LIC&#x0003c;3.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>THALASSA was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of two deferasirox regimens (5 and 10 mg/kg/d) versus placebo in patients with NTDT. Patients randomized to deferasirox or placebo in the core could enter a 1-yr extension, with all patients receiving deferasirox (extension starting doses based on LIC at end-of-core and prior chelation response). The deferasirox safety profile was assessed between baseline and 6 months before reaching LIC&#x0003c;3 (Period 1), and the 6 months immediately before achieving LIC&#x0003c;3 (Period 2).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mean &#x000b1; SD deferasirox treatment duration up to reaching LIC&#x0003c;3 was 476 &#x000b1; 207 d, and deferasirox dose was 9.7 &#x000b1; 3.0 mg/kg/d. The exposure-adjusted AE incidence regardless of causality was similar in periods 1 (1.026) and 2 (1.012).

Although there is extensive clinical experience with iron overload and its treatment strategies in patients with transfusion-dependent anemias, data are only now emerging on appropriate approaches for patients with NTDT.</p><p>Chelation therapy aims to remove excess body iron and then to prevent any further iron accumulation by controlling body iron at near-normal levels. THALASSA (assessment of Exjade&#x000ae; in non-transfusion-dependent THALASSemiA patients) was the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess iron chelation therapy in iron-overloaded patients with NTDT (NCT00873041). In the core THALASSA study, a significant reduction in iron burden and a clinically manageable safety profile were observed with up to 1 yr of treatment with deferasirox <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. In THALASSA, liver iron concentration (LIC) &#x0003c;3 mg Fe/g dry weight (dw) (hereafter referred to as LIC &#x0003c;3) was the chelation interruption threshold as it represents a low or near-normal iron burden. This threshold is now recommended for interruption of chelation and subsequent monitoring for recurrence of iron overload in patients with NTDT <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. A 1-yr extension of the study showed continued efficacy in patients receiving deferasirox for up to 2 yr <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. At study initiation, patients had significant iron overload with a mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD) LIC of 14.5 &#x000b1; 8.8 mg Fe/g dw; as such, 3.6% (6/166) of patients had reached the target of LIC &#x0003c;3 after 1 yr in the core study <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. With continued treatment in the extension, 14.5% (24/166) patients reached LIC &#x0003c;3 <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>.</p><p>The potential for over-chelation increases as patients reach low or near-normal body iron levels, although other factors may influence this risk. Such factors include the chelator(s) used, the rate of change in body iron burden, the rate of body of iron loading, and the dose of chelator in relation to these variables. It is therefore important to establish how to manage a defined chelation regime in defined patient populations, to achieve the optimal therapeutic benefit without reducing iron stores too rapidly and inducing toxicity from over-chelation. In this <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis, the safety profile of deferasirox was assessed as patients with NTDT participating in the THALASSA study approached the chelation interruption target of LIC &#x0003c;3.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients and study design</title><p>Full study design and patient inclusion/exclusion criteria for the THALASSA study (NCT00873041) have been described previously <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. In brief, a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 1-yr trial was performed to evaluate deferasirox (starting dose 5 or 10 mg/kg/d) or placebo in patients with NTDT aged &#x02265;10 yr with iron overload (LIC &#x02265;5 mg Fe/g dw and serum ferritin &#x0003e;300 ng/mL). This was followed by a preplanned 1-yr extension in which all eligible patients, irrespective of initial treatment received, were treated with deferasirox. The starting dose in the extension phase was based on absolute LIC and LIC decrease by the end of the core study (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>). For this <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis, patients reaching low iron burden (LIC &#x0003c;3; the predefined target for interruption of chelation) in the core or extension phases of the trial were included. Adverse events (AEs) and safety laboratory parameters were monitored throughout the study and the extension period. Auditory and ocular examinations were performed at baseline and at the end of the core and extension phases. Safety parameters during the period 6 months before reaching the LIC &#x0003c;3 target (Period 2) were compared with those during the period from baseline up to 6 months before reaching LIC &#x0003c;3 (Period 1; Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Starting doses in the THALASSA extension study *Wait until LIC&#x0003e;5 mg Fe/g dw and then restart at 5 mg/kg/d if 5 mg/kg/d was effective before interruption or at 10 mg/kg/d if 10&#x02013;20 mg/kg/d was effective before interruption.

Optimizing outcomes in terms of both efficacy and safety during iron chelation therapy targeting low body iron levels requires close attention to the patient population, dose, type of chelator used, and importantly, the rate of iron loading and the rate of decrease in iron load. With regard to monitoring the rate of decrease in iron burden, MRI-assessed LIC is particularly important as iron burden approaches low levels.
