</p><p>Smoking cessation could reduce total cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality by 36% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This is because the vascular endothelium plays a major role in cardiovascular health and disease (e.g. systemic and pulmonary hypertension, coronary heart disease and stroke; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and cigarette smoking has been associated with endothelial dysfunction in otherwise healthy adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] &#x02013; with its detrimental effects ranging from early functional endothelial alterations to late clinico-pathological manifestations of atherosclerotic plaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The negative effects upon cardiovascular function are not limited to smokers; passive smoking increases heart disease death-risk by almost 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>A combination of pharmacological interventions, including nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion and varenicline, and behavioural support is the most effective approach to smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, even the best methods have high relapse rates of approximately 75% within 6&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and although they are offered as part of the UK National Health Service (NHS), these interventions have been reaching fewer smokers (down about 50% from 2010/11 to 2015/16; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]).</p><p>Cigarette smoke contains more than 9000 chemicals; the vast majority of which are the products of tobacco combustion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The most important ones in regards to CVD risk are: oxidizing chemicals, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, particulates, heavy metals and nicotine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therefore, and taking into consideration that nicotine is highly addictive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], it is important, where complete abstinence is not possible, to encourage substitution of cigarettes with &#x0201c;cleaner&#x0201d; nicotine-based products to reduce CVD risk and reverse some of the smoking-induced physiological damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Electronic (or &#x0201c;e-&#x0201c;) cigarettes or vaping devices uses battery power to disperse a solution that usually contains propylene glycol or glycerine, water, flavouring and nicotine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. They have become the most popular smoking cessation aid in England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], while evidence suggests that they are efficacious as smoking cessation aids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, data on their effects on cardiovascular function is limited i.e. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and there is a lack of consensus within the smoking cessation community as to their potential impact: consequently, further research has been requested by the European Parliament [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], the British Medical Association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], regulatory agencies, clinicians and researchers Lancet; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], BMC Public Health; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. As e-cigarettes are not solely nicotine-based products, existing research exploring the effects of nicotine on the cardio-vasculature (e.g. coronary and peripheral vasoconstriction, intravascular inflammation and deregulation of cardiac autonomic function as well as inhibition of microcirculation; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]) provides only limited information.

The two drug delivery electrodes ((PF383; Perimed AB, Jarfalla, Sweden) will be positioned over healthy looking skin, approximately 4&#x000a0;cm apart with one containing 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of 1% acetylcholine (ACh; Miochol-E, Novartis, Stein) and the other 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of 1% sodium nitroprusside (SNP; Nitroprussiat, Rottapharm). A battery-powered iontophoresis controller (PeriIont PF382b; Perimed AB) will be used to provide the charge needed for ACh and SNP delivery. A 4&#x000a0;min stable recording of baseline flux will be followed by administration of the two agents according to the following protocol: 0.2&#x000a0;mA for 10&#x000a0;s (i.e., 2 mC), 0.2&#x000a0;mA for 15&#x000a0;s (i.e., 3 mC), 0.2&#x000a0;mA for 20&#x000a0;s (i.e., 4 mC), and 0.3&#x000a0;mA for 20&#x000a0;s (i.e., 6 mC), happening between 4-min intervals. To obtain an index of skin blood flow, cutaneous red cell flux will be measured by placing an iontophoresis laser-Doppler probe (PF481&#x02013;1; Perimed AB), connected to a laser Doppler fluxmeter (PF5001; Perimed AB).<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>b)</label><p>Micro-vascular function at 6&#x000a0;months (measured as described for a).</p></list-item><list-item><label>c)</label><p>Smoking status at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months, self-reported and biochemically validated by exhaled air measurement of &#x0003c;10&#x000a0;ppm Carbon monoxide in line with the Russell Standard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><label>d)</label><p>change in CVD risk at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months compared with baseline, measured using Q-risk</p></list-item><list-item><label>e)</label><p>Health Economic effects (assessed using EQ5D-L and a resource use diary) at 6&#x000a0;months.

Study material will remain in this location for data entry and storage. Patient names will not be used to identify any data. Instead, participants will be assigned a study identification number in order to anonymise their information. All data will be anonymised according to the NHS Code of Confidentiality and GMC Good Medical Practice while publications will not contain identifiable personal data. Furthermore, only research team members will have access to participants&#x02019; personal data during the project, while data will be analysed locally.
