International consensus guidelines<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> on the management of <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> infection have recommended a levofloxacin-containing second-line triple therapy consisting of a PPI, a quinolone, and amoxicillin after previous eradication failures because this particular therapy exhibits remarkable in-vitro activity against <italic>H pylori</italic>.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> In addition, an in-vivo synergistic effect is exhibited with respect to quinolone antimicrobial agents and PPIs when strains of <italic>H pylori</italic> are targeted.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Moreover, quinolone is an effective orally administered antimicrobial drug and is well tolerated, which is important because&#x02014;aside from antibiotic resistance&#x02014;compliance plays a cardinal role in eradication. Extending the duration of treatment to at least 10 days improves eradication rates.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Unfortunately, the lengthy use of quinolone is strongly associated with a risk of developing bacterial resistance.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Besides, lengthy exposure to quinolone could be associated with delays in diagnosing tuberculosis and with the development of drug resistance.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>Therefore, the search for an ideal second-line rescue therapy is mandatory. Sequential therapy has been widely used to treat first-line <italic>H pylori</italic> infection. However, few reports exist on sequential therapy comprising only 5 days of levofloxacin as a second-line <italic>H pylori</italic> eradication regimen, and none had compared a new regimen with the conventional quinolone-containing triple therapy. However, ofloxacin combined with metronidazole shows a synergistic effect against bacteria, and high-dose metronidazole can overcome metronidazole resistancy.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> We hypothesized that the addition of metronidazole may enhance the effectiveness of levofloxacin-containing therapy, and that the shortening of levofloxacin treatment to 5 days could consequently minimize the impact on tuberculosis. Therefore, we conducted this randomized, controlled trial to compare the efficacy of 5-plus 5 days&#x02019; levofloxacin- and metronidazole-containing sequential therapy (EALM) with 10-day levofloxacin-containing triple therapy (EAL) in second-line <italic>H pylori</italic> eradication treatments, and to determine the influencing clinical factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This prospective randomized trial was conducted in Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (outpatient department) in Southern Taiwan.

This was not achieved with EAL therapy. Importantly, we observed that all patients with isolated metronidazole resistance and isolated levofloxacin resistance were eradicated in the EALM group. There was no obvious difference in compliance between the 2 groups, although more side-effects were observed in the EALM group. The results revealed that 5-plus 5 days&#x02019; metronidazole and levofloxacin-containing sequential therapy was effective in areas with high resistance.</p><p>Generally, the choice of a second-line treatment depends on which treatment was used initially, as it was concluded that re-treatment with the same regimen should not be recommended.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> In the present study, levofloxacin was not prescribed in the first-line therapy. It should be an ideal second-line regimen as recommended by many consensus reports.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Duration of EAL therapy was reported to be an important factor for successful eradication with a preference of 10-day regimens as second-line therapies.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> However, our previous report showed that 14-day levofloxacin-containing triple therapies could attain eradication rates &#x0003e;90%.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>Resistance to quinolone antimicrobial agents is common because of plasmid-mediated horizontally transferable genes encoding quinolone resistance and has been the key factor for eradication failure.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Therefore, when we prescribe levofloxacin-containing regimens, we should always strive to achieve grade &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; eradication report cards. One of the alternative treatments is to apply tailored therapy according to susceptibility to antibiotics.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> However, determination of antibiotic sensitivity by pathogen culturing is time-consuming and the successful culture rate of <italic>H pylori</italic> from clinical specimens is not 100% (rather, 70%&#x02013;80%).<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> The use of scientific technology allows the identification of genotypic-resistant point mutations (N87 and D91) in the quinolone resistance-determining region of the <italic>gyrA</italic> gene from gastric biopsy specimens&#x02014;with a &#x0003e;93% success rate.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Again, genotypic resistance-guided therapy is not yet widely available commercially and may be expensive.</p><p>It is important to highlight that, in this study, levofloxacin was used only for 5 days in the 5-plus-5 days&#x02019; EALM therapy group and achieved &#x0003e;90% eradication rates. Our results are encouraging because it shortened the levofloxacin exposure to 5 days instead of 10 to 14 days. This study was one of the not numerous studies performed outside Italy, which have shown that sequential treatment is at least 90% efficacious. Sequential therapy has been proposed after the observation that spontaneous mutation rates for resistance to metronidazole and clarithromycin are quite high in many countries.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> It is therefore predictable that resistant organisms may be harbored in all patients&#x02019; stomachs, which prompted the origin of sequential therapy. The mechanism to explain how sequential therapy works is not well established. Its rationale that the administration of amoxicillin in the first 5 days of treatment is believed to considerably reduces the bacterial density, and thus decreases proportionally the number of chemoresistant bacteria.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The fact that, in the present study, the concomitant treatment with the same drugs in the EAL group is far less efficacious than sequential therapy infers that it is plausible that antibiotics other than amoxicillin could possibly interfere with amoxicillin itself. Hence, selecting the organisms resistant to metronidazole and levofloxacin, which current study showed, was responsible for the therapeutic failure in both treatments.</p><p>Years ago, one of the most important recommendations when treating bacterial infectious diseases was to avoid the simultaneous administration of bactericidal and bacteriostatic chemotherapies.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> However, practice revealed that to fight <italic>H pylori</italic> infection, both bactericidal and bacteriostatic antibiotics can instead be prescribed at the same time. The coadministration of antibiotics does not depend on whether they are bacteriostatic or bactericidal, but depends on how they act together (antagonistic, synergistic, or additive action).<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> The concomitant use of metronidazole played a crucial role despite the fact that metronidazole resistance was as high as 48.5% in the present study. Our results showed that all patients with isolated metronidazole resistance showed eradication with EALM therapy, but 4 patients with metronidazole resistance failed eradication in the EALM group probably because of concomitant resistance to amoxicillin(n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1) and levofloxacin (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3). Likewise, a 100% eradication rate was achieved with isolated levofloxacin-resistant patients when they were prescribed with EALM therapy, yet only half showed eradication when prescribed with EAL therapy. This may perhaps be explained by the combined ofloxacin and metronidazole prescriptions, which have been reported to have a synergistic effect against anaerobic bacteria.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> However, the influence of metronidazole resistance on the eradication rate could be overcome by increasing the dose.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> This result might be related to the changes in oxygen pressure in the gastric environment, which causes metronidazole-resistant <italic>H pylori</italic> isolates to become metronidazole-susceptible under low oxygen conditions in vitro.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p>Antimicrobial resistance is not the sole explanation for failing eradication. Nonadherence with treatment is a well-recognized factor. A careful evaluation of side effects is mandatory for the success of eradication because side effects influence adherence with treatment regimens. Nevertheless, a 98.8% drug compliance was attained in present study despite the fact that 23.5% of patients in the EALM group had experienced adverse events. The possible explanation could be that the side effects were usually very mild and were well tolerated. Only 1 patient with poor compliance&#x02014;owing to a severe adverse event after starting the metronidazole&#x02014;failed the attempt to eradicate <italic>H pylori.</italic> The second reason could be the strategies we undertook to improve drug compliance in patients, which included a comprehensive explanation of the possible side effects of their medications and of the importance of adhering to their eradication therapy. In our experience, compliance with prescribed medications was increased by providing the patients with a consultation phone number.</p><p>Another explanation for the high eradication rates in the present study was the use of high-dose esomeprazole (40&#x0200a;mg twice daily) rather than standard-dose therapy. High-dose therapy is less affected by the CYP2C19 polymorphism and thus is better able to increase the intragastric pH and maximize the effects of antibiotics.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p><p>This study has several limitations. This is a single-medical-center study and the small populations with antibiotic resistance data included in this study have impeded the evaluation of the effects of antibiotic resistance on eradication efficacy. Large-sample-sized, prospective randomized studies are mandatory to precisely interpret the association between antibiotic resistance and the efficacy of this therapy in Taiwan. Nevertheless, the present study observed that this second-line sequential therapy achieved a &#x0003e;90% eradication rate. Importantly, it solves the important issue of concern, the shortening of the levofloxacin exposure to 5 day is of great benefit to public health. Moreover, the success of the sequential therapy can be attributed to the lack of levofloxacin resistance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Levofloxacin- and metronidazole-containing sequential therapy achieved a &#x0003e;90% eradication rate as second-line treatment for eradication of <italic>H pylori</italic>.
