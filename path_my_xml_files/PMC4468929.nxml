of the knee results in a high risk of future osteoarthritis. Meniscal
allograft transplantation has been performed for over thirty years
with the scientifically plausible hypothesis that it functions in
a similar way to a native meniscus. It is thought that a meniscal
allograft transplant has a chondroprotective effect, reducing symptoms
and the long-term risk of osteoarthritis. However, this hypothesis has
never been tested in a high-quality study on human participants.
This study aims to address this shortfall by performing a pilot
randomised controlled trial within the context of a comprehensive
cohort study design.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Patients will be randomised to receive either meniscal transplant
or a non-operative, personalised knee therapy program. MRIs will
be performed every four months for one year. The primary endpoint
is the mean change in cartilage volume in the weight-bearing area
of the knee at one year post intervention. Secondary outcome measures
include the mean change in cartilage thickness, T2 maps, patient-reported
outcome measures, health economics assessment and complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>This study is expected to report its findings in 2016.</p><p>Cite this article: <italic>Bone Joint Res</italic> 2015;4:93&#x02013;8</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Meniscal allograft transplantation</kwd><kwd>Osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>Chondroprotection</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This study has been supported

sharing and shock absorption; they also function as secondary stabilisers.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Meniscal tears are the most common
knee injury, with an incidence of 61&#x000a0;per 100 000 per year, equating
to over 36&#x000a0;000 per year in the United Kingdom.<sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Partial meniscectomy
is the usual procedure performed in the symptomatic knee if the meniscus
is not amenable to, or has had a failed, repair. Removal of part
or all of the meniscus increases the stress on the knee articular
cartilage, with one study showing a 75% reduction in knee joint
contact area and increased peak contact pressures of 235%.<sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> It&#x000a0;is well documented
that (partial and total) meniscectomy increases the risk of osteoarthritis
(OA),<sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> with one systematic
review showing a mean prevalence of 53.5% in patients that had undergone
some form of meniscectomy, at a minimum of five-years follow-up.<sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>Meniscal allograft transplantation is a well-recognised procedure
for treatment of pain and swelling in a meniscus-deficient compartment
of the knee.<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> However,
there has been very little research on human participants to assess
its potential chondroprotective effect on articular cartilage.</p><p>Volumetric MR mapping of the change in knee cartilage has been
shown to be highly sensitive with a very low error.<sup><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> It is also increasingly
accurate, focusing analysis on the central weight-bearing areas
of the articular surface within the knee.<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> This study aims to provide the first high-level
evidence testing the hypothesis that meniscal allograft transplantation
is chondroprotective by comparing it with a non-operative personalised
knee therapy programme.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title content-type="h3">Study design</title><p>This will be a comprehensive cohort study with an embedded pilot
randomised trial. Therefore, there will be a randomised arm and
a parallel non-randomised patient-preference arm. The study will
be performed at a single centre in the United Kingdom (University
Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust (UHCW)). Recruitment
to randomised operative <italic>versus</italic> non-operative trials
is notoriously difficult due to strong patient preferences.<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Having a parallel patient preference
group should improve recruitment and may provide a more precise
estimate of effect size when analysed as a single cohort, due to
a larger sample size. It will also give the study greater external
validity as the overall rate of recruitment is anticipated to be
significantly higher.<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Study funding</title><p>This study has been supported by Arthritis Research UK as part
of a Clinical Research Fellowship award (award number 20149).</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Ethical approval</title><p>This study has been reviewed by the West Midlands &#x02013; Solihull
Research Ethics committee (Ref:&#x000a0;13/WM/0315). It was given ethical
approval on the 3&#x000a0;October 2013. The study will be carried out in
compliance with the Helsinki Declaration.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Study registration</title><p>This study has been registered with the International Standard
Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register (ISRCTN14194954) and
the National Institute for Health Research Comprehensive Research Network
(CRN) Portfolio (UKCRN ID15557).</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Timeline</title><p>The study started recruiting on the 28 November 2013 and will
be open for one year. Follow-up will be complete at one year following
the start of the intervention in the last patient.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Study participants</title><p>Patients between the ages of 16 and 50 years with a symptomatic,
meniscal-deficient compartment of the knee, in which the treating
surgeon believes that the patient may benefit from meniscal allograft
transplantation, will be included. These broad and pragmatic criteria
should ensure that the results of this study can be generalised
to the wider population of patients with a symptomatic meniscal-deficient
knee compartment.</p><p>Symptoms in the knee include pain, swelling or stiffness and
can be present intermittently to be eligible. The amount of meniscal
deficiency is difficult to accurately quantify. Therefore, it is
left to the treating surgeon to decide whether there is enough meniscal
deficiency (loss) that the patient may benefit from meniscal allograft
transplantation. The following guidance will be used in the decision-making
process: a deficient meniscal rim providing no circumferential fibre
support or an intact rim of less than 2 mm width over the majority
of the meniscus. Meniscectomy due to trauma is likely to be the
most common reason for meniscal deficiency. However, other meniscal
pathologies would be eligible, for example previous excision of
a discoid meniscus.</p><p>Patients will be excluded if they have had previous cartilage
modifying procedures such as autologous chondrocyte implantation
or have significant exposed subchondral bone in the affected compartment
due to arthritis (diagnosed on previous arthroscopy or MRI scan),
as these factors would confound the assessment of the articular
cartilage in the study. Patients that have contraindications to
anaesthetic, as well as those who show evidence that they would
be unable to adhere to trial procedures, will also be excluded.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Recruitment</title><p>Patients will be recruited from elective knee clinics at University
Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust. Once an eligible
patient is identified by the treating surgeon, they will be referred
to a research fellow or research associate.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Consent</title><p>The patients will be informed about the randomised controlled
trial (RCT) group and given a patient information sheet (PIS) specific
to the RCT. If patients are unwilling to have their treatment allocation
decided by randomisation, they will be given the opportunity to
be part of the patient-preference follow-up group. A second PIS,
which gives information about this follow-up group will be given
to patients. These participants will be allowed to decide their
treatment allocation and will have their data collected as part
of a &#x02018;follow-up-only&#x02019; group. They will, therefore, not have MRI
scans at four and eight months. Potential participants will be offered
as much time as they require to consider the study. They may withdraw
from the study at any time without prejudice.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Randomisation</title><p>This will be by a computer-generated sequence and a 1:1 allocation,
stratified for ipsilateral limb malalignment. The Warwick Clinical
Trials Unit secure telephone randomisation service will be used
to provide the participant allocation once the patient has consented
to take part in the study. The allocated treatment will then be
reported back to the chief investigator and the treating surgeon.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Blinding</title><p>The participants cannot be blind to their treatment. The treating
surgeons will of course not be blind to the treatment, but will
take no part in the post-operative assessment of the participants
which will be performed by a research associate blinded to the treatment
allocation. The MRI volume analysis will be performed by IMorphics
Ltd (Manchester, United Kingdom), an independent medical image analysis
company who will also be blinded to the treatment allocation. The
statistical analysis will also be performed blind to the patients&#x02019;
treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Study interventions</title><sec><title content-type="h3">Operative group</title><p>Participants will usually have a general anaesthetic and femoral
nerve block, but the attending anaesthetist will make the final
decision based on the patient&#x02019;s clinical requirements. Participants will
be in a supine position with a thigh side support. The surgery will
be performed by one of the knee surgeons competent in meniscal transplantation
and osteotomies. There will be no learning curve effect in this study
as all participating surgeons performing the operations are proficient
and experienced in the procedures.</p><p>The meniscal allograft is fresh&#x02013;frozen and sourced from one of
two tissue banks: NHSBT Tissue Services, (Liverpool, United Kingdom),
or Allosource USA, (Denver, Colorado, imported by Fannin UK, Dublin,
Ireland). These sources have been regularly used for meniscal transplantation
as standard practice at UHCW NHS trust. The lack of availability
from any one source requires that more than one source is used.
The meniscal allograft is dissected from the tibial bone block marking
the topographical orientation. Number two non-absorbable sutures
are inserted in the anterior and posterior horns using a Bunnell
type stitch and an absorbable middle traction suture is inserted
at the anterior aspect of the popliteal hiatus laterally or at a point
40 mm from the posterior horn medially.</p><p>Surgery is performed using an arthroscopic technique. The procedure
starts with a full assessment of the knee surfaces and the remaining
amount of meniscal tissue. A 2 mm meniscal rim of tissue is maintained
where possible. The meniscal bed is prepared to a fresh vascular
margin before insertion of the allograft. Anterior and posterior
meniscal root attachments are located and prepared using a shaver
and rasp to expose bleeding bone. Guide wires are drilled from the
anterior tibia to the insertion sites, maintaining a bone bridge
on the tibia between the tunnels, and the guide wires are then over
drilled to create 4.5 mm tibial bone tunnels. Lead sutures are inserted
through the tunnels and are retrieved through the arthroscopic portal.</p><p>The meniscal allograft sutures are fed through the lead sutures
and the allograft is 'parachuted' into place with the assistance
of the middle traction suture. Fixation of the meniscal roots is
achieved by tying the anterior horn and posterior horn lead sutures
over the bone bridge on the anterior tibia. The meniscal rim is
secured by placing multiple vertical stacked mattress sutures around
the anterior two thirds of the meniscus with an inside-out technique.
The posterior third of the meniscus is secured with all inside fixation
devices, such as the Fast-Fix 360 (Smith and Nephew, Andover, United
Kingdom).</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Osteotomy</title><p>Participants will be assessed for limb malalignment prior to
randomisation, and then stratified accordingly. Participants in
which the weight-bearing line falls greater than 5% from the centre
of the tibial plateau, where 100% represents the total tibial plateau width,
will be offered an osteotomy. A medial opening wedge high tibial
osteotomy would be performed for a varus proximal tibia and a medial
closing wedge distal femoral osteotomy would be performed for a
valgus distal femur, subject to surgeon&#x02019;s preference and participant
factors. In these procedures the medial tibia or medial distal femur
is exposed through a longitudinal incision and an oblique osteotomy
fashioned using image intensifier guidance. The final position is
then held using a titanium plate and screws.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Rehabilitation</title><p>All participants randomised into the operative group will receive
a standardised written programme of physiotherapy for their post-operative rehabilitation.
Post-operatively, participants will be advised to touch weight bear
with crutches for six weeks, followed by progression to full weight
bearing by eight weeks. Cycling exercises can commence at four weeks
when 90&#x000ba; bend has been achieved. Strength work starts at three months
and running is not allowed until nine months. Participants will
be advised of the risks of participating in contact sports and encouraged
not to return to these activities in the long term. Although there
is no agreement in the literature on the post-operative rehabilitation protocols,
this regime is broadly in line with other studies that have published
their post-operative protocols. It has been used for the rehabilitation
of over 140 patients following meniscal allograft transplantation
in our institution.<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Non-operative group</title><p>Participants will have a personalised knee therapy course, specifically
designed for patients with pain in a meniscus-deficient knee. The
course will involve a personalised knee therapy programme working on
quadriceps control and strength, along with a core-strengthening
programme to be delivered over a minimum of three months. The initial
assessment will be performed by a senior knee physiotherapist, who
will give a written booklet of exercise prescription, an exercise
diary and an instruction list of common exercises. If the participant
wishes to continue physiotherapy nearer their home, for example
if they are not local to the area, they will be referred for continued
physiotherapy at a local unit. They will be assessed at routine
follow-up clinics every four months, where adjustments to the personalised
knee therapy can be made.</p><p>Participants with malalignment that are randomised to the non-operative
group will also be given a size-matched offloading knee brace.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Fidelity of the interventions</title><p>Patients&#x02019; treatments in both the operative and non-operative
groups will be assessed for adherence to the trial protocols. In
the operative group, the surgery and post-operative rehabilitation will
be reviewed by the chief investigator and a surgeon that is not
directly involved in the treatment of trial patients. In the non-operative
group, the treatment adherence will be determined by the chief investigator and
a senior physiotherapist that is not directly involved in the treatment
of trial patients. The type and extent of physiotherapy will be
determined from responses to the physiotherapy case report form
completed at follow-up appointments. Adherence to the surgical protocol
will be determined from the operative note and pictures.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Outcome measures</title><p>The primary endpoint of the trial is the mean change in cartilage
volume in the central weight-bearing portion of the affected compartment
of the knee at one year following the intervention. Secondary endpoints
are cartilage volume changes at four and eight months following
the intervention. The central weight-bearing portion of the affected compartment will
be identified using the methods by Williams et al.<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> This method has
been shown to reveal focal cartilage losses, even in the presence
of minimal global cartilage changes. It is also thought to be more
accurate than global cartilage measurement as the cartilage edges, which
are difficult to define accurately, are trimmed.<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The cartilage
segmentation will be semi-automated and analysed by IMorphicsLtd,
an independent medical image analysis company that specialise in
changes in knee biomarkers for OA. They use active appearance models
of the knee, which allow precise measurements of articular cartilage
and changes in bone shape.<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> They have extensive
experience in measuring cartilage and changes in bone shape in both
observational and experimental trials.</p><p>Loss of cartilage was chosen as a surrogate marker for OA in
the absence of long-term follow-up. Loss of cartilage is a cardinal
feature of OA and an annual loss of 4% to 6% has been shown in patients
with knee OA, which exceeds errors of precision.<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> A number of studies
have also demonstrated an inverse relationship between pain and
volume of cartilage.<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p>The secondary outcome measures will include the Knee Injury and
Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS),<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Lysholm score,<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> International
Knee Documentation Committee score (IKDC)<sup><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and complications. An economics
analysis will be performed using the EuroQol EQ5D-5L health utility
score.<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> The
mean change in cartilage thickness, changes in bone shape<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and T2 cartilage mapping,
will also be performed.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Follow-up</title><p>In the randomised group, the participants will have MRI scans
at baseline, four, eight and 12 months. In the patient preference
group, the participants will have MRI scans at baseline and at one
year. All participants will complete questionnaires at all time
points (baseline, four, eight and 12 months). The trial period will
start from the start of the intervention, rather than the date of
randomisation. Questionnaires collected before the start of treatment
may be used as the baseline questionnaire if the treatment starts
within four months of the questionnaire being collected. MRI scans
will be done as close as possible to the start of the intervention.
If an MRI scan was done for clinical reasons (and was performed
using the correct protocol) before the intervention started, it
may be used as the baseline scan, as long as the intervention starts
within four months of the scan. Participants in the patient preference
group will not have repeat baseline scans, as they are a &#x02018;follow-up-only&#x02019;
group.</p><p>In the first instance a research associate that is blinded to
the treatment allocation will collect all functional outcome scores
from the participant in person. If the participant misses the appointment
or is not willing to attend, the outcomes pack will be sent out
by post and the patient will be telephoned. If the research associate
is unable to obtain this information within four weeks of the time
point for collection, the information will be deemed missing. Further
data will be collected at later time points as originally planned.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Post-recruitment withdrawals and
exclusions</title><p>Participants may withdraw from the trial at any time. If participants decide
to have a different treatment to which they were randomised, participants
will be followed up wherever possible and data collected as per
the protocol until the end of the trial. Participants may be withdrawn
from the study by the chief investigator at any time if any safety concerns
arise.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Sample size</title><p>There are no previously performed similar studies, thus there
is no way of gaining a meaningful standardised effect size. This
study will therefore be a pilot and no formal power calculation
will be performed. The recruitment period will be 12 months and it
has been estimated that 18 patients will be entered into the randomised
arm of the trial, based on a 50% recruitment rate. We expect that
the majority of patients that do not wish to be randomised will
wish to be part of the parallel patient preference group. One of the
important findings of this study will be recruitment, as it will
give information on the feasibility of a full RCT and expected timescales.
A sample size of 18 participants will provide some guidance as to
the likely size of the treatment effect and will allow nuisance parameters
such as the variability (standard deviation) in the primary outcome
to be estimated with some precision. These data will enable a sample
size calculation for a full RCT to be determined.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Statistical analysis</title><p>The main analysis will investigate differences in the primary
outcome measure, cartilage volume between the treatment groups (operative
and non-operative) on an intention-to-treat basis, at 12 months post-intervention.
As this is a pilot study, the main analysis will be exploratory
in nature, the aim being to assess the size and direction of observed
differences between the two treatment groups, and the variability
and distribution of the outcome measures at each point of assessment
(four months, eight months and 12&#x000a0;months). It is likely that the
primary outcome will not be normally distributed, so a range of
data transformations (e.g. cube root) will be tested to see if they
improve the measurement properties. Baseline data will be summarised
to check comparability between treatment arms, and to highlight
any characteristic differences between those individuals in the
study, those ineligible, and those eligible but withholding consent.
This is a relatively small study, and so group means are unlikely
to be estimated with much precision. However, the statistical significance of
responses between treatment groups will be formally assessed using <italic>t</italic>-tests,
based on an assumed approximate normal distribution for the primary
outcome measure. Analyses will also be performed to identify whether
there are differences between the RCT groups and the parallel patient
preference groups and subsequent analysis of the merged groups if
appropriate.</p><p>The results of these analyses will be used to recommend an optimal
sample size, based on a formal power analysis, and design for the
full RCT. In addition to the formal assessment of the primary outcome
measure, analyses will also be reported for the secondary outcome measures
(KOOS, Lysholm, IKDC questionnaires and EQ-5D) and complication
rates reported for all groups.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Economics analysis</title><p>A cost-effectiveness analysis, expressed in terms of incremental
costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, will be performed.
Health-related quality of life will be estimated using the EuroQol
EQ5D 5L, collected at baseline and four, eight and 12 months, and
converted to a multi-attribute utility score. Responses will be
converted into an overall score using a published utility algorithm
for the population of the United Kingdom.<sup><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Unit cost data will be obtained
from national databases such as the British National Formulary<sup><xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> and Personal Social
Services Research Unit<sup><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Costs
of Health and Social Care. Where these are not available the unit cost
will be estimated in consultation with the UHCW finance department.
Primary, community and social care service use as well as medication
use will be collected using a participant questionnaire at four,
eight and 12&#x000a0;months. A 3.5% discount rate will be used as per the National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) methods guide.<sup><xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p>The analyses will initially take the perspective of the service
provider including the costs of health and social care. Subsequent
analyses will adopt a societal perspective taking into account productivity
costs (time away from work) and out of pocket expenditures by the
participant in relation to their treatment. A series of sensitivity
analyses will be conducted to explore the effect of parameter uncertainty
on the results. Cost-effectiveness modelling will also take place,
based on different assumptions in regards to risk of future OA.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Reporting plan</title><p>This study is expected to report its findings in 2016.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="bjr-block"><fn fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author contributions:</bold>N.
