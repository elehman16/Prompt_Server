Physiotherapist-prescribed pelvic support belts are a treatment option, but little evidence exists to support their use. This pilot compared two pelvic belts to determine effectiveness (symptomatic relief), tolerance (comfort) and adherence (frequency, duration of use).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Unblinded, 2-arm, single-center, randomized (1:1) parallel-group trial. Twenty pregnant women recruited from the community (Dunedin, New Zealand), with physiotherapist-diagnosed symphyseal pain, were randomly allocated to wear either a flexible or rigid belt for three weeks. One author, not involved in data collection, randomized the allocation to trial group. The unblinded primary outcome was the Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS). Secondary outcomes were pain intensity during the preceding 24&#x000a0;hours and preceding week (visual analogue scale [VAS]), and disability (Modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire [MODQ]). Duration of use (hours) was recorded daily by text messaging. Participants were assessed at baseline, by weekly phone interviews and at intervention completion (three weeks). To assess comfort, women wore the alternate belt in the fourth week.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Twenty pregnant women (mean &#x000b1; SD age, 29.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.5&#x000a0;years; mean gestation at baseline, 30.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.2&#x000a0;weeks) were randomized to treatment groups (flexible = 10, rigid&#x02009;=10) and all were included in analysis. When adjusted for baseline, PSFS scores were not significantly different between groups at follow up (mean difference &#x02212;0.1; 95% CI: &#x02212;2.5 to 2.3; <italic>p</italic> =0.94). Pain in the preceding 24&#x000a0;hours reached statistical significance in favor of the flexible belt (VAS, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.049). Combining both groups&#x02019; data, function and pain were significantly improved at three weeks (mean difference &#x02212;2.3; 95% CI: 1.2 to 3.5; <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). Belts were worn for an average of 4.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.9&#x000a0;hours per day; women preferred the flexible belt. No adverse events were reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These preliminary results suggest the flexible pelvic support belt may be more effective in reducing pain and is potentially better tolerated than a rigid belt.

Pubic symphysis dysfunction is a distinct subgroup of pelvic girdle pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and during pregnancy causes pain and limits everyday activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] in at least 3-8% of women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Symptoms can be very debilitating, do not necessarily resolve after childbirth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and often recur in subsequent pregnancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Despite an adverse impact on quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], the cause of pregnancy-related symphyseal pain is poorly understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], with hormonal, genetic and/or biomechanical factors implicated in the pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] of this relatively common but under-estimated problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>A theoretical model of pelvic function based on biomechanical and clinical research, highlights the interaction of the bony interlocking mechanisms of the joints of the pelvis and the support afforded by surrounding ligaments, fascia and muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Insufficiencies in any of these components could result in abnormal pelvic motion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], thereby generating pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Pelvic support belts have been used by physiotherapists to treat symphyseal pain during pregnancy and the postpartum period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It is hypothesized that belts limit excessive motion by exerting an external force which compresses and stabilizes the joint(s) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], potentially generating a self-bracing effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>There is little empirical evidence to support the efficacy or effectiveness of pelvic support belts in the management of pregnancy-related symphyseal pain. In clinical practice, pelvic belts are typically used in conjunction with other treatments such as exercise or acupuncture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], meaning their individual contribution is unknown. In addition, a variety of belts are available for use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], yet it is not certain what type is most beneficial in terms of symptom relief and tolerance. To date, only one study has investigated the effects of a pelvic belt as a primary intervention in pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and one has reported their use in the treatment of symphyseal dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, most intervention studies have focused on pregnant women with generalized pelvic girdle pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In order to better understand the effects of a pelvic belt on pain and function, this pilot, unblinded (participants and researchers), 2-arm, single-center, randomized (1:1), parallel-group trial compared two pelvic support belts to determine effectiveness (symptomatic relief), tolerance (comfort) and adherence (frequency and duration of use) in women with pregnancy-related symphyseal pain.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>This pilot study was an unblinded (participants and researchers), single-center, 2-arm, randomized (1:1), parallel-group study conducted in Dunedin, New Zealand.

Model assumptions were assessed using histograms of residuals, plots of residuals against fitted values, and Levene&#x02019;s test for equality of variance between groups. Where model residuals were positively skewed or demonstrated heteroscedasticity, natural logarithmic transformations were investigated, after adding one in the case of measures that included zero values. Overall changes (across both groups) in measures were examined using paired t-tests where there was no evidence of differences in change between groups and regression models using follow-up values while controlling for baseline values were used to assess any association with compliance.

Scores reduced by 2.3 (flexible) and 2.4 points (rigid), equating to a reduction of 36% and 34%, respectively. The activities that these women had particular difficulty with were rolling over in bed (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;11/20), walking (for a variable time, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;8/20), and getting up from sitting (after a variable period spent sitting, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;7/20). Pain VAS scores (preceding week) also decreased overall (12.8&#x000a0;mm, 95% CI 2.5 to 23.0, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.018). Pain VAS (preceding 24&#x000a0;hours) was not examined in this combined analysis due to the evidence for different effects between the groups described above. There was no significant change in overall MODQ scores when the two groups were combined (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.243). However, at baseline, four individuals were classified as having minimal disability due to pregnancy-related symphyseal pain, 12 had moderate disability and four, severe disability; at week 3, six individuals had minimal disability, 11 moderate and three severe.</p><p>The mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD number of times a participant responded to the daily text message over the 3-week period was 18.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.1 (range 14 &#x02013; 21; one outlier 3). Pelvic belts were worn for an average of 4.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.9&#x000a0;hours per day but there was no significant difference in duration of belt use between the two groups (mean 5.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.1&#x000a0;hours for flexible belt and 4.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.6&#x000a0;hours for rigid belt, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.973) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Analyzing all participants, longer periods of belt use were associated with a greater decrease in pain VAS (preceding week) with a 3.9&#x000a0;mm greater decrease per additional hour worn (95% CI 0.8 to 6.9, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.016) but no difference in PSFS (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.546) or MODQ (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.096). There was considerable variation in duration of belt usage between individuals, ranging between a mean of 12.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.9&#x000a0;hours and 0.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.4&#x000a0;hours (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). After wearing the alternate belt for a week, the flexible belt was deemed most comfortable by 14 of the 17 (82%) participants, with reports of the rigid belt tending to &#x0201c;ride up&#x0201d;, move out of position when sitting down, and being uncomfortable and &#x0201c;digging in&#x0201d; whilst sitting.

Our study provides novel pilot data indicating that the use of a pelvic belt may improve daily functional activity as assessed by the PSFS over a period of three weeks, and the use of a flexible belt could decrease pain (preceding 24&#x000a0;hours, VAS) more than a rigid belt (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.049), but these findings remain to be confirmed in a larger randomized controlled trial with the inclusion of an appropriate control. On average, women with pregnancy-related PSP wore the belts for approximately 5&#x000a0;hours a day and found the wider, more flexible belt more comfortable than the rigid belt.</p><p>Combined data from both groups (flexible and rigid belt) showed an improvement in function (as assessed by the PSFS), and pain (as assessed by the VAS), supporting the carry-forward of pelvic belts for future investigation. This is similar to improvements documented in a previously published randomized controlled trial, observing the effect of a support garment on low back pain and posterior pelvic pain in pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In the current study, PSFS scores decreased by 36% and 34% for the flexible and rigid belts, respectively, similar to the improvements documented by Depledge et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] (rigid, 30%; flexible, 25%). One of the difficulties in assessing the efficacy or effectiveness of pelvic support belts relates to the fact that they are rarely used in isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], resulting in contamination of the findings by the additional variables of exercise and advice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In this study, all participants were given the same advice and there was no specific instruction to exercise. The flexible belt produced a mean 2.3-point difference and the rigid belt a mean 2.4-point difference over the intervention period. This change may be deemed to be clinically significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] however, it must be confirmed in a larger sample.</p><p>Our result showing a reduction in pain for the flexible pelvic belt intervention (preceding 24&#x000a0;hours, VAS) compared to the rigid belt in our preliminary sample is promising in terms of symptomatic management of pregnancy-related PSP. The magnitude of this reduction (40%) is likely to be clinically significant and for a woman with typical baseline scores for pain in the study (overall mean 56.9), this would represent a 0.9 standard deviation relative decrease in the flexible belt group compared to the rigid belt group, greater than the 0.8 standard deviations often regarded as a &#x0201c;large&#x0201d; effect. Furthermore, the women preferred the flexible type of belt to the rigid belt in terms of comfort. The mechanism of this benefit is uncertain. The use of ankle strapping has been shown to improve foot position awareness and may help to prevent ankle sprains in athletes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The same proprioceptive mechanisms may be influencing behavior in individuals with PSP; the presence of an external device (in this case, a pelvic support belt) potentially makes individuals more aware of their activity and consequently modifies behavior to minimize or avoid pain.</p><p>Although differences within- or between-group mean values for MODQ were not statistically significant, the noted improvements may still be of clinical significance. Fourteen individuals improved their scores by week 3 and three were unchanged. Four individuals changed from &#x0201c;moderate&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;minimal disability&#x0201d; and two from &#x0201c;severe&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;moderate disability&#x0201d;. Further investigation of MODQ as an outcome measure for PSP interventions is therefore warranted in a larger study to obtain more precise estimates of its effect.</p><p>The duration that women wore the belts for was highly variable, and the average daily use of five hours was less than anticipated. Depledge et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] recorded 6.5 and 6.1&#x000a0;hours a day for the rigid and flexible belts, respectively. A possible explanation of the low mean daily use may relate to the intermittent nature of PSP symptoms and a tendency for women to wear belts only if they had pain. Our data do not provide an insight into whether the belts were only utilized in response to pain or were worn as a prophylactic measure. We recommended that participants wore the pelvic support belt for as long as they were comfortable, but prescribed no specific duration since there are no existing guidelines on duration of belt use and efficacy. The high proportion of participants that responded to text-messaging suggests that this modality of communication may be a reliable method of self-monitoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] when compared to daily self-report diaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The flexible belt was the favored belt in terms of comfort (82%). In contrast, Depledge et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] reported that only 27% of individuals who wore the rigid belt found it uncomfortable, compared to 43% of those who wore the flexible belt, suggesting that the rigid belt was better received. However, as participants in the study by Depledge et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] trialed only one type of belt, they were unable to make an individual comparison. Other intervention studies have only explored the effects of a single type of pelvic support belt or garment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The practicalities highlighted by the participants in the current study, such as being able to keep the belt in place when getting up from sitting and making sure that it is comfortable to wear while sitting, should be considered when choosing the most suitable belt for a larger investigation into their effect in pregnancy-related PSP symptoms.</p><p>The present study has some limitations. Given that this was a pilot study, interpretation of the data is somewhat limited by the small number of participants and the consequently wide confidence intervals. This restriction should be taken into account when interpreting results. Another limitation is the lack of a control group as it was intended only to directly compare flexible and rigid belts. Consequently, changes in mean PSFS scores (2.3 lower at follow-up) and mean pain VAS over the preceding week (12.8&#x000a0;mm lower at follow-up) need to be interpreted with caution. However, it is unlikely that such a decrease in PSFS (greater than the clinically meaningful change of 2 points suggested by Westaway et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]) would have occurred in the absence of any intervention given the typical gestational age of the participants (mean 30.8&#x000a0;weeks). The design of our study preceded the recent publication of the Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and therefore this outcome measure could not be incorporated.</p><p>Based on these data we would recommend the PSFS as the primary outcome measure for a larger trial, with the VAS (preceding 24&#x000a0;hours) as a secondary outcome. A 2.3-point difference in PSFS observed in this study is a clinically important change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Based on these pilot data, an adequately powered randomized controlled clinical trial, assuming correlations between baseline and follow-up values of 0.5 or higher (based on the observed correlation in the present study of 0.61), would require approximately 50 participants in each arm with full data to have 80% power to detect a moderate (0.5 SD, equivalent to around a 2.3 difference in PSFS scores based on standard deviations from the current study) difference in PSFS scores, which we consider to be clinically important, using a two-sided test at the 0.05 level. The results of this pilot study support a larger-scale study to determine the functional effectiveness of flexible pelvic belts as a treatment for PSP symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of the current pilot study suggest that in general, pelvic support belts may have the potential to reduce pain and improve function in pregnant women with pubic symphyseal pain and that the flexible belt may be more effective and more comfortable. A larger study would be needed to definitively confirm these findings and to assess the potential benefits of pelvic support belts alongside other therapeutic interventions such as exercise regimens.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec14"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12884_2015_468_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
