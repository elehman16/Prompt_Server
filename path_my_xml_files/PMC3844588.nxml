However, research on the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions in high-risk immigrant populations with different cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds is scarce. The aim was to design a culturally adapted lifestyle intervention for an immigrant population and to evaluate its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>In this randomized controlled trial, 308 participants (born in Iraq, living in Malm&#x000f6;, Sweden and at high risk of type 2 diabetes) will be allocated to either a culturally adapted intervention or a control group. The intervention will consist of 10 group counseling sessions focusing on diet, physical activity and behavioral change over 6&#x000a0;months, and the offer of exercise sessions. Cultural adaptation includes gender-specific exercise sessions, and counseling by a health coach community member. The control group will receive the information about healthy lifestyle habits provided by the primary health care center. The primary outcome is change in fasting glucose level. Secondary outcomes are changes in body mass index, insulin sensitivity, physical activity, food habits and health-related quality of life. Measurements will be taken at baseline, after 3 and 6&#x000a0;months. Data will be analyzed by the intention-to-treat approach. The cost-effectiveness during the trial period and over the longer term will be assessed by simulation modeling from patient, health care and societal perspectives.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will provide a basis to measure the effectiveness of a lifestyle intervention designed for immigrants from the Middle East in terms of improvement in glucose metabolism, and will also assess its cost-effectiveness. Results from this trial may help health care providers and policy makers to adapt and implement lifestyle interventions suitable for this population group that can be conducted in the community.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01420198">NCT01420198</ext-link></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Type 2 diabetes (T2D), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired glucose regulation (IGR) are among the strongest risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The prevalence of T2D is increasing, and it is estimated that by 2025, 15% of the global population will be affected by T2D, IFG or IGT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The increase is thought to be due to population growth, ageing, urbanization, physical inactivity and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Immigrants from the Middle East and their offspring living in Sweden are at particularly high risk of T2D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Malm&#x000f6; is a multicultural Swedish city. 30% of its residents were born abroad and the largest immigrant group consists of individuals born in Iraq, who collectively comprise almost 9,000 of Malm&#x000f6;&#x02019;s nearly 300,000 inhabitants. In 2010, a pilot survey of almost 200 residents of Roseng&#x000e5;rd in Malm&#x000f6; who were born in Iraq or Sweden revealed a very high prevalence of T2D (20%), independent of country of birth, perhaps as a result of the study having been conducted in a socioeconomically vulnerable area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Since January 2011, the MEDIM (the impact of Migration and Ethnicity on Diabetes In Malm&#x000f6;) project has continuously recruited residents with Iraqi and Swedish backgrounds aged 30 to 75&#x000a0;years from the whole of Malm&#x000f6;. Preliminary results obtained by June 2012 show that the prevalence of T2D is twice as high in Iraqi immigrants (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;898) compared to Swedish participants (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;757) (12.4% vs. 5.9%, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), and that risk factors for T2D, such as family history of diabetes (52%), physical inactivity (64%) and obesity (38%), cluster in Iraqi subjects (manuscript submitted November 2012).</p><p>A previous study indicated that patients with T2D from the Middle East have a different form of T2D, with earlier onset and stronger family history function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, the same study indicated that immigrants from the Middle East have a more rapid decline in pancreatic beta-cell function compared to Swedish diabetic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. It is known that physical exercise enhance beta-cell function in people with diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and also in people at high risk of diabetes or prediabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, little is known about how increased physical activity and improved lifestyle habits affect beta-cell function and/or insulin sensitivity in immigrants from Iraq.</p><p>These previous findings indicate that a large proportion of the Iraqi population is at risk of developing T2D within the next years. The high prevalence rates of family history of diabetes, obesity and sedentary lifestyle raise the need for a lifestyle intervention targeting individuals at risk of T2D. It is well established that diet- and physical activity-based lifestyle interventions are effective in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D in the short term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and in the long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, there are currently no routines or programs to assist health care providers in improving lifestyle in individuals at risk of T2D who come from the Middle East and have a different cultural and socioeconomic background.</p><p>Recent studies highlight several obstacles and issues that need to be addressed in order to achieve successful lifestyle change in immigrants from the Middle East. Gender-specific groups must be offered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]; physical activity sessions should be adapted to the preferences of the participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]; successful intervention models should be provided by a multidisciplinary team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]; and the intervention models should mediate behavioral change and self-empowerment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Therefore, there is a need for a culturally adapted lifestyle intervention targeted to Iraqi immigrants that might differ from conventional lifestyle interventions.</p><p>In addition to the challenge of designing a culturally adapted lifestyle intervention, a further challenge remains in the implementation of the lifestyle intervention in community and primary care settings. Every intervention costs resources, but resources are always scarce and informed decision-making is required before implementation of a program at the mass population level. Cost-effectiveness analysis can ensure that limited resources are allocated as efficiently as possible, so that decision makers can take informed decisions based on the benefits outweighing the costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Although active screening for T2D combined with subsequent lifestyle intervention is cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] compared to the &#x0201c;wait and see&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;do nothing&#x0201d; approach that currently prevails, no study has emphasized the cost-effectiveness of culturally adapted lifestyle interventions for high-risk immigrants from Iraq.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim/purpose</title><p>Immigrants to Sweden from Iraq are at high risk of developing T2D, but little is known about factors preventing the development of T2D in this group. The aims of the study are to:</p><p>(1) Develop a culturally and primary health care-adapted lifestyle intervention program focusing on increased levels of physical activity and healthier eating habits.</p><p>(2) Study if the program has an effect on glucose metabolism (measured as fasting glucose level) and whether the change in fasting glucose is depending on insulin sensitivity index (ISI), insulin secretion (measured as oral disposition index (DIo)) and/or family history of diabetes.</p><p>(3) Explore factors that can predict beneficial and non-beneficial responses to the lifestyle intervention, such as baseline physical activity, motivational level, attitudes towards lifestyle change and adherence to intervention components.</p><p>(4) Study the cost-effectiveness of this lifestyle intervention from short term and long-term time horizon with patient, health care and societal perspectives.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The study is a 6-month randomized controlled lifestyle behavior intervention trial, where intervention and control groups are followed at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months.

In total 40% of the participants are estimated to be at risk of diabetes either by having prediabetes (IFG, IGT or IGR) or by their constellation of risk factors according to FINDRISC scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] resulting in a moderate (17%) to high risk (33%) to develop diabetes within the next decade. Thus we will have an eligible population of 1398*0.40&#x02009;=&#x02009;560 individuals, of whom 60% or 336 are estimated to finally agree to participate in the study. The participation rate is based on experiences from an intervention study of Arabic women, which had a participation rate of 62% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In the baseline study 315 Iraqi individuals had a moderate risk (i.e. an estimated 10&#x000a0;year incidence rate of diabetes of 17%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and 275 individuals had a high risk (i.e. an estimated 10&#x000a0;year incidence rate of diabetes of 33%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Based on a mean time of two years from baseline to the start of the study, we estimate that 26 individuals may have developed diabetes during this period. They will consequently be excluded from the study. Based on a drop-out rate of about 16%, we estimate that of the 310 individuals that initially participated 260 will complete the study (130 per group).</p><p>Inclusion criteria were being born in Iraq, age 30 to 75 years and high risk of diabetes as measured by</p><p>A.

It explains the extent to which behaviors are autonomous (<italic>i.e.</italic> originate from the self) and the extent to which they are controlled by societal pressure and intrapsychic or interpersonal forces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. There is consistent evidence of the value of using SDT to understand physical activity behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. For the current study, we will use the treatment self-regulation questionnaire (TSRQ), which was designed to assess the different forms of motivation within SDT to determine participants&#x02019; motivation to adopt healthy lifestyle habits.

Direct medical costs represent expenditures for medical services and products and are usually paid for by the health systems. These costs include the cost of hospitalization, outpatient care, laboratory tests and medications. Direct non-medical costs include time costs of participation in the exercise program, shopping, food preparation and cooking, and costs of exercise equipment, special foods and transportation. Indirect costs are productivity loss costs due to diseases.</p><p>Costs will be further divided into those borne by the program and those incurred by the study participants. Program costs include training costs and costs associated with setting up and performing the intervention. They also include resources required for meetings, staff preparation, meeting time and materials for the participants. Overhead and administrative costs will also be calculated according to recommended methods. Intervention providers (health coaches, nutritionists, physiotherapists, nurses, medical doctors, etc.) will be interviewed to determine the time they spent on each participant and the cost will calculated from their salary chart sheet. For cost calculation, we will use previously developed and validated questionnaires of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Each participant will be asked about the specific costs of their transport to and from the health care center, time costs and informal care costs (costs incurred by accompanying persons). Each participant will be asked about their sickness leave in the past two months. Participants will report their general sickness absence in general and also sickness absence due to physical exercise-related injuries. Lost days of productivity will be converted into costs by the human capital method to get the indirect cost.</p></sec><sec><title>Economic evaluation</title><p>Cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed from patient, health care and societal perspectives. In the societal perspective, all costs are included irrespective of who is burdened by them, while the health care perspective is only concerned with costs burdening the health care sector. The patient perspective focuses on the costs that the patients have to bear to change their lifestyle habits through the intervention. The societal perspective is generally preferred, although a health care perspective supplies additional (affordability) information and can strengthen conclusions based on the societal perspective. The results will be presented in terms of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), which show the change in costs for an incremental benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. To determine the cost-effectiveness of the intervention, ICERs will be calculated for all statistically significant outcomes. In cost utility analysis, utility values will be calculated using the EQ-5D questionnaire which provides the health related quality of life as quality adjusted life years (QALY).</p><p>We will perform economic evaluation in two different time horizons; short-term (within-trial) and long-term. Within-trial economic evaluation will only focus on the trial cost data and the outcomes. For long-term duration, we will develop a decision analytic model based on the outcome of the trail. This will be done by extrapolating the secondary clinical outcomes (BMI, blood pressure, lipid profile) to predict future disease events such as CVD, diabetes and diabetes-related complications. Each disease event will have a future cost and QALY. Future costs and effects will be discounted by 3% per year, but we intend to perform sensitivity analyses on other rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. We will analyze uncertainty by both one-way and multi-way sensitivity analysis, and also by non-parametric bootstrapping. We will calculate 95% confidence intervals for the ICERs.</p><p>We will also calculate the willingness to pay (WTP) to be in the program of the participants by the contingent valuation method. In this method, participants are directly asked what they are willing to pay for a benefit or service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

We will also study factors that may predict these changes, including intensity and amount of physical activity (measured with ActiGraph accelerometers and questionnaires) and behavioral factors such as stage of change and motivation level (measured with questions originating from self-determination theory).</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The study protocol and informed consent form (in Arabic) were approved by the Ethical Review Board of Lund University, Sweden (approval no. 2011/88). The blood samples are stored in biobank BD35, the Clinical Research Centre, Region Sk&#x000e5;ne, Sweden. Access to the blood samples for other researchers will be regulated by ethical approvals.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This article presents a detailed description of a culturally adapted randomized controlled trial of a lifestyle intervention, whose effectiveness in combating risk factors for T2D and cost-effectiveness we will investigate in Iraqi immigrants.</p><p>Although several resources for lifestyle change are today available in primary health care in Sweden, these programs are not culturally adapted and individuals at high risk of T2D are consequently not given priority. A considerable proportion of Sweden&#x02019;s inhabitants are immigrants from the Middle East, who have been identified as a group at high risk of T2D. Instead of just waiting for these high-risk individuals to develop T2D, the study seeks to optimize preventive action in the community and primary health care and aims to facilitate the adoption of changes in lifestyle in high-risk patients, taking account of cultural and social barriers. A community- and primary health care-oriented intervention model based on a successful evidence-based approach targeting individuals at high risk of T2D with a different cultural background will increase the probability of successful preventive actions in the community and primary health care in this high-risk group.</p><p>There are some potential challenges that may arise during this study. One challenge is to motivate Muslim women to participate in physical exercise as the baseline study have shown that 70% are physically inactive and may be reluctant to engage in physical exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. We aim to solve this issue by offering gender-specific group sessions with a health coach of the same gender as the participants. A limitation could be that the physical activity sessions are adapted to the preferences of the participants, which may be in conflict with the goals of achieving physical activity. Therefore, this study emphasizes increasing the motivational level of the participants by working on behavioral change.</p><p>The MEDIM intervention study will contribute with an intervention program that is adapted not only to evidence-based guidelines but also to Middle Eastern cultural and lifestyle habits, which is crucial for the program to succeed and reach its goals. The project has a strong clinical approach, focusing on clinical diabetes prevention research, and aims to provide a cost-effective method to decrease diabetes risk in a high-risk population. Increased knowledge in this novel research area would increase our understanding of the complex mechanisms that contribute to the high diabetes risk in Iraqi immigrants. The knowledge generated through this study will have important implications for health-related costs, quality of life and health equity.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>This trial will recruit participants from October 2013.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>There authors declared that they have no competing interst.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>SS wrote the manuscript and is the principal investigator for economic evaluation; ML participated in the study design and in writing the manuscript; UG, KS and JS contributed to the discussion, and reviewed and edited the article; DA participated in the study design, with a focus on physical activity, and reviewed and edited the article; LB is the principal investigator for the MEDIM study, conceived the study and its design, secured its funding, wrote the manuscript and is providing the leadership and coordination for the study.
