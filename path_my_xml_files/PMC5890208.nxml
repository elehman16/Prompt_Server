populations are major public health problem, especially women who experience sarcopenia
especially after menopause<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Based on research literature, there are some cognitive
impairments such as delayed reaction time and poor concentration which underlies most falls
in the elderly<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hence, an improvement in
psychomotor performance is a good strategy with which to successfully reduce the incidence
of falls in this population<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
advantageous of physical exercise in improving the functional capacity of the elderly
population have been the focus of considerable recent research<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. A growing number of studies strongly have investigated the effects
of different exercise techniques on various aspects of motor and cognitive performance in
elderly population. Despite the growing evidence on the benefits of exercise for the health,
the available literature lacks clinical evidence that supports recommendations for exercise
guidelines to improve cognitive and motor abilities<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The interesting and distinguishing point of differences between
previous studies and the presented study is the sort of exercise therapy with computerized
cognitive training. It was hypothesized that balance with computerized cognitive training
would significantly increase muscular strength, and consequently improves the psychomotor
performance including MDT (Simple and choice reaction time) and VPT. The purpose of the
research was to investigate the effects of balance supplemented with computerized cognitive
training on psychomotor performance in elderly.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of the present study were 29 elderly women, 63&#x02013;71&#x02005;years of age, from Qazvin,
Iran. Inclusion criteria included independent gait, no experience of a fall in the 1&#x02005;year
period prior to the study, no specific disease that might influence task performance. All
experiments were approved by a committee of Imam Khomeini International University. All the
subjects gave written informed consent before starting the study protocol, in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki. They were divided into four groups: balance training (3
d/wk for 12 wk), balance training with computerized cognitive training (3 d/wk for 12 wk),
computerized cognitive training group and control group. Psychomotor performance of all
subjects was measured by Vienna Test System (VTS) which was a computerized psychological
assessment tool that was able to analyse many different sport psychology related constructs.
VTS was developed by Schuhfried GmbH (Moedling, Austria) as a valid and reliable tool for
psychological assessment and contains a myriad of tests which are relevant to sport
psychology. Determination test (DT) and Visual Pursuit Test (VPT) were used as indexes of
psychomotor performance. The Determination Test consisted of a complex multiple stimuli
reaction test which provides measurement of reaction speed in the presence of rapidly
changing and continuous optical stimuli. The subject was presented with a variety of color
stimuli to which subject has to respond by pressing colored buttons on a specially provided
keyboard called the universal panel. The Visual Pursuit Test of the Vienna Test System was
used to measure selective and sustained attention in aged women. In this test, there was an
array of nine entwined dark lines leading to nine different endpoints. The starting point of
one out of the nine lines was marked and the participant was asked to follow this line with
their eyes to find the corresponding endpoint as quickly as possible by pressing one of nine
number buttons on a response panel. The performance of the participant was scored
automatically, considering the number of correct answers and mean RT for correct answers.
The training protocol consisted of a set of balancing exercises based on American College of
Sports Medicine guidelines<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The simple
home-based balance training program included warm up phase (10 minutes); main program
[strengthening exercise for hip abductors and extensors; marching; stepping over a bench;
closed kinetic chain quadriceps exercise; standing up from a chair with arms folded; and
walking heel-to-toe in a straight line]. They were asked to perform 20 repetitions of each
exercise, which took about 30 minutes/session. Cool down phase was lasted for 10 minutes.
Computerized cognitive training included Cognitrone protocol (COG) in which four pictures
(numbers, letters, &#x0fb01;gures, etc.) were presented in a row, with another picture presented
below. Subjects had to decide whether the lower picture matched any of the four pictures
above. A new set of pictures was presented either after a response or automatically after
1.8 s. Up to 200 sets of pictures were used in this protocol. A series of regular telephone
calls were made by the sport physiologist to assess and ensure quality control. The study
was approved by the Ethics Committee of Imam Khomeini International University (No. 17628).
Data was analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine if there were
differences between groups in pre and post-test data. A Tukey post hoc analysis was used to
identify significant differences when a significant F-ratio was obtained. Significance is
reported at p&#x0003c;0.05, and all values are reported as means &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Results of the ANOVA test indicated that there was a significant difference between pre-

populations, greater understanding of interventions that contribute to cognitive improvement
is of interest among researchers. Thus, the focus of this research was to investigate the
effect of balance exercises supplemented with computerized cognitive training on psychomotor
performance in elderly females especially the combined exercise group. We found that all
experimental groups attained improvements in psychomotor performance (Accuracy rate and
Reaction time in both Visual pursuit and Determination tasks) in the population. Consistent
with findings from other studies<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, the findings support the notion that it is
beneficial to combine balance and computerized cognitive training into clinical practice
over an exclusively either physical or cognitive intervention since both cognitive and
physical training would result in a greater achievement compared to either one. In agreement
with some studies which demonstrated that elderly individuals who are physically active
could retain their reaction capacity<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, it
was suggested that both interventions especially combined protocol facilitated performance
in the reaction time task in visual pursuit and determination tasks. The inconsistent
results which found no significant effects of exercise<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> can be attributed to differences in the forms of resistance
exercises (type, intensity and volume), and the psychomotor measures that were assessed. As
a result, balance training and computerized cognitive training are highly recommended in
elderly with the aim of increasing cognitive performance. One limitation of this study was
the small number of subjects, limiting the extent to which the results can be applied to
elderly women in general. Additional studies involving more subjects, a more controlled
environment, and/or a different variety of psychomotor tests are required in order to make
conclusive assumptions about a larger population. This research may constitute a reference
for further studies in the topic of psychomotor improvement in aged persons with the aim to
improve selective attention and reaction speed. Future studies are advised to compare
different types of physical and cognitive exercises where different specific perceptual and
cognitive demands are to be considered in the research design.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Morie</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Reid</surname><given-names>KF</given-names></name><name><surname>Miciek</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Habitual physical activity levels are associated with
