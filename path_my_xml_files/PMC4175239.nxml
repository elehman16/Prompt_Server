Taping<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> technique forward bending range of motion. [Subjects and Methods]
This was a longitudinal study with a randomized clinical trial composed of 39 subjects
divided into three groups (control, Kinesio Without Tension-KWT, and Kinesio Fascia
Correction-KFC). The subjects were assessed by Schober and fingertip-to-floor tests and
left the tape in place for 48 hours before being reassessed 24 hours, 48 hours and 30 days
after its removal. [Results] In all three experimental groups no significant differences
were observed with the Schober test, but it was possible to observe an increase in lumbar
flexion after 30 days. With the fingertip-to-floor distance assessment, the KFC and KWT
groups showed significantly improved flexibility 24 hours and 48 hours after tape removal.
[Conclusion] The Kinesio Taping<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> influenced fascia mobility, allowing for
slight improvement of lumbar flexibility.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Kinesio Taping</kwd><kwd>Low back mobility</kwd><kwd>Fascia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The lumbar spine plays a key role in accommodating downward loads resulting from body
weight distribution, muscle action, and external forces. The presence of imbalances in this
region leads to instability, pain, and increased energy consumption while performing
functional activities<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The lumbar fascial system
supports and connects all tissues and harmonizes and organizes muscular and gravitational
forces in the region<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the case of fascial retraction, fascial tensions occur along with abnormal changes in
tissue mobility and flexibility, which consequently leads to deterioration of movement. The
fibrous connective tissue in this region has numerous mechanoreceptors that are occasionally
activated to transmit sensitive and short-lived impulses. If these activations are
prolonged, they quickly become oversensitive and even painful. Although individuals can
withstand the initial painful symptoms, the condition is persistent and has a significant
recurrence rate<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Low back pain has a prevalence of 80% in the general population, in which 50% of those
affected recover spontaneously within two weeks and 90% recover within six weeks. However,
the recurrence rate can be up to 60%<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Kinesio Taping<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (KT) technique uses a tape with unique qualities, the
physiological applications of which include: correcting muscle activity, improving active
range of motion, improving blood and lymphatic circulation, decreasing pain by neurological
suppression, and repositioning joints<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The therapy done with KT using the fascial correction technique described by Kenzo Kase
aims create and/or direct fascia movement in order to guide it along a desired direction or
alignment<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, it is intended to
free the fascia of any movement limitations through movement of the skin relative to target
muscles by means of the mechanical tension generated by and elastic KT<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The tension imposed from this material, which deforms the fascia, stretches the bonds
between molecules, promoting a gentle flow of electrons and generating a piezoelectric
charge. The charge is interpreted by cells, which causes them to respond by increasing,
reducing, or changing their local intercellular elements. The fascia is a tissue that will
deform plastically if stretching is applied slowly enough<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Currently, there are few studies available KT and lumbar flexibility, especially for
patients with low back pain. Other research with similar goals that have also used KT
observed an improvement in range of motion and in pain reduction<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The current
work found in the literature differs from the present study with regard to the method of
application and location taped, with tape application varying along the lumbar area and in
some cases extending down to the posterior region of the lower extremities.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of KT with a lumbar fascia
application on the range of motion in forward bending of the lumbar spine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This was a longitudinal study composed of a randomized clinical trial and was conducted in
the Universidade Estadual de Goi&#x000e1;s from August to November of 2011. It was developed upon
approval by the ethics committee for research of the Hospital for Tropical Diseases under
protocol number 19/2011.</p><p>The sample consisted of 18- to 27-year-old female volunteers and physiotherapy students,
who did not present any movement dysfunction and did not perform any regular physical
exercises. Subjects were excluded from the study if they presented a body mass index (BMI)
greater than 29, had musculoskeletal disorders or recently presented low back and spinal
pain, were participants in any stretching program, and/or presented allergy to the taping
material.</p><p>All the participants provided informed consent for participation in the research before the
study began.</p><p>Initially, the study consisted of 45 participants randomly divided into three groups
(control, Kinesio Without Tension-KWT, and Kinesio Fascia Correction-KFC) and pared
according to age and BMI.</p><p>However, during the study, one subject was excluded because of an allergy to the Kinesio
Taping, and five others were excluded because they did not return for the last assessments.
Therefore, the final sample was composed of 39 subjects allocated into three groups
containing 13 individuals each.</p><p>Lumbar flexibility was evaluated by the Schober test, marking the midpoint of the two
posterior-superior iliac spines (S2 level) and then other two points 5&#x02005;cm below and 10&#x02005;cm
above the initial level. The distance between the three points was measured in the standing
position, and then the subject was instructed to bend forward for reassessment. The
difference between the two measurements is an indication of the magnitude of flexion that
occurs at the low back and should be at least five centimeters for lumbar mobility to be
considered normal<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. We also analyzed the
fingertip-to-floor distance, which consisted of measuring the distance from the distal end
of the third finger to the ground when the patient bent the trunk forward. The subject was
considered within normal flexibility parameters for this test when the third finger was able
to touch the ground<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The original bandage brand indicated by Kinesio Taping Association International (KTAI),
Kinesio Tex Gold 5&#x02005;cm wide, was used to perform the KT technique.</p><p>The control group did not receive any KT application. The KWT group received the KT
application with two 30&#x02005;cm &#x0201c;I&#x0201d; strips while the subjects were in position of maximum forward
bending of the spine. This application was performed simply by applying the tape to the skin
with 0% tension. The KFC group received the same cut of tape and used the same application
position as the KWT group, but the researcher applied the Kinesio Taping Fascia Correction
Technique<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> by utilizing short and long
oscillations in order to apply a varied amount of tension of 15% to 50%. The same procedure
was used for application of the second tape, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Kinesio Taping application for fascia correction</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-26-1371-g001"/></fig>.</p><p>The KWT and KFC subjects left the Kinesio Tape in place for 48 hours and were reassessed at
24 hours with the tape on, 48 hours with the tape on, and 30 days after tape removal.</p><p>Data were analyzed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (SPSS)
software, version 15.0. To verify the normality of the distribution of scalar variables, the
Shapiro-Wilk test was utilized, and for all the variables that had a normal distribution, a
parametric test was applied. Only the value of BMI showed an abnormal distribution (p =
0.01), and to check the difference between the average positions of BMI groups, the
Kruskal-Wallis test was used the Mann-Whitney test with Bonferroni correction significance
was applied for the differences between pairs. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to
assess the independent sample and found the mean age between the groups. Inferential
statistics were utilized to compare the means of the groups by means of ANOVA for repeated
measures, which compared lumbar flexibility before and after application of KT, as well as
the means of the control, KFC, and KST groups.</p><p>All the tests utilized in this research used a value of 0.05 for statistical significance
and a confidence interval of 95%.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><p>The mean age of the sample analyzed was 21.23 &#x000b1; 2.07&#x02005;years, with the minimum being 18&#x02005;years
and the maximum being 27&#x02005;years. From comparison of the mean age between the groups, it was
concluded that there were no significant differences regarding the mean age of the subjects
in each group (p = 0.169), thus showing age homogeneity in the whole sample.</p><p>When analyzing BMI, the average was found to be 20.71 &#x000b1; 1.83&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, with the
minimum and maximum values being 17.21&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and 25.81&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The
Mann-Whitney test with Bonferroni correction showed no homogeneity of BMI in the sample and
subsequent significant differences between the KWT and KFC groups as result of the
randomization process.</p><p>Because the sample was only composed of females, it differs from other studies that also
included males. Although subjects were compared with in these other studies, it is not ideal
to have a mixed sample, since there are differences in flexibility between men and
women<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The average Schober Test result for all participants, before application of KT, was 6.07 &#x000b1;
1.2&#x02005;cm. This shows that most subjects had normal lumbar spine mobility.</p><p>After applying KT, there was a reduction in the average Schober Test result in both the KWT
group and the KFC group, as illustrated in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table
1</xref>. After 30 days, there was an increase in the averages in all three groups. No
statistically significant differences were found between the averages obtained from the
Schober Test before applying the KT, 48 hours with the tape on, and 30 days after tape
removal, in any of the groups.</p><p>The average reduction after application of KT may have occurred as a result of the initial
restriction to the lumbar joints due to the tape&#x02019;s elastic resistance. It can be inferred
that the augmented flexibility witnessed 30 days after KT removal was due to possible fascia
mobilization as well as improvement of local blood flow and lymphatic circulation.</p><p>This was a sample of young, healthy subjects with normal BMI values and no lumbar issues
such characteristics may explain the lack of statistically significant results. Therefore,
it is necessary to conduct a study with subjects presenting actual dysfunctions and abnormal
situations.</p><p>The results of the present study corroborate those obtained by Salvat and Salvat (2010),
who concluded that there was no significant increase in lumbar mobility, since a gain in
range of motion as a result of reduction of the coxofemoral angle indicates improved
flexibility of the posterior muscles of the lower extremities<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to the averages obtained in the control group, as shown

different mean, 16.5&#x02005;cm was obtained 24 hours with the tape on. Furthermore, reassessment at
48 hours with the tape on showed improvement of flexibility, with the average distance being
13.88 cm. Thus, it can be inferred that the participants showed an average increase of
8.49&#x02005;cm 48 hours when utilizing KT without tension, which make the results even more
relevant. Thirty days after tape removal, the participants lost some of the acquired
flexibility (1.65&#x02005;cm). However, the final average (15.53&#x02005;cm) remained below the baseline
(22.37&#x02005;cm) value. It should be noted that no significant differences were observed between
flexibility values before application of KT and 30 days after its removal.</p><p>Applying KT without tension is a new modality that makes use of the Kinesio Taping Method
called no tension taping. When applying the elastic fabric over stretched skin, there is a
retraction response from the Kinesio Tex tape itself, which is accompanied by the return of
elasticity generated by the skin. This retraction is generally used with tensions of between
10% and 25%; however, as shown at the International Symposium for Research in Kinesio Taping
in Japan in 2012, retraction is present even at 0% applied tension. This KT retraction
triggers a series of convolutions that provide improved blood and lymphatic fluid
circulation as well as decompressions of the various local mechanoreceptors.</p><p>The results in <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> show that the average
fingertip-to-floor distance before applying KFC group was 17.05&#x02005;cm. When reassessed 24 hours
with the tape on, there was increased flexibility; however, its significance was 0.059.
After 48 hours with the tape on, there was an improvement in flexibility, as the average was
11.74&#x02005;cm. At 30 days after tape removal, the average was 13.51&#x02005;cm. Like the KWT group, the
KFC group demonstrated significant differences between the values obtained before applying
KT and 48 hours with the tape on. The difference between before KT and after 48 hours was
5.31&#x02005;cm. During the period of one month without the KT, the individuals lost about 1.77&#x02005;cm
of the flexibility that they had obtained. There were no significant differences between the
values obtained before applying KT and those at 30 days after tape removal.</p><p>The results also show that there were no statistical differences between the KFC and KWT
groups. In other words, both groups showed improvement in lower limb flexibility during the
same time interval.</p><p>In a similar study, an improvement in flexibility of 2.15 &#x000b1; 2.30 was observed and found to
be significant<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, this result
was inferior to that obtained in the present study in the KWT and KFC groups. To compare the
averages of the two studies, two factors should be considered: the time the tape stayed on
the skin and width of the KT that was used. The authors of the aforementioned study used a
thinner tape width (2.5&#x02005;cm) than in the present study (5&#x02005;cm), which consequently would
trigger less local mechanical and sensorial effects, and the tape application remained on
the skin for only 30 minutes. These two associated factors provide a less than optimal
effect than the potential of KT, as perceived in the present study, where the peak of
improvement in flexibility occurred at 48 hours with the tape on.</p><p>Considering the aspects mentioned above related to the previous study and also considering
the assessments made before and after the tape applications and the lack of regard for
chronic influences on flexibility, the gains mentioned in the previous research may have
been influenced by the fact that subjects remained in an elongated posture while application
of KT was conducted, which could have contributed to a false-positive effect on the
results.</p><p>Furthermore, the improvements in flexibility may have been attributed to the repeated
motions performed during the sit and reach tests, which promote a reduction in connective
tissue resistance that, when combined with stretching, may serve as an elasticity
intensifier in the muscle-tendon unit<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Ebber and Pijnappel (2006) measured the range of motion with the sit and reach test. In
their study, this test was done before applying the taping technique, immediately after its
application, and after spending three days with the tape on. They utilized the &#x0201c;Y&#x0201d; cut form
of application, and the tape was initially laid out on the lumbar region with subsequent
bilateral positioning of its tails along the path of the sciatic nerve in 99 subjects
healthy; however, they did not mention how much tension was applied. They observed a
positive influence on the results after three days of use<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The effect of KT in the lower extremities, in both the experiment mentioned above and in
the present study, can be justified by the formation of convolutions in the skin of the
lumbar region after tape application. These in turn allow for the reestablishment of fluid
flow and stimulation of the sensorimotor system<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, just as mobilization of the tissue
produces distal structural effects, since dermatomes of the lumbar and sacral region extend
over to the lower extremities<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>By verifying the influence of KT in the lower extremities, it was deemed unnecessary to
apply it to the entire lower limb, since application along the trajectory of the sciatic
nerve results in values close to those obtained in this study<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>We verified that the values for flexibility of the lower extremities were more significant
in both the KWT and KFC groups at 48 hours with the tape on. This implies that the
connective tissue does not respond immediately to external stimuli, and as they become more
sustainable and repetitive, structural changes occur. On the other hand, excitable tissues
differ in that they respond quickly to an external mechanical stimulus and allow for
reduction of pain and increased stretching tolerance<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>KT, like massage therapy, has an inhibitory effect on the positive reflex amplitude that
lasts only during application of the technique<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. When either the stimulus to the mechanoreceptors or the tension to
the tissue is discontinued, all aspects of the region return to their baseline values, as
observed in the present study during the reassessment at 30 days after tape removal.</p><p>In general, it can be observed that the control group showed no significant improvement in
flexibility and that the KWT group presented better results than the KFC group. Such results
can be attributed to the method of application and the tension used during the procedure. In
the KWT group, the tape was applied without any tension, which allowed the formation of more
convolutions in the skin and consequently increased blood and lymphatic flow while at the
same time reducing pressure on mechanoreceptors. During the fascial correction technique in
the KFC group, the tension applied in KT varied from 15% (mild) to 50% (moderate), which
somewhat limited the formation of convolutions and hence resulted in a lesser effect than
that observed in the KWT group. From 0 to 100% tension can be applied in the Kinesio Taping
Method; for muscle purposes, light tensions is used to generate only sensitive reactions,
and moderate to high tension is used to generate more mechanical functions<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. So the above results may include some
mechanical responses that could be responsible for the limited flexibility found in the KFC
group.</p><p>Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of proper application by an experienced
professional in order to allow for frequent and rhythmic motion. Having experience and
mastery of the technique during application reduces the chances of applying tensions higher
than 50%, which cause undesired effects. Another important factor to be considered is
related to the amount of time that the tape stays on the skin. Since the goal in the present
study was to mobilize the superficial fascia, the technique required a longer period of time
to promote mobilization of this connective tissue, which happens to be time dependent.</p><p>As this study was performed with female subjects, the menstrual cycle must be considered
because it coincides with significant elevations in estradiol levels<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Kinesio Taping Method is a promising tool, and its use is expanding because of various
therapeutic effects that have been proven through research, particularly those related to
the musculoskeletal system. It is a particle technique that can be reproduced from other
persons for the clinical and research porpoise.</p><p>The thoracolumbar fascia is a stable structure because of the large flow of piezoelectric
charges, which promote the deposition of collagen fibers and confers resistance to this
tissues, and thus requires high tensions to be mobilized and stretched<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therefore, the present study found that a fascial correction technique and application
without tension promoted changes in fascia mobility, allowed for discrete gains in lumbar
flexibility, and had significant influences on fingertip-to-floor distance. However, to
achieve better results in lumbar fascia mobilization, the use of the Kinesio Tape for longer
periods of time is recommended, which would allow for greater tensions on the tissues and
consequently promote better plastic adaptations. It is important to consider that the lumbar
fascia is not the only reason for improvement of the lumbar flexibility. Since Kinesio Tape
is an elastic bandage with moderate tension, it does not acutely trigger sufficient
mechanical stress to have an impact in mobilizing the fascia. Further studies are
recommended with longer periods of tape application and with subjects that present actual
myofascial dysfunctions in the lumbar region.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Almeida</surname><given-names>CCV</given-names></name><name><surname>Barbosa</surname><given-names>CGD</given-names></name><name><surname>Ara&#x000fa;jo</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>F&#x000e1;scia T&#x000f3;raco Lombar como mecanismo ativo de Estabiliza&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o
