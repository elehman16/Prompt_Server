Mobility encompasses activities necessary for daily functioning: getting in and out bed, on/off toilet, sitting, standing and walking. These activities are significantly affected in people with severe stroke who typically spend most of their time in bed or a chair and are immobile. Immobility is primarily caused by neurological damage but exacerbated by secondary changes in musculoskeletal and cardiorespiratory systems. These secondary changes can theoretically be prevented or minimised by early mobilisation, in this case standing up early post-stroke.</p><p id="Par2">Standing up early post-stroke has been identified as an important priority for people who have suffered a severe stroke. However, trials of prolonged passive standing have not demonstrated any functional improvements. Conversely, task-specific training such as repeated sit-to-stand has demonstrated positive functional benefits. This feasibility trial combines prolonged standing and task-specific strength training with the aim of determining whether this novel combination of physiotherapy interventions is feasible for people with severe stroke as well as the overall feasibility of delivering the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par3">This is a pragmatic multi-centre parallel single-blinded two-armed feasibility randomised controlled trial. Fifty people with a diagnosis of severe stroke will be randomly allocated to either the functional standing frame programme or usual physiotherapy. All patient participants will be assessed at baseline and followed up at 3&#x000a0;weeks, then 3, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months post-randomisation. Trial objectives are to determine the feasibility according to the following indicators:: (i) <italic>Process</italic>: recruitment and retention rate, ability to consent, eligibility criteria, willingness/ability of physiotherapists to recruit, willingness of patients to be randomised, and acceptability of the intervention; (ii) <italic>Resource</italic>: burden and potential costs; (iii) <italic>Management</italic>: treatment fidelity, participant adherence, acceptability and completeness of outcome measures, impact and management or orthostatic hypotension; and (iv) <italic>Safety</italic>: number and nature of adverse and serious adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par4">The functional standing frame programme addresses a key concern for people who have suffered a severe stroke. However, several uncertainties exist which need to be understood prior to progressing to a full-scale trial, including acceptability and tolerance of the functional standing frame programme intervention and practicality of the trial procedures. This feasibility trial will provide important insights to resolve these uncertainties.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.isrctn.com/">ISRCTN15412695</ext-link>.

Current government and clinical guidelines recommend that following diagnosis of a stroke, people are admitted to an Acute Stroke Unit to receive stroke specialist multi-disciplinary care. This reduces mortality and improves functional outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] compared to standard non-specialist care. The UK stroke pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and National Clinical Guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] advocate that people with mild or moderate strokes (i.e. modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 1&#x02013;3; able to transfer independently or with the help of one person with/without equipment) are discharged from the Acute Stroke Unit to the Early Supported Discharge service, which provides specialist stroke rehabilitation in a home-based setting. People with severe strokes (mRS 4&#x02013;5; requiring assistance of two people with/without equipment) are transferred from the Acute Stroke Unit to a specialist Stroke Rehabilitation Unit for early sub-acute rehabilitation usually within 7&#x000a0;days. The early sub-acute phase spans from 7&#x000a0;days to 3&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]), with average time from stroke onset to admission on Stroke Rehabilitation Unit 6&#x000a0;days (1 to 37&#x000a0;days) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Some Early Supported Discharge services in the UK admit people with a mRS of 4, but this is not the standard care nationally.</p><p id="Par34">The implementation of Early Supported Discharge has caused a change in patient caseload nationally for Stroke Rehabilitation Units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] resulting in the majority of people admitted to Stroke Rehabilitation Units having complex needs and severe deficits. This change in caseload necessitates the design and evaluation of interventions for patients in Stroke Rehabilitation Units that target people with more severe deficits. The most common physical deficit caused by stroke is motor impairment, seen in approximately 80% of people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. It is the single most disabling factor in terms of limiting a person&#x02019;s mobility, their ability to participate in activities of daily living (ADL) and to live independently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Mobility encompasses a wide range of activities necessary for daily functioning: moving in bed, getting in/out of bed, on/off toilet, sitting out of bed, standing and walking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. These activities are particularly affected in the 15.5% of people with severe stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] who require the assistance of two people to undertake ADL, may need equipment to aid transfers and are unable to sit unsupported, stand or walk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. They typically spend much of their time in bed and are dependent on a wheelchair/specialist seating when they sit out of bed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">Although immobility post-stroke is primarily caused by neurological damage, it can be exacerbated by other factors such as muscle wasting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], reduced muscle length, increased muscle stiffness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], joint contracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and orthostatic hypotension. Orthostatic Hypotension (OH) is a sudden drop in blood pressure when moving from lying to standing, leading to symptoms of feeling faint, generalised weakness, cognitive slowing, and gradual or sudden loss of consciousness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and can, therefore, limit standing time. It can affect over 50% of people post-stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and should be addressed using non-pharmacological or pharmacological interventions, or a combination of the two [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Secondary changes in the musculoskeletal and cardiorespiratory systems can theoretically be prevented or minimised by early mobilisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] especially standing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]; prevention of these secondary changes underpins the rationale for the current trial.</p><p id="Par36">Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have reported mixed outcomes of early mobilisation post-stroke. Less favourable outcomes occurred when early mobilisation was instigated <italic>very</italic> early (within the first 24&#x000a0;h post-stroke) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] compared to a reduction in complications when instigated early (&#x02265;&#x02009;24&#x000a0;h post-stroke) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Early mobilisation is associated with increased independence in ADL and a faster return to walking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, these trials all had different primary end-points (Functional Independence Measure; Modified Rankin; incidence of severe complications during hospitalisation) which makes direct comparison of effectiveness of early mobilisation interventions difficult. Whilst early mobilisation is deemed to be safe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], uncertainties have been identified with regard to dose and frequency. The AVERT Trial Collaborative Group suggest that shorter, more frequent mobilisation is preferable, and the latest Royal College of Physicians Guidelines have incorporated this, recommending patients &#x0201c;accumulate&#x0201d; at least 45&#x000a0;min daily. However, the main limitation of these studies is that they specify neither the time spent mobilising nor the intensity, content and frequency of therapy. Therefore, it is possible in previous work that, other than hoists, no specialised equipment was used to promote recovery for people with severe stroke, and active sitting constituted early mobilisation with no opportunity to stand. This is aligned with current clinical practice in Cornwall and Devon (where this research is being led) where standing is not routinely implemented as part of sub-acute inpatient rehabilitation for people who have suffered a severe stroke.</p><p id="Par37">A motorised standing frame can safely assist people with severe stroke into a supported standing posture. Suggested benefits of supported standing include stretching contracted muscles, decreasing spasticity, strengthening muscles, improving bladder and bowel function, relieving pressure areas and reducing OH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Evidence from people with spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, stroke and traumatic brain injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] indicates that the aforementioned benefits can be observed with 30&#x000a0;min of regular standing. However, a systematic review highlighted variation in duration (20 to 60&#x000a0;min) and frequency from three times per week (median 5&#x000a0;days per week), with dose dependent on length of inpatient say and participant recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">In preparation for this feasibility trial, discussions with people who had suffered a stroke and their relatives identified that standing up early after a stroke was important, relevant and meaningful for them and this formed the basis of the research question and subsequent trial design/development. Opportunities to stand for people who have suffered a severe stroke are limited due to significant disability; thus, they are reliant on physical assistance from mechanical equipment such as a standing frame.</p><p id="Par39">Standing frames are not routinely used in sub-acute inpatient stroke rehabilitation as part of a postural management programme and never issued on discharge from Stroke Rehabilitation Units. A systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] identified a paucity of robust evidence for the use of standing frames in people with stroke. A previous RCT found no difference in functional outcomes in people with a sub-acute severe stroke who did or did not use standing frames for 14 consecutive sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The lack of functional improvement may be due to the duration and intensity of treatment, as well as the sensitivity of the outcome measures used (Rivermead Mobility Index and Barthel Index). Additionally, participants undertook prolonged passive standing only and the addition of task-specific training may have improved functional outcomes. Task-specific training is based on the fundamental principle that repeated practice of functionally relevant tasks is the best way to learn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Tasks such as sit-to-stand have been shown to produce functional benefits post-stroke, and patients who receive task-specific training are more likely to improve their function and sustain these improvements than patients receiving usual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. The combination of prolonged standing and task-specific strength training underpins the rationale for the functional standing frame programme used in this feasibility trial.</p><p id="Par40">The functional standing frame intervention combines two physiotherapy interventions that have separately been evaluated and reported in the literature: prolonged standing and task-specific strength training. Currently, it is not known whether this novel combination of physiotherapy for people with severe stroke is effective in everyday clinical practice, and the United Kingdom Medical Research Council provides guidance on how complex interventions can be developed and evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. A key component of the evaluation of the complex intervention is the acceptability among people with severe stroke. Currently, it is not known whether the functional standing frame programme would be tolerated or acceptable for people with severe stroke, at this early stage of their rehabilitation continuum. The Medical Research Council guidance explicitly recommends an early phase of assessing feasibility prior to a full definitive main trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and recognises the value of using both quantitative and qualitative methods concurrently. The use of qualitative research within feasibility RCTs is becoming increasingly common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. This feasibility randomised controlled trial facilitates the evaluation of acceptability, compliance and delivery of the intervention; trial practices, processes and design; and recruitment and refusal and retention rates. This links to the trial objectives and will inform the conduct and design of the anticipated definitive main trial to facilitate successful, effective and confident delivery.</p><p id="Par41">Qualitative research will be embedded in this feasibility trial and used in tandem with quantitative methods to provide insights into the intervention and trial processes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims</title><p id="Par42">The <italic>primary aim</italic> of this trial is to establish whether a RCT of a functional standing frame programme in people with severe stroke in an inpatient sub-acute stroke rehabilitation setting is feasible.</p><p id="Par43">The <italic>secondary aim</italic> is to explore the experience of this functional standing frame programme on the individual&#x02019;s daily life, as well as the experience of being recruited and randomised to the trial, from the perspective of both the person with stroke and their relative/carer, using qualitative methods.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par44">Trial-specific objectives are to evaluate the feasibility according to the following indicators:</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Process</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment rate</title><p id="Par45">The recruitment rate will be defined as the number of participants recruited per month.

The functional standing frame programme involves a maximum of 30&#x000a0;min using the standing frame (standing and repeated sit to stand) plus an additional 15&#x000a0;min to provide time for usual care physiotherapy, where participants may practise transfers, upper limb activities or activities chosen by participants or guided by physiotherapists. Participants will be asked to undertake the functional standing frame programme once a day, for a target of a minimum of 5&#x000a0;days per week which is aligned with the RCP Guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par105">The initial frequency and duration of standing may vary according to physical capability as assessed by the treating physiotherapist. The aim is to progress standing time by 30% in each session, up to the maximum of 30&#x000a0;min. Each treating therapist will use their individual clinical reasoning when evaluating participants&#x02019; tolerance to standing and ability to tolerate incremental increases in standing duration. The associated Work Instruction (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) contains specific details of how to implement this.

Foot sensors (integral to the frame design or customised) will record load through each leg when standing in the frame. The aim is for the foot sensors to be used as biofeedback to encourage equal weight distribution during quiet standing and sit-to-stand. Whilst standing, participants will be supported in the frame with straps at the ankle, knees, hips and trunk (if required).

Repeated sit to stand (8&#x02013;12 repetitions) should, however, be continued throughout the 30&#x000a0;min session.</p><p id="Par111">Physiotherapists will record activities undertaken during every session using a Physiotherapy Content Recording Tool (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). This checklist is based on the Stroke Physical Therapy Intervention Tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>] which provides a system for recording physiotherapy treatment for stroke patients and has been modified to reflect current clinical practice in a sub-acute rehabilitation setting. Recording physiotherapy interventions during sub-acute stroke rehabilitation will enable usual physiotherapy management to be defined and inform the subsequent main trial. This will include number of repetitions of sit-to-stand, activities undertaken whilst standing, reductions in postural support, duration of stand and activities undertaken in the 15&#x000a0;min of usual physiotherapy.</p><p id="Par112">For the first three sessions (or longer if deemed appropriate by physiotherapists), blood pressure will be assessed both prior to and during the functional standing frame programme.

If, when standing, a participant demonstrates OH (decrease in systolic blood pressure of &#x02265;&#x02009;20&#x000a0;mmHg, or a reduction in diastolic blood pressure of &#x02265;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;mmHg upon changing body position from a supine position to an upright posture, or sitting to standing) standing will be modified or, if required, ceased for that session. Details are contained in a trial-specific work instruction document.</p><p id="Par113">If the participant demonstrates OH, a protocol to treat OH using non-pharmacological interventions will be implemented, in collaboration with the participant&#x02019;s ward-based doctor. This protocol will provide details about application and monitoring of a compression garment and continued monitoring of blood pressure (available from corresponding author on request).</p><p id="Par114">To standardise and optimise implementation of the functional standing frame intervention, all treating physiotherapists will be provided with face-to-face trial specific training by the CI and be included on the delegation log, authorised by the CI or PI.

There is no agreed upon definition of what constitutes usual physiotherapy; thus, there is likely to be variation in usual physiotherapy due to physiotherapists&#x02019; preferences, experience and training.

Every effort will be made throughout the trial to ensure assessments are blinded for the remaining 34 participants whose allocated group will not be unblinded. Treating physiotherapists and/or participants will be reminded not to discuss their allocated group with the assessor during any interaction. At each assessment time point, the blinded assessors will be asked to record if they were unblinded to group allocation, and if so, the reasons for this as well as recording which group they think the participant was allocated to.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec42"><title>Methods: data collection, management, and analysis</title><p id="Par147">Data will be collected using a range of methods: semi-structured interviews with patient participants, their relatives, and treating physiotherapists/PIs, Case Report Forms and observer completed fidelity checklists.<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>A)</label><p id="Par148">Feasibility outcomes</p></list-item></list><table-wrap id="Taba"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Feasibility indicator</td><td>Outcome measures</td><td>Data collection method</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&#x02003;Process</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02003;Recruitment rate</td><td>% of participants recruited/time</td><td>Case Report Forms</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02003;Retention rate</td><td>% of participants completed T1, T2, T3, T4, T5</td><td>Case Report Forms &#x00026; Withdrawal Forms</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02003;Ability to consent</td><td>% of participants consenting</td><td>Screening/Approach Logs</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02003;Consent rate</td><td>% of consultee declarations</td><td>Case Report Forms</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02003;Eligibility criteria</td><td>% of admissions screened &#x00026; eligible</td><td>Screening/Approach Log, Recruitment rate, Interview &#x00026; Focus Group</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02003;Willingness of physiotherapists to recruit</td><td>% of admissions screened &#x00026; approached</td><td>Recruitment rate, Interview &#x00026; Focus Group</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02003;Willingness of patients to be randomised</td><td>% of participants who refuse to enrol in the trial</td><td>Recruitment Rate, Interviews &#x00026; Focus Group</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02003;Acceptability of the intervention</td><td>% of withdrawals</td><td>Case Report Forms &#x00026; Interview</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02003;Determining usual physiotherapy</td><td>Frequency specific physiotherapy interventions are implemented</td><td>Case Report Forms</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&#x02003;Resources</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02003;Burden</td><td>% of participants refusing physiotherapy sessions and follow-up assessments</td><td>Case Report Forms &#x00026; Interviews &#x00026; focus group</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02003;Cost effectiveness</td><td><italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;duration (minutes) of functional standing frame programme session</td><td>Case Report Forms &#x00026; Interviews</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&#x02003;Management</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02003;Fidelity</td><td>Observe intervention and control group sessions</td><td>Fidelity Checklists</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="6">&#x02003;&#x02003;Participant adherence</td><td><italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;sessions per week</td><td>Case Report Forms</td></tr><tr><td><italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;minutes in standing</td><td>Case Report Forms &#x00026; interview</td></tr><tr><td><italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;sit to stand repetitions</td><td>Case Report Forms &#x00026; interview</td></tr><tr><td><italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;Yes; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;No for enjoyment</td><td>Case Report Forms &#x00026; interview</td></tr><tr><td>Score out of 10 for effort</td><td>Case Report Forms &#x00026; interview</td></tr><tr><td>Score out of 10 for fatigue</td><td>Case Report Forms &#x00026; interview</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">&#x02003;&#x02003;Orthostatic hypotension protocol</td><td>% incidence of orthostatic hypotension</td><td>Case Report Forms</td></tr><tr><td>% of incomplete sessions due to orthostatic hypotension (OH)</td><td>Case Report Forms</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&#x02003;Safety</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02003;Intervention</td><td><italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;AE &#x00026; SAE</td><td>Adverse Event and Serious</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02003;Data collection</td><td><italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;AE &#x00026; SAE</td><td>Adverse Event Forms</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par149">T1: baseline; T2: post-intervention period; T3: 3&#x000a0;months; T4: 6&#x000a0;months; T5: 12&#x000a0;months<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>B)</label><p id="Par150">Clinical outcome measures</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par151">Standardised, validated clinician-rated and patient self-reported clinical outcomes will be measured in both groups at baseline, post-intervention (within 1&#x000a0;week) and follow-up (3, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months &#x000b1;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;week).

This was highlighted during early discussions with patients, their relatives and clinicians where the research topic was strongly endorsed as meaningful and relevant and aligned with patients&#x02019; key priorities to &#x0201c;get up and move straight away&#x0201d; after their stroke. This led to the development of the research question and has continued to inform and influence the trial design and remained integral to the development of the methodology, grant application, trial protocol and trial monitoring. The functional standing frame programme has been developed with the aim of addressing this important issue; however, a full evaluation of its effectiveness is essential to inform evidence-based clinical decision-making. Best practice guidance emphasises the need to thoroughly test the feasibility and acceptability of both interventions and trial evaluation procedures prior to undertaking a full-scale assessment of effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par177">The functional standing frame intervention specifically aims to address the key priorities of patients, their relatives and clinicians, optimising general function, standing and walking. Whilst discussions with people who have had a severe stroke and their relatives identified the importance of people with severe stroke being actively involved in research, they identified several barriers (e.g. fatigue, exercise tolerance, communication difficulties, being physically and psychological overwhelmed and memory difficulties), which are identified and acknowledged in the literature as barriers to recruitment and retention in stroke clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These barriers have been carefully considered by utilising relevant literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and resources such as Clinical Research Networks and people who have suffered stroke, their relatives and stroke specialist therapists to facilitate inclusion of people with severe stroke. Additionally, the qualitative component will provide the opportunity to explore the impact of the functional standing frame programme intervention, being randomised into the usual physiotherapy group, recruitment and retention.</p><p id="Par178">The usual physiotherapy group provides the opportunity to describe what interventions physiotherapists are currently using to facilitate optimal function after severe stroke, using the Physiotherapy Content Recording Tool. Key clinical guidelines recommend interdisciplinary rehabilitation, of which physiotherapy is primarily aimed at optimising and maintaining activities of daily living, usually starting within the first few days&#x02019; post-stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. There is strong evidence favouring task-specific and high repetitive task-oriented training; however, randomised controlled trials are needed to address which patients may benefit from a specific intervention and at what time post-stroke interventions should be initiated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. This underpins the rationale for this feasibility randomised controlled trial to investigate the effects of a functional standing frame programme versus usual physiotherapy in people with severe sub-acute stroke on function, quality of life and neuromuscular impairment.</p><sec id="Sec56"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par179">Recruitment opened in December 2016.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec57"><p>
