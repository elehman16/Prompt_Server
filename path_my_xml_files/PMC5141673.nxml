Coronally advanced flap (CAF) is often used periodontal plastic surgical technique to accomplish root coverage. The purpose of this clinical trial is to assess and compare the effectiveness of modified CAF with orthodontic button application (CAF+B) and without orthodontic button application (CAF) for the correction of multiple recession defects.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Twenty patients exhibiting bilateral multiple proximate Millers Class I and/or Class II gingival recession defects were included in the study. Each set of proximate recession defects was designated randomly to test or control group. Control group was treated by CAF alone and test group by CAF+B.

It has been shown that preoperative recession depth is correlated with complete root coverage (CRC): The more the initial recession, the lesser the frequency of CRC.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Coronally advanced flap (CAF) is reliable and commonly used periodontal plastic surgical procedure to achieve root coverage.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Several authors have employed CAF by relocating the residual gingiva in a coronal direction alone or in association with free gingival or a connective tissue graft (CTG)[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] or with membranes, according to the principles of guided tissue regeneration.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>CAF along with CTG is one of the most successful and acceptable treatment options for the correction of an isolated type of gingival recession defect.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] However, disadvantages of using CTG includes the necessity of the second surgical site and morbidity linked with procuring the autogenous palatal donor mucosa. In contrast, the CAF is a root coverage surgery that does not require a palatal donor site and has been confirmed to be safe and predictable.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Recently, Zucchelli <italic>et al</italic>. have suggested modified CAF technique for the resolution of multiple adjacent recession-type defects (MARTD).[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Another important observation reported in an earlier study is that the location of GM at the end of the surgery appeared to have an influence on attaining CRC. Suturing the GM at least 2 mm coronal to the CEJ resulted in CRC.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Since it is important and technically difficult to achieve and protect the most possible coronal position of the GM in immediate postoperative phase with periodontal plastic surgery method alone, orthodontic buttons were applied in this study. The purpose of this randomized, controlled clinical trial is, therefore, to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of modified CAF procedure with (CAF+B) and without (CAF) orthodontic button application for the treatment of multiple Miller Class I and Class II recession-type defects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Sample size and selection criteria</title><p>A split-mouth randomized clinical trial was planned and implemented to compare the clinical performance of CAFs with or without orthodontic button application for the treatment of multiple gingival recession defects. Twenty systemically and periodontally healthy patients with bilateral Millers Class I and II multiple gingival recession defects with &#x02265;1 mm of attached gingiva and probing pocket depth &#x02264;3 mm at gingival recession sites were included in this study (with &#x003b1; error 10% and power of 80% the sample size was estimated as twenty in each group). The study patients were selected on a consecutive basis and treated between September 2014 and October 2015 in the Department of Periodontics and Implantology at VSPM's Dental College and Research Centre, Nagpur, India. All the patients were required to sign a consent letter before being enrolled. The study was conducted after the clearance from the Institutional Ethics Committee. The study protocol satisfied the provisions of Helsinki Declaration. The study was registered with Clinical Trial Registry with no CTRI/2016/01/006543.</p><p>Patients with a history of any known systemic disease, smoking, recession defects associated with caries, drug usage that would alter the healing response of the oral tissues, and patients with history of any kind of periodontal treatment in the past 6 months were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Randomization</title><p>The patients were assigned into two treatment groups, i.e., Group I and Group II. The Group I acted as control group and Group II as test group. The participants in test group were treated with CAF+B while the participants in control group were treated by CAF alone. The randomization was achieved by the toss of a coin before the surgery of each patient. The outcome of coin toss was written on paper, which was put in the opaque envelope by a blinded staff (Abhay Kolte), which contained the treatment information for the specific patient. It was opened at the time of surgery by surgeon (Sumedh Khobragade), immediately after completing treatment of the root surfaces to prevent surgeon bias. So both, surgeon and participants were blinded about the intervention group.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Presurgical therapy and clinical measurements</title><p>The study population was subjected to instructions in oral hygiene, ultrasonic instrumentation, and coronal polishing and the plaque index (Turesky&#x02013;Gilmore&#x02013;Glickman modification of Quigley-Hein 1970)[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and gingival index (Loe and Silness 1963)[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] were recorded.</p><p>Clinical recordings were performed at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 months after surgery, including; (1) Gingival recession depth (GRD) was measured as interspace between apical zenith of CEJ and GM, (2) probing depth (PD) was measured from the GM to depth of the gingival sulcus, (3) clinical attachment level (CAL) was measured as depth from CEJ to the bottom of sulcus, (4) width of keratinized tissue (KTW) being considered as distance from mucogingival junction (MGJ) to the GM, (5) Location of GM with respect to CEJ was calculated after suturing by deducting the distance between incisal margin and CEJ from the distance between incisal margin and GM, (6) Recession depth reduction, (7) mean root coverage, and (8) CRC.</p><p>All the measurements were carried out with UNC 15 periodontal probe (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL) by a single examiner (Rajashri Kolte) who was calibrated before the beginning of the present trail.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Surgical procedure</title><p>Surgical procedures were same for both groups and performed by the same operator. The CAF procedure used in this study has been detailed by Zucchelli <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Briefly, the flap design comprised two oblique, beveled divergent incisions performed at the mesial and distal line angles of the two peripheral teeth with gingival recessions, horizontal incisions performed mesial and distal to tooth with gingival recession and intrasulcular incision. The periodontal flap was elevated with a split-full-split design in the coronal-apical direction; the surgical papillae were split thickness in nature. Gingival tissue apical to the root exposures was raised full thickness and it was limited once 3&#x02013;4 mm of bone was exposed. The most apical portion of the flap was raised split thickness to enable coronal displacement of the flap. The intact and undisturbed interdental papilla were scraped for deepithelization and create a raw bleeding bed for CAF. The flap was sutured by 5-0 nylon monofilament sutures (Ethicon, Johnson, and Johnson, Woluwe, Belgium) in apico-coronal direction to facilitate the coronal displacement of the flap and to lessen tenseness over last sutures. The final position of the flap margin was always coronal to CEJ of all teeth included in the design. For the protection of the surgical area, periodontal dressing was applied [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Surgical procedure in Group I (coronally advanced flap group), (a) teeth 21, 22, 23, 24 with gingival recession.

The surgical procedure performed for recession defects in test group was same as that applied for the control group except that two types of sutures were used in test group; sling and stabilizing sutures. The sling 5-0 sutures with nylon monofilament were used to suspend the central area of the flaps on the buttons. The second 5-0 sutures were applied to establish a precise approximation and adaptation of the buccal flap on the convexity of crown surfaces. At the end of the surgery, the flap margins were a minimum of 3&#x02013;4 mm coronal to the CEJ of all concerned teeth [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>].</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Surgical procedure in Group II (coronally advanced flap with orthodontic button application), (a) teeth 13, 14, and 15 with gingival recession.

The orthodontic button can be used in root coverage procedure as an anchorage on which sutures are suspended which provides maximum coronal placement of flap and accounts for stabilizing the flap in coronally advanced positions. CAF along with orthodontic button application is a procedure which is easy to perform, inexpensive, and highly acceptable as compared to the use of CTG, enamel matrix derivative, and acellular dermal matrix.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>The results of the present study indicate that utilization of CAF+B procedure aids in statistically significant GRD reduction as compared to CAF alone. It was revealed that a positive correlation exhibit between postoperative GM location and achieving CRC. The coronal advancement of the GM relative to CEJ following CAF+B procedure appears to augment the success of CRC. These results are in accordance with studies by Pini Prato <italic>et al</italic>. 2005, 1999 where they reported that the greater postoperative coronal displacement of the GM may ensure greater root coverage.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Pini Prato 2005 evaluated and observed that postsurgical location of GM is crucial factor for attaining CRC and a greater recession reduction was associated with greater coronal displacement of the flap. The results of the present study also demonstrated that application of CAF+B procedure increases the CRC rate in multiple gingival recession defects.</p><p>During all the time intervals, i.e., 2, 4, and 6 months, there was statistically significant reduction in GRD when compared to baseline. The results of the present study are similar to results of studies by Ozcelik <italic>et al</italic>. 2011 and da Silva <italic>et al</italic>. 2004.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In the present study, at the end of 6 months, the mean GRD reduction for Group I was 2.38 &#x000b1; 054 mm and for Group II was 2.84 &#x000b1; 0.84 mm. The differences in results between the present study and the previous studies in terms of amount of root coverage can be attributed to differences in gingival recession defects present at baseline which was greater in these studies.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>This study showed statistically significant gain in CAL in both the groups when compared to baseline with more gain in CAL in Group II. In addition, the CAL gain was more at end of 2 months as compared to 6 months of follow-up in both the groups. The reduction in CAL gain at 6 months can be attributed to apical shift of the GM, which might be related to the delicate and thinner dimensions of keratinized tissue achieved.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Cetiner <italic>et al</italic>. 2004 reported a higher gain in CAL as compared to the present study which can be accredited to the use of CTG along with CAF; such combination enables to achieve thicker dimensions of gingiva postoperatively which appears to be more resistant to the initial apical shift.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, the increase in KTW can be explained by the fact that MGJ is genetically determined as it demarcates the junction between the basal bone and alveolar process.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] This MGJ has tendency to reestablish itself to the original position leading to gain in KTW.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>The difference in percentage of root coverage was found to be statistically highly significant between both the groups. Twenty-five out of 57 (43.8%) treated sites showed CRC in Group I and 46 out of 59 (77.47%) of treated sites showed CRC in Group II. As esthetic analysis is extremely vital and subjective in root coverage procedures, two sets of measurement techniques were used. The VAS analysis was adapted to calibrate the patient satisfaction with esthetics. The patients treated with CAF+B technique showed increased satisfaction esthetically in comparison to patients treated with CAF. This finding is in agreement with the patient-centered assessment results, which demonstrated that the patients treated with CAF+B had significantly advantageous RES scores when collated with the CAF.</p><p>Some clinical and biological benefits of the procedure utilized in the current study might be attributed to the split-full-split flap elevation.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The split-thickness elevation at the level of the surgical papilla assures stability and blood supply in the interproximal areas mesial and distal to the root exposure; the full-thickness portion accords increased thickness, and thus provides enhanced chances to achieve root coverage; the more apical split-thickness flap elevation enables the coronal positioning of the flap. A long-term analysis on a larger study population is however desired to enable us to further substantiate the results.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Limitations</title><p>The following limitations were observed in the present study:</p><p>

The placement of GM and its stabilization during early healing stages appears to have a profound influence over the root coverage as well as the esthetic outcome achieved in such procedures.</p><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ozcelik</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Haytac</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name><name><surname>Seydaoglu</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Treatment of multiple gingival recessions using a coronally advanced flap procedure combined with button application</article-title><source>J Clin Periodontol</source><year>2011</year><volume>38</volume><fpage>572</fpage><lpage>80</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21443557</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>L&#x000f6;e</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Anerud</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Boysen</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The natural history of periodontal disease in man: Prevalence, severity, and extent of gingival recession</article-title><source>J Periodontol</source><year>1992</year><volume>63</volume><fpage>489</fpage><lpage>95</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1625148</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Aroca</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Keglevich</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Nikolidakis</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Gera</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Nagy</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Azzi</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Treatment of class III multiple gingival recessions: A randomized-clinical trial</article-title><source>J Clin Periodontol</source><year>2010</year><volume>37</volume><fpage>88</fpage><lpage>97</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19968743</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pini Prato</surname><given-names>GP</given-names></name><name><surname>Baldi</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Nieri</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Franseschi</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Cortellini</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Clauser</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Coronally advanced flap: The post-surgical position of the gingival margin is an important factor for achieving complete root coverage</article-title><source>J Periodontol</source><year>2005</year><volume>76</volume><fpage>713</fpage><lpage>22</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15898931</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>de Sanctis</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Zucchelli</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Coronally advanced flap: A modified surgical approach for isolated recession-type defects: Three-year results</article-title><source>J Clin Periodontol</source><year>2007</year><volume>34</volume><fpage>262</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17309597</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Matter</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Free gingival grafts for the treatment of gingival recession.
