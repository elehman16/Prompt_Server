Because of the desire to reduce setup errors to a negligible level, a wide range of commercialized immobilization devices have been designed. In prostate radiation therapy, variations in practice exist between different hospitals, ranging from the use of a simple device such as a leg immobilizer (LI) or thermoplastic shell, to a more sophisticated, multicomponent body-fix device. At the other end of the spectrum, others use invasive options such as endorectal balloons.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Several factors, such as ease of and time taken for setup, storage, and robustness, in addition to residual setup errors, are usually considered before clinical implementation of an immobilization device.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>In our center, we traditionally use a simple foam cushion LI (Civco Medical Solutions, IA) for positioning of prostate patients during radiation therapy. In 2011, Siow et&#x000a0;al reported interfraction mean setup errors of 0.1&#x000a0;mm (range, &#x02212;2.3 to 1.2), 0.1 mm (range, &#x02212;2.3 to 1.7) and 0.1 mm (range, &#x02212;1.3 to 1.5) in the right-left (x), anteroposterior (y), and superoinferior (z) directions, respectively, for 36 patients treated in our hospital between 2006 and 2008 using an empty bladder protocol and orthogonal imaging.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Since 2013, however, all prostate patients have been treated with a full bladder protocol because of the advantage of small bowel displacements and reduced gastrointestinal and genitourinary side effects. Additionally, their position is now verified using daily 3-dimensional cone beam computed tomography (CBCT).</p><p>Recently, our department has placed more emphasis on the accuracy and consistency of the treatment setup position because of our interest in the use of hypofractionation and dose escalation for prostate radiation therapy. The application of real-time imaging using the 4-dimensional (4D) Clarity transperineal ultrasound (TPUS) system (Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden) to monitor prostate motion during treatment has become increasingly popular in the literature, with reliable system accuracy and potential in achieving better treatment outcomes.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> More recently, Trivedi et&#x000a0;al has further demonstrated the capability of the Clarity TPUS system in achieving comparable accuracy compared with the fiducial-based CT localization of the prostate gland.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Before adopting this system, however, radiation therapists (RTs) needed to implement a more elaborate immobilization device for separating the patients' legs to facilitate the positioning of the ultrasound probe. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to evaluate the usability of the Clarity Immobilization System (CIS) from the perspective of patients and the RTs. This study aims to investigate the level of comfort and stability of treatment position using CIS as perceived by patients. More importantly, the interfraction setup errors between the 2 immobilization devices (LI vs CIS) will be compared and RT perspectives on the handling, storage, and cleaning will be assessed.</p><sec id="sec1.1"><title>Methods and materials</title><p>This was a prospective, nonrandomized study to compare treatment setup between 2 immobilizing devices. Ethics approval was obtained from the SingHealth Centralised Institutional Review Board in November 2014, and informed consent was obtained from each participant. The study is registered on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical trial registry (ID: NCT02408497). From March 2015, this study enrolled 111 patients who were treated in 2 groups (55 patients in the intervention group and 56 in the control group) for 12 months. All patients were prescribed radical volumetric modulated arc therapy (74 Gy in 37 fractions) to the prostate (&#x000b1;seminal vesicles and pelvic nodes). Patients treated in the intervention group were part of an ongoing prospective study to evaluate the use of real-time tracking of the target volume in prostate radiation therapy using the noninvasive Clarity TPUS system. Patients in the intervention group were immobilized with the CIS, and patients in the control group were immobilized with the LI, which is used traditionally in the department (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Patients immobilized with the CIS were treated with the TPUS probe in place. The TPUS probe position was guided and reproduced daily by an optical camera that detected the fiducial markers mounted on the probe. The setup and placement of the TPUS probe was completed by the same group of trained RTs throughout the study. Exclusion criteria included postprostatectomy and stereotactic body radiation therapy prostate cases.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Illustrates the leg immobilizer (left) and Clarity Immobilization System (right) used in the control and intervention groups, respectively.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="sec1.2"><title>Imaging protocol</title><p>Patients were instructed to follow a full bladder preparation protocol. After initially emptying their bladder 30 minutes before the radiation therapy session, patients were then required to drink 2 cups of water (400 mL). No specific bowel emptying protocol was given, but all patients were encouraged to evacuate their bowels before the treatment. Pretreatment CBCT images were acquired for all patients (115 kV, 80 mA; 15 ms) on a daily basis using the on-board imager, version 1.5, using a half-fan bowtie filter on a Varian Trilogy Linac (Varian Medical Systems, PA). Each CBCT contributed approximately 17.7 mGy imaging dose.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref></p><p>During online image registration, automatic matching within a region of interest was performed using the on-board imager bony matching algorithm. Bladder and rectal volumes (including rectal content) were visually assessed for consistency against the planning CT. Manual finetuning&#x000a0;based on soft-tissue coregistration was then completed by the RTs using a coned down region of interest including the prostate and seminal vesicles for coverage by the primary planning target volume. For large-field treatments including pelvic nodes, this manual registration was limited to maximum deviation of &#x02264;5 mm from the initial bony match to ensure nodal volume coverage. The 2 different immobilization devices were assessed based on the magnitude of daily interfraction CBCT-derived setup errors during prostate radiation therapy.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.3"><title>Patient and RT satisfaction survey</title><p>To investigate the comfort level of each setup position from the patients' perspective, a 2-question questionnaire using a 10-point visual analog scale (scale, 1-10) was administered once per week to both patient groups (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Appendix E1</xref>, available as supplementary material online only at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.practicalradon.org" id="intref0020">www.practicalradon.org</ext-link>). A 10-point rating scale was used because it contained multiresponse points without the complication of words.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> The questionnaire was adapted from the validated questions previously used by Nutting et&#x000a0;al and Howlin et&#x000a0;al.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The shift toward a higher score would imply an increase in discomfort and lack of stability in position during treatment. The population mean (&#x003bc;) and standard deviation (&#x003c3;) score for each question will be reported.</p><p>Additionally, an evaluation of each device by the treating RTs was conducted using a visual analog scale and analyzed (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Appendix E2</xref>).

Similarly, overall ratings in terms of stability of the patients immobilized on the devices gathered 100% vs 57.7% as the LI is preferred over the CIS (3 missing data for the intervention group). <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table C2</xref> (in <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Appendix E3</xref>) summarizes the responses of the RTs' perceptions and evaluation about the overall stability of the immobilizer devices for both groups.<table-wrap id="tbl5" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>Summary of RTs perceptions and evaluation about immobilizer devices for both the control and intervention groups (LI&#x000a0;vs CIS)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Ease of handling</th><th>Ease of storage</th><th>Ease of cleaning</th><th>Achieving patient comfort</th><th>Ease of setup</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="6">Control group (n = 56)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Very easy (%)</td><td align="char">70.9</td><td align="char">69.1</td><td align="char">65.5</td><td align="char">54.5</td><td align="char">58.2</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Easy (%)</td><td align="char">29.1%</td><td align="char">30.9%</td><td align="char">34.5%</td><td align="char">45.5%</td><td align="char">41.8</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Difficult (%)</td><td align="char">0.0%</td><td align="char">0.0%</td><td align="char">0.0%</td><td align="char">0.0%</td><td align="char">0.0</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Very difficult (%)</td><td align="char">0.0%</td><td align="char">0.0%</td><td align="char">0.0%</td><td align="char">0.0%</td><td align="char">0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Missing (n)</td><td align="char">1</td><td align="char">1</td><td align="char">1</td><td align="char">1</td><td align="char">1</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Very easy + easy (%)</td><td align="char">100.0</td><td align="char">100.0</td><td align="char">100.0</td><td align="char">100.0</td><td align="char">100.0</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Difficult + very difficult (%)</td><td align="char">0.0</td><td align="char">0.0</td><td align="char">0.0</td><td align="char">0.0</td><td align="char">0.0</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6">Intervention group (n = 55)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Very easy (%)</td><td align="char">20.4</td><td align="char">14.8</td><td align="char">20.4</td><td align="char">9.3</td><td align="char">16.7</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Easy (%)</td><td align="char">33.3</td><td align="char">46.3</td><td align="char">44.4</td><td align="char">51.9</td><td align="char">35.2</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Difficult (%)</td><td align="char">42.6</td><td align="char">38.9</td><td align="char">35.2</td><td align="char">33.3</td><td align="char">42.6</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Very difficult (%)</td><td align="char">3.7</td><td align="char">0.0</td><td align="char">0.0</td><td align="char">5.6</td><td align="char">5.6</td></tr><tr><td>Missing (n)</td><td align="char">1</td><td align="char">1</td><td align="char">1</td><td align="char">1</td><td align="char">1</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Very easy + easy (%)</td><td align="char">53.7</td><td align="char">61.1</td><td align="char">64.8</td><td align="char">61.1</td><td align="char">51.9</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Difficult + very difficult (%)</td><td align="char">46.3</td><td align="char">38.9</td><td align="char">35.2</td><td align="char">38.9</td><td align="char">48.1</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>Of the 55 RT questionnaires in the intervention group, there were 32 positive and 38 negative comments about the CIS, compared with 28 positive and 4 negative comments about the LI. The comments were categorized into themes with some comments contributing in different themes. Positive comments in the intervention group included &#x0201c;easy to use and stable&#x0201d; (43.8%) and &#x0201c;legs were well rested on knee rest&#x0201d; (21.7%). Negative comments were categorized into 2 main themes: &#x0201c;heavy&#x0201d; (55.3%) and &#x0201c;knee rest was not indexed and reproducibility issue&#x0201d; (47.4%). On the other hand, positive comments in the control group were categorized into 2 main themes: &#x0201c;easy to use and stable&#x0201d; (89.3%) and &#x0201c;lightweight&#x0201d; (21.4%). All the negative comments captured in the control group can be represented in a single theme; &#x0201c;LI not indexed and reproducibility issue.&#x0201d;</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="sec3.1"><title>Interfraction setup shifts</title><p>This study found that the CIS is a stable immobilization device for daily treatment positioning and is able to achieve high reproducibility compared with the LI. It was also notable that the population overall &#x003bc; interfraction setup errors in the z-plane (ie, superoinferior) were relatively smaller compared with the LI.</p><p>These findings were in agreement with the previous paper by Palombarini et&#x000a0;al,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> who reported mean interfraction prostate motion to be 2.7 mm (&#x000b1;0.7 mm) in the anteroposterior direction and &#x0003c;1-mm shifts in the lateral and superoinferior directions. From the comparison of the CBCT-derived setup shifts between the 2 groups of patients, it is apparent that the intervention group has achieved an acceptable stability and demonstrated reliability in prostate treatment setup. The results of the improved reproducibility in the superoinferior plane for the intervention group that used the CIS may be attributed to the placement of the TPUS probe at the perineum (indexed on the autoscan probe kit), which potentially restricted motion in the longitudinal plane during daily treatment setup.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>Patients' perspectives</title><p>All patients reported a favorable experience with the use of the CIS in terms of comfort level and their ability to maintain position during treatment. Most important, the comfort level and satisfaction of this new device was not inferior to the traditional LI. The high level of acceptance of the CIS by the patients also postulates that the patients are receptive toward the application of the TPUS probe during treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>RTs' perspectives</title><p>There were mixed responses among the RTs, with 55.3% of the negative comments highlighting that the CIS was &#x0201c;heavy and bulky&#x0201d; to handle or transfer (especially for female RTs). In addition, 18 (47.4%) negative comments commented that the CIS made it &#x0201c;difficult to reproduce&#x0201d; the knee rest position on the autoscan probe kit because of a lack of indexing and was &#x0201c;difficult to use,&#x0201d; compared with only 4 negative comments related to the LI. Despite that, 43.8% of the positive responses from the RTs in the intervention group perceived that the device was &#x0201c;easy to clean and set up&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;benefits the US workflow&#x0201d; by allowing more accurate treatment delivery (ie, considering the intrafraction tracking capability). A&#x000a0;further 21.9% of the positive comments indicated that the knee rest may be more comfortable because patients' legs were slightly bent. Nonetheless, the weight and bulkiness of the CIS was 1 of the main issues elicited from the RT evaluation. On the other hand, 89.3% of the positive comments in the control group found that the LI was &#x0201c;easy to use&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;stable&#x0201d; and 21.4% commented the LI was &#x0201c;lightweight.&#x0201d; Interestingly, both groups captured negative comments about the potential difficulty of reproducing the leg position because of the lack of indexing for both the LI and knee rest on the CIS.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><title>Summary of advantages and disadvantages and future research</title><p>Considerations before the introduction of a new immobilization device are multifaceted. In our investigation, we reported high acceptability of the CIS compared with the LI by patients in terms of comfort level and perception of stability of the device. <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table C3</xref> (in <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Appendix E3</xref>) summarizes the overall advantages and disadvantages of using the CIS. Although the RTs preferred the LI, the superior setup results indicate that the CIS has a clinical application. To overcome the apparent negativity expressed by RTs toward the CIS, and to minimize occupation safety risk with handling bulky devices, workflow processes should be reviewed and feedback provided to the Clarity manufacturer.</p><p>Now that the acceptability of using CIS has been established, future work will focus on analyzing the potential planning target volume margin reductions achievable, particularly in the superoinferior direction, when using the real-time tracking capability of the CIS instead of daily CBCT for pretreatment setup corrections. Additional work is also under way to analyze and evaluate the most important capability of the Clarity 4D TPUS, intrafraction tracking, with a view to publishing these works in the near future.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The CIS demonstrated stability and reproducibility in prostate treatment setup comparable to the use of LI. Patients were receptive to its use during treatment; however, RTs indicated their preference for the LI over the CIS mainly because of its weight and bulkiness.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list
