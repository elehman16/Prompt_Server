Large-for-gestational-age infants to mothers with diabetes are at increased risk for birth trauma, transient tachypnea, and neonatal hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), and maternal diabetes in pregnancy is associated with later-life morbidity in the offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The major barrier in the strive for strict maternal glycemic control is the risk of severe hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), occurring up to five times more frequently in early pregnancy than in the period prior to pregnancy in women with type 1 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>Real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) measures interstitial glucose in an ongoing fashion and offers the possibility of hyper- and hypoglycemic alarms. Studies of nonpregnant patients with type 1 diabetes indicate that real-time CGM lowers HbA<sub>1c</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) and may reduce the tendency to biochemical hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).

A randomized controlled trial evaluating intermittent use of a previous CGM system (not real-time) on top of routine pregnancy care reported improved glycemic control and a reduced risk of large-for-gestational-age infants in the intervention arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Against this background, it is tempting to suggest that women with pregestational diabetes would benefit even more from the use of real-time CGM in pregnancy.</p><p>In this investigator-driven trial, we therefore aimed to assess whether intermittent real-time CGM, as part of routine pregnancy care, could improve maternal glycemic control and pregnancy outcome in an unselected cohort of women with pregestational type 1 or type 2 diabetes.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Patients</title><p>During the study period of 15 February 2009 to 15 February 2011, all Danish-speaking pregnant women with pregestational diabetes referred to the Center for Pregnant Women with Diabetes, Rigshospitalet, before 14 completed gestational weeks with one living intrauterine fetus (<italic>n</italic> = 222), were offered participation in the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Patients were referred from the Capital Region of Denmark and Region Zealand, covering 2.4 million inhabitants. Exclusion criteria were present use of real-time CGM (<italic>n</italic> = 7), severe mental or psychiatric barriers (<italic>n</italic> = 4), diabetic nephropathy (<italic>n</italic> = 3), or severe concurrent comorbidity (one with severe psoriasis and two with previous gastric bypass surgery). If a woman had more than one pregnancy in the study period (<italic>n</italic> = 4), the woman was only offered inclusion at first referral. Among eligible patients, a total of 123 (79%) women with type 1 diabetes and 31 (67%) women with type 2 diabetes were accepted to take part in the study, of whom 79 (51%) women were randomized to intermittent use of real-time CGM in pregnancy in addition to routine pregnancy care (see below). The major reason for rejecting participation was the possibility of real-time CGM allocation.</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Progression of women through the trial. (A high-quality color representation of this figure is available in the online issue.)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1877fig1"/></fig><p>The research protocol was approved by the Danish National Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics and the Danish Data Protection Agency. All eligible women were invited at first pregnancy visit. They were offered time to think it through, often with their partner, before accepting participation. Most women gave written informed consent, were randomized, and had allocated intervention initiated later the same day and at the latest before 14 completed weeks. Many women had been informed about the running of the trial beforehand by their local diabetologists, who had all received written information. Information about medications and pregnancy complications was drawn from the hospital maternity records.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Management of diabetes in pregnancy</title><p>All women in both study arms followed the routine pregnancy care program for pregestational diabetes with antenatal visits at our clinic at 8, 12, 21, 27, and 33 gestational weeks. Self-monitored plasma glucose measurements were recommended seven times daily (before and 1.5 h after each main meal and at bedtime), and diet and insulin doses were adjusted by the women themselves every third day and in collaboration with an experienced diabetologist every second week. Treatment goals for self-monitored plasma glucose values were 4.0&#x02013;6.0 mmol/L preprandially, 4.0&#x02013;8.0 mmol/L 1.5 h postprandially, and 6.0&#x02013;8.0 mmol/L prebedtime. At single-standing preprandial self-monitored plasma glucose values &#x0003e;8.0 and &#x0003e;10.0 mmol/L, supplementary rapid-acting insulin was recommended (1&#x02013;2 and 2&#x02013;4 insulin units in the first half of pregnancy and thereafter 2&#x02013;4 and 4&#x02013;6 insulin units, respectively). At self-monitored plasma glucose values &#x0003c;4.0 mmol/L and/or mild hypoglycemia (see below), supplementary carbohydrate intake of &#x0223c;20 g was recommended. For HbA<sub>1c</sub>, the aim was &#x0003c;5.6% (38 mmol/mol) after 20 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). HbA<sub>1c</sub> was measured on a DCA 2000 analyzer by a latex immunoagglutination inhibition method (DCA 2000; Bayer, Mishawaka, IN). Blood pressure was measured as formerly described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), and if &#x0003e;135/85 mmHg, treatment was initiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Elevated urine albumin excretion was defined as albumin-to-creatinine ratio &#x02265;30 mg/mmol in a random urine sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Diabetic retinopathy was diagnosed with retinal photos at first pregnancy visit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Obstetrical ultrasound scanning was performed at all five routine visits and when indicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). At first pregnancy visit, all women had a dietitian appointment for individual dietary planning following national guidelines for diabetes diet. Carbohydrate counting was mainly used in women on insulin pumps, and specific recording of dietary data was not performed. Women with BMI &#x0003c;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were advised to gain 10&#x02013;15 kg in pregnancy, whereas women with BMI &#x0003e;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were advised to stay weight-neutral in the first half of pregnancy and thereafter to limit weight gain to 5 kg. All women visited our clinic and/or their local diabetes clinic at &#x0223c;2-week intervals throughout pregnancy, at which time HbA<sub>1c</sub>, blood pressure, weight, and urine examination were registered.</p><p>Twenty-seven (22%) women with type 1 diabetes were on insulin pump therapy (mainly initiated before pregnancy) with rapid-acting insulin analogs. Most of these women used insulin pumps that could be connected to the prescribed real-time CGM system. The majority were using the bolus calculator, but they did not have the possibility of low glucose suspend. Women with type 1 diabetes on multiple daily injections were treated with rapid- and long-acting insulin analogs (<italic>n</italic> = 66), rapid-acting insulin analogs with intermediate NPH insulin (<italic>n</italic> = 19), human short-acting and intermediate NPH insulin (<italic>n</italic> = 9), or human short-acting insulin and long-acting insulin analog (<italic>n</italic> = 2). All but one of 31 women with type 2 diabetes received insulin therapy in pregnancy with insulin aspart mix (<italic>n</italic> = 14), intermediate NPH insulin combined with rapid-acting insulin analog or human short-acting insulin (<italic>n</italic> = 12), or solely intermediate NPH insulin (<italic>n</italic> = 3) or rapid-acting insulin analog (<italic>n</italic> = 1). Patients were recommended to administer rapid-acting insulin shortly before meals throughout pregnancy. During labor and delivery, intravenous glucose infusion was given, and if indicated, insulin was administered subcutaneously. Self-monitored plasma glucose measurements were performed hourly, aiming for plasma glucose levels of 4.0&#x02013;7.0 mmol/L.</p><p>For study purpose, participants were asked to perform eight daily self-monitored plasma glucose measurements for 6 days, including measurements at 3 <sc>a.m.,</sc> at study visits at 8, 12, 21, 27, and 33 weeks. Registration of self-monitored plasma glucose values for study purpose was handled as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). All women were offered free use of a blood glucose meter with corresponding test strips (Contour; Bayer, Wakimachi, Japan). Results on HbA<sub>1c</sub> and insulin doses were obtained at all five study visits and shortly before delivery at median 36 (range 29&#x02013;39) weeks. Mild hypoglycemia was defined as events familiar to the patient as hypoglycemia and managed by the patient, whereas severe hypoglycemia was defined as self-reported events with symptoms of hypoglycemia requiring help from another person to actively administer oral carbohydrate or injection of glucose or glucagon in order to restore normal blood glucose level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Information on mild and severe hypoglycemic events was obtained in detailed questionnaires and structured interviews at all study visits and shortly after delivery, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Other medications</title><p>During the study period, 30 women received antihypertensive treatment, mainly methyldopa (<italic>n</italic> = 27). Eight women were treated with antidepressive medicine&#x02014;six of them with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Thyroid dysfunction was treated in 32 women with levothyroxine (<italic>n</italic> = 29), thiamazole (<italic>n</italic> = 2), or propylthiouracil (<italic>n</italic> = 1), resulting in normal thyroid function in all women.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Randomization</title><p>A computer-generated randomization program was used and treatment allocation was properly concealed using automated telephone allocation service (Paravox) provided by an independent organization. Participants were stratified according to type of diabetes. Trained research personnel (A.L.S. or project nurse) provided the women with their arm allocation.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Intervention</title><p>Participants in the intervention arm were offered intermittent real-time CGM (Guardian Real-time Continuous Glucose Monitoring System with the Sof-Sensor; Medtronic Minimed, Northridge, CA) for 6 days at the first pregnancy visit at 8 weeks and at 12, 21, 27 and 33 weeks, on top of routine pregnancy care. The women were encouraged to use real-time CGM continuously, especially in cases of hypoglycemia unawareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Real-time CGM was free of charge regardless of number of monitoring periods. A small number of women were only willing to use real-time CGM for 3 days per monitoring period, which was accepted. Blinded real-time CGM was not performed in the control arm.</p><p>At the first pregnancy visit, women were allocated to intervention in which they were educated in sensor insertion and the maintenance of the system on a one-to-one basis for 1 to 2 h by a trained diabetes caregiver (A.L.S. or one of two project nurses) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). They were instructed to continue performing self-monitored plasma glucose measurements as recommended and to verify the accuracy of real-time CGM glucose values with self-monitored plasma glucose measurement before making management decisions. At real-time CGM alarms with subsequent plasma glucose &#x0003c;4.0 mmol/L, the women were advised to supplement carbohydrate intake. Real-time CGM alarms for hyperglycemia were tackled on an individual basis, including physical exercise like walking or supplementary rapid-acting insulin. All women received a scheduled phone call the day after initial sensor insertion. Patients were encouraged to contact the clinic at any time and were offered visits on weekdays other than those planned if convenient. The majority of the women preferred to have the sensor inserted in the abdominal skin, but in late pregnancy, during labor or caesarean section, some patients chose to insert the sensor in the upper arm. At enrollment, all women were advised to set the hypoglycemic alarm (mainly at 3.5 mmol/L) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). In order to limit excessive alarms, it was in general recommended that patients deactivate the alarm for hyperglycemia, but the alarm was sometimes set at the patient&#x02019;s request (mainly at 10.0 mmol/L) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Throughout pregnancy, alarm limits were flexible, and patients were supported in individual alarm settings. Shortly after each monitoring period, downloaded real-time CGM data were printed out, with hard copies given to both the participants and health professionals. Each real-time CGM reading was discussed with a diabetes caregiver (mainly A.L.S., H.U.A., and E.R.M.) using locally developed guidelines on how to interpret real-time CGM readings in pregnancy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-2360/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link>). The primary focus was glycemic trends during nighttime with emphasis on the prevention of hypoglycemia. Thereafter, hypoglycemia and pre- and postprandial glucose values during the daytime were evaluated, aiming for glucose values between 4.0 and 8.0 mmol/L. Therapeutic adjustments in diet, exercise, and insulin doses were primarily based on self-monitored plasma glucose values, in combination with real-time CGM data. The prescribed device was the only real-time CGM system available at the Danish market during study preparation.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Pregnancy outcome parameters</title><p>The prevalence of large-for-gestational-age infants [i.e., infant birth weight &#x02265;90th centile adjusted for sex and gestational age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>)] was predefined as the primary outcome of this study. To reflect neonatal morbidity, the prevalence of preterm delivery (&#x0003c;37 weeks of gestation) and/or severe neonatal hypoglycemia (2-h plasma glucose &#x0003c;2.5 mmol/L treated with intravenous glucose infusion) was selected as the secondary combined end point prior to study onset. Other pregnancy outcomes were defined as follows: miscarriage (before 22 weeks), preeclampsia [blood pressure &#x02265;140/90 and proteinuria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>)], birth weight SD score (z-score), neonatal hypoglycemia (2-h plasma glucose &#x0003c;2.5 mmol/L), and major congenital malformation (i.e., abnormality requiring surgery and/or resulting in permanent injury).</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Sample size</title><p>Based on the assumption that the prevalence of large-for-gestational-age infants was 50% in our study population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) and that the use of real-time CGM could reduce it to 20%, and a type 1 error of 5% and a type 2 error of 20%, the number of patients needed in each arm was 45. We intended to analyze predefined primary and secondary outcome parameters of women receiving intervention versus control subjects in the entire study population, as well as in the subpopulation of women with type 1 diabetes. To secure sufficient numbers, a 2-year inclusion period was planned. The study population of 154 women (of whom 123 had type 1 diabetes) was therefore judged to have sufficient power to detect a possible effect of real-time CGM on the prevalence of large-for-gestational-age infants in the entire study population, as well as in women with type 1 diabetes alone.</p></sec><sec id="s9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We compared the characteristics of the women using the Fisher exact test or &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test when appropriate for categorical variables and <italic>t</italic> test or Mann&#x02013;Whitney test when appropriate for continuous variables. Continuous variables were given as median (range), and categorical variables were given as numbers (percentage). A two-sided <italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis, counting 154 subjects at baseline, and thereafter with the exclusion of women with miscarriages (<italic>n</italic> = 5). We primarily analyzed data as planned by comparing women allocated to real-time CGM with control subjects in the entire study population and in women with type 1 diabetes alone. We also analyzed the prevalence of severe hypoglycemia and main outcome parameters in women using real-time CGM per protocol, and despite limited numbers, we analyzed glycemic control and pregnancy outcomes in women with type 2 diabetes and the prevalence of large-for-gestational-age infants in women with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy. Six infants were excluded from calculations on neonatal hypoglycemia because of intravenous glucose infusion prior to routine 2-h plasma glucose measurements (<italic>n</italic> = 5) or perinatal death (<italic>n</italic> = 1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-2360/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 3</ext-link>).

These findings are disappointing in the light of real-time CGM efficiency in nonpregnant patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). However, participants in trials demonstrating an effect on HbA<sub>1c</sub> in both nonpregnant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) and pregnant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) populations had higher baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> compared our cohort of women. The negative findings of this trial are in line with a study on well-controlled nonpregnant patients, in whom HbA<sub>1c</sub> was not further improved by real-time CGM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Recent data indicate the importance of frequent real-time CGM use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Our study was designed with intermittent real-time CGM use in relation to five routine antenatal visits at our clinic, but the women were encouraged to use real-time CGM continuously and offered much support and flexibility in scheduling to attain frequent real-time CGM use. Still, only very few women were willing to use real-time CGM continuously. Our aim was to improve our routine pregnancy care and therefore to intervene on an unselected cohort of women. The inclusion rate of 77% is comparable to that of Murphy et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), whereas studies on nonpregnant patients with improved HbA<sub>1c</sub> due to real-time CGM mainly cover selected and highly motivated patients, willing to use real-time CGM continuously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>In this trial, sufficient numbers of women were included, and proper allocation with equal distribution of women with type 1 diabetes was secured with computer-generated randomization provided by an independent organization. Study arms were comparable at baseline, both in the entire cohort and when analyzed according to type diabetes. We believe that our study design was robust, despite it not being blinded, and broadly comparable to that of Murphy et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), suggesting a beneficial effect of intermittent CGM in pregnancy.</p><p>Real-time CGM had been used for several years in our clinic, and we have previously published case reports suggesting beneficial effects of real-time CGM in pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Therefore, we had expected high compliance to real-time CGM in this trial. However, the relatively low number of per-protocol users has also been observed in the nonpregnant population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), and the average use of CGM was comparable to the former study on pregnant women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). We have previously published the results of a questionnaire on patient satisfaction with real-time CGM in early pregnancy based on the present population of women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). This survey demonstrated that real-time CGM inaccuracy compared with self-monitored plasma glucose values, technical challenges, and skin irritation limit compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), which is in line with previous studies of nonpregnant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) and pregnant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) patients. During the first period of real-time CGM, our women experienced up to 12 alarms per 24 h, of which one-third disturbed their sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Future development of the real-time CGM systems, leading to improved accuracy in the hypoglycemic range and fewer alarms, may improve compliance.</p><p>The main barrier in obtaining strict maternal glycemic control is the high risk of severe hypoglycemia, occurring in up to 45% of pregnant women with type 1 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). A reduction of severe hypoglycemic events due to real-time CGM has been suggested in a study of nonpregnant patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and in our case study of pregnant women with hypoglycemia unawareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Therefore, elimination of nocturnal hypoglycemic episodes was emphasized in our guidelines on the interpretation of real-time CGM readings in pregnancy. This may have lead to slightly higher nocturnal glucose levels and could at least partly explain the tendency toward higher birth weight z-score in the intervention arm. The self-monitored plasma glucose levels, which were mainly performed during daytime, and the number of women experiencing at least one severe hypoglycemic event after inclusion were similar in spite of real-time CGM allocation. However, among women with type 1 diabetes using real-time CGM per protocol, there was a tendency toward fewer women with severe hypoglycemia compared with women in the control arm, but numbers were low. Surprisingly, we could document severe hypoglycemic events during ongoing real-time CGM without hypoglycemic alarms to warn the patient. This again calls for improved real-time CGM accuracy in the hypoglycemic range and future studies on continuous real-time CGM in pregnant women at high risk of severe hypoglycemia. Whether a sum of imbalances including tendencies toward higher pregestational BMI, fewer smokers, and higher weight gain in pregnancy in women in the intervention arm could have affected birth weight z-score in this trial remains speculative.</p><p>The majority of the women with type 1 diabetes in this trial were on basal bolus therapy with multiple daily injections, but patients on insulin pumps may benefit more from real-time CGM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). However, not even in the subset of women treated with insulin pumps in this study was a tendency toward a beneficial effect on large-for-gestational-age infants seen.</p><p>In conclusion, our data do not support intermittent real-time CGM on a routine basis in an unselected pregnant population of women with pregestational diabetes, already performing self-monitored plasma glucose measurements seven times per day. Careful introduction to real-time CGM and interpretation of the real-time CGM readings were offered, but otherwise, the two arms were treated similarly regarding diet, exercise, and insulin therapy. The negative finding of this trial may lead to intensified focus on dietary advice, including carbohydrate counting, stable day-to-day carbohydrate intake, especially in late gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), and weight gain within the Institute of Medicine recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). This trial does not rule out that real-time CGM may be efficient in highly selected pregnant women, and whether introducing continuous real-time CGM prior to pregnancy can reduce the risk of severe hypoglycemia and enhance pregnancy outcome is yet to be examined.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
