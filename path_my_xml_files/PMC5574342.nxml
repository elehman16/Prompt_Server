exercise on changes Pulmonary Function and body mass index in female overweight subjects
in their 20&#x02019;s. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects were randomly assigned to the dance
music jump rope exercise group and the stationary cycle exercise group. All subjects have
conducted the exercises three times a week for four weeks. Pulmonary function was
evaluated using a spirometer, and body mass index was evaluated using an InBody 3.0.
[Results] The findings of this study showed significant improvements in the voluntary
capacity and body mass index of the experimental groups. Vital capacity was higher in the
music jump rope exercise group than the stationary cycle exercise group, and body mass
index was lower in the music jump rope exercise group than the stationary cycle exercise
group. [Conclusion] This study showed that the dance music jump rope exercise can be used
to improve vital capacity and body mass index.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Vital capacity</kwd><kwd>Dance music jump roping</kwd><kwd>Overweight</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Obesity, which refers to the condition of having an abnormally increased amount of fat in
the body, can cause adult diseases that result in decreased, decreased physical strength,
and decreased cardiopulmonary reserve function<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Generally, women have more fat than men and require a larger amount
of food to produce energy because women have fewer muscles, which consume energy<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, women are more vulnerable to
obesity than men because women undergo unique biological reactions related to changes in
hormones and to mental and environmental effects throughout their lives. Thus, the
proportion of obesity in women is more than twice that of men. Obesity is associated with
dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, and this association means that
obesity affects health in a variety of ways<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Diet and exercise therapies have been the main recommended treatments for obesity, and many
studies have been conducted to reduce or prevent obesity using these therapies. Among these
therapies, exercise therapy has been the safest and most economical method, and aerobic
exercise forms a large part of exercise therapies. Aerobic exercise has been reported to be
effective at improving the respiratory system and the blood lipid metabolism and at
preventing coronary heart disease<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Furthermore, pulmonary function has been significantly enhanced by increasing the amount of
oxygen in the respiratory muscles and the body through respiratory exercise, which requires
a large amount of oxygen because this exercise causes a rapid heart rate<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Among the aerobic exercises used to treat obesity, the most economical and widely used
exercise is jump rope. Jump rope is a personal exercise that can regulate exercise load and
increase physical activity according to a person&#x02019;s physical strength<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Music jump rope, which is a special type of jump rope, is a
group exercise that is performed with background music. Music jump rope is a coordinated
exercise that requires the movements of the hands and feet to be matched to the beat of
music, and this type of exercise enhances body control, such as agility, endurance,
quickness, and flexibility<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kang reported
that music jump rope decreased obesity in elementary students<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Oh and Kim showed that music jump rope improved the physical
strength of obese female students<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Since obesity has been recognized as a disease, aerobic exercise is essential for people in
modern society. The obesity rate has continued to increase due to the increasing prevalence
of sedentary lifestyles and westernized eating habits, and many studies have been conducted
to overcome the increasing occurrence of obesity. However, most studies have focused on the
obesity index, physical strength, and the constitutional effects of obesity, and studies on
the relationship between obesity and cardiorespiratory functions are still insufficient.
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the dynamic jump rope
exercise with the addition of fast tempo musical elements on the vital capacity (VC) and
body mass index (BMI) of college students in their 20s whose body fat percentage was higher
than normal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>For this study, 20 students whose body fat percentage qualified as overweight (fat
&#x0003e;25.0%) were selected among female college students attending N university in Cheonan,
Chungcheongnam-do between May 1 and May 31, 2016. Subjects who had pathological findings
(determined using a constitutional examination) other than being overweight (measured using
InBody 3.0) were excluded by means of medical inquiry and tests. The subjects understood the
purpose of this study and consented to participate in it. This study was approved by the
Clinical Bioethics Committee at Korea Nazarene University (KNU IRB 16-1021-03) and was
reviewed according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The general characteristics of the

Before participating in the program, the experimental group received adaptation training for
a day to become accustomed to the music-based exercise.</p><p>The control group performed a fixed cycle exercise using a stationary exercise cycle
(RECKTechnik GmbH &#x00026; Co., Betzenweiler, Germany) for 30 minutes per session in the
laboratory, and there were three sessions a week for four weeks. Before the experiment, the
experimenter checked each subject&#x02019;s resting heart rate using the radial artery at the right
wrist for 15 seconds, and four times the measured value was set as the subject&#x02019;s stable
heart rate. Each subject&#x02019;s heart rate was checked during each resting period, which occurred
at five-minute intervals after the start of the exercise. And to the speed was set below 2
kilometer per hour and the exercise intensity was adjusted not to exceed the subject&#x02019;s
resting heart rate by 20%. Then, a fixed cycle exercise was performed for 30 minutes<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Measurements were conducted using a spirometer (COSMED, SRL, Italy), which is a measuring
instrument used for pulmonary function tests, while each subject was in the sitting
position. The experimental group and the control group were instructed to use a mouthpiece,
and the subjects&#x02019; noses were closed during the measurement so that air could not be inhaled
or exhaled through the nose. Beginning from expiration, each subject was instructed to
breathe out slowly and completely and then breathe in slowly. Subjects&#x02019; VC was recorded<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The measurements were conducted three
times before and after the experiment, and the average values of the three measured values
were used in the analysis. A resting time of five minutes was given after each
measurement.</p><p>Each subject&#x02019;s body fat was measured using a body fat analyzer (InBody 3.0, Biovpace, USA).
The subjects placed their thumbs on the input part of each hand with their hands and stood
on the analyzer barefooted, and their body composition was measured by bioelectrical
impedance analysis. The subjects took an upright posture on the position indicated on the
measuring instrument with their arms and legs slightly open. They then held the electrode
handles with their hands and were measured according to the measurement order of the
instrument. The measurement time was set to 10 seconds or less.</p><p>In this study, SPSS ver. 16.0 was used to examine the general characteristics of the
subjects and to obtain the means and standard deviations of the individual groups. A paired
sample t-test was used to compare the subjects&#x02019; vital capacity and body mass index values
before and after the intervention, and the exercise and independent sample t-test was used
to examine the differences between the measurements taken before and after the experiment in
each group. A statistical significance level of 0.05 was chosen.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The experimental group showed significant change in VC and BMI before (p&#x0003c;0.05) and after

BMI in overweight female college students in their 20s. The music jump rope exercise adopted
in this study was based on the research by Sun et al., which showed that the exercise
significantly enhanced pulmonary function, strengthened the internal organs to activate
their functions, and increased oxygen consumption in the body by strengthening the
respiratory muscles<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. For pulmonary
functions, vital capacity was evaluated using a VC measuring instrument, and obesity was
evaluated by measuring each subject&#x02019;s BMI using a body composition analyzer.</p><p>Pulmonary function and BMI measurements were conducted four weeks after the experiment
concluded. The experimental group and control group showed significant differences in VC and
BMI. The music jump rope exercise improved the circulation of the cardiovascular system
through dynamic movements and strengthened deep breathing by activating the movement of the
respiratory muscles to improve the circulation of breathing. These physical activities
decreased the subjects&#x02019; obesity index by increasing their basic physical strength and
endurance.</p><p>In a previous study on pulmonary functions, Jang argued that the jump rope exercise had a
great effect on enhancing endurance by developing the cardiopulmonary functions<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kim and Kim showed that a 12-week music
jump rope exercise program resulted in significant differences in lung capacity, which is a
cardiopulmonary function<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Park et al.
reported that their subjects&#x02019; maximum oxygen uptake increased significantly after 12 weeks
of aerobic training<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. It contributed to
the improvement of cardiopulmonary functions by injecting more oxygen into active muscles
than respiratory muscles, thus increasing the ventilation and supplying the energy
source.</p><p>Furthermore, in a previous study on obesity, Choi reported significant decreases in body
fat percentage and fat mass in obese middle school girls after they completed a jump rope
exercise program<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Yang showed a
significant decrease in body weight and BMI after 12 weeks of music jump rope exercise<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the body fat percentage of obese
children showed statistically significant differences after they completed a music jump rope
program<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, Yu reported a
statistically significant difference in BMI, body fat mass, and body fat percentage, which
all indicate changes in body composition, after aerobic exercise in obese children<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. This change was attributed to the
decreased size of fat cells, which resulted from the diminished appetite that followed the
increasing amount of energy consumption from the aerobic exercise<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>These previous studies showed similar results in pulmonary function and BMI improvement to
those obtained in this study. Therefore, the results of this study suggest that music jump
rope exercise is effective for the improvement of pulmonary function and the decrease of
BMI, and this exercise can help reduce obesity and improve pulmonary function according to
their physical strength.</p><p>However, this study has some limitations: The research subjects included only women in
their twenties, and the experiment was implemented using only rapid dance music. In the
future, further studies that include subjects from diverse age groups and male subjects
should be conducted when using the research methods of this study.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by the Korean Nazarene University Research Grants 2017.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="ths"><person-group><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name></person-group>: An influence that an aerobic exercise has on fat in the blood a change of
