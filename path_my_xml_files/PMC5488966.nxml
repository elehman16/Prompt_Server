Generic markers of lipid peroxidation are increased in AD and reactive oxygen species have been suggested to be involved in the aetiology of cognitive decline. Carotenoids are depleted in AD serum, therefore we have compared serum lipid oxidation between AD and age-matched control subjects before and after carotenoid supplementation.

After six months of carotenoid intervention, serum POVPC was not different in AD patients compared to healthy controls. However, POVPC was significantly higher in control subjects after six months of carotenoid intervention compared to their baseline (p=0.03).

Many lipid hydroperoxides, including oxidised phospholipids (oxPLs), are considered to be biologically relevant lipid signalling molecules <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, oxPLs are usually low in abundance and pose some challenges in detection, identification and quantification <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. To address this, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) techniques are emerging for reliable detection and quantification of wide range of oxPLs <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Lipidomics, a robust method for lipid analysis, has been defined as the characterisation of lipids in biological systems <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Oxidative lipidomic techniques offer sensitive and specific methods for high throughput analyses of oxPLs <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> such as 1-palmitoyl-2-(5&#x02032;-oxo-valeroyl)-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POVPC) and fatty acid oxidation, such as 8-iso-PGF2a (IsoP) <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. POVPC is a truncated oxidation product of 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-phosphatidylcholine (PAPC); and IsoP belongs to the prostaglandin family that is formed by free radical peroxidation of arachidonic acid in membrane lipids. IsoP is a relatively stable peroxidation product compared to many other short lived species <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. POVPC and IsoP are considered as biomarkers of oxidative stress <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Oxidative stress has been defined as the imbalance between the pro-oxidant and antioxidant status favouring the pro-oxidant state <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Ferric reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP; the ferric reducing ability of the serum and a measure of total antioxidant capacity) has been reported to be lower in AD patients compared to healthy controls <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Carotenoids are naturally occurring plant pigments, some of which have antioxidant properties <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Higher plasma carotenoid concentrations are associated with reduced risk of developing chronic disease <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. They are lipid soluble, are transported principally by lipoproteins and can be broadly classified as either oxygenated xanthophylls or non-oxygenated carotenes <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Several authors have shown a significantly lower serum concentration of carotenoids (lutein, zeaxanthin and meso-zeaxanthin) in AD subjects <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> which can be increased after 6 months of supplementation with carotenoids <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>Therefore, we have investigated the hypothesis that POVPC is a modifiable marker of AD that relates to cognitive performance.

Samples for this study were part of a randomised double-blind clinical trial investigating the effect of macular carotenoid supplementation on macular pigment (MP), vision and cognitive function in patients with AD versus control subjects. Patients with mild to moderate AD attending the Age-Related Care Unit at Waterford University Hospital Ireland and healthy control subjects with the same age range were recruited via the media. Mild to moderate AD was defined as an average Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 14&#x02013;24, with some alteration in behaviour as well as difficulties in carrying out day-to-day tasks. Cognitive function was assessed with different cognition tests which includes a semantic fluency score using &#x02018;Animal&#x02019; category (as many examples in one minute), and a phonemic fluency score using the &#x02018;FAS&#x02019; test (as many words starting with letters F, A and S, one minute per letter). Full details of the patient demography and health, study design and methodology have been previously reported <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. AD subjects and healthy controls were supplemented with either 10&#x000a0;mg meso-zeaxanthin, 10&#x000a0;mg lutein, 2&#x000a0;mg zeaxanthin in sunflower oil daily or placebo (sunflower oil) for six months (double-blinded). The carotenoid and placebo supplements were identical in external appearance (gel capsules) and composition (sunflower oil with or without carotenoids) and were therefore indistinguishable from each other. Patients who were taking carotenoid supplements or had taken a supplement in the previous 12&#x000a0;months were excluded from the study. Other screening tests used for eligibility included the clock drawing test and semantic fluency score.

POVPC, a truncated oxidation product of PAPC (1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-phosphatidylcholine), has been identified in vivo as an important oxidised phospholipid <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. We developed a reproducible and sensitive method for quantitative analysis of POVPC by LC-MS/MS. LC-MS/MS has been reported to be the best choice for the assay of different oxPLs <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and we achieved sensitivity to detect POVPC from 10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l serum using a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method. At present, the lack of specific oxidised phospholipid standards limits absolute quantification of some analytes such as POVPC by MS, however, relative quantitation can be achieved accurately. Using this approach, we have shown here for the first time that the level of oxPL, POVPC, is two-fold higher in serum from AD patients compared with age-matched healthy control subjects.</p><p>The MTBE lipid extraction method used for lipid extraction in this study allows faster and cleaner lipid recovery and is suitable for lipidomics. We adapted the sample preparation described by Matyash et al. <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> to extract, recover and preserve the phospholipid content without oxidation. Serum lipids were recovered into the upper MTBE phase of the 2-phase solvent system while non-extractable matrix were in the aqueous phase retained at the bottom of the extraction vial. Hence, the MTBE organic phase enriched with lipids is easily accessible by micropipette from above without contamination. We demonstrated the effective recovery of oxPL in serum samples of AD patients and control subjects using the MTBE method.</p><p>We were interested to understand whether POVPC was related to cognition. We used the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), &#x02018;Animal&#x02019; semantic fluency (SVF) and &#x02018;F A S&#x02019; phonemic fluency scores as the clinical parameters for scoring cognitive performance in AD and to measure the effect of carotenoid supplementation on cognitive impairment (see <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>). These parameters were significantly higher in healthy controls compared to AD subjects with MMSE score correlating with higher levels of oxPL. Pharmacological treatment with cholinesterase inhibitor has no effect on POVPC level in AD patients. There were no significant differences observed in the SVF and FAS scores of control subjects or AD patients after supplementation compared to their baseline readings. The present study has identified an inverse correlation between POVPC and cognitive function in AD. These findings are consistent with our earlier observation of an increase in plasma LDL protein carbonyls that correlated inversely with MMSE in AD. We also demonstrated that plasma malondialdehyde concentration was not different but that LDL oxidation in AD plasma was higher than in LDL from age-matched control subjects <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> i.e. different oxidative biomarkers are inversely correlated with cognitive function in two independent dementia populations.</p><p>The higher levels of POVPC and lower antioxidant potential, FRAP, that we measured here in AD subjects compared to their age-matched controls support the existing evidence for increased systemic oxidative damage to macromolecules in AD <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The FRAP, POVPC level and IsoP concentration in AD patients' serum was unchanged after six months of carotenoid intervention using 10&#x000a0;mg meso-zeaxanthin;10&#x000a0;mg lutein; 2&#x000a0;mg zeaxanthin. However, in control subjects a significant increase in POVPC level but not IsoP concentration was observed after six months of carotenoid intervention. Several antioxidants, e.g. vitamin C, may also act as pro-oxidants at high concentrations and there remains an optimal antioxidant concentration in serum to maintain reducing activity. We are not sure if this is responsible for the high levels of POVPC and lack of change to FRAP in the control subjects after carotenoid supplementation but we expected supplementation with macular carotenoids to benefit AD patients by reducing POVPC level and increasing FRAP based on evidence of clinical improvement in vision after using the same supplement (see&#x000a0;<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>). It was shown previously that carotenoids have contrasting effects on rates of peroxidation that relate to interaction with membrane lipids. Using x-ray diffraction studies, lutein and zeaxanthin have been shown to alter phospholipid acyl chain organisation which correlated with lipid peroxidation <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. However, astaxanthin did not modify the phospholipid structure in the membrane and it was an antioxidant <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. FRAP analysis did not detect an increase in total antioxidant potential on supplementation, suggesting that carotenoid supplements do not contribute significantly to serum antioxidant activity and therefore are not likely to have direct effects on oxidative stress in this AD population.</p><p>There are ~20 different carotenoids in human plasma with lycopene, &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-carotene, zeaxanthin, lutein and &#x003b2;-cryptoxanthin being the most abundant. AD patients have low plasma carotenoid concentrations and recent evidence has shown that AD is more prevalent in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This led to the hypothesis that dietary supplementation with macular carotenoids may delay progression of both AMD and AD. While 10&#x000a0;mg meso-zeaxanthin;10&#x000a0;mg lutein; 2&#x000a0;mg zeaxanthin supplementation increases total serum carotenoid concentrations in AD (22), it has not led to any change in AD serum POVPC level, FRAP or improvement in cognitive performance. One potential explanation is that those foods which are enriched in carotenoids may deliver additional essential phytonutrients that are not included in the supplement formulation; the serum carotenoid concentrations used here may be a correlate of lower nutrient intake rather than act an important bioactive for reducing phospholipid oxidation. Fruits and vegetables are the best dietary sources of protective phytochemicals and antioxidants <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Additional phytochemicals such as astaxanthin may either reduce the formation of POVPC directly or may operate in synergy with the carotenoid supplement constituents 10&#x000a0;mg meso-zeaxanthin;10&#x000a0;mg lutein; 2&#x000a0;mg zeaxanthin as chain breaking antioxidants.

Using this information to calculate power using G*Power <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, a total sample size of 102 (51 patients and 51 healthy controls) is required to attain a power of 80% with p&#x0003c;0.05. We will be validating our findings in a larger cohort that has commenced on Macushield&#x02122; with participants who have mild dementia and who are treated for longer than six months.</p><p>Our study contributes to a growing body of research that highlights oxPLs as biomarkers of human pathologies. OxPLs are widely reported to be inflammatory through engagement with Toll-like receptors on macrophages and activation of the inflammasome <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Others have reported that oxidised lipids including POVPC can affect microvascular endothelial barrier function and are therefore likely to impair the functions of the blood brain barrier <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. We have previously shown that oxidised lipids can increase amyloid production by neuronal cells <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. It remains to be determined whether OxPL such as POVPC are important in the pathway to disease development and are effective biomarkers of early disease and mild cognitive impairment.</p></sec><sec id="s0135"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have described a reliable and sensitive MS method to measure POVPC that has been employed successfully to analyse peroxidative damage to phospholipids in serum. Using this method, the peroxidised phospholipid POVPC was found to be higher in AD patients and was correlated with cognitive performance. In our study of 37 subjects, supplementation with carotenoids (10&#x000a0;mg meso-zeaxanthin, 10&#x000a0;mg lutein, 2&#x000a0;mg zeaxanthin) for six months in AD had no effect on patients&#x02019; cognitive performance or serum POVPC level.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibliog0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Simoncini</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Orsucci</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Caldarazzo Ienco</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Siciliano</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bonuccelli</surname><given-names>U.</given-names></name><name><surname>Mancuso</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Alzheimer's pathogenesis and its link to the mitochondrion</article-title><source>Oxid.
