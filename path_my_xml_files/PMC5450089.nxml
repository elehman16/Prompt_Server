Only a few studies have investigated how everyday life is affected by PE, although many patients are negatively affected both physically and emotionally after hospital discharge. Currently, no documented rehabilitation options are available for these patients. We aim to examine whether an 8-week home-based exercise intervention can influence physical capacity, quality of life, sick leave, and use of psychotropic drugs in patients medically treated for PE.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>One hundred forty patients with incident first-time PE will be recruited in five hospitals. After inclusion, patients will be randomly allocated to either the control group, receiving usual care, or the intervention group, who will be exposed to an 8-week home-based exercise program in addition to usual care. The intervention includes an initial individual exercise planning session with a physiotherapist, leading to a recommended exercise program of a minimum of three weekly training sessions of 30&#x02013;60 minutes&#x02019; duration. The patients have regular telephone contact with the physiotherapist during the 8-week program. At the time of inclusion, after 2&#x000a0;months, and after 6&#x000a0;months, the patients&#x02019; physical capacity is measured using the Incremental Shuttle Walk test. Furthermore the patients&#x02019; quality of life, sick leave, and use of psychotropic drugs is measured using self-reported questionnaires. In both randomization arms, all follow-up measurements and visits will take place at the hospital from which the patient was discharged. Levels of eligibility, consent, adherence, and retention will be used as indicators of study feasibility.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We expect that the home-based exercise program will improve the physical capacity and quality of life for the patients in the intervention group. The study will furthermore contribute significantly to the limited knowledge about the optimal rehabilitation of PE patients, and may thereby form the basis of future recommendations in this field.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02684721">NCT02684721</ext-link>.

In Northern Europe, there is an estimated incidence of about 100 per 100,000 person-years, with incidence rates increasing with age for both genders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The 30-day mortality is reported to be as high as 10&#x02013;30%, depending on the size and localization of the thrombosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These numbers correspond well with incidence and mortality rates reported in Denmark, the 2012 incidence of PE being 90 and 100 per 100,000 for women and men, respectively, accumulating to a total of 2779 incidents in 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. For those who survive a PE event, physical wellbeing and quality of life are significantly reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and it has furthermore been found that younger patients have a significantly higher use of psychotropic drugs up to 5&#x000a0;years after their PE event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In Denmark, the typical patient pathway following discharge after acute PE does not address these negative consequences of PE, as health care contact is limited to a few outpatient visits during the first year after discharge, with a main focus on monitoring and adjusting anticoagulant medication. Unlike patients with myocardial infarction, who receive a 12-week rehabilitation program as standard care in Denmark, no rehabilitation is offered for patients with PE. The European guidelines on management of acute PE similarly have no recommendations regarding rehabilitation after PE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], even though early mobilization has been shown to be safe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A retrospective cohort study correspondingly found no activity-related adverse events in 422 patients with PE participating in a 3-week inpatient rehabilitation program with various activities (e.g., Nordic walking, chair exercises, ergometer bicycle training) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, although safety of early physical activity has been proven, a randomized trial is necessary to determine the effectiveness of a rehabilitation program for patients with acute PE. Here, one American RCT was found, examining the effect of a 3-month exercise and behavioral weight program on body mass index (BMI), physical activity, and cardiorespiratory fitness (<italic>V</italic>0<sub>2peak</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, only 19 patients were included, of whom 17 completed the study, making any conclusions difficult. Furthermore, no patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) were used (e.g., quality of life, disease impact on everyday life, sick leave). Thus, we lack knowledge of whether participation in a physical rehabilitation intervention can improve self-reported physical and mental well-being for this group of patients. If we look toward the fields of cardiac rehabilitation or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) rehabilitation, there is well-founded evidence that physical exercise has a significant positive effect on quality of life, physical capacity, fatigue, and dyspnea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>The aim of our study is therefore to investigate the effect of an 8-week home-based exercise intervention on physical capacity, quality of life, sick leave, and use of psychotropic drugs in patients with PE. We hypothesize that patients participating in the home-based exercise program will have significantly improved physical capacity and quality of life, and correspondingly reduced sick leave and use of psychotropic drugs compared to patients who receive usual care. The trial is a parallel-group, multicenter, randomized clinical superiority study with 6&#x000a0;months&#x02019; follow-up, including 140 patients with PE randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either control or experimental treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The study is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded, superiority trial, investigating the effect of a low-cost home-based exercise program commenced after hospitalization for acute pulmonary embolism and continued for 8&#x000a0;weeks at home.

Patients will be excluded in the case of: (1) PE as a secondary finding in relation to a scan performed due to another disease; (2) severe co-morbidity (e.g., severe heart disease&#x02014;NYHA class 4, severe COPD&#x02014;GOLD class D, active cancer, severe psychiatric disease); (3) inability to perform the Incremental Shuttle Walk test (e.g., due to amputation or intermittent claudication); (4) pregnancy; and (5) prescription of a structured rehabilitation plan to the patient&#x02019;s home municipality from the discharging hospital (which entails up to 20 sessions of publicly paid, supervised physical rehabilitation within a limited time frame).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Recruitment procedure and assignment of intervention</title><p>On the day of discharge, the nurses or physiotherapists attending the ward inform eligible patients about the ongoing study both verbally and in writing. If required, the patients are given 2&#x000a0;days&#x02019; deliberation time before they decide on participation in the study. The patients accepting participation are subsequently called in 2 to 3&#x000a0;weeks after discharge for completion of a written consent form, baseline tests, and questionnaires. Following the baseline tests, the patients are randomly allocated to either the control group or the exercise group by the use of opaque, sealed envelopes. Generation of the allocation sequence is handled by the primary investigator (PI) (NR), who is not otherwise involved in the practical enrollment and assignment of patients to the two interventions. Block randomization (by hospital) is used to ensure an equal allocation to intervention and control group at each recruitment site. The enrollment and actual randomization procedure is handled by the physiotherapist performing the baseline measurement at the hospital from which the patient was discharged.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Blinding</title><p>Due to the nature of the intervention, the patients cannot be blinded to the allocation group. The physiotherapist performing the Incremental Shuttle Walk test (ISWT) at follow-up (assessor) is blinded to the patients&#x02019; group allocation. The PI performing the data analysis is furthermore blinded to the patients&#x02019; group allocation, as the patients&#x02019; allocation group is not provided on questionnaires or the ISWT test results. At each recruitment location, the physiotherapists performing baseline measurements and allocation keep a secured record of the included patients and their group allocation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Control group (usual care)</title><p>Patients in the control group receive usual care. This includes zero to several days of hospitalization, depending on severity of the PE. The patient and his or her relatives receive general information about the disease and the course of treatment, the medication, and future prevention of embolism. Up to 1&#x000a0;year following discharge, the patient is seen on an outpatient basis for adjustment of anticoagulant treatment as required.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Exercise group</title><p>Patients in the intervention group receive the same usual care as patients in the control group. In addition, the patients participate in an 8-week home-based exercise program. Patients are recommended to exercise for a minimum of three times per week for 30&#x02013;60 minutes, and with three to four intervals of approximately 1&#x000a0;minute at a high intensity level, according to the Borg CR10 Scale level 7 (only very short sentences are possible) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The patients can choose whatever type of exercise they prefer, and they are generally encouraged to choose an exercise modality they already perform, or a modality they have previously had positive experiences with. Progression of the exercise program is guided by the physiotherapist at follow-up telephone calls to the patient after 1&#x000a0;week, 2&#x000a0;weeks, and 4&#x000a0;weeks. The aim of the physiotherapist guidance is both to keep up the patients&#x02019; motivation for exercising and to ensure the progression of the exercise program in terms of reaching a sufficiently high intensity during the interval phases during each exercise session. The patients record all their training sessions in a diary handed out at the first visit (type of exercise, duration, frequency, intensity, and additional remarks). This information will be helpful for the physiotherapist guiding the patient during the follow-up telephone calls, and furthermore aims to increase adherence to the exercise program. No intervention is offered after the 2-month follow-up, and patients are encouraged to maintain an active lifestyle.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Concomitant care</title><p>Any form of concomitant care is allowed during the study period, reflecting usual care for this group of patients in Denmark.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Outcome measures</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Primary outcome measure</title><p>Physical capacity from baseline to 6-month follow-up, as measured with the Incremental Shuttle Walk test.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><p>Quality of life measured with the PE Quality of Life (PEmb-QoL) and the EuroQol Five Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaires; sick leave (number of days in the last 4&#x000a0;weeks) and use of psychotropic drugs (type of drug, doses, and frequency in the last 4&#x000a0;weeks).</p><p>The Incremental Shuttle Walk test (ISWT) has been developed for assessing a person&#x02019;s maximum walking capacity.

The PEmb-QoL questionnaire contains six dimensions, these being frequency of complaints, activities of daily living (ADL) limitations, work-related problems, social limitations, intensity of complaints, and emotional complaints. Scores for all dimensions are calculated by the sum of the scores for each item of the dimension divided by the number of the items. Questions 1, 4, 5, and 9 are reverse scored. Questions 2 and 3 provide descriptive information. Higher scores indicate worse outcome.</p><p>The EuroQol Five Dimensions (EQ-5D) is a generic quality of life questionnaire comprising five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Each dimension has three levels (no problems, some problems, extreme problems), resulting in a total of 245 potential health states. The scores fall on a scale of -0.624 to 1.0 (perfect health), including the scores of -0.293 for &#x0201c;unconscious&#x0201d; and 0.000 for &#x0201c;dead&#x0201d;.

All patients and physiotherapists will be asked to report any adverse events to the primary investigator, and the trial will be stopped if any adverse events are considered to have been caused by the exercise intervention or the physical test. The authors meet frequently during the study to discuss trial conduct.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment of patients was initiated by centers on 1 May 2016, and the last center began inclusion early September 2016. As of April 1st 2017, 60 patients are included in the study. With an expected inclusion rate of seven to eight patients per month in total, an estimated recruitment period of 18&#x02013;20 months is required, counting from the initiation of recruitment in May 2016.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Dissemination of results</title><p>The results of the study will be shared with the public and with peers through publication in peer-reviewed journals and in the public press, and through presentations at conferences.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec23"><title>Additional file</title><p>
