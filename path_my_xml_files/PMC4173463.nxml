Intrathecal drug delivery with epidural volume extension (EVE) with the above aims has attracted many researchers since the combined spinal epidural (CSE) technique was introduced into clinical practice. The studies have targeted various aspects of physiological and anatomical relation of intrathecal and epidural space to decrease drug requirements and attain effective long-lasting anesthesia/analgesia. EVE using saline has been used to achieve higher block heights;[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] however, there is not enough literature on regression of such a higher block achieved in such cases. Knowing how rapidly the block regresses will be clinically important to meet the demands of long surgeries and will also help us chart out plans for postoperative analgesia. As bupivacaine remains the most commonly used drug intrathecally and is capable of causing differential blockade, higher sympathetic block attained can be associated with increased hemodynamic instability which can be further aggravated by augmentation of subarachnoid block (SAB) by EVE. Besides use of volume expansion, epidural opioids also are used to prolong the duration and quality of SAB.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] However, there is no conclusive evidence available on block behavior when both these methods are used together. There are also scarce data available on block regression rate and time to first analgesia, comparing different opioids, when used as adjuvant with EVE of SAB. With the above background, we decided to conduct a study to compare a non-supplemented SAB and to determine the safety and pharmacokinetic aspects of EVE when combined with opioids like fentanyl and tramadol. Such a study would help us determine if one opioid could score over another to maintain a longer effect of SAB by delaying regression of the block, and thus would prolong time to first analgesia besides lowering total analgesic requirement.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After institutional ethical approval was obtained, 75 patients (ASA I and II) scheduled for lower abdominal surgery under neuraxial blockade were included in the study.

The mean blood pressure after 10 min of the block in groups 1, 2, and 3 was 82.93, 82.01, and 80.43, respectively. Within the first half an hour of block, 8 patients in group 2 and 11 patients in group 3 had transient systolic blood pressure readings below 90 mm of Hg, while it was seen only in six patients in group 1. All these patients responded well to intravenous fluid loading or single dose of 3 mg intravenous ephedrine. One patient each in groups 2 and 3 had transient bradycardia with heart rate below 60 beats/min and responded to a single dose of intravenous atropine (0.3 mg); however, no bradycardia was seen in any patient in group 1. The pulse oximeter recordings did not show any significant variation among the three groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Requirement of first analgesic postoperatively</title><p>Group III, where 25 &#x003bc;g fentanyl was used, provided postoperative analgesia for the maximum duration since the time of administration of block, while group I, where no additional agent was given, had the shortest average duration of analgesia of around 180 min for the first analgesic postoperatively. Group II, where 25 mg tramadol was given, showed average duration to first analgesic of around 240 min as compared to 330 min in 25-&#x003bc;g fentanyl in Group III.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Associated adverse effects</title><p>Adverse effects were divided into two groups &#x02013; immediate (first 6 h after the block) and delayed (2 days postoperatively). The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting was the highest in the tramadol group where 10 patients either complained of severe nausea or had episodes of vomiting, while the number in groups 1 and 3 was 2 and 4, respectively. Five patients in group 1 had at least a single episode of shivering, whereas no such episode was noted in groups 2 and 3. Pruritus was noted in one patient in the tramadol group and two patients in the fentanyl group. One patient each in group 1 and fentanyl group had an episode of urinary retention requiring single time urinary catheterization postoperatively [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. Two patients only in group 1 had history of headache suggestive of post-dural puncture headache on day 1, which responded to conservative treatment.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Comparison of side effects in all three groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-6-189-g005"/></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>EVE is a known modality of increasing block height post spinal block.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] It also has demonstrated additional benefits in terms of reduced dose requirements of intrathecal local anesthetic.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The aim of such a dose reduction is to lower the local anesthetic dose-associated side effects like hypotension after spinal blockade. Once the regular dose of spinal local anesthetic is given and an EVE is used, it rather causes the block to reach higher sensory level,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and thus may add to hypotension by increasing the level of associated sympathetic blockade. On the other hand, if lower dose with planned epidural extension is used, knowing the rate of block regression is very important as a rapidly receding blockade could lead to inadequate anesthesia for the surgical duration. Thus, it would be clinically relevant to find agents which when used with EVE methods could lower the rate of block regression. In our study, we used standard dose of intrathecal bupivacaine in short procedures lasting up to 1&#x000bd; hours to evaluate the rate of block regression after surgery. The choice of small procedure was made as this would not require any epidural local anesthetic supplementation during the intraoperative course and would allow us to measure block regression only from the SAB component.</p><p>The block recorded in both fentanyl and tramadol groups with epidural volume was seen to be higher by around two segments than our control group, which is in accordance with the literature as the epidural volume compresses the thecal space causing the CSF to move higher, thus achieving a higher level. The similar levels attained by both fentanyl and tramadol groups highlight that this is more likely to be only associated with the physical property of volume effect in the epidural space and remains unaffected by the content injected into the epidural space.</p><p>Interestingly, both groups 2 and 3 regressed to level of T10 much faster than group 1 where no epidural volume was supplemented despite attaining a higher block level. The possible explanation to this fact is that since bupivacaine is not actually metabolized in the CSF, the action is only offset by reabsorption and circulation of CSF. In other words, if the CSF mobilization becomes faster, the likely effect will last smaller.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The injected volume in epidural space raises the CSF pressure and enhances its reabsorption, and thus the action offsets faster. Intrathecal fentanyl is known to enhance the duration of motor blockade in SAB.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] However, in the present study, the block actually offset faster and also fentanyl failed to show significant block prolongation in comparison to tramadol. Tramadol and fentanyl both have been used in central neuraxial blocks to prolong the duration of analgesia. Both these, used in our groups 2 and 3, respectively, did seem to achieve higher analgesic efficacy as the mean time to first analgesic was higher than in group 1. The time to analgesic requirement, however, was statistically equivalent in both tramadol and fentanyl. Since motor block and sensory block regression was faster, it is likely that the block of pain fibers is also offset faster and the analgesic effect seen was due to the action of both the drugs used epidurally rather than improving the quality of SAB when used as an adjuvant in EVE group. The time of analgesic administration in both the groups was similar to the time of their action when used epidurally alone.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>We monitored our patients continuously for hemodynamic changes, as SAB block is well known for its hypotensive effects. The block height directly correlates with the degree of hemodynamic variations. Eight of our patients in the tramadol group and 11 patients in the fentanyl group showed hypotension requiring treatment, whereas the number was 3 in group 1. This is likely due to the higher block level attained in these groups. So, if EVE is planned, one must use smaller doses of intrathecal local anesthetics.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] A possible higher sympathetic block level also would account for bradycardia seen in two patients in groups 2 and 3. This capability of increasing the efficacy of block can be used where patchy or incomplete block is seen after CSE technique.</p><p>Other adverse effects like nausea and vomiting were more common in the tramadol group, which is more likely to be due to local properties of the drugs used. The prime reason for decreasing the use of tramadol in central neuraxial block is the high degree of nausea,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] which was also highlighted in our study. Two patients in group 1 possibly had mild Post Dural Puncture Headache, which was not reported in any other groups; this is also in accordance with the fact that CSE technique is associated with lower incidence of PDPH and injection into epidural space helps to seal dural leaks if any.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The &#x0201c;volume effect&#x0201d; was distinct from the block enhancement after an epidural top-up of local anesthetic in that saline extends the block height by a mechanical volume effect and does not prolong the block duration.</p><p>
