Given the central role of the liver in regulating homeostasis including steroid hormone metabolism, we sought to understand how E2-17&#x003b2; and P4 interact to affect global gene expression in liver. Ovariectomized cows (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8) were randomly assigned to 4 treatment groups applied in a replicated Latin Square design: 1) No hormone supplementation, 2) E2-17&#x003b2; treatment (ear implant), 3) P4 treatment (intravaginal inserts), and 4) E2-17&#x003b2; combined with P4. After 14 d of treatment, liver biopsies were collected, allowing 28 d intervals between periods. Changes in gene expression in the liver biopsies were monitored using bovine-specific arrays. Treatment with E2-17&#x003b2; altered expression of 479 genes, P4 472 genes, and combined treatment significantly altered expression of 468 genes. In total, 578 genes exhibited altered expression including a remarkable number (346 genes) that responded similarly to E2-17&#x003b2;, P4, or combined treatment. Additional evidence for similar gene expression actions of E2-17&#x000df; and/or P4 were: principal component analysis placed almost every treatment array at a substantial distance from controls; Venn diagrams indicated overall treatment effects for most regulated genes; clustering analysis indicated the two major clusters had all treatments up-regulating (172 genes) or down-regulating (173 genes) expression. Thus, unexpectedly, common biological pathways were regulated by E2-17&#x003b2; and/or P4 in liver. This indicates that the mechanism of action of these steroid hormones in the liver might be either indirect or might occur through non-genomic pathways. This unusual pattern of gene expression in response to steroid hormones is consistent with the idea that there are classical and non-classical tissue-specific responses to steroid hormone actions. Future studies are needed to elucidate putative mechanism(s) responsible for overlapping actions of E2-17&#x003b2; and P4 on the liver transcriptome.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a CAPES-Fellowship from Brazil to CAP and the Pfizer Global Academic Consortium on Reproduction in Dairy Cattle.

In the liver, many of E2-17&#x003b2; actions may be mediated by estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#x003b1;) which is the predominant form reported in the liver, while subtype beta (ER&#x003b2;) has not yet been demonstrated <xref rid="pone.0073552-Kuiper1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073552-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.

Ovariectomy is a classical experimental strategy that provides an animal model of reproductive steroid hormone depletion. Moreover, the bovine model is a valuable model for hormone action in hepatic tissue, since multiple liver samples can be collected from the same animal. Our initial hypothesis was that E2-17&#x003b2; and P4 would produce distinct hepatic gene expression profiles and that P4 would antagonize E2-17&#x003b2;-induced gene expression in the bovine liver.

Messenger RNA was isolated from the liver samples using Magnetight oligo (dT) magnetic beads (Novagen, Madison, WI). Quantity and quality of mRNA was assessed using a spectrophotometer (Nanodrop-1000) and the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (for mRNA integrity using microfluidic analysis).

Cluster 1 contained genes that were up-regulated similarly by E2T, P4T, and E2P4T. Of the 172 transcripts in cluster 1, a total of 121 of these transcripts (70.3%) were significantly upregulated in all treatments when compared to CO. Conversely but analogously, cluster 2 contained genes that were down-regulated by all of the treatments. Of the 173 genes contained in cluster 2, a total of 160 genes (92.5%) were significantly down-regulated by all treatments compared to CO. The majority (58.3%) of genes were grouped into these first 2 clusters. Cluster 3 is characterized by a synergism between E2-17&#x003b2; and P4, since the levels of expression of these transcripts were lower in E2P4T than in E2T or P4T alone. A total of 22 of the 39 genes (56.5%) that were classified into cluster 3 showed a significantly decreased gene expression for E2T and P4T compared to CO and for E2P4T compared to E2T or P4T alone. Cluster 4 contained genes that were most markedly down-regulated by P4T and least down-regulated by E2T. Out of 47 genes clustered in cluster 4, there were 29 genes (61.7%) that were significantly down-regulated by all treatments, compared to CO. Cluster 5 contained genes that were down-regulated by E2T or P4T alone but were less down-regulated by E2P4T. Of the 24 transcripts classified into cluster 5, there were 17 transcripts (70.8%) that were significantly decreased by E2T or P4T; whereas, the pattern produced by E2P4T did not differ from the CO pattern.

Interestingly, a similar distribution of differential gene expression was found for up-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073552-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) and down-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073552-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). However, there were more genes that were down-regulated by at least one of the treatments (382 of 578 genes; 66%) than genes that were up-regulated by at least one of the treatments (202 of 578 genes; 35%). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073552-g005">Figure 5A</xref> also shows that a relatively small number of genes (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;83) were altered by only one of the treatments and not by any other treatment with numerically more of these genes altered by E2T (41 genes) than P4T (21 genes) or E2P4T (21 genes).

Although not considered a classical tissue for steroid hormone action, the liver has been previously found to respond to estrogens with changes in gene expression <xref rid="pone.0073552-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073552-Boverhof1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Indeed, appreciable effects of both steroid hormones are evident in the present study. Identification and characterization of hepatic genes that are regulated in E2-17&#x003b2;, P4, and E2-17&#x003b2; plus P4 treated cows is an important step toward understanding the mechanism of action of estrogenic and progestogenic compounds in physiological and pathological conditions in liver cells. In addition, the central role of liver in controlling the biological activity and circulating concentration of steroid hormones make the potential interplay of steroids with this tissue of particular interest to endocrinologists. After completing this research, the most striking and surprising finding was that gene regulation was so similar in the liver of cows treated with either E2-17&#x003b2;, P4, or both steroid hormones since these steroid hormones are generally thought to have distinct receptor activity and biological actions in most tissues.</p><p>The similarity of gene expression changes produced by these two hormone treatments separately or together was substantial both with respect to the genes stimulated and suppressed and to the magnitude of the responses. First, principal component analysis demonstrated strong similarity between the steroid treatments groups with almost every treatment array placed a substantial distance from the CO arrays. This result was mostly due to distinctive differences between the CO arrays and arrays for any of the treatment groups for values derived for Principal Component 1. The Venn diagrams represent a second type of evidence that E2-17&#x003b2; and P4 had similar actions on hepatic gene expression. Clearly, the majority of genes were regulated in all three treatment groups (346 of 578&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;60%) with only 14% (83/578) of genes regulated by only one of the treatment groups. This overlapping of genes that were regulated in all three treatment groups was observed for genes that were either up-regulated or down-regulated by the treatments. Thirdly, the clustering analysis also demonstrated the remarkable similarity in magnitude and direction of hepatic gene regulation by animals treated with either P4 or E2-17&#x003b2;, with the majority of regulated genes grouped into cluster 1 (172 genes), with genes similarly up-regulated by all three treatments, or cluster 2, with genes similarly down-regulated in all three treatments (173 genes). A perusal of any of the supplementary tables for the top genes regulated by any particular treatment shows that most of these genes were also similarly regulated by the other 2 treatments and that these similar effects were usually statistically significant for all 3 treatments. Thus, we are left with the clear conclusion that overall gene expression in the liver was similarly regulated by 14 days of treatment with E2-17&#x003b2;, P4, or E2-17&#x003b2; plus P4. These remarkable results are even more noteworthy given that the experiment utilized a Latin-square design to account for individual variability and therefore each individual animal had a liver biopsy followed by a microarray analysis in each of the experimental treatment groups. The replication of multiple treatment groups in the same animals, with a sizeable number of animals for a microarray experiment, makes the results of this experiment particularly powerful, from a statistical viewpoint. Other studies have also noted some similarities between E2-17&#x003b2; - and P4-induced gene expression for the lacrimal gland <xref rid="pone.0073552-Suzuki2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and Meibomian Gland <xref rid="pone.0073552-Suzuki1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, although not to the same degree as noted in our study. Using a similar approach to understand the patterns of regulation of steroid hormones in the bovine endometrium, Shimizu and collegues <xref rid="pone.0073552-Shimizu1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> found that treatment with E2-17&#x003b2; alone, or with P4 followed by increased E2-17&#x003b2; (P4+E2), produced similar patterns of gene expression change that differed substantially from gene expression in the endometrium of cows treated with only P4. There were surprisingly few genes (20 out of a total of 1291 differentially expressed genes) that were common between all three treatment groups. Thus, in classical steroid responsive tissues the pattern of gene expression regulation by E2-17&#x003b2; and P4 are very distinct from the highly similar regulatory changes that were found in our studies in liver.</p><p>The near identity of clusters 1 and 2 responses to E2-17&#x003b2; and P4 and their complete lack of additivity, suggests that liver gene expression is regulated through pathways that are similarly controlled by these two steroids and may be maximally activated by the doses of either steroid that were used in this study. This represents the complete opposite of our initial hypothesis that E2-17&#x003b2; and P4 would have distinct actions or possibly antagonistic actions on gene expression in the bovine liver. This hypothesis was based on previous results showing distinct biological responses and distinct patterns of gene expression for E2-17&#x003b2; and P4 actions in a variety of tissues, for example in the endometrium <xref rid="pone.0073552-Tong1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073552-Shimizu1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073552-Kraus1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073552-Hewitt1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In our study, opposite effects of E2-17&#x003b2; and P4 were detected in clusters 6 and 7 (not shown), but very few genes were found in these clusters (total of 16 genes). Antagonistic effects of E2-17&#x003b2; and P4 have been described in cultured hepatic stellate cells exposed to oxidative stress <xref rid="pone.0073552-Itagaki1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In the bovine endometrium, there were very distinct patterns of gene expression regulated by the two hormones. For example, there were over 300 genes that were down-regulated by E2-17&#x003b2; but were up-regulated by P4 <xref rid="pone.0073552-Shimizu1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In contrast to our study, the majority of steroid-responsive genes were regulated differently by E2-17&#x003b2; than by P4. In endometrial adenocarcinoma cells, the estrogenic metabolite tibolone elicited a distinct set of regulated genes, compared to its progestogenic metabolite with only 13% of genes demonstrating coregulation (the great majority presented opposite effects) <xref rid="pone.0073552-HanifiMoghaddam1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The authors of that manuscript indicated that estrogenic and progestogenic properties of tibolone regulate similar biological processes but through regulation of distinct genes. In the present study, the functional annotation data also indicated that similar biological processes were regulated by the two steroids in liver but in contrast to their results we observed almost identical genes regulated by E2T, P4T, and E2P4T. Some genes that were regulated by E2T have been previously reported <xref rid="pone.0073552-Shimizu1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073552-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, such as Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (<italic>CDK2</italic>), collagen type II alpha 1, and <italic>UDP</italic>-Gal:betaGlcNAc beta 1,4- galactosyltransferase, polypeptide 1 (<italic>B4GALT1</italic>). Other genes that we identified in this study have not been previously described such as myopalladin and G protein-coupled receptor 155 even though other G protein-coupled receptors had already been shown to be involved in the rapid actions of E2-17&#x003b2; <xref rid="pone.0073552-Filardo1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073552-Hsieh1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The distinct down-regulation of genes by E2-17&#x003b2; in our experiment was similar to the robust down-regulation by E2-17&#x003b2; of global gene expression in breast cancer cells <xref rid="pone.0073552-Frasor1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and the bovine mammary gland <xref rid="pone.0073552-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073552-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Similarly, the combination of E2-17&#x003b2; and P4 induced predominantly down-regulation of genes involved in the neuroplasticity of the raphe region <xref rid="pone.0073552-Reddy1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In the bovine endometrium, P4 primarily up-regulated gene expression, whereas, E2-17&#x003b2; produced similar numbers of down-regulated and up-regulated genes <xref rid="pone.0073552-Shimizu1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Progesterone alone or combined with E2-17&#x003b2; down-regulated a large number of genes in the lacrimal gland <xref rid="pone.0073552-Suzuki2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and in the Meibomian gland <xref rid="pone.0073552-Suzuki1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Thus, although somewhat unexpected results were found in our study, the results are not entirely inconsistent with results that have been previously reported for E2-17&#x003b2; and P4 regulation of gene expression.</p><p>It is not clear whether our E2-17&#x003b2; results are due to regulation of the classical ER through the estrogen-response element <xref rid="pone.0073552-Nilsson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> or by other mechanisms. Although <italic>ER&#x003b1;</italic> and <italic>ER&#x003b2;</italic> were present on the Affymetrix bovine array, their transcripts were almost undetectable in our tissues. Estrogen receptor <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> expression has been previously described in the rodent liver <xref rid="pone.0073552-Kuiper1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073552-Lindberg1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073552-Follettie1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. However, expression of <italic>ER&#x003b1;</italic> in hepatic tissues is very low when compared to the uterus, pituitary, ovary, kidney, and adrenal gland <xref rid="pone.0073552-Kuiper1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The rodent liver is highly responsive to an antagonist of both ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2; despite low or absent levels of these receptors in the liver <xref rid="pone.0073552-Follettie1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. This suggests that mechanisms of estrogen actions in the liver could involve indirect mechanisms through other signaling pathways or even other tissues. Non-genomic pathways regulated by E2-17&#x003b2; have been described in bone, mammary, vasculature, and nervous tissues <xref rid="pone.0073552-Filardo1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073552-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Previous studies have not carefully evaluated the non-genomic actions of E2-17&#x003b2; in the liver although one study reported that E2-17&#x003b2; reduced hepatic injury after trauma-hemorrhage through the PKA-dependent pathway via the membrane G protein-couple receptor 30 in a mechanism that is independent of <italic>ER&#x003b1;.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0073552-Hsieh1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>Similarly, it seems unlikely that the classical pathway of P4 binding to PR and regulating P4-response elements is the underlying explanation for the changes in gene expression observed after P4 treatment. The <italic>PR</italic> was also represented in the Affymetrix Bovine Gene Chip.

There are other non-classical P4 receptors <xref rid="pone.0073552-Losel1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073552-Ellmann1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> that may mediate some of the progesterone actions in liver <xref rid="pone.0073552-Losel1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073552-Boada1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, such as the progesterone receptor component 1 (PGRMC1) that we detected as present in all our microarrays.</p><p>Nevertheless, even if a clear presence of steroid receptors was detected in the liver, it would still seem unlikely that the presence of estrogen and P4-response elements in the same gene promoters could account for the level of similarity in gene expression results described here. An alternative explanation is that P4 may have an estrogenic effect in the liver. It is possible that P4 could be converted to androgens peripherally <xref rid="pone.0073552-Quinkler1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073552-Blouin1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> or in the liver <xref rid="pone.0073552-Granata1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> and then aromatized to estrogen; although, the bovine P45017<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> enzyme does not appear to catalyze this conversion <xref rid="pone.0073552-Conley1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. In addition, aromatase has not been detected in normal liver <xref rid="pone.0073552-Granata1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> and was not detectable in our hepatic samples in this study. Another possible site for conversion of androgens to estrogens is peripheral and visceral fat tissue <xref rid="pone.0073552-Blouin1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Nevertheless, circulating E2-17&#x003b2; concentrations remained undetectable in the P4-treated animals suggesting that this explanation is not plausible or that small increases in local concentrations of E2-17&#x003b2; were sufficient to exert substantial and similar biological actions as observed for E2T. Thus, this technical explanation, although implausible, cannot be completely discounted.</p><p>Since neither steroid significantly increased circulating levels of the other, we advance the hypothesis that these common liver gene expression changes arise from signaling processes that are shared by estrogen and progesterone receptors (classical or non-classical), either within the liver or, more likely, from sites in external tissues. Thus, an alternative mechanism is that E2-17&#x003b2; and P4 are regulating endocrine pathways or neural signaling from outside the liver. Such pathways may be producing the common actions of these steroids in the liver. Indeed, the liver is sensitive to regulation through the sympathetic nervous system through sinusoidal release of catecholamines and neuropeptide Y. The liver is regulated by numerous hormones such as: insulin, glucagon (from pancreas), cortisol (from adrenal glands), and growth hormone (from pituitary) and each of these hormones is regulated by complex endocrine and neural pathways. An attractive candidate in this context could be growth hormone since it has clear actions in the liver and has been shown to be differentially regulated by kisspeptin-10 in the presence of E2-17&#x003b2; or P4 <xref rid="pone.0073552-Whitlock1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>
<monospace>. </monospace>In that study, growth hormone was increased by kisspeptin-10 treatment in ovariectomized cows that were treated with either E2-17&#x003b2; or P4 but growth hormone was not increased by kisspeptin-10 in the absence of E2-17&#x003b2; and P4. In addition, E2-17&#x003b2; has been found to increase circulating growth hormone concentrations and insulin-like growth factor-1, in addition to increasing the mRNA for their receptors in the liver <xref rid="pone.0073552-olak1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>.</p><p>Another proposed mechanism to explain the similarity in gene expression for E2-17&#x003b2; and P4 is that both steroids or even their metabolites could be binding to other members of the steroid-hormone receptor superfamily such as pregnane X receptor <xref rid="pone.0073552-Moore1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> or constitutive androstane receptor <xref rid="pone.0073552-Moore1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073552-Kawamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, eliciting activation of common pathways. One example is the low affinity of E2-17&#x003b2; for other nuclear receptors such as the androgen receptor <xref rid="pone.0073552-Kousteni1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>.</p><p>A final possible explanation is that E2-17&#x003b2; and P4 might be eliciting similar protein-protein or nucleic acid-protein interactions to modulate gene expression without directly binding to DNA <xref rid="pone.0073552-Nilsson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. This can occur at the post-transcriptional regulation level, with rates of degradation of specific mRNA regulated by <italic>cis</italic>-elements and <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors. Similar regulation of mRNA stability by different steroid hormones has been well-described (for review see <xref rid="pone.0073552-Ing1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>) and this is a potent and important action of steroid hormones <xref rid="pone.0073552-Ing1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. It seems plausible, although not yet tested in any tissue that E2-17&#x003b2; and P4 may have similar actions in regulation of mRNA stability in the liver or other tissues and this could be the common mechanism that produces the unexpected similarity in E2-17&#x003b2; and P4 regulation of hepatic gene expression.</p><p>In conclusion, the steroid hormones including E2-17&#x003b2; and P4 are key regulators of many physiological processes and have been the subject of extensive previous research, particularly in classical steroid responsive tissues such as the uterus, mammary gland, and ovary. However, evaluation of E2-17&#x003b2; and P4 action in the liver, not generally regarded as a tissue that is regulated by steroid hormone, is particularly pertinent given the critical physiological role of the liver in regulation of energy homeostasis and metabolism of numerous substances including the steroid hormones. Steroid metabolism is extremely elevated in lactating cows and this elevated steroid metabolism underlies many of the changes in reproductive physiology and fertility that have been found in these animals <xref rid="pone.0073552-Wiltbank1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Therefore we felt that understanding the effects of E2-17&#x003b2; and P4 on hepatic gene expression could provide insight into both the basic biology of E2-17&#x003b2; and P4 action and could provide additional insights into links between hepatic function and reproduction in dairy cattle. Collectively, the present study demonstrated for the first time a remarkable similarity in action for physiological concentrations of E2-17&#x003b2; and P4 in regulation of gene expression in the liver. There was little indication that these two distinct hormones elicited antagonistic or synergistic actions in the liver. Indeed most regulated genes were regulated similarly in magnitude and direction by E2T, P4T, and E2P4T. This uncommon pattern of gene expression in response to steroid hormones is consistent with the hypothesis that there are tissue-specific responses to steroid hormones. Thus classical steroid-responsive tissues may have dramatic and steroid-specific responses to E2-17&#x003b2; and P4, whereas, other tissues, such as the liver, may have changes in gene expression in response to steroid hormones but these changes may not be steroid specific and therefore not dramatically different during different of the stages of the estrous or menstrual cycle. Given the central role of the liver in regulating numerous metabolic functions including metabolism and deactivation of steroid hormones, this result may indicate that hepatic homeostasis can be maintained regardless of phase of the cycle by the activation of common biological pathways by distinct steroid hormones. These findings may also have important functional implications for hepatic gene expression in women or animals at different stages of the ovarian cycle or during treatments with different steroid hormones during birth control or hormone replacement.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0073552.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Top 40 genes in the bovine liver that were differentially expressed in response to estradiol.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0073552.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0073552.s002"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p>Top 40 genes in the bovine liver that were differentially expressed in response to progesterone.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0073552.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0073552.s003"><label>Table S3</label><caption><p>Top 40 genes in the bovine liver that were differentially expressed in response to estradiol+progesterone treatment.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0073552.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We gratefully acknowledge the help from the staff of University of Wisconsin-Madison Gene Expression Center and Dairy Cattle Research Center.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0073552-Graham1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
