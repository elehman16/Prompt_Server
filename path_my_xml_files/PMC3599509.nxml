Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is the commonest cause of retinal redetachment in these eyes and is reported to occur in up to 45% of cases. Intensive anti-inflammatory agents have been shown to be effective at modifying experimental PVR and to be well tolerated clinically.</p><p>The Adjuncts in Ocular Trauma (AOT) Trial was designed to investigate the benefits of using intensive anti-inflammatory agents (intravitreal and sub-Tenon&#x02019;s triamcinolone, oral flurbiprofen and guttae prednisolone 1.0%) perioperatively in patients undergoing vitrectomy surgery following open globe trauma.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>Patients requiring posterior vitrectomy surgery following open globe trauma will be randomised to receive either standard treatment or study treatment. Both groups will receive the standard surgical treatment appropriate for their eye condition and routine perioperative treatment and care, differing only in the addition of supplementary adjunctive agents in the treatment group. The investigated primary outcome measure is anatomical success at 6&#x000a0;months in the absence of internal tamponade.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first randomised controlled clinical trial to investigate the use of adjunctive intensive antiinflammatory agents in patients undergoing vitrectomy following open globe trauma.

Currently, it is estimated that almost 1 million people in the US live with trauma-related visual impairment, and 40,000 to 60,000 individuals are diagnosed as new cases of trauma-related blindness each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Those patients with open globe injuries lose a mean 70&#x000a0;days of work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Prevent Blindness America estimated that in 1988 approximately 90,000 disabling eye injuries occurred at the workplace, resulting in a total direct cost of $354,870,000; with indirect cost (lost wages, medical expenses, and insurance administration cost), the sum reached $709,740,000. When the cost of all non-disabling eye injuries is included, the total easily exceeds $1 billion. (Prevent Blindness America Statement on the Scope of the Eye Injury Problem, Schamburg IL, 1996). Globally it has been estimated that 1.6 million people are blind as a result of ocular trauma, with 2.3 million suffering bilateral low vision and up to 19 million with unilateral blindness or low vision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>In the UK it is estimated that 5,000 patients per year sustain eye injuries serious enough to require hospital admission and of these 250 will be permanently blinded in the injured eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Ocular trauma is the commonest cause of unilateral blindness in the world today and in developing countries the high incidence of ocular trauma has extensive socioeconomic costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>It is clear from recent published data that although vitreoretinal surgical techniques have improved, outcomes remain unsatisfactory and that the development of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is the leading cause of this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Proliferative vitreoretinopathy</title><p>Eyes sustaining penetrating or open globe trauma (OGT) are a group at high risk of severe visual impairment. Retinal detachment is common in these eyes and multiple surgical interventions are often necessary. PVR is the commonest cause of recurrent retinal detachment and visual loss in eyes with open globe trauma. It is estimated to occur in 10-45% of all OGTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>PVR can be considered a wound-healing response in a specialised tissue. This results in the formation of fibrocellular membranes on both surfaces of the detached retina and the posterior hyaloid face. Contraction of these membranes results in retinal detachment in post-trauma eyes or in subsequent failure of surgical reattachment. Despite the improvements in vitreoretinal surgery over the past 15&#x000a0;years, a significant number of cases fail to achieve reattachment. The most common cause of anatomic failure in retinal detachment surgery is the development of new or recurrent proliferative vitreoretinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Preclinical and clinical data</title><p>The cellular components of PVR peri-retinal membranes (RPE, glial, inflammatory and fibroblastic cells) proliferate and may also be contractile; they are thus targets for antiproliferative agents. There is a notable inflammatory component to the PVR process with marked blood-retinal barrier breakdown and a greater tendency to intraocular fibrin formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Macrophages and T lymphocytes have been identified in PVR membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and, although relatively small in number, they may play an important role in membrane development and contraction through growth factor production. Thus, both cellular proliferation and the intraocular inflammatory response are realistic targets for adjunctive treatments in PVR.</p><p>Steroid treatment can potentially influence both inflammatory and proliferative components of PVR. Experimental work has suggested that the corticosteroid triamcinolone acetonide can reduce the severity of PVR. In addition, it has been demonstrated that periocular corticosteroids can reduce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] the severity of experimental PVR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Laboratory work has also demonstrated that triamcinolone appears to have no significant retinal toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] although in vitro it may be toxic to proliferating retinal cells.</p><p>Investigation of the pathobiology of PVR has demonstrated a process of fibrocellular proliferation and contractile periretinal membrane formation, which appears to be due to migrating RPE cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Recent laboratory investigations by the senior author have demonstrated the central role of retinal glial upregulation and M&#x000fc;ller cell process extension in the formation of PVR periretinal membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], suggesting that adjuncts that transiently affect free-floating intraocular cells may have limited effect on the PVR process. Hence, targeting the retinal glial response may be a more effective method of modifying the clinical development or recurrence of PVR. We have subsequently tested the effect of triamcinolone on the glial response in experimental retinal detachment and found a significant reduction in M&#x000fc;ller cell proliferation in treated animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The effect of triamcinolone on the glial response in experimental retinal detachment is evidence that clinically, in addition to their antiinflammatory effect, steroids will downregulate the intraretinal proliferative response seen in PVR.</p><p>Jonas <italic>et al.</italic> reported that intravitreal crystalline cortisone was well tolerated in PVR cases undergoing vitrectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Previous small-scale, uncontrolled clinical studies of PVR have suggested that systemic prednisolone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], infused dexamethasone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and intravitreal triamcinolone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] may reduce the severity of PVR, although none of these studies were of sufficient power to provide a definitive answer. An initial pilot study by the senior author has shown that triamcinolone is well tolerated in PVR cases undergoing vitrectomy and silicone oil exchange and that a combination of adjuncts targeting the inflammatory component of the PVR process may be a potential treatment to prevent PVR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. A small, prospective, non-comparative clinical study by Cheema <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] concluded that triamcinolone may have some benefit as an adjunct in non-trauma related established PVR, whereas Ahmadieh <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] found no additional benefit in surgical outcome. Both groups concluded that further larger studies were required to definitively answer the question.</p></sec><sec><title>Investigational medicinal products</title><p>Triamcinolone acetonide is a hydrophobic long-acting steroid preparation, which is increasingly being administered intraocularly to treat a variety of retinal conditions. It is cheap and widely available with a long duration of action and good safety profile. It appears to be effective in preventing intraocular proliferation and stabilising the blood-retinal barrier, making it a useful adjunctive treatment for retinal diseases resulting in refractory macular oedema. It is particularly useful in patients who have isolated ocular disease, especially unilateral, providing an antiinflammatory and antiproliferative efficacy equal to or greater than that achieved with systemic administration while avoiding the unwanted systemic side effects of steroid use. Its effects last about 3&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], which covers the key active developmental stage of PVR that occurs over about 6 to 8&#x000a0;weeks following ocular injury.</p><p>Flurbiprofen is an oral non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug most commonly used to treat musculoskeletal disorders including rheumatoid disease, osteoarthritis, and bursitis, but in ophthalmic practice it is commonly used to treat scleritis. The rationale for its use in this study stems from evidence suggesting that non-steroidal antiinflammatory medications given perioperatively may limit the degree of blood-retinal barrier breakdown and have been shown to inhibit cellular proliferation in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Prednisolone acetate 1% is an eye drop suspension used commonly in the treatment of steroid-responsive inflammatory conditions of the eye. It remains the most potent topical steroid treatment licensed for use in the UK.</p><p>Combining corticosteroids and non-steroidal antiinflammatories has been shown to have a synergistic effect in reducing blood-ocular barrier breakdown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a phase 2, single-masked, single-centre, pilot, randomised, controlled clinical trial.

As this group of patients is often given a poor visual prognosis, largely because of the high incidence of retinal detachment complicated by PVR, a positive outcome could potentially have significant implications in the change of management of these patients.</p><p>As this is a pilot study, it is anticipated that the results will provide sufficient valuable data to assist in powering a definitive study. As well as providing data regarding the case mix of ocular trauma at the study site, recruitment rate, and loss to follow-up rates, it aims to evaluate whether adjunctive antiinflammatory agents offer any additional benefit in this group of patients. As the sample size is small and has not been subject to a power calculation, we accept that we may limit our sensitivity to small differences between the two groups.</p><p>We also accept that the cohort of participants is likely to be quite a heterogeneous group given that open globe trauma can vary significantly in extent and severity. However, we expect the adequacy of randomization to compensate for this and shall acknowledge any unequal weighting within the groups as limitations of this pilot study. As the single-centre pilot study serves a wide geographical catchment area with a broad patient demographic representative of the UK, we do not expect the results to provide a misleading estimate of treatment effect. We would expect this to be confirmed in a definitive multicentre study.</p><p>The authors acknowledge the limitations of a single masked study, but have made every effort to reduce investigator bias by: (1) masking the operating surgeon to the treatment allocation until the end of the surgical procedure and (2) being explicit in definitions of clinical findings and adverse events and defining rigid management protocols, e.g. for IOP rise. The trial team considered an independent assessor of the primary outcome measure at 6&#x000a0;months, but felt that there was insufficient evidence to suggest this to be necessary and added additional cost to a pragmatic exploratory pilot study. Our projected recruitment rate is based on a retrospective audit of the incidence of relevant cases at the study site. We expect a high recruitment uptake following successful eligibility screening, due to the poor prognosis associated with current standard treatment, and are optimistic that our recruitment target be met within the projected timescale.</p><p>In summary, this is the first randomised controlled clinical trial to investigate the use of adjunctive intensive antiinflammatory agents in patients undergoing pars plana vitrectomy following open globe trauma.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interest</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>PJB participated in development of the trial protocol, co-ordinated the trial&#x02019;s setup at the study site, prepared the standard operating procedures, carried out study documentation, and drafted the manuscript.
