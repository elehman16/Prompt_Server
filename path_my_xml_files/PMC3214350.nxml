According to our knowledge, there are not reports regarding the evaluation of daily milk supplementation among Iranian children. We hypothesized that daily milk supplementation could improve the health status of Iranian children. Furthermore, school feeding programs could increase and privilege the healthy food choices among children. Assessing the results of such programs could change and provide some new policies in health care systems which could improve the health status of vulnerable groups. Therefore, we decided to determine the effects of daily milk supplementation on the physical and mental function and school performance among Iranian children.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Methods</title><p><bold>Subjects:</bold> 469 students were selected for this case-control population-based intervention from 4 primary schools in a medium socio-economic status region in Tehran, Iran (two girls&#x02019; schools and two boys&#x02019; schools). In either case one school was an intervention and one was a control school. The schools were chosen by Iranian Ministry of Education and Training and they were allocated in case and control groups randomly. All the students in the first to third classes in the intervention schools were consumed daily milk. None of the students in the control schools were given daily milk supplementation. All the 4 primary schools were in a medium socio-economic status region in Tehran. Therefore, there were no significant differences between the participants regarding the socio-demographic status. There was one girl school and one boy school in the intervention and one girl school and one boy school in the control. They were matching regarding the sex variable. Therefore, there were no significant differences regarding their age group. In 2 separated sessions the objectives of the project were explained to the students&#x02019; parents and the principals of the schools to obtain their collaboration before beginning the intervention. Iranian Ministry of Education and Training has ordered this project to Shaheed Beheshti University of Medical Sciences. This was a joint research project by National Nutrition and Food Technology Institute, Shaheed Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran and Iranian Tetra-pack company in Tehran with the collaboration of Al-Zahra University in Tehran, Iran (Research Project Number: 001). Written informed consent was taken from all students&#x02019; parents.</p><p><bold>Anthropometric measurements and questionnaires:</bold> General and socio-demographic characteristics of the students were collected with a pre-tested checklist. Socio-economic status was assessed by asking the number of sisters or brothers, having a separated room for the children, and the occupation of the parents. 24 hour dietary recalls were used for assessing the food intake one time during the study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> Dietary recalls were provided by the parents of the children. Anthropometric measurements were done according to the standard methods at the rest time, by the trained nutritionist of the study at the beginning of the intervention and after 3 months of daily milk supplementation. Weight was measured while children were minimally clothed using digital scales. Height was measured using a tape measure while the students were standing in a normal position. The mid-arm circumference was measured while the tape was wrapped loosely around the arm at the mid-point and the measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 cm.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> School performances were assessed by gradepoint averages of each student. For evaluating the mental function two psychological tests including the Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (CPM) and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for children (verbal, non-verbal, total IQ) were conducted on students. The Raven's CPM is internationally recognized as a culture-fair or culture reduced test of non-verbal intelligence for young children.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> Validity and reliability of CPM has been mentioned before.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> Intelligence Scale for children test (WISC) is an individually administered intelligence test for children between the ages of 6 and 16 inclusively that can be completed without reading or writing. Validity and reliability of this test is also mentioned previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></p><p><bold>Milk supplementation:</bold> Tetra-pack sterilized and homogenized milk was distributed daily for three months (250 ml for each student) from December to March. The fat content of milk was 2.5%. Milk was consumed by the first to third class students in the primary school under supervision of the teachers at the first rest time of the primary school at 9:30 a.m. Some students refrained from taking milk at the beginning, but nutrition education by the teachers and some of the more interested students through discussion, posters, and wall papers solved this problem at the first week of this population trial. So, within two weeks all the students were taking their milk. During the three months period, two more meetings were held with the parents to discuss further about the benefits of dairy intake. At the end of the three months period, anthropometric data, psychological tests and data regarding the school performance were gathered again. There were no reports of not consuming milk from the intervention schools.</p><p><bold>Statistical Methods:</bold> We used paired t-tests to globally compare means of all quantitative variables before and at the end of the study in each of the intervention and the control group (within each group). Furthermore, two-independent samples t-test was used for comparing the mean of variables between the intervention and the control group (between groups). Results were considered significant if the two-tailed p value was &#x0003c; 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) for Windows version 13.0 (SPSS, Chicago IL).</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Results</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> shows the socio-demographic characteristics of the intervention and the control groups. Regarding the parents&#x02019; occupation information, 42% of the fathers had private business, 35% were government employees, 19% were workers, and the rest were unemployed. Mean &#x000b1; SD age of fathers was 38.7 &#x000b1; 3.8 year and the mean age of mothers was 32.5 &#x000b1; 3.1. Most of the students (31.6%) were the first child of the family. Half of the children in this study had gone to kindergarten before the primary school. Breastfeeding was reported as the major method of feeding among the participants. Based on the students report, 10.7% of them had never consumed breakfast. There were 235 children in the intervention and 234 children in the control group.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Socio-demographic characteristics of the students in the present study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JRMS-16-469-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Anthropometric measurements and mean of the psychological tests, as well as grade-point averages before the intervention and after the intervention are presented separately for both groups in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">table 2</xref>.

The benefits on the physical function and school performance were specified in female students. This school feeding program presented beneficial outcomes. Schools are the centers of communities and the teachers are of great assistance in this respect. Therefore, it would be a good place for promoting nutrition. School feeding supplementation could also privilege the suitable dietary habits among children. In the present study there were also educational sessions for parents and teachers and the school principals which could increase the preference of families for dairy consumption.</p><p>Two recently school nutrition program demonstrated the major impacts of supplementing diets of Vietnamese primary school children with fortified milk and biscuits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> as well as regular and fortified milk<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> on weight and height. However, milk supplementation could increase the micronutrients intake and therefore it is mostly a source of micronutrients supply. The results of the present study regarding the weight of students were more pronounced on girls. This might be due to the difference between the age of puberty among male and females. In the age range of the present study population, girls had a more rapid growth; however, this time is not near to the age of puberty among boys. In the present study there was no significant difference between height of the control and the intervention group. This might be due to the short duration of the study. Maybe the long-term trials would show the effect of milk supplementation on children's height. This is exactly the case regarding the results observed in the present study on the mid-arm circumference.</p><p>The school feeding program in Vietnam had beneficial effects on mental function and short memory.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> Another fortified milk supplementation program in Indonesia showed an improvement in the cognitive function. However, some evidence does not support this result.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref> In the present study also, milk supplementation significantly improved intelligence quotient, both verbal and non-verbal skills. Nutrient content of milk might be responsible for this improvement.</p><p>School performance increased in the intervention group in the present study but only among girls. Considering the results of this part, we should also pay attention to other environmental confounders. Therefore, we cannot attribute all the observed results to milk consumption. However, presences of biases are inevitable in the population intervention programs. So, we can consider the confounders as the limitation of the population interventional studies.</p><p>Beverages might be important for gaining energy, macronutrient, and micronutrient quality of overall intake.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref> Compared to other drinks milk frequently occupies a generally weak position in schools, unless it is supported by legislative measures. Nowadays, sugar sweetened beverages are consumed in highly amount worldwide. In terms of availability, fruit juice is the main competitor of milk in schools internationally. There are several reports regarding the association between soft drinks and chronic diseases such as obesity and adiposity among children and adolescents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref> According to the reports, 56-85% of school aged children in USA consume at least one soft drink daily.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref> Each additional can or glass of sugar-sweetened drink beyond the normal intake could increase the rate of overweight and obesity 1.6 times.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref> However, there are some reports regarding the weight control effects of dairy products.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></p><p>Beverages, liquids, and dairies are major components of the different dietary patterns. Different dietary patterns might be related to health and disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref> Dairy consumption might be associated with chronic diseases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref> Even, dietary intervention containing high amount of dairy could improve the risk of chronic diseases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref> Nutrition education plays an important role for encouraging people to follow the healthy dietary pattern. Therefore, nutrition education is recommended according to the health educational models. Previous studies showed successful results regarding the application of health education models.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref> School feeding programs based on healthy food choices could be a suitable method for improving the nutritional status among children.</p><p>In the present study, as a limitation, we could not collect the blood samples from students. It is suggested to also collect blood and urine samples before and after school feeding programs in future studies for analyzing the nutritional status further. Collaborative activities of the school principals were the most important strength of the present study.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the results of the present study support the beneficial effects of school feeding programs&#x02019; focus on milk supplementation on students&#x02019; physical, mental and school performances in Iran.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Authors&#x02019; Contributions</title><p>KHR, MIH, HH, ARDM, ADJ, MP participated in the design and conducting the study and preparing the manuscript.
