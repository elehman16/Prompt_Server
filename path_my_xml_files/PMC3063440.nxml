In previous studies, low dose bupivacaine with an intrathecal opioid was used successfully in urological surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and block quality of low dose levobupivacaine, and compare it with low dose bupivacaine when they are combined with fentanyl in transurethral resection of prostate surgery.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>METHODS:</title><p>Forty nine patients undergoing transurethral prostate surgery were enrolled in this prospective, randomized and double blind study. Patients in levobupivacaine group received 5 mg levobupivacaine + 25 &#x003bc;g fentanyl and bupivacaine group received 5 mg bupivacaine + 25 &#x003bc;g fentanyl. Demographic data, surgery times, hemodynamic parameters, block qualities and patient and surgeon satisfactions were recorded.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Demographic data, surgery times and patient and surgeon satisfactions were similar in both groups. Hemodynamic parameters were comparable and stable during the procedure in both groups. Sensory block characteristics were comparable and clinically effective in both groups. While 3 patients in bupivacaine group had Bromage score of 3 at the beginning of the surgery, no patient in levobupivacaine group had this score and this difference was significant (p = 0.042). Bromage scores at the end of the surgery were comparable in both groups.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>In conclusion, for transurethral prostate surgery 5 mg levobupivacaine with 25 &#x003bc;g fentanyl can provide stable hemodynamic profile, patient and surgeon satisfaction and effective sensorial blockade with less motor blockade in spinal anaesthesia; so it could be used at low doses as a good alternative to bupivacaine.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Levobupivacaine</kwd><kwd>Bupivacaine</kwd><kwd>Fentanyl</kwd><kwd>Anaesthesia</kwd><kwd>Spinal</kwd><kwd>Transurethral Resection of Prostate</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Spinal anaesthesia for transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) operations has been frequently used, because symptoms of over hydration, TURP syndrome and bladder perforation can be recognized earlier. At the same time, short acting spinal anaesthesia with minimum motor block can be useful in preventing the patient from the complications related with delayed immobilization. It can be assumed that recovery and mobilization of the patient could be faster, if the motor block was less intense. For this purpose, short acting or low doses of local anaesthetics can be used.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></p><p>Levobupivacaine 0.5% and bupivacaine 0.5% were shown to be equally effective in spinal anesthesia. In literatures, no studies could be detected in which levobupivacaine was reported to be used in low doses intrathecally for TURP surgery. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness, block quality and hemodynamic effects of low dose levobupivacaine and also compare it with low dose bupivacaine when they are combined with fentanyl in spinal anaesthesia for TURP surgery.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was performed in Ankara Numune Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey. After obtaining approval from Institutional Ethics Committee and written informed consent from all patients, 50 ASA I-III patients who were scheduled for elective TURP surgery were enrolled in this prospective, randomized and double blind study. Patients having known hypersensitivity to amide local anesthetics, abnormal coagulation profile, with spinal anomalies or skin infections and unwilling to accept regional anaesthesia were excluded.</p><p>Patients were not premedicated before surgery. Before lumbar puncture, an intravenous (IV) cannula was inserted and an infusion of NaCl 0.9% was started. All spinal anaesthesias were performed at the level of L3-L4 with a 25 G Whitacre needle, in sitting position by the same anesthesiologist. Patients were randomized into two groups via sealed envelope technique. Patients in levobupivacaine group (L) received intrathecal 5 mg 0.5% levobupivacaine + 25 &#x003bc;g fentanyl, and in bupivacaine group (B) received intrathecal 5 mg 0.5% bupivacaine + 25 &#x003bc;g fentanyl at an injection rate of 120 sec. The anesthesiologist who performed spinal anaesthesia was blinded to the group of study solution. The study solutions were prepared by another anesthesiologist.</p><p>Electrocardiogram, non invasive blood pressure and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) saturation of all patients were monitored with PETAS KMA-175 monitor (PETAS Corp., Ankara, Turkey) and recorded as before spinal anaesthesia, every 2 minute for 20 minute after spinal anaesthesia, every 5 minute thereafter for 30 minute and at the end of the surgery. Supplementary 2 mL.min<sup>-1</sup> O<sub>2</sub> was given to all patients via a face mask.</p><p>Quality of anaesthesia was assessed by testing for sensory and motor blockade. Sensory blockade was monitored with the pinprick test at every 2 minute for 20 minute, at the end of the surgery and in recovery room until S2 segment regression. Time to achieve sensory block of T10, max spread of sensory block, time to two segment regression and time to S2 regression were recorded. Motor blockade was assessed based on a modified Bromage scale (as 0 = no paralysis, able to flex hips/knees/ankles; 1 = able to move knees, unable to raise extended legs; 2 = able to flex ankles, unable to flex knees; 3 = unable to move any part of the lower limbs) every 2 minute for 20 minute, at the end of the surgery and in recovery room. Bromage scores at the beginning and at the end of surgery were noted.</p><p>Fifteen minutes after the initiation of spinal anaesthesia, if the sensory block had reached to T10, permission was given to start the operation. If the sensory blockade was inadequate, general anaesthesia via a laringeal mask was induced.</p><p>A decrease more than 25% from baseline level or to &#x0003c; 60 mmHg in mean arterial pressure was defined as hypotension and treated with IV 5 mg ephedrine bolus. Heart rate &#x02264; 50 beats/min was defined as bradycardia and treated with IV 0.5 mg atropine bolus and these were all noted. Other adverse effects like pruritis, nausea, vomiting, shivering and respiratory depression were also recorded.</p><p>In the case of anxiety, IV 1 mg midazolam was given for sedation. At the end of the surgery, patient and surgeon satisfaction were assessed as good, fair or poor.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 11.5 version (SPSS Inc; Chicago, IL, USA). Sample size was calculated to provide 80% power to detect 25% reduction in the incidence of complete motor block in L group compared with B group. Independent samples t test for parametric data, Mann Whitney U test for non parametric data and Chi square test for frequency data were performed for statistical analysis. A p value &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Data were expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD) or median (range) or number of patients (n).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>Results</title><p>One patient in L group declined to go on with regional anaesthesia after receiving the study medication because of serious anxiety and excluded from the study.

But low doses of local anaesthetics could not provide an adequate level of sensory block.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> Adjuvant agents like opioids can be used to enhance analgesia and successful spinal anesthesia. Fentanyl has been widely used as an adjunct to local anesthetics for enhancement of analgesia without intensifying motor and sympathetic block in spinal anaesthesia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></p><p>In previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> dose sparing effect and augmentation block of bupivacaine with intrathecal fentanyl usage were confirmed in urological surgery. By this combination of bupivacaine and fentanyl, dose reduction of bupivacaine can be provided and this will cause less sympathetic blockade, also resulting in lower incidence of hypotension, early recovery and mobilization. Since the usage of low dose levobupivacaine in spinal anaesthesia for urological surgery has not been reported yet, we tried to compare the effectiveness of the low doses of levobupivacaine and bupivacaine when they are combined with fentanyl, which were showed to be effective in spinal anaesthesia for TURP surgery when used in higher doses. By using 5 mg levobupivacaine + 25 &#x003bc;g fentanyl, an effective sensorial blockade was provided with less motor blockade than usage of 5 mg bupivacaine + 25 &#x003bc;g fentanyl.</p><p>Vercauteren et al reported that, slight motor impairment seems to occur more often with the use of racemic bupivacaine and they suggested to perform further studies to confirm that levobupivacaine causes less or short lasting motor impairment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> Also in the study of Camorcia et al, the potencies for motor block of intrathecal ropivacaine, levobupivacaine and bupivacaine were compared and bupivacaine was found to have more potency for motor block when compared with bupivacaine and ropivacaine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref> The present findings about less motor block in levobupivacaine group was also consistent with these studies.</p><p>As known, spinal opioids carry the risk of respiratory depression especially in elderly patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> In the previous study, O<sub>2</sub>supplementation was continuously administered via a face mask. Only small doses of IV midazolam were used in a few patients for sedation. No respiratory depression or transient hypoxia was observed in either group. It can be sug-gested that, 25 &#x003bc;g intrathecal fentanyl in combination of small doses of midazolam can be safely administered when O<sub>2</sub>supplementation was continued during the procedure.</p><p>As also shown in other studies that bupivacaine was used in low doses,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> no hypotensive period was observed in either groups in the present study.
