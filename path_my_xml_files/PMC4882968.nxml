Inclusion criteria were existence of BID in the mania period or combination state according to the diagnosis of psychiatric based on the DSM IV-TR measures, patient and his supervisor's consent to participate in the study, and to be under the treatment of lithium and olanzapine. Exclusion criteria were the mentally retarded patients who based on the clinical diagnosis, had an intelligence quotient lower than 70 using intelligence test, patients with pervasive developmental disorders based on the patient's case history and clinical diagnosis, patients who require electroconvulsive therapy (ECT is now more commonly used for patients with resistance to those treatments, except in the case of life-threatening illness due to inanition, severe suicidal symptoms, or catatonia) or other treatments (such as other mood stabilizers except for lithium or the other anti-psychotics except for olanzapine) because of the severity of their symptoms according to the clinical diagnosis performed by the psychiatric, substance abuse, or dependence for at least 3 months before the study, pregnancy, risk of suicide, possibility of harming others, and patients who suffer from the severe side effects of consuming omega-3 supplements such as bruising and bleeding as a result of increased bleeding time.

At first and after completing patients&#x02019; demographic information form, they were randomly put into one of the omega-3 and placebo groups. In the experimental group, patients received 1000 mg supplement capsules containing omega-3, made by nichers&#x02019; factors in the USA on a daily basis for 3 months. Placebo was used in the control group. Patients were given one placebo capsule on a daily basis for 3 months. To study the effects of this intervention and to compare the treatment results of the two groups, all patients were clinically interviewed at the beginning and ending of the intervention by the psychiatric collaborator expert who had no information regarding the treatment groups. In addition, all patients were educated about confounding factors such as physical exercise, insomnia, and consuming foods that have a higher amount of omega-3 and other factors.

The results of this study is consistent with the results of the previous studies that indicate the effectiveness of consuming omega-3 supplements for adjuvant therapy of patients suffering from bipolar disorder.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Fatty acids play various physiological roles in the organisms; they are crucial for the structure of cell membranes, metabolic processes, transmission of nerve impulses and brain functions.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Omega-3 is influential for brain development, function of brain membrane enzymes, learning, and many other instances, and its deficiency is associated with many psychological disorders.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>Therefore, particular attention has been paid to the rich sources of omega-3 for the treatment of many diseases, especially mental illnesses in the recent years.</p><p>Since the present study was carried out among the patients with BID who were hospitalized in Farabi Hospital of Kermanshah city, generalization of results should be done with caution. It is suggested for further research to study the effectiveness of omega-3 supplement for the treatment of other mentally ill patients.</p><p>The results of Stoll's study showed that there are tangible implications for understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of bipolar disorder and for development of future treatments. Biochemical studies on human white blood cells indicate that treatment with high-dose omega-3 causes internalization of these polyunsaturated combination into membrane phospholipids that is necessary for cell signaling.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Increasing the concentration of omega-3 fatty acids in phospholipid membranes of cells suppresses signals related to phosphatidylinositol transmission pathways.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The value of this mechanism is unknown. However, the accession of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid into lipid bilayer membranes of cells changes the membrane physically and[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] probably these changes make phospholipid membranes resistant against hydrolysis by phospholipase enzymes. It may be the result of reducing the second messenger molecules, diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate generation.</p><p>Epidemiologic data have linked the findings of the epidemiological studies that have shown the link between fish consumption and omega-3 absorption with national prevalence of depression, including postpartum depression, as well as bipolar disorder.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] The amount of omega-3 fatty acids in plasma and red blood cells membrane is associated with severe depression.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Moreover, in addition, the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids (that are more common in our diet) in erythrocyte membranes is associated with depression.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Since omega-3 has a preventive role in coronary heart disease,[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] it can be justified that reduction of omega-3 is correlated with heart disease, cardiac mortality, and depression simultaneously. Consistent data show that omega-3 may have a preventive role against heart disease and mood disorders. Since atypical antipsychotic agents which are commonly used in the treatment of bipolar disorder are associated with an increased risk of diabetes, preventive effects of heart disease by omega-3 are significantly noticeable clinically.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In the double-blind, placebo-controlled, Stanley Bipolar Disorder Network trial, high-dose of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) was used as monotherapy and failed for the treatment of mood symptoms.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] As well as, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of bipolar depression by applying 1 g or 2 g of ethyl-EPA as adjunctive treatment turned out that both doses are effective and tolerable for bipolar depression.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The results of this study showed that supplements containing omega-3 are useful in the treatment of BID. The use of supplements containing omega-3 Along with other treatments is recommended based on the consideration of high prevalence of BID, the impossibility of making this substance in the human body, and the body's need for external supplements amount of this substance. In addition, it is recommended to measure the adequate blood levels of omega-3 consumption and absorption. As in previous similar studies, patients were evaluated by the Young Mania Rating Scale weekly, so in future studies, patients should be evaluated on a weekly basis. At the end of the study, patients had normal mood and some of them had high mood and in none of them, depressive mood was not reported. While in our study YM was used to evaluate the subjects with normal and elevated mood, we recommend that researchers in future studies administer the different scales. Diet of patients must be totally under control and has to be similar.</p><p>Limitations are as follows; dissimilarity of diet, failure to measure blood levels of omega-3, and limited evaluation by YM only at the beginning and end of the study.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank all the staff of the Farabi Hospital of Kermanshah, for their co-operation in data collection.
