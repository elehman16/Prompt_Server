The prevalence is 1 - 2% worldwide. Both, incidence and prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis, are two to three times higher in women than in men [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The treatment goal is achieving the lowest level of activity of the disease and longest remission, minimization of the joint damage, maintaining physical function and quality of life. Treatment of RA contains a program that includes medical, social and emotional support for the patients. ETN is effective in reducing the signs and symptoms of RA, as well as in slowing or halting the radiographic damage when used either as a monotherapy or in combination with MTX. ETN binds TNF in circulation and in the joint, preventing interaction with cell surface TNF receptors, thereby reducing TNF activity [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of Methotrexate (MTX) as a monotherapy versus combined therapy with Etanercept (ETN) and Methotrexate (MTX), in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="patients|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In this randomised controlled study conducted during a period of two years, from March 2014 to March 2016, we have evaluated the efficacy of treatment of patients with RA treated with MTX alone and the combination of MTX and ETN.</p><p>Patients were diagnosed with RA fulfilling criteria of European League against Rheumatism (EULAR)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and disease duration of at least one year [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Patients included in the study were treated with DMARDs such as Sulfasalazine and Hydroxychloroquine and they did not have a satisfactory response to the therapy. The youngest patient included in the study was aged 29 years, with function class I - III (ACR), with 8 swollen and 10 painful joints; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 25 mm/hour, C - reactive protein (CRP) level of 12 mg/liter, and morning stiffness more than 30 minutes. Pain on a visual analog scale (VAS: 0 - 100 mm) was evaluated for each patient, clinical response was assessed using American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for 20% improvement ACR20, the ACR50 and the ACR70 in RA, and the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>][<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>][<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].

Results confirm the significant advantage of combined therapy over monotherapy. DMARD medications are utilised much earlier in the treatment of RA, due to their efficacy in retarding erosive damages. Biologics produce rapid and sustained amelioration of the signs and symptoms of RA, retard radiological progression, and improve quality of life more effectively than DMARDs [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Our study showed that combined therapy had a statistically significant benefit compared to the monotherapy for ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 response. It also shows the significant advantage of combined therapy over monotherapy in controlling the disease activity measured by DAS28 Score. DAS28 was obviously lower in the group treated with combined therapy compared to the group treated with monotherapy.</p><p>Different authors showed the improvement of RA using combined therapy (ETN + MTX), e.g. Weinblatt ME et al., (1999). A trial of Etanercept, a recombinant tumour necrosis factor receptor: Fc fusion protein, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving MTX. The authors show that in 89 RA&#x02019;s, patients treated with ETN showed more efficacy of ETN when used a combination treatment with MTX over 6 months of treatment. Our results are similar to recent studies [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The reason we conducted this study was to improve the care of our patients. Our study confirmed that combined therapy had given better improvement. Clinical studies suggest that etanercept is safe and effective as a long-term therapy for the treatment of RA, and the risk and benefit ratio of continuous etanercept treatment remains beneficial [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Limitations of the study include the small number of patients in the group of combined therapy, because of the economic limitation conditions of applying etanercept to other patients with RA. Furthermore, studies with higher number of patients need to be done.</p><p>According to our results, we can conclude that etanercept in combination with methotrexate reduced disease activity, slowed radiographic progression and improved clinical manifestations more effectively than methotrexate alone within 2 years. During the treatment, no serious adverse events were noticed with a combination treatment of etanercept and methotrexate.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
