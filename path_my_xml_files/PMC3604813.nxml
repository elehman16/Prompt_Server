These native collagen grafts are immunologically accepted without rejection and/or reaction and get reconstituted with host cells and supporting vasculature. Subsequently they are incorporated into host tissue. This biological response to the native tissue remains an ideal to which any other dural substitutes can be compared[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Over the past several decades, poor biological performance compared with native tissue has excluded many dural substitutes ranging from metal foils to various synthetic polymer sheets.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Xenogeneic collagen-based dural graft materials, such as DuraGen (Integra Life Sciences, Plainsboro, NJ, USA) and Dura-Guard (Synovis Surgical, St. Paul, MN, USA), have shown to be favorable alternatives to autografts.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] These materials are composed of animal collagen tissue processed to remove immunogenic components for improved integration into patient's tissues.</p><p>Dura-Guard, derived from processed bovine pericardium, is a strong membranous implant that is sutured to the surrounding dura. DuraGen, in contrast, is a collagen matrix derived from bovine Achilles tendon and is implanted, without suture, as an on-lay graft to cover dural defects. To emphasize, DuraGen does not require suturing to the surrounding dura.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]</p><p>In 1891, Hans Chiari first document 3 rhombencephalic congenital defects that are now classified as Chiari malformation Types I, II, and III.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Chiari Malformation I (CM I) is the mildest form of the disease and it is associated with a protrusion, of varying degrees, of the cerebellum through the foramen magnum.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Patients with symptomatic CM I tend to experience disequilibrium, dizziness, headaches, neck pain, double vision, difficulty swallowing, slurred speech, and loss of coordination.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>This study focuses on posterior fossa decompression for the treatment of CM I and the possible benefits of sutured vs. sutureless duraplasty in a surgery requiring an opening of the dura mater. The efficacy of DuraGen and Dura-Guard as dural substitutes in cranial and spinal surgery has been previously reported. The literature is distinctly sparse, however, on outcome and cost analysis data following posterior cranial fossa augmentation duraplasty utilizing the two dural substitutes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] To our knowledge, no one has explored the questions of whether suturing the dural patch is essential for reduction of complications or whether use of sutureless patches correlates with worse clinical outcomes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] To address these questions, we compared outcome, cost, operative and postoperative variables, and rates of complications in patients randomized to either DuraGen or Dura-Guard for dural closure during posterior fossa decompression in patients with CM I.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Institutional review board and human subject protection</title><p>This research was conducted with approval and under the guidance of the University of Illinois at Chicago's (UIC) Institutional Review Board.

Randomization was 1:1 to DuraGen or Dura-Guard and the subjects were blinded to the results of randomization.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Decompression surgery procedures</title><p>Treatment within the study protocol did not deviate from standard practice. Following suboccipital craniectomy and C1 posterior arch excision, dura was opened along with arachnoid membrane to facilitate CSF flow and all visible arachnoid adhesions were released. After an adequate intradural decompression the duraplasty was performed with either DuraGen or Dura-Guard depending on randomization. Dura-Guard patches were sutured to the native dura in a watertight fashion using 4-0 Nurolon running nonlocking suture, whereas DuraGen was placed over the dural opening without any sutures or glue. In most cases, DuraGen was tucked under the native dura. After discharge from the hospital, the patients were seen in the outpatient neurosurgical clinic for suture removal and follow up examinations for the duration of study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Operative parameters and study follow up procedures</title><p>Patients were followed for 3 months postoperatively with the SF-36 Quality of Life Questionnaires (QLQ) and for specific complication indicators. Complication parameters evaluated were: Presence of pseudomeningocele based on clinical examination and follow up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); postoperative meningitis (infectious and aseptic), evaluated by clinical symptoms and/or lumbar puncture; development of CSF leak; and postoperative wound infection. We also analyzed duration of surgery (minutes); blood loss (milliliters); length of postoperative hospital stay (days); readmissions and emergency room (ER) visits within 30 days following surgery; and other postoperative complications not included above.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Cost analysis</title><p>Total charges were calculated as actual hospital charges incurred from surgery to discharge. Operating cost was calculated as actual hospital charges specified as operating room cost, anesthesia cost and recovery room cost. Each was assessed individually and additively (total operating time cost) for statistical significance. The complication management cost was determined by the cost of treatment of complications occurring after the initial hospital treatment. Among others, it included cost of all readmissions, ER visits and outpatient visits related to any complication of surgery.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>SF-36 quality of life grading and evaluation</title><p>Symptomatic improvement vs. stabilization vs. worsening was measured by the SF-36 health outcomes survey (Quality Metric, Lincoln, RI, USA) at months 1, 2, and 3 postoperatively. Outcome was evaluated by subject reported response to the month 1, SF-36 questionnaire question #2: &#x0201c;Compared to one year ago, how would you rate your health in general now?&#x0201d; Subjects were also evaluated for outcome via this criterion at their last postoperative, or month 3, questionnaire evaluation. The SF-36 quality of life questionnaire scores resulted in five specific scoring categories.</p><p>Scores range from 1 to 100 (1 = very poor and 100 = excellent), and these categories are: physical function, physical role, pain, general health, vitality, social function, emotional role, and mental health. The questionnaire also gives a total physical health and mental health score that ranges from 1 to 100. The total QLQ score was determined by adding the total physical health and mental health scores together (score 1-200). Scores for each specific category, total physical, total mental, and total QLQ score were individually assessed at the three time points (months 1, 2, and 3) and were averaged across all time points for an overall assessment of each parameter.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Outcome</title><p>Follow up evaluation was conducted for objective evaluation of outcome and marked as better, same or worse.

We also evaluated whether the type of duraplasty, sutureless with DuraGen, or sutured with Dura-Guard, translates into additional cost both during surgery and postoperatively. Furthermore, study data was compared at different time points throughout the clinical course to determine overall efficacy of surgery.</p><p>The two study groups, DuraGen and Dura-Guard, exhibited comparable demographic parameters indicating that differences in clinical course could be correlated with randomization to either duraplasty material. Similarly, it has been previously reported that intrinsic patient characteristics (e.g., age, alcohol, drug abuse, duration of symptoms, and smoking) do not affect the efficacy of collagen dural grafts.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] The higher prevalence of women with CM I has been previously documented in the literature and again confirmed here within our study population.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>We did not find any significant difference in clinical course (operative time, hospital stay, and blood loss during surgery) between sutureless (DuraGen) and suturable (Dura-Guard) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Operative time was less for DuraGen and it appears to be related to the fact that DuraGen is an on-lay graft and does not require suturing time.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] The difference, however, was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.06), although it is conceivable that this could become significant with a larger study population.</p><p>Hospital stay for Dura-Guard was on average less but not significantly different from DuraGen (<italic>P</italic> = 0.06). In this case, the lack of a statistically significant difference is not surprising as the postoperative treatment was essentially identical between the two groups. For postoperative parameters, Dura-Guard and DuraGen showed somewhat larger than expected incidence of complications, infections, CSF leaks, pseudomeningocele formation, ER visits, and readmissions. Zerris, <italic>et al</italic>. studied somewhat similar parameters in animal experiments comparing Dura-Guard with DuraGen and none of the animals developed CSF leak, seizures, hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, foreign body reaction, or infection.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] Dura-Guard in our study had smaller incidences for most postoperative outcome parameters (e.g., CSF leak, ER visits, etc.) and higher for some others (e.g., meningitis) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>], however, this was not significantly different from DuraGen.</p><p>The cost analysis portion of our study indicated that there was no significant difference in cost for DuraGen compared with Dura-Guard duraplasty [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. We postulated that DuraGen, because it does not require suturing and suturing time, compared with Dura-Guard would have lower operating room cost, however, we did not find this to be the case. Therefore, the argument that surgeons can reduce cost by avoiding duraplasty, which requires suturing, was not supported by our results as reduction in surgical time did not translate into statistically significant reduction in costs.</p><p>Dura-Guard patients compared with DuraGen showed more improvement in quality of life at month 2. However, scores did not significantly differ between groups at the final follow up [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. This indicates that Dura-Guard patients may recover more quickly but DuraGen patients reach a comparable quality of life at 3 months postoperatively. The success of the Dura-Guard in clinical setting and possibly the quicker recovery time observed here could be attributed to its ability to be sutured securely in place, which provides an immediate occlusive seal.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>Nevertheless, both DuraGen and Dura-Guard patients had comparable results in the QLQ categories of total mental and total physical health [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>] and all patients showed significant improvement in outcome from months 1 to 3 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>], and most prominently in the categories of total physical health and physical function [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">b</xref>]. This, in our opinion, indicates the overall effectiveness of both implants and duraplasty techniques in the surgical treatment of CM I.</p><p>Interestingly, patients did not show a significant difference between months 1 and 3 for specific QLQ survey parameters physical role, pain, general health, vitality, social function, emotional role, or mental health [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>]. Furthermore, study subjects did not show a significant change in total QLQ score from months 1 to 3 following surgical intervention for CM I [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>]. This indicates that the bulk of improvement following posterior fossa decompression for CM I is related to total physical health and physical function. This may be in part because CM I pathology involves herniation of the cerebellum through the foramen magnum[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] and the cerebellum is primarily responsible for motor function. The cerebellum receives motor input from the cerebral cortex, balance information from the vestibular organs, and sensory information from the spinal cord. Its major function is related to motor learning.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] The purpose of posterior fossa decompression for CM I is to alleviate overcrowding of rhombencehpalic derivatives (the cerebellum) by creating a larger posterior fossa cavity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Thus alleviating the pressure on the cerebellum, caused by a small shallow posterior fossa, results in an improvement in motor function as seen by our SF-36 QLQ results. No specific QLQ survey parameters decreased from months 1 to 3 indicating a stabilization of all other parameters.</p><p>It should be noted that one of the limitations of this study was the small sample size and long period of accrual. The National Institutes of Health estimates the prevalence of CM I to be 1 in 1000 individuals and this may or may not include patients that are asymptomatic.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] The low accrual may not be a problem in a larger multi-institutional study that could provide more conclusive results and would further power this analysis. We conclude, however, that the differences in the study variables between dural patches and dural closure technique (DuraGen vs. Dura-Guard) are not statistically significant. Similarly, no difference has been observed in prior studies comparing autologous and nonautologous grafts in duraplasty for Chiari decompression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] All patients showed a significant improvement in their response to the question &#x0201c;Compared to one year ago, how would you rate you health in general now?&#x0201d; &#x02013; The average patient response to this question was &#x0201c;better&#x0201d; indicating treatment efficacy over the time course of the study. Neither DuraGen nor Dura-Guard had a significantly different response to this question. This should alleviate some controversy regarding the effectiveness of posterior fossa decompression for the treatment of CM I.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Multiple concerns that arise when using autologous collagen implants (inconsistent availability, surgical morbidity at the donor site, and the need for enlargement of original incision or creation of additional incisions) can be addressed by the processed bovine collagen grafts. Both sutureless and suturable xenogeneic dural substitutes are effective in reaching the goals of posterior fossa decompressive surgery for CM I. Interestingly, with the clinical course of both treatments being statistically similar, surgical time is the only variable that affects the surgeon and shorter surgical time is always preferred by any operating team. Furthermore, shorter surgical time translates into shorter duration of anesthesia and, at least theoretically, should improve outcome and lower the chances of complications. Based on our findings, we conclude that posterior fossa decompression with either duraplasty technique results in an improvement in patients compared with one year prior to surgery, as seen with patient's response to the outcome question, and emphasizes the physical deficits that can be alleviated with treatment. Furthermore, with similar clinical outcomes and comparable costs there is no benefit to the patient for surgeons to take additional effort suturing the dural graft. Ultimately, the choice of duraplasty material may be based upon the surgeon's preference.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors of the paper would like to express
