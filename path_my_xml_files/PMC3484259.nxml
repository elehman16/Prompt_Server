The aim of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of nabilone in reducing pain and frequency of headache, the number of analgesic intake and in increasing the quality of life on patients with long-standing intractable MOH. Thirty MOH patients were enrolled at the University of Modena&#x02019;s Interdepartmental Centre for Research on Headache and Drug Abuse (Italy) in a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, crossover study comparing nabilone 0.5&#x000a0;mg/day and ibuprofen 400&#x000a0;mg. The patients received each treatment orally for 8&#x000a0;weeks (before nabilone and then ibuprofen or vice versa), with 1&#x000a0;week wash-out between them. Randomization and allocation (ratio 1:1) were carried out by an independent pharmacy through a central computer system. Participants, care givers, and those assessing the outcomes were blinded to treatment sequence. Twenty-six subjects completed the study. Improvements from baseline were observed with both treatments. However, nabilone was more effective than ibuprofen in reducing pain intensity and daily analgesic intake (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05); moreover, nabilone was the only drug able to reduce the level of medication dependence (&#x02212;41&#x000a0;%, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01) and to improve the quality of life (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). Side effects were uncommon, mild and disappeared when nabilone was discontinued. This is the first randomized controlled trial demonstrating the benefits of nabilone on headache, analgesic consumption and the quality of life in patients with intractable MOH. This drug also appears to be safe and well-tolerated. Larger scale studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Medication overuse headache (MOH)</kwd><kwd>Treatment</kwd><kwd>Nabilone</kwd><kwd>Cannabinoid</kwd><kwd>Migraine</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2012</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Medication overuse headache (MOH) is a chronic headache (&#x02265;15&#x000a0;days/month) that develops from primary headaches (migraine, tension-type headaches). It has been described as the result of an interaction between an overused therapeutic agent and a susceptible patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>MOH is a common problem in tertiary headache centers, especially in patients with chronic migraine. The diagnosis is very important because patients seldom respond to prophylactic treatment, if the medication overuse for the acute condition continues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>MOH is a considerable burden for sufferers; its pathophysiology is unclear and its treatment has few evidence-based indications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>It has been suggested that this condition may be mediated by cognitive impulsiveness and has certain mechanisms in common with addiction and substance abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>A high percentage of patients with chronic daily headache with a high risk to develop MOH met the criteria for substance abuse according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). They also demonstrated that the prevalence of dependence according to DSM-IV varied with the different types of analgesic being overused [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>In most cases, treatment of MOH includes an abrupt interruption of medication overuse through appropriate supportive care and the introduction of prophylactic treatment. There is no evidence on the most efficacious way to discontinue medication overuse. As the number of patients with this kind of problem continues to grow, MOH has become one of the main challenges of headache treatment in headache clinics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Researches and current models are based on the assumption that it is caused by alterations in the nociceptive threshold and central sensitisation in susceptible individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>These processes have a number of characteristics in common with chronic neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia, chronic conditions for which nabilone has been tested with encouraging results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Increasing evidences are available concerning the benefits of cannabinoid agents in pain management, it should prompt to design larger and longer-term studies on their effects in homogeneous populations with chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>In one recent review of published studies on non-cancer pain, cannabinoids appeared to have proven safety and modest efficacy in the treatment of neuropathic pain whereas, there are some evidences of efficacy also in fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Other studies gave similar results in the management of neuropathic pain: one comparing nabilone and gabapentin used as add-on or mono-therapy in patients with peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and another comparing nabilone with dihydrocodeine in neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Nabilone is a synthetic cannabinoid CB1-receptor agonist (licensed in Canada since 1981 for chemotherapy-induced vomiting and nausea); it is well-tolerated and has a good safety profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Reports of its abuse are extremely rare and the drug has been even recently suggested to be a potential treatment for marijuana addiction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Cannabis derivatives have been suggested for the treatment of chronic pain conditions. Therefore, we tested the effects of nabilone in patients suffering from intractable/refractory MOH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The study was aimed to investigate the efficacy of nabilone in reducing headache days, intensity of pain and analgesic intake in these patients.</p><p>The enrolled patients in the past performed many therapeutic attempt to withdraw daily analgesic abuse, without any clinical benefits.</p><p>It was well known by clinicians that their refractory headache patients did not suspend their antimigraine drugs without an alternative treatment.</p><p>Our ethic commitee did not allow to deprive patients suffering from daily headache of analgesic drugs by using a placebo, so we choose to treat daily attacks with a unique drug for all patients, by using ibuprofene as rescue medication or another drug if it was ineffective.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>Between February 2009 and May 2010, 30 outpatients attending the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia&#x02019;s Interdepartmental Centre for Research on Headache and Drug Abuse (Italy) were enrolled.</p><p>Eligible patients were men and women who were not pregnant, aged between 35 and 65&#x000a0;years, with daily analgesic intake and who had MOH for at least 5&#x000a0;years.

The drugs were taken orally every day and each treatment period lasted 8&#x000a0;weeks. Neither the doctors and nurses nor study patients knew which treatment sequence had been allocated.</p><p>Sixty doses of nabilone (0.5&#x000a0;mg) and 60 doses of ibuprofen (400&#x000a0;mg) were prepared for each patient by an independent pharmacy, as identical white capsules and randomized in two containers, named Drug A and Drug B. The pairs of containers were consecutively numbered for each subject according to the randomization schedule, generated by a computer.

Headache frequency was evaluated using the Headache Index (HI), i.e. the number of headache days per month. The mean duration of pain was evaluated calculating the hours of pain per day (reported in the headache diary); the mean intensity of pain was recorded using the 10&#x000a0;cm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), which was administered at each visit. In addition, the reduction in the number of analgesics or antimigraine drugs taken during the observation period, was considered as an indirect efficacy parameter and it was measured as daily analgesic intake (DAI).</p><p>The secondary outcome measures were the improvement in the quality of life and mental health, assessed through the administered: HIT-6&#x02122; (Headache Impact Test), SF-36 questionnaire and the Zung Depression and Anxiety Scales. We also recorded the level of dependence using the Leeds Dependence Questionnaire (LDQ) appropriately modified for headache and consumption of analgesics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

Cannabinoid-1 receptors (CB1R) are co-localized with the opioid receptors on the dopaminergic cells of the nucleus accumbens, probably the most important structure in human reward pathways, which partly overlaps the antinociceptive pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>The oral administration of cannabinoid drugs shows poorer bioavailability than when these drugs are administered by inhalation. An oromucosal spray of THC was one way of releasing active principle into the central nervous system, however, the rapid administration of cannabinoid drugs had different effects to those observed with slow absorption: the reward system is activated by a rapid rise in cannabinoids concentration, such as to obtain a significant euphoric effect (a &#x02018;high&#x02019;), the main cause of dependence. The oral cannabinoids administration, on the other hand, avoids concentration peaks and with chronic administration, the individual differences in bioavailability are overcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The use of nabilone, a cannabinoid1-receptor agonist, would therefore appear reasonable in the treatment of MOH for which central mechanisms are hypothesised in the maintenance of chronic head pain due to medication overuse.</p><p>We studied a group of patients who had been suffering from MOH for a long time (on average more than 12&#x000a0;years) and who had used various pharmacological and other approaches, without achieving any positive results.</p><p>When resistant to conventional medical treatment and prophylactic medication this condition is known as refractory chronic migraine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>Our patients presented almost daily headache (HI&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.95&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.1), with really high DAI values at baseline (2.1&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.4). In these patients, the main unresolved problem is the excessive use of drugs for the acute treatment and the overall deterioration experienced in their quality of life, so the headache symptoms should be considered as part of the issue as a whole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Nabilone seemed more helpful in reducing the intensity of pain than the frequency.

DAI dropped during both treatments: &#x02212;36.2&#x000a0;% with ibuprofen (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01) and &#x02212;57.7&#x000a0;% with nabilone (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01), which was significantly superior to ibuprofen, in reducing analgesic intake (DAI&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.89&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.5 and 1.34&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.9, respectively, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). In addition, a deeper analyses showed significant differences between the DAI in single drug overusers and in multi drug overusers: during treatment with nabilone both SDO and MDO improved in a similar way, however, this was not so for the period of treatment with ibuprofen as MDO patients maintained higher overuse than SDO (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This result agrees with the clinical observation that multi drug overusers experience greater difficulties in reducing DAI and are less sensitive to treatments.

In addition, nabilone alone reduced the level of drug dependence (LDQ &#x02212;41&#x000a0;%, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01) and improved the quality of life scales (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). The number of days with headache was not significantly reduced in the same way as the other indicators, probably due to the short duration of the study. Side effects were infrequent, of mild intensity and disappeared after discontinuation of the treatment. This randomized, controlled trial evaluated the benefits of nabilone on headache, analgesic consumption and the improvements in quality of life in patients with MOH. Nabilone would also appear to be safe. Larger-Scale studies are required to confirm the effectiveness and safety of nabilone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>What is already known about this study: although cannabinoids have been used as painkillers for centuries, there is little evidence-based information available on their use. At low doses, they have few psychotropic side effects, which disappear rapidly in patients with chronic headache.</p><p>What this study adds: nabilone, a synthetic oral cannabinoid, is efficacious in
