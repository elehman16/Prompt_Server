cause endorphin release in the brain reward system. There is also evidence for the
involvement of the opioid system in human psychostimulant dependence. The acute effects of
an i.v. psychostimulant drug on the brain opioid system, however, have not yet been
investigated in humans. We hypothesized that an i.v. dose of amphetamine as compared to
placebo would cause an opioid release in the human brain reward system, measurable as a
reduction of the binding potential of the &#x003bc;-opioid receptor radioligand
[<sup>11</sup>C]carfentanil. Ten healthy young men were examined using positron emission
tomography (PET) and [<sup>11</sup>C]carfentanil in three sessions: at baseline; after
placebo; after an i.v. amphetamine dose of 0.3 mg/kg bodyweight. The order of amphetamine
and placebo was double-blinded and randomized. PET examinations were performed with a
Siemens high resolution research tomograph. Data were analysed with the simplified
reference tissue model, applying manually drawn regions of interest for every subject.
Using repeated measures analysis of variance, we found no significant differences in
[<sup>11</sup>C]carfentanil binding potential between amphetamine and placebo conditions
in any of the investigated brain regions. In contrast to data from rodent studies and a
recent study of oral amphetamine administration in humans, an i.v. dose of amphetamine
does not cause any acute opioid release in healthy human subjects. The postulated role of
the opioid system in mediating the effects of amphetamine needs to be further investigated
in animal models of the disease as well as in patient populations.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Amphetamine</kwd><kwd>brain imaging</kwd><kwd>carfentanil</kwd><kwd>positron emission tomography</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="2"/><ref-count count="37"/><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>While psychostimulants have acute effects on brain dopamine systems, there is also evidence
from several lines of research for the involvement of the opioid system in psychostimulant
dependence. For instance, positron emission tomography (PET) studies have revealed
functionally important changes in the brain opioid systems of cocaine users as compared to
controls (Gorelick <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">2005</xref>). There is also pharmacological evidence from
animal studies showing that the opioid antagonist naltrexone attenuates amphetamine-induced
locomotor sensitization and reinstatement of drug-seeking in rats (H&#x000e4;ggkvist <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">2011</xref>). In human subjects, naltrexone has been shown to significantly attenuate the
subjective effects of amphetamine in amphetamine-dependent subjects and healthy controls, as
well as reducing craving and risk of relapse to amphetamine use (Jayaram-Lindstr&#x000f6;m
<italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">2008<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">
<italic>b</italic>
</xref>). This is in line with studies linking the opioid system to the hedonic component of
reward (Berridge <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">2009</xref>).</p><p>A possible explanation of naltrexone's effect could be that amphetamine causes an
activation of the opioid system and that this activation is inhibited by opioid antagonists,
which thereby attenuate the rewarding effects of amphetamine. Indeed, several studies have
shown evidence of such stimulant-induced opioid release in the ventral striatum of rodents
(Olive <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">2001</xref>; Roth-Deri <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">2003</xref>; Soderman &#x00026; Unterwald, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">2009</xref>). Recently, a dose of oral amphetamine was shown
to induce decreases in [<sup>11</sup>C]carfentanil binding in healthy control subjects.
However, in this study there was no within-subject control for expectation effects and the
measurements were performed 3 h after dosing (Colasanti <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">2012</xref>). The acute effects of i.v. administration of
amphetamine on the opioid system have not yet been investigated in humans.</p><p>In this placebo controlled PET study of healthy, drug-naive subjects, we aimed to examine
the hypothesis that i.v. amphetamine induces an acute opioid release in the brain,
specifically in the ventral striatum, measurable as a reduction in binding of the &#x003bc;-opioid
receptor radioligand [<sup>11</sup>C]carfentanil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Materials and method</title><p>The study was approved by the Swedish Medical Products Agency, the regional Ethics Review
Board and the Radiation Safety Committee and performed in accordance with ICH guidelines for
Good Clinical Practice.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Ten healthy young men, aged 26.7&#x000b1;2.5 yr (mean&#x000b1;<sc>s.d</sc>.), were recruited by
advertising within the Karolinska Institutet. Screening procedures, including the Alcohol
Use Disorders Identification Test, Drug Use Disorders Identification Test and Mini
International Neuropsychiatric Interview, were performed by a study physician in order to
exclude subjects with any somatic or psychiatric disease or a history of any substance use
disorders either themselves or in a first-degree relative. At screening and on the test
days, subjects were tested for alcohol in exhaled air and with urine toxicology to exclude
use of any illicit drugs.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Magnetic resonance scanning</title><p>A T1 weighted magnetic resonance (MR) scan (1.5 T) was performed for every subject prior
to PET procedures to exclude intracranial pathology and obtain anatomical references for
definition of regions of interest (ROIs).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Design and test procedures</title><p>Applying a double-blind, cross-over randomized design, three PET examinations were
performed for each subject. The test days were approximately 1 wk apart, although three
examinations were delayed for technical reasons (performed after an interval of 20&#x02013;40 d).
The first examination served as a baseline measure, while the second and third
measurements were done after administration of an i.v. dose of dexamphetamine (0.3 mg/kg
bodyweight) or placebo. The order of amphetamine or placebo was randomized and
double-blind to avoid confounding with expectation effects.</p><p>After the amphetamine and placebo sessions, subjects were asked to subjectively rate, on
a scale from 0 to 100, how strongly they felt any effect of the drug and how strongly they
experienced any arousal or &#x02018;being high&#x02019;. They were also asked to rate how strongly they
would like to have more of the drug.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>PET examinations</title><p>We used the PET radioligand [<sup>11</sup>C]carfentanil, a selective &#x003bc;-opioid receptor
agonist (Frost <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">1985</xref>). [<sup>11</sup>C]carfentanil has been shown
to have excellent test&#x02013;retest reliability, making it a suitable ligand for cross-over
experiments (Hirvonen <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">2009</xref>). [<sup>11</sup>C]carfentanil is considered
sensitive to acute changes in opioid neurotransmission, based on previous findings of
reduced [<sup>11</sup>C]carfentanil binding potential (BP<sub>ND</sub>) in response to
behavioural or pharmacological challenges that have been interpreted as increased
endogenous opioid release (Hirvonen <italic>et al.</italic>

were no significant differences in these variables between the baseline, placebo and
amphetamine conditions [repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) for injected dose:

Molecular Imaging; Germany). For each subject, an individual helmet was made and attached
to a holder on the coach to minimize head movement. After a 6 min transmission scan using
a single <sup>137</sup>Cs source, the study drug (amphetamine/placebo) was injected into
an i.v. catheter and flushed with saline. Two minutes later, the radioligand was
administered as a rapid bolus and flushed with saline. List-mode data were acquired for 69
min, starting at the time of ligand injection. PET images were reconstructed from a series
of 16 time frames (3&#x000d7;1, 4&#x000d7;3 and 9&#x000d7;3 min), including modelling of the point spread
function, after correction for attenuation, randoms and scatter. This reconstruction
procedure yields a spatial resolution of 1.5 mm (Varrone <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">2009</xref>). PET images were corrected for head
movement using frame-by-frame realignment (Montgomery <italic>et al.</italic>

immediately caused evident subjective effects in all participants. Ratings of how much the
subjects &#x02018;felt&#x02019; the drug effect ranged from 50 to 100 (mean 88&#x000b1;16.9), feeling of &#x02018;high&#x02019; from
30 to 90 (mean 66&#x000b1;22.2) and how much they wanted more of the drug from 0 to 100 (mean
64&#x000b1;32.6). Placebo ratings were between 0 and 10 for all three questions. No serious adverse
events occurred during the study.</p><p>When analysing the PET data with repeated measures ANOVA, we found no significant effects
of amphetamine compared to placebo on the [<sup>11</sup>C]carfentanil BP<sub>ND</sub> for
ventral striatum, which was the primary ROI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig.

mean &#x00394;BP<sub>ND</sub> was &#x02212;0.037 in our sample, with <sc>s.d</sc>.=0.240, giving us a 95%
confidence interval of &#x02212;0.186 to 0.111 (or &#x02212;6.4 to 3.8%). In other words, we are confident
that amphetamine does not reduce BP<sub>ND</sub> in the ventral striatum by &#x0003e;6.4%, as
compared to placebo. Neither were there any effects of treatment when comparing to baseline
BP<sub>ND</sub> measures. ANOVA revealed no significant effects of order between

between different conditions as indicated by the standard deviation was higher than the
corresponding inter-individual variation in test&#x02013;retest difference shown previously. We
therefore proceeded in analysing associations between individual BP<sub>ND</sub> changes and
subjective ratings of amphetamine effects. However, we found no evidence of a correlation
between changes in [<sup>11</sup>C]carfentanil BP<sub>ND</sub> and the subjective effects of
amphetamine (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003e;0.1, data not shown).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present cross-over, randomized, placebo-controlled PET study, we found that an acute
i.v. dose of amphetamine did not change [<sup>11</sup>C]carfentanil BP<sub>ND</sub> in the
striatum, nor in the prefrontal cortex, amygdala or hippocampus. This is a surprising
finding that gives rise to several important questions.</p><p>The dose of amphetamine administered in this study (0.3 mg/kg bodyweight) is the one most
often used in human laboratory studies, causing strong, immediate subjective effects in
drug-naive individuals. This dose has been shown to induce a significant dopamine release in
the ventral striatum, measurable in human PET studies as a decrease of the dopamine
D<sub>2</sub>-receptor radioligand [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride BP<sub>ND</sub> by about 15%
(Drevets <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">2001</xref>). Importantly, a dose of 0.3 mg/kg bodyweight
was also used previously in studies showing that naltrexone blunts the subjective effects of
amphetamine (Jayaram-Lindstr&#x000f6;m <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">2008<italic>b</italic></xref>). Amphetamine-dependent patients often inject several
hundred mg and such a dose naturally gives rise to stronger pharmacological effects,
possibly including an activation of the opioid system. However, due to the risk of adverse
reactions, such doses cannot be administered to humans in an experimental setting. Animal
studies are therefore needed to investigate the opioid effects of amphetamine across a wider
dose range.</p><p>In this study, we started the PET measurement 2 min after the amphetamine/placebo injection
and continued for 69 min. A possibility is that amphetamine does cause an endogenous opioid
release that either evaporates too fast or commences too late for us to capture it in this
time frame. The 69 min time frame was chosen based on our previous studies, where
naltrexone's effects were already evident after a couple of minutes and stayed significant
over several hours (Jayaram-Lindstr&#x000f6;m <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">2008<italic>b</italic></xref>). In a rat microdialysis
study, the peak opioid activation following i.p. amphetamine administration came somewhat
later, but was clearly evident during the first hour (Olive <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">2001</xref>). Evidence from a recent animal study suggests
that opioid activation following cocaine administration i.p. peaks at 20 min (Soderman
&#x00026; Unterwald, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">2009</xref>). To test for signs of
such an early opioid activation, we did a <italic>post-hoc</italic> kinetic analysis using
only the first 39 min of the PET scan, a time frame that has previously been shown to have
good reliability with [<sup>11</sup>C]carfentanil (Hirvonen <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">2009</xref>). This analysis did not reveal any trend of
early opioid release, suggesting that our original time frame was adequate.</p><p>Several rodent studies have shown evidence of psychostimulant-induced opioid activation, a
finding that could not be translated to humans in this study. This might point to
physiological differences between species. Experiments using microdialysis in rats have
shown that an i.p. dose of 2 mg amphetamine/kg bodyweight gives rise to an increase of
dialysate endorphin levels in the accumbens, peaking at 300% (Olive <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">2001</xref>), and a dopamine increase peaking at 350%
(Butcher <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">1988</xref>). While i.p. doses in rats are hard to
translate directly to i.v. doses in humans, the dose used in this study is probably less
potent, even though it did cause strong behavioural effects. Other species differences,
particularly in the anatomy of the dopamine system, might therefore be more important in
explaining these results (Berger <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">1991</xref>).</p><p>In human subjects, as opposed to other animals, it is important to acknowledge expectation
effects since they may involve opioid mechanisms (Scott <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">2008</xref>). In this study, the subjects were aware that
they would not be administered any study drug during the first, baseline PET examination,
but in the second and third they would get either amphetamine or placebo intravenously. By
randomizing the order of placebo and amphetamine, we could control for expectation effects
and ANOVA showed no effect of order on [<sup>11</sup>C]carfentanil BP<sub>ND</sub>. Neither
was there any significant difference between the baseline (i.e. without study drug) and
medication conditions, which means that the expectation of an amphetamine injection did not
give rise to any measurable opioid activation.</p><p>This study was performed with healthy, drug-naive subjects, but the effects of amphetamine
may be quite different in amphetamine-dependent patients. For example, after three doses of
the same strength as in this study, a significant sensitization to amphetamine occurs with
an increased dopamine release in the striatum (Boileau <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">2006</xref>). Such mechanisms might also cause a downstream
recruitment of other neurotransmitter systems with repeated drug intake. Although we saw no
evidence of opioid activation in healthy subjects from this first dose of amphetamine, it is
possible that the opioid system becomes involved later in the development of stimulant
dependence, forming part of the neuro-adaptations in brain reward systems that create a
state of hedonic allostasis in the addicted brain (Koob &#x00026; Le Moal, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">2001</xref>). Indeed, recent PET studies have shown
significant alterations of [<sup>11</sup>C]carfentanil BP<sub>ND</sub> in chronic cocaine
patients as compared to healthy controls, changes that predict treatment outcome and are
correlated with drug craving and risk of relapse to cocaine use (Ghitza <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">2010</xref>; Gorelick <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">2005</xref>). Another recent study of alcohol-dependent
patients found that opiate-induced dopamine release in the ventral striatum was correlated
with the severity of alcohol dependence (Spreckelmeyer <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">2011</xref>), providing further evidence of the important
interactions between these two neurotransmitter systems in substance use disorders.</p><p>We have previously shown that naltrexone pretreatment attenuates the subjective response to
an acute dose of amphetamine to a greater extent in amphetamine-dependent patients than in
healthy subjects (Jayaram-Lindstr&#x000f6;m <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">2008<italic>b</italic></xref>). It is therefore possible that amphetamine does cause a
significant opioid release in the amphetamine-dependent, but not in the healthy, human
brain. Genetic variability between samples, particularly in the prevalence of the Asp40
single nucleotide polymorphism in the &#x003bc; opioid receptor gene that has been linked to
naltrexone response in alcohol dependence, might also have contributed to differences
between studies; although we do not have genetic data to prove this (Dlugos <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">2011</xref>).</p><p>Very recently, Colasanti <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">2012</xref>) published a study reporting a decrease in [<sup>11</sup>C]carfentanil
BP<sub>ND</sub> 3 h after an oral amphetamine dose of 0.5 mg/kg bodyweight. There are
several differences between our studies that may help explain the differences in results.</p><p>First, oral dosing differs substantially from i.v. administration of amphetamine in terms
of pharmacokinetics and also in the resulting subjective effects. Indeed, in Colasanti's
study, the high-dose group did not report any significant euphoria, while the subjects in
our study consistently reported strong effects of amphetamine as compared to placebo.</p><p>Another important difference is the timing of the PET measurements. We started within
minutes of the amphetamine injection, whereas Colasanti <italic>et al.</italic> waited 3 h
before injecting the radioligand. While a part of this interval is needed due to the slower
absorption of an oral amphetamine dose, it remains a significant difference between our
studies. Our choice of an immediate measurement was based on several lines of evidence, not
least previous studies showing a very fast reduction of (3)H-DAMGO binding after cocaine
administration in rodents (Soderman &#x00026; Unterwald, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">2009</xref>). Also, the euphoric effects of an i.v. amphetamine dose are immediate and
start to wear off gradually after 1&#x02013;2 h. Of course, if opioid release plays any important
role in these acute rewarding effects, it has to be present within this time interval rather
than 3 or 4 h later.</p><p>There are also some technical differences between the studies that might have influenced
the results. The increased resolution of the high-resolution research tomograph system
provides a higher signal recovery, which should provide additional sensitivity to changes in
binding (Schain <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">2012</xref>). Also, we had no bias in terms of differences
in injected mass or radioactivity between the different conditions. Finally, a particular
strength of our study is the cross-over randomization, which allowed us to do within-subject
comparisons while still controlling for expectation effects.</p><p>The results of these two PET studies suggest another possible explanation for the fact that
naltrexone attenuates the subjective effects of amphetamine, namely, that weak unspecific
adverse effects of naltrexone (e.g. nausea) might somewhat blunt the immediate effects of
amphetamine, while its specific action as an opioid antagonist blocks the prolonged euphoric
effects possibly caused by opioid release 2 or 3 h later.</p><p>To conclude, in this placebo-controlled PET study, an acute i.v. dose of amphetamine did
not cause any opioid release in the healthy human brain reward system. Furthermore, possible
expectation effects were not mediated by opioid activation, since order of
placebo/amphetamine did not change [<sup>11</sup>C]carfentanil BP<sub>ND</sub>. These
results are in contrast with earlier findings of stimulant-induced opioid activation in
rodents as well as recent data showing later effects of oral amphetamine using a slightly
different study design. Further studies are needed to more fully investigate this issue from
a translational perspective. With the recent development of small animal PET systems, the
effects of amphetamine on the opioid system could be studied across a wider dose range and
timescale than what is possible in humans. Studies of stimulant-dependent patients are also
needed to investigate the pathophysiological importance of the opioid system and its
potential as a therapeutic pharmacological target.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Per Stenkrona and Andrea Varrone, as well as other members of the
