It is also associated with several extra-articular symptoms (fatigue, sleep disorders, anxiety and depression) and a reduction of life quality. Studies have revealed that patients with OA benefitted from enhanced management via telemedicine. Guangdong Online Hospital (GOH) is the first officially recognized web-based hospital that provides telemedicine service in China. However, the effective implementation of GOH telemedicine (GOHT) to enhance management for patients with OA remains unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">An assessor-blinded, parallel randomized controlled trial will be performed to study the feasibility and effectiveness of GOHT in the enhanced management of OA. Forty participants with knee OA will be recruited for a 6-month study. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomly allocated to receive conventional therapy (CT) or conventional therapy plus a brief GOH-based intervention (CT-GOHT). The primary outcome is the feasibility of a full-scale randomized controlled trial. The secondary outcomes include the self-reported total score of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Assessments will be performed at baseline, 2&#x000a0;weeks, 3&#x000a0;months and 6&#x000a0;months later after the initiation of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This trial is intended to test the application of GOHT in the chronic management in knee OA. The hypothesis is that OA patients may receive disease management via this network platform conveniently and effectively, especially those in the remote areas of our country. GOHT telemedicine would be an attractive alternative to traditional methods for disease management in knee OA. The results could provide preliminary experiences and guidance for an upcoming full-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) in disease management via telemedicine.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ChiCTR: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=24717">ChiCTR1800014465</ext-link>.

Globally, the age-adjusted prevalence of knee OA is 3.8% and of hip OA is 0.85% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In China, the prevalence of symptomatic knee OA among people aged 45&#x000a0;years or older is 10.3% in women and 5.7% in men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. OA causes joint pain, functional impairment and disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Moreover, OA patients suffer from a series of extra-articular symptoms. It is reported that poor sleep is highly prevalent in OA patients and approximately 40% of OA patients have substantial fatigue which is related to pain, sleep disturbance and depressed mood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Besides, a considerable number of OA patients experience clinically significant depression and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. OA has become a very serious medical problem that significantly decreases the quality of patients&#x02019; life and causes large social and economic burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">As a prevalent chronic disease, OA patients are in need of long-term disease management to improve their quality of life and to prevent disability, and this demand is expected to increase greatly in the coming years with the rising incidence. As an emerging concept in health care, telemedicine, provides ways to remotely deliver consultations, treatments and monitoring disease activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Telemedicine has been shown positive results in feasibility, effectiveness and patient satisfaction in the use of chronic disease management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

Patients are able to receive online health services such as consultations, disease education and preliminary treatment suggestions through the telemedicine platforms with audio and video settings in the communities around the province. Our previous study has demonstrated that GOH provided a convenient platform for ankylosing spondylitis patients to receive effective disease management, especially those in the remote areas of the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The positive results encourage us to explore the role of GOHT telemedicine in the management of OA.</p><p id="Par21">Therefore, we design this trial to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of GOH for knee OA management in the context of a routine clinical care.

Advertising posters about the trial will be placed in the local newspapers, homepage of the hospital official website and WeChat (a popular social media application in China) official account. An overview of the trial and various announcements will also be available on these platforms. In the clinic, clinicians will be responsible for identifying the potential participants from the outpatients&#x02019; reception room, and will further make an overall assessment to decide whether they meet the requirements.

As the recommended sample size for a feasibility pilot trial is 12 per group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], we anticipate that the sample size of 40 participants will provide us with sufficient information about the feasibility of the intervention including the enrollment rate and the acceptability of the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Randomization and blinding</title><p id="Par27">Recruited participants will be randomly allocated to either the CT-GOHT group (intervention) or the CT group (control) at a 1:1 ratio.

As a kind of long-term chronic disease management, telemedicine has shown effectiveness in the treatment of OA by providing multi-faceted interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, a considerable number of OA patients in China are unlikely to receive long-term treatment due to poor adherence, drug resistance or lack of disease knowledge. Furthermore, China is a large country with regional imbalance in economic development, which makes it difficult for patients from the remote areas to receive high-quality medical services. Recently, the Chinese Government has put forward a series of policies including the &#x0201c;Internet Plus&#x0201d; action plan to deal with this situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par48">This study is an exploratory trial in response to the Internet Plus action plan by providing disease management via GOHT. It will reveal the willingness of patients to participate in the forthcoming RCT, adherence to the interventions and the possible dropout rates. In addition, this study will collect preliminary information regarding the effects of GOHT in relieving knee pain, stiffness and physical dysfunction, in improving fatigue, anxiety, depression and sleep quality in patients with knee OA. These will be useful for power calculations in future larger-scale RCTs. The potential limitation is that the participants may not turn up on time for clinic visits and GOHT visits during this 6-month study. Therefore, every participant will be provided with a task form with the accurate time of their appointments stated. The schedule of enrollment, interventions, and assessments is explained in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>.</p><p id="Par49">To the best of our knowledge, this is the first trial to explore the role of telemedicine in the management of OA patients in China. The findings from this study will contribute to better understanding of the practice of telemedicine in China. As a part of the Internet Plus action plan, our study has been encouraged by the provincial government and GOH is likely to provide telemedicine services for patients with other chronic diseases and help them with their health problems via a web-based disease management program. If GOH is feasible and effective in disease-enhanced management for patients with knee OA, a further larger-scale clinical trial will be conducted to test the effect of GOHT telemedicine on OA. This will eventually be beneficial for OA patients, especially for those in remote areas.</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par50">The trial is still pending at the time of manuscript submission.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec24"><p>
