Metabolic alterations and reduced immune competence lead to wasting and an increased risk of infectious complications. In the present study, the effect of a nutritionally complete medical food, which is high in protein and leucine and enriched with fish oil and specific oligosaccharides, was investigated on immune function, nutritional status, and inflammation in patients with esophageal cancer and compared with routine care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this exploratory double-blind study, 64 newly diagnosed esophageal cancer patients were randomized. All patients received dietary counselling and dietary advice. In the Active group, all patients received the specific medical food for 4&#x02009;weeks before the start of anticancer therapy. In the routine care control arm, patients with &#x0003c;5% weight loss received a non-caloric placebo product, and patients with weight loss &#x02265;5% received an iso-caloric control product to secure blinding of the study. The required study parameters of body weight and performance status were recorded at baseline and after 4&#x02009;weeks of nutritional intervention, and patients were asked to complete quality of life questionnaires.

Worldwide, the incidence of malnutrition during cancer ranges from 30 to 90%, being most prevalent in patients with esophageal, pancreatic, lung, prostate, or colon cancer.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The incidence and severity of malnutrition are affected by the type, location, grade, and stage of the tumor, as well as by anticancer treatments, patient characteristics, and individual susceptibility.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Severe and prolonged malnutrition can lead to cancer cachexia, which is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality, especially in advanced disease. Characteristics of this chronic condition of catabolism include progressive, involuntary weight loss (WL), anorexia, asthenia, fatigue, depletion of lipid stores, and severe loss of skeletal muscle proteins.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Other important features of the cachexia syndrome include the presence of a chronic inflammatory state and, paradoxically, a state of impaired immune responsiveness.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Several mediators that are either tumor-derived or host-derived (e.g. pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and prostaglandins) induce a cascade of events leading to a suppressed immune function, thereby reducing the acute response to infectious triggers.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> This compromised immune competence may lead to increased complications, delayed, or suboptimal anticancer treatment, and even to accelerated disease progression, resulting ultimately in a decreased quality of life and reduced survival rates in patients.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>To reduce the risk of (infectious) complications and to support the performance status of cancer patients, a multidisciplinary approach should be applied, in which nutritional intervention is recommended as an integral part of anticancer therapy to prevent involuntary weight loss and delayed treatment schedules and to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In malnourished patients, preoperative nutritional support is associated with a 50% reduction of post-operative complications,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> including decreased gastrointestinal toxicity, improved performance status, and increased immune responses.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> However, recent findings show that impaired immune responsiveness and muscle protein degradation may already occur before the onset of WL.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Consequently, it is of clinical relevance to provide the optimal treatment support as early as possible, preferably starting at diagnosis and running parallel to the pathway of anticancer therapies.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> However, today, routine care is often still limited to dietary counselling with, depending on the severity of the nutritional status, protein and energy supplementation.</p><p>Recently, a specific medical food* has been developed for application in cancer patients. This medical food is high in protein and leucine and is enriched with emulsified fish oil (containing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) and a specific oligosaccharide mixture and is designed to reduce complications and to provide optimal treatment support by reducing the inflammatory state, supporting immune function and nutritional status, and preserving muscle mass and function. These effects have been demonstrated in previous preclinical studies using an animal model of tumor-induced cachexia.<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The aim of this exploratory study was to investigate the effects of this medical food on immune function, nutritional status, and inflammation in an early phase in a group of newly diagnosed patients with esophageal cancer or adenocarcinoma of the gastro-esophageal junction before the start of anticancer therapy and to compare this with routine care.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="n1">1</xref>&#x0003e;</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>An explorative, randomized, controlled, double-blind study with parallel groups was conducted in order to determine the effect of a 4 week nutritional intervention with a specific medical food on immune function in newly diagnosed esophageal cancer patients before the start of anticancer therapy, compared with the effect of routine care (dietary counseling and advise to increase food intake with the addition of an iso-caloric or non-caloric placebo product depending on the nutritional state). The secondary objective was to assess the effects of this specific medical food on nutritional status and inflammation. Data on immune function, nutritional state, and inflammation of healthy volunteers were obtained to compare baseline values and allow an adequate interpretation of the data.</p><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>In the period between August 2007 and February 2009, 64 newly diagnosed patients with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma or squamous carcinoma located in the esophagus or gastro-esophageal junction (Siewert&#x02013;Stein classification type I-III)<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> planned for esophageal cancer treatment were recruited from the Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Patients had an age of 18&#x02009;years and above and were included in the study after informed consent was obtained. Exclusion criteria were life expectancy &#x0003c;3&#x02009;months, planned start of anticancer treatment within 3&#x02009;weeks, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &#x02265;2, esophagus-related surgery after diagnosis before inclusion, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in the past 5&#x02009;years, altered immune function, dysphagia score of 4, dependency on tube feed or parenteral nutrition during the previous 4&#x02009;weeks, use of fish oil-containing supplements during the previous 4&#x02009;weeks, intolerance or allergy to dairy products, fish, or other ingredients of the study products, dependency on fibre-free diet, pregnancy or lactation, dementia or altered mental status that would prohibit the understanding and giving of informed consent, any other medical condition that may interfere with the safety of the patient or the outcome parameters or uncertainty about the willingness or ability of the patient to comply with the protocol requirements, according to the investigator's judgment. In addition to the patients, a reference group of 40 healthy volunteers was recruited for the study from the database of Vaxinostics BV, University Vaccine Center Rotterdam Nijmegen, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Subjects in the reference group were age-matched and sex-matched with the Dutch esophageal cancer population, had a body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 30&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and were included in the study after signing an informed consent. Exclusion criteria for subjects in the reference group were significant involuntary weight loss in the past year, smoking, acute or chronic disease, altered immune function, pregnant or lactating, and any other condition that may interfere with the definition &#x02018;healthy volunteer&#x02019; according to the investigator's judgment.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The study was conducted in compliance with the principles of the &#x02018;Declaration of Helsinki&#x02019; (52<sup>nd</sup> WMA General Assembly, Edinburgh, Scotland, October 2000, including the Notes of Clarification as added in 2002, Washington, and in 2004, Tokyo) according to the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) guidelines and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The trial was registered in the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trials Number (ISRCTN) database with the Trial registration ID: ISRCTN28490479. After initial screening of the patients, subject characteristics, relevant medical history, dysphagia score, and anthropometrics were determined at visit 1 (baseline). Patients were randomized to the Active group receiving the specific medical food or to the Control group receiving routine care (dietary counselling and advice with the addition of an iso-caloric or non-caloric placebo product depending on the nutritional state), using a computerized randomization program after stratification based on their nutritional status. Patients with 0 to &#x0003c;5% weights loss in the past 3&#x02009;months and a dysphagia score of 0 or 1 (group 0&#x02013;5% WL) were either assigned to the Active group receiving the medical food or to the Control group receiving a Placebo product. Patients with &#x02265;5% weight loss in the past 3&#x02009;months and/or a dysphagia score of 2 or 3 and/or prescribed sip feed in the last 4&#x02009;weeks (group &#x02265;5% WL) were either assigned to the Active group receiving the medical food or to the Control group receiving an iso-caloric control product.</p><p>Patients were asked to complete the quality of life questionnaires and the required study parameters, as body weight and performance status were recorded at baseline (visit 1) and after 4&#x02009;weeks of nutritional intervention (visit 3). In addition, blood was drawn for the measurement of several immune-, nutritional-, and safety-parameters. Two&#x02009;weeks after the start of the study, patients visited the clinic (visit 2) to monitor the use of concomitant medication, body weight, and product palatability. The amount of study product taken was recorded daily in a diary by the patient. Patients with an intake of &#x0003c;75% of the minimum amount of 2&#x000d7;200&#x02009;mL Active or Control product per day were considered as noncompliant.</p><p>The subjects in the reference group were prescreened, and eligible subjects visited the clinic once. Subject characteristics, relevant medical history, and anthropometrics were determined, and the required study parameters were recorded. In addition, blood was drawn for the measurement of several immune- and nutritional-parameters. Subjects in the reference group did not receive any intervention with a study product.</p></sec><sec><title>Nutritional intervention</title><p>All patients received dietary counselling in addition to the nutritional intervention. The prescribed product intake during the study was 2 doses (2 &#x000d7; 200&#x02009;mL sip feed) of either the Active medical food or Control product daily for patients in group 0&#x02013;5% WL and at least 2 doses for patients in group &#x02265;5% WL. The Active medical food is an energy dense (163&#x02009;kcal/100&#x02009;mL), nutritionally complete oral supplement (FortiCare) that is high in protein and leucine (9.9&#x02009;g protein/100&#x02009;mL of which 3.2&#x02009;g whey protein/100&#x02009;mL, 5.6&#x02009;g casein/100&#x02009;mL, and 1.1&#x02009;g free leucine/100&#x02009;mL) and is enriched with emulsified fish oil (0.6&#x02009;g EPA and 0.3&#x02009;g DHA/100&#x02009;mL), specific oligosaccharides (1.2&#x02009;g galactooligosaccharides (GOS) and 0.2&#x02009;g fructooligosaccharides (FOS)/100 mL) and a balanced mix of vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. The Control product is for group 0&#x02013;5% WL, a non-caloric Placebo product and for group &#x02265;5% WL, an energy dense (163&#x02009;kcal/100&#x02009;mL) iso-caloric standard nutritional product to provide patient with routine care and secure sufficient nutrient intake for a good preparation for their treatment. All products (active, iso-caloric, and placebo) were provided in white 200&#x02009;mL tetra packs in three different flavors (mocha, banana, and fruitcake). (Nutricia NV, Zoetermeer, The Netherlands, for details, see <italic>Table</italic> S1,). The products were delivered as ready-to-drink with a straw attached to each pack for patient convenience. The study products carried identical product labels and were packaged in such a way that the double-blind design of the study was effectively maintained throughout the study.

Therefore, the expected difference between the Active and Control group and its variance was estimated.

The results were reviewed to check whether the calculated sample size was adequate and that no safety concerns had arisen. From this interim analysis, it was concluded that in order to find differences on the primary outcome, the sample size had to be adjusted to an unrealistically high number of patients. Therefore, it was decided to stop the study and perform the final analysis on the available 64 patients. All subjects that received the study products were included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. For baseline comparisons, the differences between healthy volunteers and total patients, group 0&#x02013;5% WL and group &#x02265;5% WL and between the Active and Control group were determined. Moreover, the differences between visit 1 and 3 were compared between the Active and Control group and between group 0&#x02013;5% WL and group &#x02265;5% WL.</p><p>The results of the ConA and LPS stimulations were corrected for the unstimulated cultures by subtraction of the latter. ANOVA, with treatment and stratification for group 0&#x02013;5% WL and group &#x02265;5% WL as covariates, was used to analyse the measurement of the study parameters. When the data were not normally distributed, the Mann&#x02013; Whitney <italic>U</italic> test adjusted for stratification (group 0&#x02013;5% WL and group &#x02265;5% WL) was used, and correlations were made using the Spearman's Rank test.

This effect was accompanied by a significant reduction of serum PGE<sub>2</sub> levels in the patients. However, no effects of the nutritional intervention were observed on proliferation responses or cytokine production in PBMC.</p><p>Patients in group &#x02265;5% WL had lost significantly more weight in the past 3&#x02009;months than patients in group 0&#x02013;5% WL, which might contribute to the induction of a (pre) cachectic state and consequently into more inflammation. In the present study, this was confirmed by higher baseline levels of PGE<sub>2</sub> in group &#x02265;5% WL compared with group 0&#x02013;5% WL. After the nutritional intervention with the Active medical food, body weight change was significantly improved in the total group when compared with routine care. Calorie intake in these patients was not controlled, but all patients received dietary counselling and dietary advice to increase food intake, and products were taken in addition to their normal diet. PGE<sub>2</sub> levels were also reduced after the nutritional intervention with the Active medical food, demonstrating most pronounced effects in group &#x02265;5% WL. Accordingly, a relation between the improved body weight and reduced serum PGE<sub>2</sub> levels may exist via the reduction of (pre-) cachexia and inflammation by the anti-inflammatory nutrients in the Active product, because body weight shows a significant inverse correlation with serum PGE<sub>2</sub> levels in group &#x02265;5% WL (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02). However, the presence of high protein and leucine in the Active medical food may have contributed to the preservation of body weight. Leucine has been added to the Active product to provide an anabolic trigger for muscle protein synthesis, and high levels of protein were added in order to provide sufficient amounts of protein-building blocks. The acute effect of this composition on muscle protein synthesis has recently been shown in a clinical study in catabolic cancer patients with involuntary weight loss,<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and the effects on muscle mass and function have been demonstrated in previous preclinical studies using an animal model of tumor-induced cachexia.<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In the present study, the effects of the medical food on muscle function are reflected by a significantly improved ECOG performance status after the intervention with the Active medical food compared with the Control group. Cachectic cancer patients often suffer from a reduced activity and decreased performance status, which is related to the increase of weight loss in these patients affecting the muscle compartments as well.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Moreover, weight loss and a decreased performance status may negatively affect immune competence, leading to an increased risk of (infectious) complications.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In relation with the observed weight loss, McMillan described the link between weight loss, poor performance status, poor response to treatment, and poor prognosis, which is probably due to loss of skeletal muscle. Although the loss of adipose tissue accounts for the majority of the weight loss, the loss of muscle accounts for most of the morbidity and mortality.<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> PGE<sub>2</sub> might also be involved, because a rise in PGE<sub>2</sub> is suggested to be associated with muscle protein degradation in cancer cachexia.<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Consequently, reduced PGE<sub>2</sub> levels might diminish the loss of muscle function and thereby improve ECOG performance status.</p><p>Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> is one of the best studied eicosanoids that contributes to the inflammatory state and immune suppression during the course of cancer.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> It is involved in several human malignancies including colon, lung, breast, and head and neck cancer and is produced during the course of inflammation in response to growth factors, hormones, and inflammatory cytokines.<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> PGE<sub>2</sub> is produced by various types of cancer cells and their surrounding cells, leading to a range of oncogenic effects including stimulation of cell proliferation, protection against apoptosis, and induction of migration and invasion.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> In addition, it can induce epithelial cells to secrete growth factors, pro-inflammatory mediators, and angiogenic factors, switching a normal microenvironment to a tumor-supporting environment.<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> PGE<sub>2</sub> contributes to the shift of the tumor microenvironment from an antitumor Th1 response to an immunosuppressive Th2 response by down-regulating Th1 cytokines (IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>, TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, and IL-2) and up-regulating Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10) and has a clear role in the regulation of immune suppression.<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>A reduction of PGE<sub>2</sub> might be important to reduce the inflammatory state and to improve immune responsiveness in cancer patients. Clinically, this may lead to an improved acute response to infectious triggers and may beneficially affect tumor immunity. For that reason, the reduction of serum PGE<sub>2</sub> levels in the present study, observed after the nutritional intervention of the medical food, could be beneficial for these cancer patients. Each of the product features, being fish oil, specific oligosaccharides, high protein, and leucine, might play a specific role in this process, but overlapping biological activities and synergistic interactions between them eventually lead to the overall effect.<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>The cancer patients in the present study showed significant lower percentages total n-3 PUFAs (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.006) and EPA (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001) in plasma compared with HV.

This is partly because of the high compliance to the study product, inducing comparable effects as observed in a previous study in healthy volunteers.<xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> The increase in n-3 PUFAs was partly at the expense of the n-6 PUFA AA, but the total percentage n-6 PUFAs was decreased significantly. Because AA can be used as a substrate for the COX-enzyme to produce PGE<sub>2</sub>, a reduction in AA may explain the decrease in PGE<sub>2</sub>, but other factors were involved. The specific oligosaccharides (GOS/FOS) may affect the process of PGE<sub>2</sub> production as well. These non-digestible oligosaccharides are fermentable fibers that have been associated with a reduced production of PGE<sub>2</sub> and pro-inflammatory cytokines in different parts of the gut.<xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> In addition, immune modulatory effects and other health benefits as an improved gut barrier function have been described, which may be related to their prebiotic properties.<xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> Besides the direct effect of fish oil and the oligosaccharides on PGE<sub>2</sub> metabolism, these ingredients were also described to reduce the systemic inflammatory state by decreasing the production of several inflammatory mediators.<xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></p><p>In contrast to the effects on PGE<sub>2</sub>, no effects were observed on other inflammatory mediators as IL-6, TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, IL-8, IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> and CRP (<italic>Table</italic> S3), but levels of these markers were very low. Nevertheless, baseline levels of IL-6, IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> and CRP were significantly higher in the total patient group compared with healthy volunteers, even though a more severe inflammatory state of these patients was expected before the start of the study. In the patient group, baseline CRP levels were significantly higher in group &#x02265;5% WL, compared with group 0&#x02013;5% WL, indicating a more severe inflammatory state of the patients in group &#x02265;5% WL.</p><p>In addition, no effects of the nutritional intervention were observed on proliferation responses or cytokine production in PBMC. This could partly be explained by the fact that the total patient group did not differ from the healthy volunteers in respect to their immune status at baseline. In contrast to these findings, esophageal cancer patients are frequently described to be at high risk for malnutrition and reduced immune responsiveness, especially around major surgery.<xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> However, these studies were primarily performed in Japan, where the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus is higher compared with adenocarcinoma,<xref rid="b51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> whereas in the present Dutch study, adenocarcinoma of the esophagus is mostly observed.</p><p>It appears that the patients included in this study had a better immune function than expected, possibly due to the type of cancer or the early phase of patient inclusion, just after diagnosis. Goto demonstrated a reduced production of IL-2, IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> and IL-10 in PHA-stimulated PBMC and a reduction of IL-12 and TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> in LPS-stimulated PBMC of cancer patients compared with healthy controls.<xref rid="b52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> However, these patients suffered from different types of advanced cancer, which were irresectable with multiple metastases. Other explanations for the lack of effects on these immunological parameters were the high number of differences between Active and Control already at baseline and the higher drop-out of patients in group &#x02265;5% WL in the Control group, leading to a skewed distribution of patients with milder and more advanced disease between Active and Control groups, possibly obscuring treatment effects. The high variance on the various immune parameters in combination with a relatively small group size was an important discussion point as well. In addition to that, another limitation of the study was the absence of a calorie measurement tool that could have made the conclusion on body weight ascribed to the specific nutritional intervention more specific.</p><p>In conclusion, the present exploratory study demonstrates a significant increase in body weight and an improved ECOG performance status in newly diagnosed esophageal cancer patients after a 4 week nutritional intervention with medical food, which is high in protein and leucine and enriched with emulsified fish oil (containing EPA and DHA) and a specific oligosaccharide mixture compared with routine care (control group with an iso-caloric or placebo product). This effect is accompanied by a significant reduction of serum PGE<sub>2</sub> levels of the patients and an efficient incorporation of n-3 PUFAs. Moreover, the medical food is well-appreciated with a high compliance rate of study product intake. No clinically relevant safety concerns were reported, and no changes in blood safety parameters were measured. Consequently, these results show that nutritional intervention with the specific medical food may represent a new opportunity for applications in cancer patients being an integral part of disease management to provide optimal treatment support. However, additional research is recommended to elucidate the potential immunological effects in different types and stages of cancer.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank M.
