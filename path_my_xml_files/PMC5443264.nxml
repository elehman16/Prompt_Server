In the present study, it has been identified that chemotherapy lasting &#x0003c;6 months [ultra-short course chemotherapy (UCCT)], rather than the 6&#x02013;18 months of the traditional regimen, is effective in sustaining TB clearance following complete surgical debridement. This current study aims to compare the changes in peripheral blood gene expression prior to and following UCCT, subsequent to complete debridement of spinal TB lesions. The study includes 5 patients without TB and 27 patients with spinal, divided into three groups: Group 1 (untreated group, n=8); group 2 (UCCT treatment group, n=9); and group 3 (UCCT treatment 1 year follow-up group, n=10). Gene changes were detected using DNA microarray analysis, confirmed through reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and the results were examined using the DAVID Knowledgebase to identify the pathways and functions of differentially expressed genes. TB lesions were active in group 1, while groups 2 and 3 showed no signs of active TB, as indicated by clinical manifestations and imaging. Comparison of the transcription profiles of the control and study groups showed that treatment of spinal TB resulted in upregulation of genes that are associated with immune response pathways; RT-qPCR produced similar findings. In conclusion, these results indicate that UCCT is an effective treatment against TB following complete surgical debridement. Furthermore, DNA microarray analysis proved a useful tool to evaluate the effects of spinal TB treatment on the expression of genes associated with immune response pathways.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>spinal tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>surgical debridement</kwd><kwd>ultra short-course chemotherapy</kwd><kwd>DNA microarray</kwd><kwd>DAVID pathway analysis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a lethal disease caused by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> that is commonly diagnosed worldwide. In 2012 there were 8.6 million new TB cases and 1.3 million mortalities resulting from TB (<xref rid="b1-etm-0-0-4170" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). TB primarily infects the lung; however, 1% of all TB cases involve the spinal column (<xref rid="b2-etm-0-0-4170" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Traditional treatments for spinal TB involve chemotherapy and surgery. The chemotherapy regimen involves 2&#x02013;4 drugs, such as isoniazid and rifampicin, with the duration of usage ranging between 6 and 18 months (<xref rid="b3-etm-0-0-4170" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). This long duration of chemotherapy can have adverse effects on patients and may lower patient compliance. Ultra-short course chemotherapy (UCCT), chemotherapy lasting &#x0003c;6 months, can be used as a treatment in patient's with spinal TB to counter these issues. In the present study, the blood transcript signatures of patients with spinal TB prior to and following treatment with UCCT, subsequent to complete debridement of TB lesions, were identified. The chemotherapy included streptomycin (S), isoniazid (H), rifampicin (R) and pyrazinamide (Z). Results of previous studies have demonstrated that UCCT with a mean duration of 5.5 months is effective in treating patients with spinal TB (<xref rid="b4-etm-0-0-4170" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b6-etm-0-0-4170" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Although surgical treatment and UCCT improve spinal TB, the pathways involved in clearing spinal TB are uncharacterized. Therefore, the present study utilized DNA microarray analysis to measure the gene expression profiles from the whole blood of patients with spinal TB prior to and following treatment. Spinal TB varies in the severity of infection and prognosis (<xref rid="b7-etm-0-0-4170" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). DNA microarray analysis can identify the pathways associated with spinal TB infection and provide insight into the effectiveness of the UCCT regimen used.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Patient selection</title><p>A total of 38 patients with TB that underwent complete debridement of lesions and UCCT were recruited from the Department of Spinal Surgery at the General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University (Yinchuan, China) between October 2010 and June 2011. Peripheral blood samples were collected from these patients at various treatment periods. Out of the recruited 38 patients, only 27 patients had verified spinal TB by RNA quality testing, this consisted of 13 males and 14 females, ranging between 17&#x02013;72 years old (average 38.8&#x000b1;15.6 years). Tuberculous lesions were found in the lumbar region (n=11), thoracic region (n=8), thoracolumbar region (n=5), lumbosacral segment region (n=2), and thoracic and lumbar damage of the region (n=1). In all cases, complete debridement of the lesions was performed, followed by interbody graft fusion and internal fixation between the focal vertebras (<xref rid="b4-etm-0-0-4170" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-etm-0-0-4170" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b7-etm-0-0-4170" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Complete debridement, based on traditional debridement, involves tissues including the edge of lesions, the multi-cavity and bony bridge being cleaned (<xref rid="b4-etm-0-0-4170" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-etm-0-0-4170" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>In the control group of 7 patients without TB, 5 peripheral blood samples were confirmed to not have spinal TB by RNA quality testing. <xref rid="tI-etm-0-0-4170" ref-type="table">Table I</xref> provides the study group descriptions.

Based on the different therapeutic periods, the peripheral blood samples of the 27 patients in the study group were divided into three groups (<xref rid="tI-etm-0-0-4170" ref-type="table">Table I</xref>). Group 1 consisted of 8 untreated, TB-infected individuals that received no treatment prior to hospitalization, with clinical data indicating active spinal TB. Group 2 consisted of 9 TB-infected individuals that had thorough clearance of focal lesions and UCCT for 4&#x02013;6 months (mean, 5.5 months). Their clinical data indicated lesion healing and fusion of the interbody graft. Group 3, the 1 year follow-up group, consisted of 10 individuals that had not been taking medications for 5&#x02013;6 months following initial UCCT. The clinical results of groups 2 and 3 showed a similar recovery of spinal function and interbody healing. Additionally, a control group consisting of 5 uninfected individuals was used for this study.</p><p>In the control group, there were 5 cases of carpal tunnel syndrome (2 males and 3 females, aged between 35 and 50 years old, mean age 40.6&#x000b1;7.4 years old).

Considering the differences between individuals, peripheral blood samples were collected from patients at various treatment periods. The consistency of the study and clinical results demonstrated the reliability of this detection method. Previous studies reported that UCCT lasting &#x0003c;6 months has proved effective in the initial treatment of pulmonary TB (<xref rid="b10-etm-0-0-4170" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13-etm-0-0-4170" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In addition, complete debridement and UCCT for spinal TB have proven to be clinically effective (<xref rid="b4-etm-0-0-4170" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b6-etm-0-0-4170" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In the present study, it is demonstrated that using DNA microarray technology to determine whole blood transcriptional profiles at various stages of spinal TB treatment is a promising adjunctive therapeutic tool. Transcriptional profiling can be used to measure the changes in gene expression prior to and following treatment, so it can be used to indirectly evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of treatment and accurately determine the type and severity of infection (<xref rid="b10-etm-0-0-4170" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b14-etm-0-0-4170" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b17-etm-0-0-4170" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>DNA microarray technology and gene cluster analysis using the DAVID knowledgebase were used to detect the gene expression profiles from the peripheral blood of patients with spinal TB at the three different stages: Prior to spinal TB treatment (group 1), following the completion of UCCT treatment (group 2) and 1 year post-UCCT treatment (group 3). These profiles were then compared with those of healthy controls. As shown in the heat map of all the groups, a transition from the downregulation of certain genes to upregulation of certain genes was identified over the course of spinal TB treatment. It was observed that following the removal of TB lesions with surgical debridement and subsequent UCCT, the expression of certain genes increased in the peripheral blood of the treated groups (group 2 and group 3). This heat maps provide an overview of the changes in the gene expression from the microarray data. The 2,971-transcriptional profile can be used to observe whether the treatment has an effect on spinal TB.</p><p>Furthermore, analysis of the groups in comparison to one another provided an overview of the effects of spinal TB treatment on changes in gene expression. For example, although few changes were identified between the control group and group&#x02248;1, a separate analysis identified 125 differentially expressed genes between the two groups. Profiling expression of these 125 genes may prove useful in separating TB-infected individuals from uninfected individuals. In addition, transcriptional profiling provided an indication of the infection phases of TB. Bioinformatical pathway analysis using the DAVID knowledgebase between TB infected patients and healthy controls identified 2 pathways that are associated with TB infection: Small cell lung cancer associated signaling and the APP pathway. These pathway changes are consistent with TB infection, since TB primarily infects the lung. The changes observed in small cell lung cancer-associated signaling indicated the infectious phase of TB spread from the lungs to the spine. Observed activity in the APP pathway indicated that TB infection was triggering an immune response. One explanation for the downregulation of genes that were upregulated in the control group, is that TB infection is downregulating the expression of genes that would interfere with its spread. Further studies are needed to explore the genes that are downregulated following TB infection.</p><p>In patients with spinal TB who underwent UCCT treatment, 1,550 differentially expressed genes were identified from cluster analysis. It was observed that genes that were downregulated in the control group were upregulated in UCCT-treated patients. This transcriptional profile was found to be associated with several immune response-related pathways including the following: Autophagy, inflammation, apoptosis and protein degradation. This shows that the clearance of TB and UCCT treatment serve a primary role in inducing an immune response. This 1,550-gene transcriptional profile reflects the changes in gene expression between individuals exposed to UCCT compared with healthy controls. The activation of apoptosis and protein degradation pathways are indicative of the toxic side effects of chemotherapy. However, activation of B and T cell receptors, APP and natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathways were additionally noted. This suggests that treatment with UCCT and complete debridement supports the clearance of spinal TB.</p><p>In patients who had completed treatment (1 year follow-up), there was a change in the expression of 400 genes and a reduced number of altered cell death pathways compared to healthy controls. A continued upregulation in these genes in comparison to the control group was observed. The upregulation of these genes is not attributable to UCCT, as treatment was 1 year ago. Pathway analysis identified that, compared with the control group, a lesser number of immune response, inflammation and apoptosis associated pathways were changed. These changes demonstrate that patients are recovering both from TB and the chemotherapy treatment as spinal tuberculosis itself is an inflammatory reaction; as the inflammatory response after one year follow-up indicators are decreased, the treatment is effective.</p><p>The present study identified transcriptional profiles that changed over the course of spinal TB treatment. In addition to evaluating the profile changes, the transcriptional profiles of untreated and treated spinal TB groups were compared, along with comparing the 1 year follow-up group with the treated TB group. The transcriptional profiles of 1,989 genes were found to differ between the untreated and treated spinal TB patients. Pathway analysis identified 41 pathways that differed between the two groups. These pathways were associated with cancer, inflammation, the immune response and apoptosis. The heat map confirmed that the treated patient displayed an upregulation of genes associated with those pathways. Interestingly, when comparing the untreated and the 1-year post-treatment of patients with spinal TB, the number of differentially expressed genes reduced to 824, which were associated with protein degradation and the immune system. Although the genes associated with these pathways are upregulated in group 3, the decreased number of upregulated genes compared with the untreated group showed that the individuals were recovering.</p><p>The difference in the transcriptional profiles between the treated spinal TB group and the 1 year post-treatment group was examined to evaluate the changes in gene expression following UCCT and complete debridement. There was no increase in the number of differentially expressed gene. Instead, it was observed that there were only 27 differentially expressed genes between group 2 and group 3. These genes are associated with the RIG-1 like receptor pathway. These receptors recognize viruses, which trigger an innate immune response. The reduced number of differentially expressed genes showed that patient's gene expression levels are returning to normal 1 year post-treatment. The heat maps showed that the differentially expressed genes were downregulated when comparing group 3 with group 2. In addition, the heat maps confirmed that following therapy, a number of genes are downregulated to similar levels of those in the control group.</p><p>The present study shows that the gene expression in the peripheral blood of spinal TB patients changes over the course of treatment. The gene expression levels measured are consistent with the clinical results in the current study, indicating that complete surgical debridement and 5&#x02013;6 months of UCCT have therapeutic efficacy on spinal TB. The complete debridement of TB lesions removes the barriers that prevent the medication from targeting the infected area (<xref rid="b9-etm-0-0-4170" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Analysis of the upregulated differentially expressed genes found that they are involved in immune response pathways. These changes at the different stages of treatment indicate the clearance of TB with UCCT and complete debridement. The removal of TB from the lesion relieved the host immune system and promoted expression of regulatory factors that are involved in clearing the bacteria (<xref rid="b18-etm-0-0-4170" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, the present study has demonstrated for the first time that DNA microarray technology can detect and monitor the changes in gene expression in the peripheral blood cells of patients with spinal TB at different therapeutic stages. This is shown through the consistency of the study results, clinical results and the differentially expressed genes associated with immune responses between groups. Evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of spinal TB treatments could prove an important application of DNA microarray technology. In addition, the microarray data allowed the use of heat maps to monitor changes during TB infection and treatment with UCCT. These heat maps can be used to determine how effective TB treatments are. Additionally, the present study provides an important insight into novel genes involved in the immune response against TB. The next step is to screen for UCCT-specific gene targets, in order to elucidate genes involved in the chemotherapeutic response.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The present study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 81260282) and the Ningxia Natural Science Foundation (grant nos.
