Incidence of NP in general ICU patients varies between 8 and 20%. This risk is about 10 folds higher in ICU patients treated with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation as compared to patients with no respiratory therapy devices.</p><p>Nosocomial pneumonia is associated with a high mortality rate of around 30%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref>]</p><p>Patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) have a longer duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay and hospital stay. It is also associated with increased hospital charges.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref>]</p><p>Incidence of VAP increases by 1 to 3% per day of intubation, and it increases hospital stay by 4-9 days and contributes to 15% of hospital deaths.</p><p>To add to this problem, successful treatment of patients with NP is still a challenging task for intensivists. No concensus has still been reached regarding issues like optimal antimicrobial therapy or duration of treatment. Controversy still exists regarding preference for monotherapy or combination therapy and also use of endotracheal or aerosolized antibiotics as either sole or adjunctive therapy.</p><p>In the face of such a scenario, prevention of VAP becomes a dire need for the success of emergency and intensive medicine in order to decrease morbidity and mortality, duration of hospital stay and health care costs. This is especially important in patients who already have an anticipated prolonged ICU stay, for example polytrauma patients with head injury and major chest and abdominal injuries, requiring ventilatory support. Any superadded iatrogenic infections in such patients, worsens their prognosis along with increasing hospital stay and economic burden.</p><p>There are several recommendations for prevention of infections. Changing of tubing regularly and sterilization of the tubing may be expensive, time consuming and environmentally unfriendly. Further, some studies showed that these methods are not always effective. In recent years, use of filters has become very popular in intensive care since this is user friendly, effective and economical.</p><p>As the patient is the most likely source of initial contamination of a circuit, probably the most logical place to position the filter is as near to the patient as possible. The &#x02018;ideal patient end&#x02019; filter should totally retain contaminated liquids, have high airborne microbial removal efficiency, a low resistance during clinical use and be able to be left in place during nebulization. In addition, the device should also act as a heat and moisture exchanger (HME). Currently, there are a whole range of different devices that have been proposed for use at the &#x02018;patient end&#x02019; of a breathing circuit and it is extremely difficult to know whether or not a device possesses these attributes.</p><p>The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of two different types of HME filters in reducing transmission of infection from the patient to ventilator and vice versa and its cost effectiveness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><p>A randomized, controlled, double blind, prospective study was conducted in the Intensive Care Unit of a tertiary care hospital on medico-surgical patients (including trauma cases). Sixty consecutively admitted patients of either sex and age ranging between 20 and 60 years who required mechanical ventilation for an anticipated period of more than 48 h were selected for the study. The study included patients who had to be urgently intubated in the emergency room, cardiac unit or high dependency unit of the hospital or who could not be extubated after an emergency surgery and were then shifted to the ICU for further management. The study was approved by the departmental board of studies and written consent was obtained from the patient's relatives.</p><p>Following intubation of the patients, the HME device was attached to the breathing circuit randomly. The HME device routinely used in our center (Hygrobac &#x02018;S&#x02019; type) was taken as the control and compared with a newer variety (Intersurgical type). The randomization was done by the chit-in-a box method.

Contamination of breathing systems, which can arise either via medical gases or through the patient, is a major source of ventilator acquired pneumonia (VAP).</p><p>Ventilator acquired pneumonia (VAP) is an expensive, time consuming and potentially fatal complication of respiratory therapy. Various prophylactic measures have been suggested for prevention of VAP, e.g., proper patient positioning, use of oscillating beds, aspiration of subglottic secretions, ventilator circuit management, stress ulcer prophylaxis etc.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref>]</p><p>Recently, use of bacterial and viral filters in ventilator circuits has become a very popular and cost-effective means of reducing infection secondary to mechanical ventilation. It is now well known that the use of humidified gases in ventilated patients is associated with better preservation of ciliary motion of the respiratory tract and lesser chances of infection. Humidification of gases can be done by either active (Heat Humidifiers) or passive (HME devices) methods. Heat Humidifiers use an external humidification source for providing moist gases to patients whereas HMEs use patient's own heat and moisture for the same. It has been found in various studies that the technique of humidification offers no benefit in mortality rates or rate of development of VAP.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref>] Use of HME devices considerably reduces nurses' workload and financial demands and is thus more user friendly than heat humidifiers.</p><p>In this study, cultures were taken from three sites. Endotracheal aspirate soon after intubation on culture indicated the prior presence of any respiratory tract infection. Taken from the patient end of the device after 24 h, it indicated the spread of infection from the patient towards the ventilator. Cultures taken from the machine end of the device determined the efficacy of the filter in preventing the transmission of microorganisms from the patient to the ventilator circuit. They were taken serially after 24 and 48 h to determine the duration for which the device could be used.</p><p>Correlation between the microorganisms detected in the endotracheal aspirates and those found on the HME device indicate that the contamination was obtained from the patient and spread towards the ventilator. The only case which had a positive culture on the machine end with a negative culture on the patient end probably got the contamination from the ventilator rather than the patient, since the endotracheal aspirate of this patient was also sterile.</p><p>We found that many of our patients had chest infection at the time of intubation, more so in medical rather than surgical patients. This is possible as most of these patients were already hospitalized and were admitted to the ICU from the wards. Therefore, it is quite likely that they already had acquired nosocomial infections, especially if they had also been immunocompromized due to their prolonged illness. This fact is also supported by the observation that the endotracheal aspirates of majority of patients yielded <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>, which are mainly responsible for hospital acquired infections. The surgical patients who were brought to ICU from inadequate recovery from anesthesia could also have acquired such infections because of severe illness especially in cases of intestinal obstruction and peritonitis, which lead to severe derangements in body's homeostatic mechanisms.</p><p>It is very difficult to remove biasness in any study. However, we tried to make our study bias-free by making the observer blind about the collected samples. The samples were collected by the ICU doctors and were coded and sent to the Microbiology Department of the Hospital, where cultures were performed. The personnel involved in identifying the growth were not aware of the site from where the specimen was taken (endotracheal, patient end or machine end) and the time when the specimen was taken (just after intubation, after 24 h or 48 h).</p><p>HME devices studied earlier have claimed to be of equal efficacy, but our results differ as there was a significant difference between the efficacy of the two types of devices studied. The Intersurgical HME devices proved to be far more superior compared to Hygrobac S devices as infection rate at both ends was only 6.6% after 48 h compared to 26.6% in the latter after only 24 hours.</p><p>The limitation of our study was that the colony count (quantitative analysis) of the microbial growth obtained on the HME devices was not done. Therefore the significance of the presence of growth could not be evaluated. Another limitation was that since the culture reports were obtained after 72 h of incubation, it could not be estimated during the study how long the devices would be effective and necessitate change of the device. We changed the devices after 48 h as per the recommendation of the previous studies. In the Control group more than 60% of the filters were infected on both the sides. This endangered our circuits. However, the circuits used with Study group filters were privileged. Hence, further studies would be required to assess the actual duration for which this device could be used and also its cost effectiveness. We presume that the Intersurgical HMEs are more cost-effective than Hygrobac S HMEs as there is lesser contamination of the ventilators with the use of the former till 48 h and lesser number of them were discarded due to visible soiling and rise in PIP. Also the market price of both the filters is nearly the same, with Intersurgical HMEs costing only about Rs. 10 more to the patient than Hygrobac S HMEs. But since we do not know the exact duration for which they can be used effectively, any quantitative assessment of cost-effectiveness cannot be made.</p><p>Rise in PIP was taken as a measure of humidifying ability of the device. A measure of the difference of temperature at both ends of the device along with a PIP rise could have served as a better guide of the same.</p><p>Another deficiency was that we studied only the transmission of contamination from the patient towards the ventilator but not any increase in the incidence of VAP. Therefore, further scope remains to study the effect of this microbial transmission on the change in incidence of VAP, if any using more clinical and microbiological parameters.</p></sec><sec
