Using effective strategies to prevent its occurrence is essential to improve outcome. However, despite various efforts, the incidence of PPCs remains elevated in high-risk patients. Anticholinergic inhalation is used to reduce high airway resistance and improve pulmonary function; it may be helpful to decrease the risk of PPCs. Penehyclidine is a long-acting anticholinergic agent which selectively blocks M1 and M3 receptors. We hypothesize that, in high-risk patients, prophylactic penehyclidine inhalation may decrease the incidence of PPCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with two parallel arms. A total of 864 patients at high risk of PPCs will be enrolled and randomized to receive prophylactic inhalation of either penehyclidine or placebo (water for injection). Study drug inhalation will be administered from the night (7&#x000a0;pm) before surgery until the second day after surgery, in an interval of every 12&#x000a0;hours. The primary outcome is the incidence of PPCs within 30&#x000a0;days after surgery. Secondary outcomes include the time to onset of PPCs (from end of surgery to first diagnosis of PPCs), the number of PPCs (indicates the number of diagnosed individual PPCs), the incidence of postoperative extrapulmonary complications, the length of stay in hospital after surgery, and the 30-day all-cause mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Results of the present study will provide evidence to guide clinical practice in using prophylactic inhalation of an anticholinergic to prevent PPCs in high-risk patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">The study was registered prospectively in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chictr.org.cn/">www.chictr.org.cn</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=10981">ChiCTR-IPC-15006603</ext-link>) on 14 May 2015 and retrospectively in ClinicalTrials.gov (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT0264487">NCT02644876</ext-link>) on 30 December 2015.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-017-2315-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Postoperative complications</kwd><kwd>Cholinergic antagonists</kwd><kwd>Penehyclidine</kwd><kwd>Administration</kwd><kwd>inhalation</kwd><kwd>Pre-exposure prophylaxis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Scientific research fund of Peking University First Hospital</institution></funding-source><award-id>2015QN025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>Ting</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Scientific research fund of Chinese Society of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesiology</institution></funding-source><award-id>2017-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Dong-Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p id="Par14">Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) are major causes of morbidity, mortality, and prolonged hospital stay in patients after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The reported incidences of PPCs vary from 5% to 70% depending on the definition of PPCs, the type of surgical procedures, and the population of patients included in the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The ARISCAT study identified seven independent predictors, including four patient-related factors and three surgery-related factors, and built a predictive model for the risk of PPCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A subsequent study confirmed that, in high-risk patients (i.e., patients with cumulative ARISCAT risk score&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;45), the incidence of PPCs was as high as 38% (25&#x02013;51%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Changes in pulmonary physiology after major thoracic or upper abdominal surgery include diaphragmatic dysfunction, reduced vital capacity, postoperative pain and splinting, and impaired clearance of airway secretions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Affected patients are at increased risk to develop atelectasis, pneumonia, and other respiratory complications. Prophylactic inhalation of anticholinergic agents may be helpful in preventing PPCs by dilating bronchus, decreasing mucous secretion and relieving airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). In a retrospective study of patients with COPD requiring lung cancer surgery, perioperative inhalation of tiotropium was associated with decreased cardiopulmonary complications after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In a randomized controlled trial of gastric cancer patients with COPD, perioperative (1&#x000a0;week before and 2&#x000a0;weeks after surgery) inhalation of tiotropium decreased the incidence of postoperative complications in those with moderate COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Theoretically, selective M1 and M3 receptors blockers may have advantages over nonselective blockers (such as tiotropium bromide) for the purpose of bronchodilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

Postoperative data including NRS pain scores, analgesic consumption, respiratory management, return of gastrointestinal function, start of nutrition, occurrence of complications and related treatment, admission to the ICU, duration of hospital stay, and any events that lead to return or readmission to hospital after hospital discharge will be recorded. Any adverse events or complications that occur during the study period will be promptly treated according to routine practice. For patients who deviate from the intervention protocol, deviations will be corrected when possible and follow-up will be completed. For patients who withdraw consent, the last follow-up results will be regarded as the final results.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Primary outcome</title><p id="Par35">The primary outcome is the incidence of PPCs within 30&#x000a0;days after surgery.

Whereas perioperative inhalation of tiotropium reduced the incidence of PPCs by 16% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and inhalation of penehyclidine during the first three postoperative days reduced the incidence of PPCs by 12.4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In the present study, we assume that the incidence of PPCs will be 42.1% in high-risk patients of the placebo group, and prophylactic penehyclidine inhalation will reduce the incidence of PPCs by 10%. The calculated sample size that will provide 80% power to detect a superiority of this difference at a one-sided significance level of 0.025 is 360 patients in each group.

Various predictive models have been reported to identify patients at high risk of pneumonia, respiratory failure, pulmonary complications, and cardiopulmonary complications after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the present study, we adopt the ARISCAT risk score to identify high-risk patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] because of the following reasons. First, this scoring system is derived from patients undergoing various types of surgery (including thoracic and abdominal surgery) under various type of anesthesia. Therefore, it is suitable for the patient population in our study. Second, the risk indices are convenient to use. Besides the four patient-related factors, the three surgery-related factors can also be known or anticipated before recruitment. Third, the predictive effect of this scoring system has been validated in a recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">PPCs are a composite of the hospital-acquired respiratory events after surgery. The diagnostic criteria used to define individual PPCs varied among different studies. In the present study, we used the diagnostic criteria used in the ARISCAT study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In addition, we adopt the Clavien-Dindo Classification to categorize PPCs, and those of grade II or above will be used to calculated the incidence of PPCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. For example, patients with a small amount pleural effusion that does not require specified medical management (e.g., diuretics) or intervention (e.g., drain placement) will be excluded from the diagnosis. This will help us to identify PPCs that have impact on the prognosis of patients.</p><p id="Par48">Using effective strategies to prevent PPCs is essential in high-risk patients. Some strategies have been proved beneficial in previous studies, such as smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and inspiratory muscle training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] before surgery; use of regional anesthesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], lung-protective ventilation (for patients who received general anesthesia) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and goal-directed fluid therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] during surgery; as well as use of continuous positive airway pressure or noninvasive ventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and early exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] after surgery. High-risk patients, such as those complicated with bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, left ventricular dysfunction and morbid obesity, tend to develop AHR during the perioperative period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], which increase the risk of PPCs. Whereas anticholinergic inhalation can prevent parasympathetic bronchoconstrictive effect and reduce high airway resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and improve patients&#x02019; pulmonary function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. As a long-acting anticholinergic drug with selective M1, M3-receptors blocking activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], penehyclidine is a promising candidate agent in the treatment of COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Indeed, penehyclidine inhalation was used in COPD patients with acute exacerbation and resulted in good effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Our pilot study suggested that penehyclidine inhalation might be effective in preventing PPCs in high-risk patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Results of the present study will provide evidence on the effectiveness and safety of penehyclidine inhalation in preventing PPCs in high-risk surgical patients.</p><p id="Par49">Our study has several limitations. First, unlike other inhalational anticholinergics (such as tiotropium bromide and ipratropium bromide), penehyclidine is currently only approved for clinical use in China. This will restrict the generalizability and reproducibility of our results. However, considering the selective M1 and M3 receptor blocking activity and long-lasting effects, penehyclidine may be more suitable for PPCs prevention. Second, some perioperative factors, such as selection of anesthetic methods, use of anesthetics and analgesics, fluid management, respiratory management and ventilator settings, may also affect the occurrence of PPCs. We do not standardize anesthetic management in the present study. This might produce confounding effects to our intervention. However, large sample size and strict randomization will help to balance these factors between groups. And our results will reflect the impact of penehyclidine inhalation on PPC incidence in the real-world practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par50">Recruitment and data collection of patients started on 1 September 2015.
