An analogous disease occurs in cattle and costs US agriculture a billion dollars a year. RSV causes much of its morbidity indirectly via adverse effects of the host response to the virus. RSV is accompanied by elevated prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) which is followed by neutrophil led inflammation in the lung. Ibuprofen is a prototypical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that decreases PGE<sub>2</sub> levels by inhibiting cyclooxygenase.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Hypotheses</title><p>We hypothesized that treatment of RSV with ibuprofen would decrease PGE<sub>2</sub> levels, modulate the immune response, decrease clinical illness, and decrease the histopathological lung changes in a bovine model of RSV. We further hypothesized that viral replication would be unaffected.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Methods</title><p>We performed a randomized placebo controlled trial of ibuprofen in 16 outbred Holstein calves that we infected with RSV. We measured clinical scores, cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase and endocannabinoid products in plasma and mediastinal lymph nodes and interleukin (Il)-4, Il-13, Il-17 and interferon-&#x003b3; in mediastinal lymph nodes. RSV shedding was measured daily and nasal Il-6, Il-8 and Il-17 every other day. The calves were necropsied on Day 10 post inoculation and histology performed.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Results</title><p>One calf in the ibuprofen group required euthanasia on Day 8 of infection for respiratory distress. Clinical scores (p&#x0003c;0.01) and weight gain (p = 0.08) seemed better in the ibuprofen group. Ibuprofen decreased cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, and cytochrome P450 products, and increased monoacylglycerols in lung lymph nodes. Ibuprofen modulated the immune response as measured by narrowed range of observed Il-13, Il-17 and IFN-&#x003b3; gene expression in mediastinal lymph nodes. Lung histology was not different between groups, and viral shedding was increased in calves randomized to ibuprofen.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Ibuprofen decreased PGE<sub>2</sub>, modulated the immune response, and improved clinical outcomes.

The clinical manifestations largely reflect the hosts&#x02019; immune response to RSV; authors have described eicosanoid and cytokine storms leading to neutrophilic infiltration and tissue destruction. Antibodies formed to bystander antigens lead to bronchospasm on subsequent re-exposure.[<xref rid="pone.0152913.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Eicosanoid pathway products in general, and prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) in particular are higher in more severe RSV infection in infants.[<xref rid="pone.0152913.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] PGE<sub>2</sub> is produced by cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in respiratory epithelial cells in response to RSV infection.[<xref rid="pone.0152913.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Multiple COX- and lipoxygenase (LOX)-generated mediators stimulate the cytokine responses affecting neutrophil and monocyte trafficking as well as stimulation of mucus secretion from bronchial goblet cells.[<xref rid="pone.0152913.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0152913.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>COX-1 is constitutive, but COX-2 is mostly inducible in the lung;[<xref rid="pone.0152913.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and COX-2 in particular is believed responsible for the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes in RSV.[<xref rid="pone.0152913.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Simple nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen inhibit COX-2 and to a lesser extent COX-1. Ibuprofen is inexpensive and widely available for human use. Current treatment of human RSV bronchiolitis is mostly symptomatic and supportive with modest benefit from bronchodilators in some patients, but not from glucocorticoids or leukotriene inhibitors.[<xref rid="pone.0152913.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0152913.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] NSAIDs are not currently used in human RSV and aspirin is contraindicated in infants.[<xref rid="pone.0152913.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0152913.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] However pretreatment of RSV infected cotton rats with indomethacin decreases the severity of lung histology,[<xref rid="pone.0152913.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and in veterinary medicine NSAIDs are used as adjuncts to antibiotics in mixed respiratory infections in cattle and piglets.[<xref rid="pone.0152913.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0152913.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] A randomized controlled trial (RCT) in asthmatic children found that ibuprofen, compared with acetaminophen, decreased near term wheezing following viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI)[<xref rid="pone.0152913.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and ibuprofen decreases antibody production in human monocytes.[<xref rid="pone.0152913.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>The outbred Holstein bovine model of RSV bronchiolitis uses a naturally occurring bovine RSV to replicate the clinical, immunological, and histological features of human RSV.

This dose is the same as is typically used in children (10 mg/kg tid) and is similar dosing that has previously been used in cattle. Randomization was performed using a minimization strategy based first on maternal RSV antibody titres (determined by indirect immunofluorescence) and then body weight. All animals were housed in climate controlled barns at our veterinary school. Free access to water and a small amount of oat hay was allowed.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Measurement of clinical scores</title><p>A complete physical exam was performed at 07:00 daily, with additional respiratory exams and temperature measurements at 13:00 and 19:00. These findings were used to calculate a daily clinical severity of illness score. This score was originally developed by Collie et al [<xref rid="pone.0152913.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and has been widely used subsequently. A modified version which underweights the importance of fever has also been described,[<xref rid="pone.0152913.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and because of the antipyretic effects of ibuprofen, that is the version we used. The scoring schema is in supporting information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0152913.s005">S1 Table</xref>). The veterinarian and physician doing evaluations and their research assistants were blinded to drug allocation. The calves were weighed at the start and the end of the experiment.

Plasma (100&#x003bc;L) and lymph tissue (~20&#x02013;30mg) were enriched with a suite of deuterated surrogates prior to extraction.[<xref rid="pone.0152913.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Plasma samples were extracted directly with 300&#x003bc;L acetonitrile with 1% formic acid while tissues were first cryopulverized with 50&#x003bc;L of methanol in a Geno/Grinder 2000 (SPEX SamplePrep; Metuchen, NJ) at 1350 rpm for 90 seconds in 30 second increments, and extracted by further pulverization with 550&#x003bc;L acetonitrile with 1% formic acid, and 100&#x003bc;L water for 90 seconds. Supernatants were isolated by centrifugation. Target analytes were isolated in extract eluents from an Ostro Sample Preparation Plate (Waters Corp; Milford, MA), concentrated into 2&#x003bc;L of glycerol, and reconstituted in an internal standard solution containing 1-cyclohexyl-3-ureido dodecanoic acid and 1-phenyl,3-ureido hexanoic acid in 1:1 (v/v) methanol:acetonitrile prior to analysis.[<xref rid="pone.0152913.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>Analytical targets were separated on a 2.1 x 150 mm, 1.7 &#x003bc;m BEH C18 column (Waters; Milford, MA) and detected by positive or negative mode electrospray ionization (endocannabinoids or oxylipins, respectively) and tandem mass spectrometry on an API 4000QTrap (Sciex; Framingham, MA).[<xref rid="pone.0152913.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Calibrants and internal standards were from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI), or Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.

Expression of Il-6, Il-8 and Il-17 was also evaluated in nasal secretions as this type of sample will be readily accessible in human translation. For each gene, two primers and an internal, fluorescent labeled Roche Universal Probe Library probe was designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Cell pellet samples were placed in 470&#x003bc;L of Buffer RLT+Isopropanol and 40uL Proteinase K Enzyme, heated at 56&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes, and stored at -20&#x000b0;C. Two grinding beads (4 mm diameter, stainless steel beads, SpexCertiprep, Metuchen, NJ) were added and the tissues homogenized in a GenoGrinder2000 (SpexCertiprep) for 2.5 minutes at 1000 strokes per minute.

In brief, the three reference genes were averaged to normalize the CT values of the target genes (&#x00394;CT). The &#x00394;CT was calibrated against the average of the negative control group within each target gene. The linear amount of target molecules relative to the calibrator was calculated by 2<sup>-&#x00394;&#x00394;Ct</sup> and gene transcription is expressed as an n-fold difference relative to the calibrator.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Measurement of histopathology</title><p>Lung consolidation was estimated by inspection by an experienced board certified veterinary pathologist. Sections of the right lung were collected and fixed for at least 24 hours in 10% formalin. The left lung was then perfused with formalin at 15 cm water pressure. A second board certified veterinary pathologist blinded to the gross autopsy findings performed detailed histological assessment of the slides. Both pathologists were blinded to drug assignment. A scoring system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0152913.s006">S2 Table</xref>) was derived from the placebo group and validated on weight change and clinical findings. This scoring system was then applied to both groups. The scoring system is described in detail elsewhere.

We did this because if ibuprofen failed to improve outcomes when given this early then our hypothesis would have been thoroughly disproven. No further work to determine how late into the course of illness NSAIDs could be beneficial would be needed. This approach mirrors that taken with other early stage drug studies. An inherent limitation of the bovine RSV model is the frequent development of secondary bacterial infections in RSV infected calves. This can be diminished by pre-treating calves with antibiotics prior to initiation of the viral infection. Secondary bacterial infection occurs less frequently in humans ranging from 20% overall to 44% in those admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit.[<xref rid="pone.0152913.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0152913.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] Consequently our model approximates the more severe forms of bronchiolitis in infants. This in part reflects our use of a minimally passaged virus that had demonstrated significant pathogenicity in the wild. Even this limitation is appropriate; most cases of RSV in both humans and cattle are mild and do not result in a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis. Furthermore pretreatment with antibiotics would decrease the applicability of our results to veterinary practice. Another limitation is that because we minimized on maternal anti-RSV antibody titre first and weight second our placebo group was on average heavier than the placebo group at enrollment. This tends to bias our study against finding a benefit where one exists. Our sample size was small compared to human RCTs although typical for large animal studies which are expensive to conduct. Inhibition of COX was poorly reflected in the plasma, as were systemic changes in lipoxygenase metabolites, demonstrating the difficulty in extrapolating mediator responses in the plasma to changes at the tissue level. Therefore, little information regarding the time course of lipid mediator changes can be gleaned from this study. This highlights an inherent limitation for human studies where only nasal secretions and blood can be obtained for testing, but where lung and lymph tissue are matter more. Our lipidomics findings in plasma however mirror those of human studies which have examined the effect of ibuprofen in blinded human RCTs.[<xref rid="pone.0152913.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] The immunological validity of the bovine model for RSV has been demonstrated.[<xref rid="pone.0152913.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Implications for veterinary and medical practice</title><p>These findings generally support the early use of NSAIDS as adjunctive treatment of bovine RSV which is a key component in bovine respiratory disease complex. The results are not directly applicable to veterinary practice because our study was designed as a proof of concept with early drug administration and use of ibuprofen rather than a more widely used veterinary NSAID. Ibuprofen is short acting and has limited safety data in bovines. [<xref rid="pone.0152913.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] The proof of concept design also limits its applicability to pediatrics, but ibuprofen is a widely used NSAID in pediatrics at the dosage we used. The safety of ibuprofen is well established in children. Our work does raise the caution that although NSAIDs improve clinical appearance, NSAIDs increase viral shedding with attendant implications for infection control in dairies and hospitals.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Ibuprofen decreased COX, 12/15-LOX, and cytochrome P450 epoxygenase products in lung lymph nodes. Ibuprofen modulated the immune response as measured by narrowed range of observed Il-13, Il-17 and IFN-&#x003b3; gene expression in mediastinal lymph nodes. Weight and clinical scores were improved by ibuprofen but lung histology was not, and viral shedding was increased. This apparent paradox argues for a combined antiviral and immunomodulatory approach to RSV.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec024"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0152913.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Data files.</title><p>(DTA)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0152913.s001.dta"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0152913.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Data files.</title><p>(DTA)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0152913.s002.dta"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0152913.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Data files.</title><p>(DTA)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0152913.s003.dta"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0152913.s004"><label>S4 File</label><caption><title>Data files.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0152913.s004.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0152913.s005"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Clinical scoring scheme.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0152913.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0152913.s006"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Histopathology scoring system.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0152913.s006.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0152913.s007"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Mass spectroscopy results.</title><p>Complete results of lipids measured in lymph nodes.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0152913.s007.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0152913.s008"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Mass spectroscopy results.</title><p>Complete results of lipids measured in plasma.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0152913.s008.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0152913.s009"><label>S5 Table</label><caption><title>Summary data for lipid mediators by pathway.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0152913.s009.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0152913.s010"><label>S6 Table</label><caption><title>Endocannabinoids and lipid mediator abbreviations.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0152913.s010.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge the input and statistical and modeling expertise of Stephen J Rothenberg PhD, Instituto Nacional de Salud P&#x000fa;blica, Centro de Investigaci&#x000f3;n en Salud Poblacional, Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico, and adult pulmonology insight and guidance of Nicholas Kenyon MD, Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine UC Davis and Nathan Kuppermann for general supervision.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0152913.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Gershwin</surname><given-names>LJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>ML</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Berghaus</surname><given-names>LJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kenny</surname><given-names>TP</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gunther</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name>. <article-title>Assessment of IgE response and cytokine gene expression in pulmonary efferent lymph collected after ovalbumin inhalation during experimental infection of calves with bovine respiratory syncytial virus</article-title>. <source>American Journal of Veterinary Research</source>. <year>2011</year>;<volume>72</volume>(<issue>1</issue>):<fpage>134</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>45</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.72.1.134">10.2460/ajvr.72.1.134</ext-link></comment>
