Background</title><p>Colonoscopy is one of the most commonly performed outpatient procedures throughout the
world as a screening, diagnostic, and therapeutic tool. The pain and anxiety which are
frequently associated with colonoscopy, may lead to either patient refusal or elevated
medication administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9653R1">1</xref>). Routine
colonoscopy can be performed without preparing sedation in many countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9653R2">2</xref>). The reason may be fear of probable
cardio-respiratory complications or a high cost of anesthesia facilities. Since either
moderate or light level of anesthesia can provide adequate pain control and hypnosis for
most patients, it is recommended to avoid a deep level of sedation in these patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9653R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9653R4">4</xref>). It
must be noted that propofol combined with narcotic drugs are used widely for sedation during
colonoscopy. Although, this combination may increase patient comfort, but because of the
synergistic depressive effect of this combination on cardio-respiratory system, occasionally
cardio-respiratory adverse events may take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9653R5">5</xref>). Ketamine produces dose-related unconsciousness and analgesia with minimal
effect on the central respiratory drive while stable hemodynamics are maintained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9653R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9653R6">7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec10371"><title>2. Objectives</title><p>Since no study has evaluated the role of bolus injection of ketamine as an analgesic
component of anesthesia in comparison with the other analgesics (opioids) in colonoscopy
procedures and because of the increasing importance of patient&#x02019;s satisfaction and
preparation of analgesia during invasive medical interventions we designed this study to
compare the effects of, ketamine-propofol versus fentanyl-propofol for achieving a more
acceptable satisfaction of the patients during colonoscopy procedures.</p></sec><sec id="sec10373"><title>3. Patients and Methods</title><p>This was a double-blind, prospective, randomized controlled trial conducted in the
Endoscopy Center in the Sina Hospital of the Tehran University of Medical Sciences between
March 2010 and May 2011. The university ethics board approved this study and all
participants provided an informed consent. Sixty ASA physical statuses I, II or III patients
who were older than 18 years were included in this study. Randomization of patients was
performed by the use of a sealed envelope technique. Patients who had a recent history of
colonoscopy, a previous colonic resection, severe heart failure (ejection fraction &#x0003c; 30%)
and known history of hypersensitivity to midazolam, propofol, ketamine or fentanyl were
excluded from the study. In addition, any need for further anesthetic drug administration
other than the study protocol was another exclusion criterion of this study. Sedation for
colonoscopy was administered by an attending anesthesiologist (cooperated with resident of
anesthesiology) who was blinded from drug allocation. The colonoscopies were performed by a
gastroenterologist who was blinded from the type of drugs used for sedation. The study was
performed. In the endoscopy room, for all patients after establishment of intravenous
access, standard monitoring (noninvasive blood pressure, electrocardiography and pulse
oximetry) was performed. Use of standard monitoring continued in the recovery unit, until
the patients were discharged. Oxygen (6 l/min) administration commenced via facemasks for
all patients and, midazolam 0.03mg/kg IV as a premedication was injected to all of the
patients. By the means of a double-blind randomized construct, patients were scheduled to
receive either IV bolus dose of fentanyl (Fentanyl 0.5 mg/10ml, Aburaihan Co. Iran)
(1&#x000b5;g/kg) and propofol (Propofol 1% MCT/LCT Fresenius, manufactured by Fresenius Kabi
Austria.) (0.5mg/kg) in group PF or ketamine (Ketamine Hydrochloride 500mg/10 ml,
Rotexmedica, TRITTAU, Germany) (0.5mg/kg) and (propofol 0.5mg/kg) in the group PK. The
serious adverse events during the study period were defined as: 1- &#x0003e;30% change in
baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP); 2- &#x0003e; 30% change in diastolic blood pressure
(DBP); 3- HR &#x0003c; 50/min; 4- apnea &#x0003e; 30 sec; 5- SpO<sub>2 </sub>&#x0003c; 85%. Treatment of
the aforementioned adverse events was at the discretion of the anesthesiologist caring for
the patient. The level of sedation (an objective variable) during the procedure was assessed
with an Observer&#x02019;s Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scores (1 = fully
sedated, 5 = not sedated) every five minutes after commencement of sedation (four times
during the procedure) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9653R8">8</xref>). After the end of the
procedure, in the recovery ward and when the patients were alert enough to express their
attitude regarding the intra-procedural events, they were asked to score their level of
satisfaction during the procedure in terms of recalling any painful or other undesirable
intra-procedural events. Patient&#x02019;s satisfaction level was assessed with a Likert
five-item scoring system (1 = Not at all satisfied, 2 = slightly satisfied, 3 = somewhat
satisfied, 4 = very satisfied, and 5 = extremely satisfied) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9653R9">9</xref>). All OAA/Sand Likert scores were obtained by one investigator (who
was blinded to the drug allocation) to reduce inter observer variability. Hemodynamic
parameters (heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure) and
SpO<sub>2</sub> values were recorded every five minutes (three times during the
procedure). Probable side effects (nausea and vomiting, psychological reactions) were noted
during recovery period as well. We used the Aldrete&#x02019;s scoring system for the
discharge of patients from recovery. Achievement of at least 8 out of 10 scores was the
criteria for discharge in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9653R10">10</xref>). The
primary aim of this study was to compare the means of patients&#x02019; satisfaction scores
after the end of procedure (in the recovery period) between the patients of the two groups.
Comparison of hemodynamic parameters (mean heart rate, mean systolic blood pressure, and
mean diastolic blood pressure) and mean SPO<sub>2</sub> values throughout the procedure and
also some probable side effects such as nausea, vomiting and psychological reactions during
the recovery period between groups was our secondary objective.</p><sec id="sec10372"><title>3.1. Statistical Analysis</title><p>All quantitative data were expressed as means &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD) and compared
using student T test. For comparison of categorical data, K2 test was used. All
qualitative data were expressed as numbers (%) and compared with the Fisher's exact
probability test. For comparison of the sedation score data, hemodynamic parameters and
SpO<sub>2</sub> values, the repeated measurement analysis was used. A sample size of
thirty patients in each group was calculated to have at least an 80% power to detect the
expected differences between the two groups with respect to the primary goal. Finding a
difference of at least two out of five in the mean satisfaction scores (40% change)
between the two groups was regarded as a clinically significant difference. A P value less
than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec10374"><title>4. Results</title><p>Sixty patients were enrolled in the study, 30 in each group. No predefined serious adverse
events were observed in the patients of both groups. No patient during the procedure was
excluded from the study because of extra-protocol sedative administration. No significant
demographic differences were identified between the two groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3235">Table 1</xref>).The mean duration of colonoscopy in the group PK was 23.3
&#x000b1; 7.7 minutes and it was 21.8 &#x000b1; 9.7 minutes in the group PF. The mean duration of
recovery in the group PK was 50.6 &#x000b1; 6.2 minutes and it was 45.3 &#x000b1; 8.4 minutes in
the group PF. Although, the patients in the group PK had lower mean sedation scores (more
sedated) during the procedure but this was not statistically significant between the two
groups (P = 0.17) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2538">Figure 1</xref>). The mean of Likert
satisfaction scores of the patients in the group PF was1.8 &#x000b1; 0.4 (mode = 2), while it
was 3.9 &#x000b1; 0.5(mode = 4) in the group PK. The mean Likert satisfaction scores of the
patients were significantly higher in the PK group (P = 0.005). The trend of hemodynamic
variables, (SBP, DBP, and HR) during the procedure was similar between the two groups (P
&#x0003e; 0.05). In addition, the trend of SPO<sub>2</sub> changes remained similar throughout
the colonoscopy in the two groups (P &#x0003e; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2539">Figure
2</xref>). The incidence of complications such as nausea and vomiting were similar in the
two groups (12.5%). During the recovery period, three patients had psychological emergence
reactions in the group PK (7.5%), but, this was self-limited and didn&#x02019;t need any
medication.</p><table-wrap id="tbl3235" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of Included Patients and the Procedures</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variables </th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group PF <sup><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="fn1941">a</xref></sup></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group PK <sup><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="fn1941">a</xref></sup></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age, y, Mean &#x000b1; SD</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">51.6 &#x000b1; 21</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">55.9 &#x000b1; 15</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sex (Male/Female), Mean &#x000b1; SD</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">18/12</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">16/14</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight, kg</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">56 &#x000b1; 14</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">59 &#x000b1; 17</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height, cm</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">155 &#x000b1; 5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">157 &#x000b1; 8</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ASA <sup><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="fn1941">a</xref></sup> physical

Discussion</title><p>This is the first study, which evaluates bolus IV injection of a ketamine-propofol
combination in comparison with fentanyl-propofol combination in the colonoscopy
procedure.</p><p>The principal result of this investigation is that patients in the PK group have been more
satisfied (in terms of recalling any undesirable experiences such as pain or discomfort)
than the other group. The sedation scores during the procedure were comparable between the
two groups; in addition, the trend of hemodynamic and respiratory variables was similar in
the two groups. Sedation for colonoscopy should provide an optimal hypnosis and analgesia
with a lower probability of hemodynamic and respiratory complications; thus, drug selection
is a crucial determinant of these outcomes. According to the study by Fanti et al, the most
common complications in gastrointestinal endoscopy are not related to the procedure, but are
related to sedation; they include cardio-respiratory adverse events such as hypoxemia,
hypoventilation, apnea, dysrhythmias, hypotension and vasovagal episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9653R11">11</xref>). Fortunately, in this study no adverse events
were seen during the colonoscopies of either group. The achieved sedation in the two groups
of study was at a moderate level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2538">Figure 1</xref>), thus,
it is not surprising that no cardiorespiratory complication was observed. Since several
researchers have found propofol, as a hypnotic drug, to be superior to traditional sedative
regimens (because of rapid recovery), the use of propofol for endoscopic sedation has been
increased significantly during the past 10 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9653R11">11-16</xref>). Propofol in combination with midazolam can be titrated to achieve a
moderate level of anesthesia in colonoscopy, but it is important to note that this
combination lacks analgesic properties and may result in the sensation of more pain and
consequently a low level of patient satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9653R17">17</xref>). The mean of procedure duration was similar in patients of both groups (21
versus 23 minutes) in this study, similar to Sipe and Paspatis&#x02019;studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9653R13">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9653R12">16</xref>).
The frequency of nausea in patients who were sedated with propofol plus narcotics in the
Kostash et al. study was 26 %, (range 16-40%) while it was much less (12.5%) in our study
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9653R18">18</xref>). The combination of ketamine and propofol
for performing procedural sedation theoretically may be advantageous as using lower doses of
each agent may result in a reduction of the adverse drug effects while maintaining an
acceptable condition for colonoscopy. It is noteworthy to mention that a low plasma level of
ketamine can inhibit nociceptive central sensitization and has a preemptive analgesic effect
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9653R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9653R20">20</xref>). The use of propofol&#x02013; ketamine infusion for procedural sedation and
analgesia outside the operating room environment especially in the emergency department and
pediatric patients has become popular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9653R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9653R22">22</xref>). However, researchers have found insufficient
data to recommend the use of the aforementioned combination. Additionally, Slavik et al. did
not support the use of a bolus dose of propofol-ketamine for procedural sedation and
analgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9653R23">23</xref>). On the contrary, the results of
this study revealed that injecting a bolus dose of propofol-ketamine is not only an
acceptable sedative option, but also it may be superior to the other commonly used
combination (propofol-fentanyl) for sedation of patients during the colonoscopy procedures.
On the other hand, ketamine may produce undesirable psycho- mimetic reactions, known as
"emergence reactions", which may occur during awakening from anesthesia. Factors that affect
the incidence of emergence reactions are age, dose, gender, psychological susceptibility,
and concurrent drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9653R6">7</xref>). Additionally, it was
suggested that psycho- mimetic reactions may occur predominantly in the case of a large dose
injection of ketamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9653R24">24</xref>). The incidence of
this reaction in our study was low (7.5%). The reason may be injection of midazolam to all
patients. In addition, the combination of ketamine with propofol may be the other factor,
which contributed to the low incidence of psycho- mimetic reactions of ketamine in this
study. This study may be subjected to one limitation: the study duration was short because
of some logistical reasons; it might be better to follow patients until 24 h to discover
probable adverse events which may occur even after discharge. Therefore, we suggest that
more research is needed to elucidate the role of this combination for sedation and analgesia
in colonoscopy procedure. For preparing sedation in colonoscopy procedure, use of a bolus IV
dose of ketamine-propofol is more acceptable than the fentanyl- propofol combination.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the Research Promotion Center of Sina Hospital for their
