Indications include hemodynamic monitoring, total parenteral nutrition, renal replacement therapy and medication prescription, among others. It is estimated that 5,000,000 central venous lines (CVLs) are placed each year in the USA [<xref rid="R001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The rate of mechanical complications during the procedure ranges between 6% and 19% [<xref rid="R002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], representing between 250,000 and 1,000,000 mechanical complications per year.</p><p>CVLs are usually inserted in the internal jugular vein (IJV), the subclavian vein, and the femoral vein. Subclavian access potentially presents an higher risk of pneumothorax [<xref rid="R002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] while femoral CVL displays a higher risk of artery puncture [<xref rid="R005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R006" ref-type="bibr"> 6</xref>] and of infectious complications [<xref rid="R002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] when compared to the jugular approach.</p><p>Anatomically, the IJV is in an anterolateral position with respect to the internal carotid artery (ICA), covered by the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM). It ends behind the internal edge of the clavicular bundle of the SCM, near the medial end of the clavicle when it joins the subclavian vein to form the venous brachiocephalic trunk [<xref rid="R007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Traditionally, IJV catheterization has been performed taking these anatomical landmarks into account, particularly in relation with the SCM [<xref rid="R008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The first description of percutaneous access to the IJV in critical care dates back to 1966 [<xref rid="R009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; different approaches have been described since: anterior [<xref rid="R010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], central [<xref rid="R011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and posterior [<xref rid="R012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Although the anatomical landmark techniques have been validated by the above-mentioned studies, they present mechanical complications during insertion, such as accidental ICA puncture, local hematoma and pneumothorax, at an incidence of 3% to 10% for ICA and/or local hematoma, and 0.8% to 2.4% for pneumothorax [<xref rid="R003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R013" ref-type="bibr"> 13</xref>,<xref rid="R014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Other less frequent complications involve nerve injury, such as lesions of the recurrent laryngeal nerve [<xref rid="R016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], cervical sympathetic chain [<xref rid="R017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and brachial plexus [<xref rid="R018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; accidental deaths during the procedure have also been reported [<xref rid="R013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R019" ref-type="bibr"> 19</xref>]. Additionally, the IJV approach by anatomical landmarks displays a variable incidence of failure, ranging from 2% to 35% [<xref rid="R013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R015" ref-type="bibr"> 15</xref>,<xref rid="R020" ref-type="bibr"> 20</xref>,<xref rid="R021" ref-type="bibr"> 21</xref>]. Many studies have identified the factors associated with complications during CVL placement by anatomical landmarks, namely operator&#x02019;s experience, site of placement, number of attempts, patient&#x02019;s body mass index (BMI), or CVL placement in an emergency situation [<xref rid="R013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R014" ref-type="bibr"> 14</xref>,<xref rid="R022" ref-type="bibr"> 22</xref>,<xref rid="R023" ref-type="bibr"> 23</xref>].</p><p>In 1978, Ullman et al. reported the advantages of localizing the IJV by means of Doppler ultrasound before its catheterization [<xref rid="R024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Later on, Legler et al. published a prospective randomized study on central venous catheterization with Doppler ultrasound versus the technique by landmarks, reporting a higher success rate and lower rate of complications with the former [<xref rid="R025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Bond et al. gave an account of the first IJV catheterization with bi-dimensional ultrasound [<xref rid="R026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]: through this technique, the neck structures and the advancement of the puncture needle can be directly visualized. Mallory et al. published a prospective randomized study indicating a higher rate of success and a lower number of attempts and of immediate complications for IJV catheterization with bi-dimensional ultrasound versus the anatomical landmarks technique [<xref rid="R020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Additionally, they reported that patients in whom the CVL by anatomical landmarks failed could be catheterized under ultrasound through the same puncture site. These results have been confirmed by many consequent prospective randomized studies, in which a success rate of 98% to 100% has been reported, together with a rate of complications &#x0003c;5%, a decrease in the time used to perform a CVL of &#x0003c;50%, and a reduction in the number of punctures to &#x0003c;50% compared to the anatomical landmarks technique [<xref rid="R015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R018" ref-type="bibr"> 18</xref>,<xref rid="R021" ref-type="bibr"> 21</xref>,<xref rid="R027" ref-type="bibr"> 27</xref>,<xref rid="R028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Two meta-analyses have been performed with prospective studies comparing the landmarks technique versus the ultrasound-guided technique [<xref rid="R030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R031" ref-type="bibr"> 31</xref>], concluding that the ultrasound-guided technique lead to fewer failures and a lower number of attempts than the traditional technique. In the pediatric setting reports also favor the ultrasound technique over the traditional one [<xref rid="R032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality of the USA [<xref rid="R033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and the UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence [<xref rid="R034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] both recommend CVL catheterization under ultrasound as one of the safe practices to improve patient care. To date, there are no published studies analyzing in a randomized and controlled manner the effects of operator&#x02019;s experience, both with or without ultrasound, on the efficiency and incidence of complications when performing a CVL.</p><p>Despite the obvious advantages of ultrasound line placement, many countries (mainly emerging countries) do not have access to such technology in every operating room. In those cases, it is essential to identify the operators that strongly require ultrasound to guide CVL placement. We hypothesize that non-expert operators must use ultrasound for CVL placement. If ultrasound is not available, it is suggested that only expert operators should perform CVL placement.</p><p>This study aims to compare the efficacy and the incidence of complications in CVL placement, with or without ultrasound, depending on the operator&#x02019;s degree of training or the patient&#x02019;s neck anatomy. In Uruguay, only one study has analyzed the advantages of ultrasound guided CVL placement focusing on a Nephrology Center of the University Hospital [<xref rid="R035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>&#x000a0;</p><p>This is a prospective and randomized controlled study focused on the placement of CVL in the intensive care unit and operating rooms of the Military Hospital in Montevideo, Uruguay.</p><p>Oral or written consent was obtained from the patients or their families in order to include them in this study, which was approved by the Military Hospital Ethics Committee (in Uruguay, oral consent is accepted under special circumstances). Critically ill patients or those that required surgery and a CVL were included; unconscious, intubated, and paralyzed patients were also included. Patients under 18 years old were excluded from the study, as were conscious but non-collaborative patients.</p><p>The central IJV approach was used for CVL placement in all cases. Operators were divided into two groups according to their previous experience in CVL placement. An operator was considered an &#x0201c;expert&#x0201d; (E) when he/she had placed more than 70 central accesses by anatomical landmarks over the last 5 years. Anesthesia and intensive care unit residents that had performed less than 70 procedures were included in the &#x0201c;non-expert&#x0201d; (NE) group. Initially two doctors were included in the E group and two in the NE group.</p><p>One of the residents surpassed 70 procedures during the study period and was switched to the E group. At the beginning of the study, a basic training course on ultrasound CVL placement was given to both E and NE groups simultaneously.</p><p>The attending or resident responsible for the patient was the one who performed the CVL. CVLs were only placed if the clinical condition required it (absolutely independently of the study). When the attending or resident informed the authors that a CVL needed to be placed on a patient, he/she was randomly assigned to either the &#x0201c;ultrasound&#x0201d; or the &#x0201c;landmark&#x0201d; groups. Randomization was performed through a computer random number generator, placing the results in sheets inside closed envelopes, which were opened right before CVL placement (<italic>Figure 1</italic>).</p><p>&#x000a0;</p><fig id="F001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study design and randomization process.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="hlv-06-013-g001"/></fig><p>&#x000a0;</p><p>The number of patients to be included in this study was calculated through a test for the comparison of two proportions for dichotomy variables based on the average rate of complications of the procedure without ultrasound taken from the literature, which is approximately 12% [<xref rid="R003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R013" ref-type="bibr"> 13</xref>].</p><p>The formula:</p><p>n=<mml:math id="FO001"><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mi> x p x q</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mfrac></mml:math></p><p>was applied, with 95% confidence (Z=1.96), accuracy of 3% (d=0.03), a proportion of 12% (p=0.12) and q=0.88.</p><p>The number of the sample is 450 patients.</p><p>The study was interrupted when an intermediate analysis indicated a statistically significant difference in the complications of the procedure with or without ultrasound in the NE group.</p><p><italic>Complications. </italic>Mechanical complications were defined as ICA, hematoma in the site of puncture and pneumothorax. ICA was diagnosed by visualization of throbbing bright red blood return through the syringe, local hematoma was diagnosed through inspection and palpation of the puncture site, and pleural complications were diagnosed by thorax radiography.</p><p><italic>Success. </italic>CVL success was determined when the IJV was catheterized in three or less than three attempts. Catheterization after more than three attempts was defined as failure. After failure was assigned, the operator could opt to perform the puncture on the contralateral side or to use a different approach. Multiple punctures was defined as the occurrence of more than one skin piercing with the puncture needle in order to perform the venous catheterization.</p><p><italic>Type of neck. </italic>With respect to the patient&#x02019;s neck features, patients were classified into two groups: normal neck with palpable anatomical landmarks (sternocleidomastoid muscle muscle bundles and carotid pulse) and difficult neck with non-palpable landmarks due to obesity, subcutaneous cell tissue infiltration, previous CVL, or tracheotomy, among others.</p><p><italic>Landmark-guided technique. </italic>The apex of the triangle of separation between the sternal and clavicle bundles of the SCM was used as an anatomical landmark (Sedillot&#x02019;s triangle). The IJV was placed in a deep position in that space. For CVL placement, EPSA&#x02019;s CVL kit (Electroplast S.A., Montevideo, Uruguay) was used. Catheterization was carried out in sterile conditions. Patients were placed in the Trendelenburg position, with the head rotated 45&#x000ba; towards the contralateral side of the puncture. The carotid pulse was identified and the puncture was performed through Sedillot&#x02019;s triangle apex, directing the needle towards the areola. Once blood aspiration was confirmed, the CVL was placed using Seldinger&#x02019;s technique. Control of the central catheter position was performed by chest x-ray in all cases.</p><p><italic>Ultrasound-guided technique. </italic>An expert in ultrasound-guided procedures trained the operators (anesthesiologists and intensivists) in ultrasound-guided IJV cannulation. The need to follow and visualize the needle tip during the procedure was stressed. During the one-week training period, all CVLs needed at the Intensive Care Unit of the Military Hospital were placed by the operators, under supervision, using ultrasound; the number of CVLs placed was similar for all operators: 7 to 9.</p><p>A portable ultrasound scanner (Logic Book XP, GE Medical Systems, USA) in bi-dimensional (2D) mode with a linear transducer of 8 Mhz was used in all procedures. The transducer was covered with ultrasound gel and wrapped in a sterile plastic bag. Sterile physiological saline solution was spread on the patient&#x02019;s skin to eliminate the air interface between the skin and the plastic bag. The transducer was placed in a transverse position to the patient&#x02019;s neck axis, leveled with the separation of the sternal and clavicle bundles of the SCM, or, if non-palpable, lateral to the visceral axis at the middle point between the lower jaw angle and the clavicle. Briefly, the ICA was identified as a round, throbbing, and incompressible structure. The IJV was identified because it is placed in front and outwards with respect to the ICA, it is compressible, and non-throbbing. Catheterization was attempted after checking for compressibility. In case of finding an incompressible vein (intraluminal thrombus), catheterization was attempted through the contralateral side. Each procedure was carried out by a single operator, who performed the ultrasound scan and the puncture simultaneously (mono-operator). Vein penetration was confirmed objectively when the tip of the puncture needle was visualized inside the vein or when blood return was obtained. Once inside the vein, the CVL was placed using Seldinger&#x02019;s technique. Control of the central catheter position was performed by thorax radiography in all cases.</p><p><italic>Data collection and statistical analyses. </italic>Demographic data were collected from all patients: age, sex, BMI, main condition, and mechanical ventilation. From the procedure, the following data were collected: puncture side, number of attempts, success/failure, complications (arterial puncture, hematoma, and/or pneumothorax), and neck features. Data were analyzed by &#x003a7;<sup>2</sup> independent test through 2&#x000d7;2 tables. In order to include three variables into the analysis, difference of proportions tests were used.

Regarding non-expert operators, comparison with previous studies that include ultrasound scanner use is difficult because most prospective studies included operators that were experts in CVL. The study of this issue involving non-expert or in-training operators is one of the novelties of our work. It is noted that in the present study the puncture technique was performed using an ultrasound scanner in a mono-operator mode, i.e., the operator had to learn to perform both the ultrasound scan and the puncture simultaneously. Mey et al. reported on the efficiency of the ultrasound-guided technique when performed by two operators (one performing the puncture while the other performed the ultrasound scan) [<xref rid="R040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The study showed that the most important factor when performing a puncture under ultrasound guidance is the scanner operator&#x02019;s experience, since only when this operator was experienced the success rate was &#x0003e;97.1%; on the other hand, if only the operator performing the puncture was experienced or both operators were inexperienced, effectiveness was reduced to between 90.1% and 90.3% [<xref rid="R040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In our study, non-expertoperators succeeded in 72% of the cases without ultrasound and improved to 86% with ultrasound use, which coincides with the above-mentioned results. Slama et al. published a prospective study with inexperienced operators, reporting a 76% effectiveness without ultrasound and 100% with ultrasound while using the two-operators technique with an experienced ultrasound scanner operator [<xref rid="R029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>With regards to complications in the NE group, we recorded an incidence of 24% without ultrasound, which is higher than that obtained by Sznajder et al. [<xref rid="R003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] (14%) and Eisen et al. [<xref rid="R013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] (10%). With the help of the ultrasound scanner, the incidence of complications in this group decreased to 7.8%, which is similar to that obtained by Mey et al., who reported an incidence of 10% to 17% for inexperienced ultrasound operators and puncture performers [<xref rid="R040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In the case of expert operators, a similar rate of complications was observed both with and without an ultrasound scanner, namely 8.3% and 8.8%, respectively. The rate of complications without ultrasound is similar to that reported by Karaktisos et al. (10.6%) [<xref rid="R015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], Troianos et al. (8.43%) [<xref rid="R027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and Denys et al. (8.3%)[<xref rid="R018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; however, we did not observe a decrease in the rate of complications with ultrasound use, as was observed in these studies. This might reflect a lack of experience in the use of ultrasound, since the 8.3% rate of complications can be compared to the 7.8% obtained by the NE group, and is in concordance with the study by Mey et al. highlighting the importance of experience in the ultrasound scan [<xref rid="R040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Therefore, training in ultrasound scanning is essential to achieve higher benefits from the technique.</p><p>The most frequently found complications [97% (29/30)], were ICA puncture and/or local hematoma. Although the classical anatomical description of the vein in the anterolateral position with respect to the artery is the most usual, it does not apply to all cases. Gordon et al. reported that the vein was found in anterolateral or lateral position in 72% of cases while in 22% and 5% of cases it was in an anterior position and inside with respect to the artery, respectively [<xref rid="R041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Troianos et al., in a study with over 1,000 patients, found that the vein was overlapping the artery over 75% of its circumference in 54% of the patients [<xref rid="R042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The mere movement of head rotation in a contralateral direction relative to the puncture site, employed as part of the vascular access technique, increases the overlap between both vessels [<xref rid="R043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. It has also been observed that the vein is easily compressed by the puncture needle, sometimes going across this blood vessel; along with the overlap observed between the IJV and the ICA, this compression helps to explain the higher rate of arterial puncture when performing the maneuver blindly [<xref rid="R044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>Further, we investigated if the absence of palpable landmarks had an influence on the results; the E group was more successful with ultrasound (93% vs 65%), whereas the NE group did not show significant differences. In our opinion, the difficult neck situation posed an additional difficulty for the NE group. Regarding complications in patients with necks considered difficult to puncture, there were no significant differences in either of the groups. We consider that the number of procedures analyzed might be insufficient to detect differences and that a more powerful study (higher patient numbers) may be necessary to detect them.</p><p>&#x000a0;</p><p><bold><italic>Limitations </italic></bold></p><p>A significant limitation of the current is the unequal number of patients included in the E and NE groups. The cutoff point was decided when half the number of patients estimated in the sample was reached (257 of 450) and the number of patients in each group (E and NE) was not considered in that decision. Another limitation is the threshold of 70 procedures for inclusion of an operator in the E group. This limit may be too high, since an observation <italic>a posteriori </italic>of our data indicates that for an operator who performed the 70 procedures in the NE group, most complications occurred during the first 30 procedures (<italic>Figure 2</italic>).</p><fig id="F005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>&#x000a0;</p><p>Number of complications in the 70 procedures performed by a non-experienced operator. Most of the complications (10 of 12) were presented in the first 30 punctures.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="hlv-06-013-g005"/></fig><p>It is possible that an operator can be considered an &#x0201c;expert&#x0201d; with only more than 30 CVLs placed; if that is the case, the NE group would actually be a moderately trained group, with smaller differences between the two groups than expected. Even though there is lack of a specifically delineated number of procedures to develop competence in ultrasound CVL cannulation, it has been suggested by experts that a minimum of 10 procedures are required [<xref rid="R038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. A recent paper by Nguyen et al. demonstrated that the maximal technical skills score was obtained after 8 procedures [<xref rid="R045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In our study, the &#x0201c;expert&#x0201d; operators in CVL placement were probably not trained in ultrasound techniques well enough, which would explain the same percentage of complications with and without ultrasound in the &#x0201c;expert&#x0201d; group. Nevertheless, this lack of a difference may also be attributed to the small sample size (the study was interrupted in 257 procedures). For a correct interpretation of this result, the study would need to be completed with the total number of patients that were initially calculated in the methods section of the study. Finally, difficult neck with non-palpable landmarks due to obesity, subcutaneous cell tissue infiltration, previous CVL, tracheotomy, or intraluminal thrombus could be considered as exclusion criteria in order to avoid bias in the study, as they have not been evenly distributed between the two studied groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s10"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Ultrasound scanning facilitates the insertion of central lines and decreases the number of complications. If ultrasound is not available for CVL placement, we highly recommend that experienced operators insert the CVL. Experience in ultrasound scanning has an influence on the results; therefore, operators, no matter whether they are experienced in CVL placement or not, should receive training on ultrasound scanning to improve results.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="nota_1" fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support</bold> Nil.</p></fn><fn id="nota_2" fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Disclosures</bold> None declared.</p></fn><fn id="nota_3" fn-type="other"><p><bold>Cite as:</bold> Rando K, Castelli J, Pratt JP, Scavino M, Rey G, Rocca ME, Zunini G.
