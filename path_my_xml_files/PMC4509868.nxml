The societal value of removing all uncertainty around glaucoma screening is &#x000a3;107 million at a threshold of &#x000a3;20,000 per QALY. For informing policy decisions on glaucoma screening, reducing uncertainty surrounding the NHS and personal social care cost of sight impairment (&#x000a3;74 million) was of most value, followed by reducing uncertainty in test performance (&#x000a3;14 million) and uptake of either screening or current eye care (&#x000a3;8 million each).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A glaucoma screening trial in the UK is unlikely to be the best use of research resources.

The modelling evaluation, hereafter referred to as the Glaucoma Screening Model, used the best data available but still had some uncertainties: how best to screen (tests and location); likely uptake of any screening programme; and the effectiveness and coverage of current eye care services.</p><p>The most robust way to evaluate any proposed screening programme is a randomized controlled trial (RCT).<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1355819613499748" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> There are no RCTs evaluating glaucoma screening<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1355819613499748" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and any trial would need to be large and thus costly. In a recent trial platform study,<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1355819613499748" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> we undertook a multicomponent mixed-methods approach to provide evidence to inform the optimal design for a trial.

We took a systematic, theory-based approach to intervention development (identifying the evidence, modelling process and developing outcomes) and explored the feasibility (for service providers), acceptability (for providers and users), and cost-effectiveness (for health and social services) of trial components.

We also used data collected in the survey on attendance by the public for an eye test within the last three years to estimate uptake of the comparator pathway within the model of opportunistic case finding within current eye care.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-1355819613499748" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Costs were reported in 2010 prices. We sought estimates of attendance at eye care services for several risk groups (age over 50, black ethnicity, diabetes, myopia, family history of glaucoma, and low socioeconomic status from the British Household Panel Survey data<sup><xref rid="bibr22-1355819613499748" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> to develop and fit the probability distributions around the mean uptake of current eye care for the general population and subgroups using the Excel&#x000a9; add-on Oracle&#x000a9; Crystal Ball. Revised utility data were based on the EQ-5D-3L<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1355819613499748" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> responses from 640 participants with ocular hypertension and glaucoma sampled from a secondary glaucoma service (Prior, personal communication). All other parameters were as detailed in the original Glaucoma Screening Model.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1355819613499748" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-1355819613499748" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The model allowed movement between health states every year, estimated costs from NHS and personal social services perspectives and used the EQ-5D-3L quality of life weights to calculate quality adjusted life years (QALYs).</p><p>The base case analysis conducted from NHS perspective, considered a cohort of 40-year old males with prevalence from 1% to 5%. Sex-specific variables were not available for any of the model parameters except for mortality. We used male mortality in the base-case analysis, consistent with good modelling practice, as they are a conservative assumption for screening. Alternative likelihoods of attending screening (e.g. 30&#x02013;100%) and estimated costs and QALYs over their estimated lifetime with screening occurring every 10 years were included. All costs and QALYs were discounted at 3.5%. The results are presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).</p><p>We conducted sensitivity analyses to identify plausible situations where screening might be considered worthwhile by varying screening start age and accuracy of glaucoma detection within current eye care services. We used alternative data for uptake of current eye care (based on the survey of the public<sup><xref rid="bibr21-1355819613499748" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) data) for the whole population, for cohorts aged 50 and 60 as well as for higher risk subgroups of the adult population: those self-reported as having diabetes, sight problems in the family (excluding using spectacles) as a proxy for family history of glaucoma, and those at low household income (below &#x000a3;10,000 a year). Data were not available within the BHPS to investigate the impact of ethnicity or myopia on the uptake rates of current eye care by these groupings.</p><p>The effect of including personal social services costs was explored in the sensitivity analysis by incorporating an annual cost of sight impairment from &#x000a3;1000 to &#x000a3;40,000. The upper value is in line with personal social services expenditure per person with sight impairment for England for 2009&#x02013;10.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-1355819613499748" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Variations in cost of sight impairment were combined with variation in both prevalence rates and screening uptake to identify situations where screening might be worthwhile. We explored the impact of increasing screening uptake because of a behavioural intervention and incorporating an additional cost for its provision. Without a behavioural intervention, glaucoma screening uptake was considered to be about 23% (based on our survey where 45% of the sample had strong intention scores (mean intention score of 7 on a 1&#x02013;7 scale)<sup><xref rid="bibr21-1355819613499748" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and the health behaviour literature that 50% of strong intenders will perform the intended behaviour.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-1355819613499748" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> We varied screening uptake from 30% to 100% to explore the impact of a behavioural intervention. Reflecting a simple behavioural intervention such as an invitation letter targeted to improve motivation by making it easier to attend a screening appointment to a fully tailored intervention, and thus more costly, to persuade those with low intentions to attend. The mean QALYs were expressed in pounds sterling by multiplying them by the willingness to pay for a QALY threshold (e.g. &#x000a3;30,000, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1355819613499748">Figure 1</xref>). <fig id="fig1-1355819613499748" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Strategies with the highest net-benefit (defined as &#x000a3;30,000&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;mean QALYs minus mean costs) for alternative values of annual cost of sight impairment and percentage of screening uptake for a 50-year-old cohort.

</p><p>We also explored whether enhanced current eye care would be better than enrolling in a screening programme by modifying the model in order to compare two current practice strategies. Two uptake rates of current eye care were compared using BHPS data: 6.5% (corresponding to the uptake rate of low income groups) and 17% (estimated uptake of eye care for people with diabetes).</p><p>All analyses incorporated probabilistic sensitivity analyses where the statistical imprecision is allowed for by sampling (e.g. 1000 times) from probability distributions attached to model mean parameter values. The uncertainty in the model parameter values has cost implications as the &#x02018;correct&#x02019; strategy might not be chosen. In effect, if the analysis is run with alternative parameter values the choice of strategy might differ from the strategy finally adopted. The sum of the benefits forgone for not being able to make the right decision due to this uncertainty is the expected value of perfect information (EVPI), as perfect information would eliminate the possibility of making wrong decisions.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-1355819613499748" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The EVPI can be compared with the cost of reducing uncertainty in the model by collecting further information.

These data include estimates from people with sight loss but data were not reported separately.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-1355819613499748" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> The cost of sight impairment in the UK is reported by the Royal National Institute for the Blind as &#x000a3;12,457 per person per year.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-1355819613499748" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> However, these calculations include indirect costs (productivity losses), cost due to lower employment, premature mortality, as well as &#x000a3;8782 corresponding to burden of disease cost &#x02013; the use of such figures entails some double counting as some of these effects are captured within the QALY estimates. Estimates by Mead and Hyde suggest that the cost of blindness for another chronic eye condition, age related macular degeneration, range around &#x000a3;8000 (updated to 2010&#x02013;2011 prices) for the first year of blindness but highlighted the limitations in the data to determine the true costs of failing eyesight.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-1355819613499748" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p><p>The purpose of updating the original Glaucoma Screening Model was to determine whether, given the newly defined screening pathways and target population, a large glaucoma screening RCT would be value for money in terms of informing policy decisions. The value of removing all uncertainties in the model was around &#x000a3;107 million, indicating that further research on glaucoma screening might be worthwhile. The uncertainty around cost of sight impairment contributed most followed by the uncertainty around screening test performance, and the uptake of screening or current eye care services.</p><p>These findings suggest that before proceeding to a large RCT evaluating a glaucoma screening or surveillance programme, further research to understand and quantify the cost of sight impairment is a priority. These data would be best collected within a prospective cohort study, following individuals through the spectrum of visual impairment and as needs change and adaptation to sight loss occurs.</p><p>The effectiveness of any screening or surveillance programme requires that the target population attend. Our findings suggest that behavioural intervention, such as a carefully worded invitation with a reminder or a more intensive intervention (e.g. tailored message, SMS reminder, buddy system) may improve attendance.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-1355819613499748" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="sec12-1355819613499748"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study used a transparent iterative approach building on a robust evidence synthesis and sought views of all stakeholders to inform decisions regarding glaucoma screening. We used robust qualitative and quantitative methods to provide an evidence-based recommendation for future research. It was not within the scope of this study to estimate the accuracy of screening tests or to evaluate the accuracy of current eye care services in the detection of glaucoma. We used the same estimates of performance of community optometric detection of glaucoma (current eye care) as used in the original model, based on a survey in the late 1980s which may not represent current practice. To estimate screening test performance we used estimates from an evidence synthesis but these were based on evidence from studies with heterogeneous populations and high risk of bias.</p><p>We had limited data on the uptake of current eye care services by higher risk groups, particularly by ethnic minority groups and those who might expect to have a higher uptake of current eye care, those with a family history of glaucoma. We did however use new primary data from our survey on eye testing within the last few years and used data from the BHPS that is considered to be representative.</p><p>The value for information analysis can only capture those uncertainties incorporated into the economic model and is dependent on the model structure. The model did not consider the potential harms due to screening (e.g. anxiety for those with false positives) or the side effects of treatment (e.g. cataracts). While it is unlikely that these omissions would have a major impact on the model results, they are a limitation of the analysis. Finally, while the EVPI analysis constitutes a necessary condition in determining whether further research is worthwhile it is not in itself sufficient to determine whether research should be conducted (although it can give a strong indication that further research is not worthwhile, if for example EVPI is less than the costs of conducting further research). A positive expected net-benefit of sampling (ENBS) constitutes a necessary and sufficient condition to conduct further research. ENBS is the difference between the benefits of reducing uncertainty with a particular sample size study and the cost of obtaining that sample size. Unfortunately, ENBS can be obtained only under very restrictive assumptions and is often computationally prohibitive and there have been few examples where it has been used in practice to inform, for example, the sample size of a trial.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-1355819613499748" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> In such circumstances, we believe the EVPI establishes a first step to inform the judgment that further research is potentially worthwhile.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec13-1355819613499748"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A glaucoma screening trial is currently unlikely to be the best use of research resources to inform policy decisions on screening policy in the UK. Further research to quantify the health and personal social services costs of sight impairment is recommended. Further development of glaucoma tests and an evaluation of a behavioural intervention to improve attendance for those who do not use eye care services would be worthwhile. Our findings are UK specific, but the methods used and the modelling framework can be adapted and populated with country specific parameters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="doc" xlink:href="supplementary_material_499748.doc" orientation="portrait" id="d35e1070" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank John Norrie, Alexandra Green, and Jemaima Che-Hamzah for their contribution to the design of the project; members of the advisory group&#x02009;-&#x02009;Rustom Bativala, David Crabb, David Garway-Heath, Roger Hitchings, Stephen McPherson, Anja Tuulonen, Ananth Viswanathan, Heather Waterman, and Richard Wormald.</p></ack><sec id="sec18-1355819613499748"><title>Funding</title><p>This paper was developed from a strategic grant funded by the Medical Research Council (project reference G0701759).
