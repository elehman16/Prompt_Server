In the absence of specific treatments, it has been suggested that removable, lightweight fibreglass heel casts may both promote healing and reduce discomfort and pain. The aim of the study is to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of fibreglass heel casts in the management of heel ulcers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is an observer-blind, randomised controlled trial in which participants with diabetes and heel ulcers (NPUAP/EPUAP grades 2, 3 or 4 and present for 2 or more weeks) are randomised to receive either usual care plus lightweight fibreglass heel casts or usual care alone. Randomisation is undertaken by random number sequence generation incorporated as part of the electronic case record form, and is stratified by both ulcer area (less than versus equal to or greater than 1&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup>) and NPUAP/EPUAP grade. Participants are followed every two weeks until healing or for 24&#x000a0;weeks. The primary outcome measure is healing at or before 24&#x000a0;weeks and maintained for 4&#x000a0;weeks. Secondary outcomes include (<italic>i</italic>) <italic>ulcer-related outcomes</italic>: time to healing, change in ulcer area, minor and major amputation, secondary infection and (<italic>ii</italic>) <italic>patient-related outcomes</italic>: local pain, mood and function (EQ-5D), impact of the ulcer (Cardiff Wound Impact Schedule) and survival. Cost-effectiveness will be assessed using a decision analytic model to estimate costs from the perspective of the UK NHS and personal social services and health outcomes, including percent healing and Quality Adjusted Life Years gained.</p><p>Safety will be documented as adverse and serious adverse device effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>If it is possible to confirm significant clinical benefit and/or cost-effectiveness, this would have direct implications for the management of this distressing and costly complication of diabetes</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN62524796">ISRCTN62524796</ext-link> Registered 29 March 2011</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Diabetic foot ulcer</kwd><kwd>Heel</kwd><kwd>Pressure sore</kwd><kwd>Ulcer healing</kwd><kwd>Diabetes complications</kwd><kwd>Neuropathy</kwd><kwd>Casting</kwd><kwd>Off-loading</kwd><kwd>Amputation</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Chronic ulceration of some part of the foot affects up to 15% of all people with diabetes at some stage, and is the source of considerable cost and suffering[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The average age at presentation is 67&#x000a0;years and many of those affected are thus older aged, with significant co-morbidities and often clinging to an independent existence. Only two thirds of all ulcers heal without amputation within 12&#x000a0;months and in these, the median time to healing is 78&#x000a0;days[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Forty percent of patients whose ulcers heal will develop a recurrence within 12&#x000a0;months[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Ulcers of the heel present particular difficulties and it has often been said traditionally that 'Heel ulcers don&#x02019;t heal'. Seven percent of heel ulcers result in amputation of the limb in diabetes and 20% persist until death[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Despite this, a single centre review of a consecutive series of 154 heel ulcers in 97 patients with diabetes managed in UK revealed that the eventual incidence of healing of heel ulcers without surgery was very similar to ulcers elsewhere on the foot. The median time to healing was, however, very much longer at 200 (24 to 1,225) days[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] - almost 3 times longer than ulcers elsewhere on the foot. A recent multicentre survey in 14 centres in Europe reported that the median time to healing of heel ulcers was very similar, at 237&#x000a0;days[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Heel ulcers in diabetes also differ from ulcers elsewhere on the foot in that they are frequently painful.</p><p>Many heel ulcers arise as a result of the pressure of immobilisation, and pressure ulcers are very common in acute hospitals. Repeated prevalence surveys in UK suggest that 8 to 10% of all patients in acute hospital beds develop a pressure ulcer, of which one third are on the heel; half of all pressure ulcers are in people with diabetes. The prevalence of pressure ulcers is higher in long-stay hospitals and care homes (Pankhurst S, Clough A unpublished data).</p><p>While the principles of care have been specified by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the Royal College of Nursing (RCN)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and by the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (International Diabetes Federation)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], there are no specific interventions which have been shown to improve the outcome. The use of a non-removable below-knee fibreglass (total contact or variant) cast is known to hasten healing in ulcers caused by abnormal pressure loading on other parts of the foot[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], but it has been reported to be ineffective when the ulceration is on the heel[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>In the absence of specific treatment of proven effectiveness in heel ulcers, a small number of specialists in UK advocated the use of lightweight, removable fibreglass heel casts, and produced uncontrolled observational evidence that these devices result in both a reduced time to healing and a prompt improvement in pain and discomfort. Thus, healing was observed in 42 (84%) of a consecutive series of 50 heel ulcers (in patients both with and without diabetes, but all of whom had peripheral arterial disease), with a median (range) time to healing of 6 (3 to 13) weeks[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Although the apparent benefit seems greater than would be expected for such a simple device, the findings of this uncontrolled study are mirrored by the clinical impression of the applicants. The mechanism for any positive effect is not known but may relate to the reduction of shearing and stretching forces applied to the surface of the ulcer. Current strategies to reduce local forces in an area of ulceration (or ulceration risk) are largely concentrated an attempt to reduce vertical forces with minimal effect, if any, on shear and on stretching.</p><p>Lightweight fibreglass heel casts take approximately 15&#x000a0;minutes to mould to the heel and can be easily fashioned in a domiciliary setting. They are applied over the primary wound dressing and held in place with an outer dressing, being saved and re-used each time the dressing is changed. They are replaced when stained, damaged or lost, and can often be worn inside shoes. Health care professionals can be trained in their use in approximately 30&#x000a0;minutes, and the material cost of each cast is approximately &#x000a3;7. Casts need to be replaced on average every three weeks.</p><p>The purpose of the proposed study is to systematically evaluate the effectiveness and cost implications of this simple and apparently beneficial intervention. The study was funded by NHS National Institute for Health Research, Health Technology Assessment Programme Grant 09/01/53.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study configuration</title><p>This will be an observer-blind, randomised controlled trial.

Costs will be compared between the two groups using a bottom-up approach from the perspective of UK NHS and personal social services. Data relating to the costs of training professionals and the costs of heel casts and their application will be collected by discussions with relevant clinical and finance staff. Incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios will be generated for a series of time horizons (including a lifetime perspective) that reflect management of patients with diabetic ulcers of the heel. The findings will be subjected to a series of one-way sensitivity analyses to determine the degree to which variation in parameter estimates affect the relative cost-effectiveness ratios. The results will be used to model the likely effects over the particular time horizons and costs and effects will be discounted at 3.5%. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis will be conducted to investigate the joint uncertainty in parameter values and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will be generated. A budget impact analysis will be undertaken for 1-year and 5-year periods and will compare the costs to the health service of the use of heel casts in the management of ulcers of the heel in diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Safety endpoints</title><p>The study population is one which comprises older aged people who will have a high prevalence of co-morbidities, including renal, cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases. Moreover, ulcers of the foot may themselves worsen and lead to hospital admission because of infection or increasing necrosis. Although no specific safety issues are foreseen with the use of the heel cast, significant events are listed among the secondary outcome measures. Other unexpected ADEs will be recorded and if considered serious (SADE) will be reported to the sponsor in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP).</p><p>The trial will be stopped when the last recruited subject reaches the end of the trial. However, premature termination of the clinical trial may occur because of a regulatory authority decision, change in opinion of the Research Ethics Committee (REC), or safety problems at the discretion of the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) or Sponsor. No formal interim analyses for efficacy are planned by the Trial Management group (TMG). However, the DMC may need to assess efficacy in relation to safety in order to advise the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) appropriately. Stopping for safety will be based on an informal assessment by the DMC of adverse events. To aid interpretation of efficacy, Haybittle-Peto type boundaries of&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3 standard errors (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0027) will be adopted to permit the DMC to break the blind with negligible effect on the properties of the final analysis.</p><p>Recruitment at any centre may be stopped for reasons including low recruitment and inadequate data recording.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>Internet-based treatment assignment will be determined by a computer-generated pseudo-random code using random permuted blocks of randomly varying size, created by the Nottingham CTU.

In addition all local regulatory requirements will be adhered to, in particular those which afford greater protection to the safety of trial subjects. All investigators and research staff will be fully trained in GCP, and the study will be conducted in line with these principles.

The treatment group term will be forced to stay in the maximum model; the model outcome will be the primary outcome. Using a backwards-stepwise elimination from the maximum model, the final covariate adjusted model will contain all prognostics and unbalanced variables known to have a meaningful bias on the estimate of the treatment effect. The LRT <italic>P</italic>-value for the estimate of treatment effect from this model will be reported, together will the covariate adjusted OR for treatment effect, and the appropriate 95% CI.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>Testing of the secondary outcome variables is exploratory and the results should mainly be used for exploratory purposes. On this basis, no adjustments for multiple testing will be performed.</p><p>The time to complete healing of the reference ulcer between the two randomized groups is an important secondary outcome and will be compared using survival analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival curves will be produced for the 2 groups and the median time to healing with 95% CI presented. Treatment effect will be explored using a Cox proportional hazards model including stratification factors (ulcer size and grade) initially. Participants&#x02019; heel ulcers that are not healed will be treated as censored and their date of trial exit, or date of last available assessment, or 168-day/trial cessation, as appropriate, will be used to calculate their duration in the trial. Hazard ratio with 95% CI will be given.</p><p>Final ulcer area will be analysed by treatment group for those who remain unhealed at the end of the study, using linear regression. As this exploratory analysis will include a subset of the participants, the analysis will be adjusting for baseline area, and any other variables that are found to be imbalanced at baseline (ANCOVA: on both an ITT and PP basis).</p><p>Ulcer related pain (measured on a VAS), will be analysed using linear regression and adjusting for baseline pain score, ulcer area, duration of ulcer, and ulcer type on both an ITT and PP basis.</p><p>Scores on standardised scales (EQ-5D) will be calculated in line with the guidelines provided by the original authors. The three domain scores will be calculated on the CWIS for each participant, in line with the standard instructions for use: descriptive statistics will be used to summarise these at each assessment. The standardised areas under the curve (area under the curve for each participant adjusted for the duration of available data) will be reported for both groups and compared using a Wilcoxon rank sum test.</p><p><italic>Secondary variables: Descriptive</italic></p><p>All other variables that will not be modelled formally will be considered descriptively.

However, missing data could still occur due to failure to attend for an assessment visit. Missing primary outcome data will be investigated through multiple imputation as a secondary sensitivity analysis of the primary outcome, should the missing data fall within the 20to 25% range.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Determination of sample size</title><p>The expected prevalence of healed ulcer in the control group and the treatment group is 40% and 55%, respectively, at 24&#x000a0;weeks.

With 25% attrition, the number required is 496 (to achieve 186 in each group). The study will aim to recruit 500 patients and closely monitor the number of cases where the primary outcome data are missing. All secondary analyses will be interpreted with caution as the sample size calculation is based on the primary outcomes only. Internet-based treatment assignment will be determined by a computer-generated pseudo-random code using random permuted blocks of randomly varying size, created by the Nottingham CTU. Trial participants will be allocated with equal probability to each treatment arm with stratification by ulcer grade and ulcer size.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Discussion</title><p>Ulcers of the heel constitute a major source of morbidity and cost, and there has hitherto been no specific therapy described. Recently, however, the use of lightweight fibreglass heel casts has been described and has been reported to improve both the incidence and speed of healing. The purpose of this trial is to document the efficacy of this intervention, as well as its cost, when compared to the use of defined criteria of best usual care.</p><p>The trial is randomised and while it is not possible to blind either the participant or their carer to the allocated arm of the study, the primary outcome measure (clinical healing) will be confirmed by a blinded observer. All non-clinical measures (including digital images of ulcer, measures of pain and discomfort) will be undertaken by blinded observers.</p><p>The study population is designed to be as inclusive as possible, with the aim of maximising the external validity of any findings. Thus, the intention is that as large a percentage as possible of people with diabetes complicated by ulceration of the heel could be included - including those with active infection, as well as those with all but the most severe peripheral arterial disease. This population is, however, one with multiple co-morbidities, a high expected incidence of unrelated illness and hospital admission and a poor overall life-expectancy. It is for this reason that a decision has been made to restrict safety measures to device effects. It is also for this reason that the sample size calculation allows for up to 30% attrition, and this is based on previous experience gained in conducting trials in this area.</p><p>While the primary outcome measure is that of healing, the trial includes a number of secondary outcome measures. Principal among these are rate of change in ulcer area - as an indication of the likelihood of eventual healing, and the experience of local pain and discomfort. While most foot ulcers in diabetes are typically painless, those on the heel are often the source of pain or other discomfort and experience reported by those who have used such casts in clinical practice is that reduction in local discomfort is often observed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment started on 20 April 2011 and ceased on 4 September 2014 by which time 509 participants had been randomised.
