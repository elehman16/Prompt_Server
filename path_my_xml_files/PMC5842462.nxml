Severe symptoms are more often seen in young infants.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Management is mainly supportive, includes proper hydration and moist oxygen support delivered through either face mask, nasal cannulae, noninvasive continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) or hot humidified high-flow nasal cannulae (HHHNFC). Severe cases may require mechanical ventilation (MV).[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>nCPAP in bronchiolitis acts by widening the peripheral lung airways thus allowing the overdistended lungs in bronchiolitis to deflate. It also prevents the collapse of the poorly supported peripheral airways during expiration by increasing the airway pressure, thus increasing Functional residual capacity (FRC) which in turn increases gaseous exchange and hence oxygenation. A constant airway pressure during nCPAP support maintains airway patency throughout the breath cycle, thus causing unloading of respiratory muscles and an improvement in breathing pattern.</p><p>Over the last decade, HHHFNC therapy has emerged as a new method to provide respiratory support for bronchiolitis.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Nasal cannulae, which were first used to administer supplemental oxygen (low-flow therapy) on a large scale, also showed the capability for the administration of nCPAP through HFNC as it developed. Needless to say, apart from meeting-specific physical criteria, a relative humidity of 100% and a temperature of 37&#x000b0;C are the basic requirements of this intervention.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The application of HHHFNC in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) has developed significantly during the last decade due to the fact that not only is this system capable of providing a specific percentage of the respiratory oxygen, but it can also administer noninvasive respiratory support of constant-flow CPAP without the need for any further equipment.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>When the respiratory disease is accompanied by increasing respiratory work, supportive mechanisms of HHHFNC are specifically categorized as follows:</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Dead space ventilation in the nasopharyngeal space</title><p>High-flow therapy (HFT) may eventually enhance alveolar ventilation by decreasing the dead space through establishing washout in the nasopharyngeal space by gas insufflations (GIs), which in turn increases the minute ventilation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Decrease in respiratory work</title><p>This is the result of providing some level of splinting in the nasopharynx, which has a significant ability of compliance. When HFT produces GIs beyond demand flow in the nasopharynx, it avoids the retraction of the nasopharynx wall in inspiration and with the lowering of resistance in this space; the respiratory work also decreases in inspiration. Moreover, during expiration, the expiratory flows face resistance in the nasopharynx and are redirected to the oropharynx, which eventually decreases the expiratory work because of the occurrence of the Coanda effect in the behavior of the gas.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Providing the maximum humidity and temperature</title><p>To establish optimal gas exchange, the airways increase the temperature and humidity of the inhaled gases to 37&#x000b0;C and 100%, respectively, while the HFT systems blocks energy wastage in the airways by establishing these conditions and eventually improving lung mechanics.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Study rationale</title><p>We conducted a prospective, randomized, pilot study involving patients admitted to the PICU with Bronchiolitis, complicated with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure to determine whether high-flow oxygen therapy as compared with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) therapy, could reduce the need of MV and improve outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Study design</title><p>We conducted a single-center, prospective, parallel group, open-label, and randomized pilot study at PICU of a tertiary care teaching hospital from September 2016 to February 2017.

Parameters such as LOS in PICU and oxygenation were similar in the two groups. Oxygen weaning occurred during the same time for the two groups. There were no differences between the two groups for RR, HR, FiO<sub>2</sub>, and CO<sub>2</sub> evolution. HFNC therapy failed in three patients, two of whom required invasive MV, versus one in the nCPAP group. These results are in concordance to our findings.</p><p>On the contrary Pedersen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] in a recent (2017) study from Denmark showed CPAP was superior to HFNC in lowering RR and FiO<sub>2</sub> in infants with bronchiolitis. More than half of the children treated with HFNC were changed to CPAP treatment due to suspected treatment failure. There were no differences between HFNC and CPAP in treatment length, hospitalization length or transfer to PICU. However, the study was limited by its retrospective, unrandomized design, and the lack of standardized measurements. It could be planned in a prospective design (e.g., a standardized clinical score and control pCO<sub>2</sub>).</p><p>There is lack of robust data comparing both therapies, though individually, both have been studied in different setups. An RCT comparing placebo versus nCPAP therapy in children &#x0003c;3 years with acute bronchiolitis found that nCPAP significantly improved the RR. However, changes in SpO<sub>2</sub>% and PaCO<sub>2</sub> data were imprecise, and duration of hospital stay was similar in both groups.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] A study evaluating the feasibility of nCPAP for infants with Bronchiolitis in a pediatric ward, reported a decline in median PaCO<sub>2</sub> after therapy, thus it was concluded that nCPAP may be feasible in such setting, provided sufficient trained staffs and PICU referral setups were available.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Another study reviewing the use of nCPAP (either alone or associated with Heliox) reported a reduction of PaCO2, RR, and the modified Woods clinical asthma score after 1 h of treatment. However, after applying the GRADE system, the quality of evidence for a beneficial effect of nCPAP was considered as low.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>In a Cochrane review article including RCTs or quasi-RCTs which assessed the effects of HHHFNC to conventional treatment in infants with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis, concluded that there is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of HHHFNC therapy for treating infants with bronchiolitis.
