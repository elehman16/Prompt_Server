Surgical treatment results in large improvement of hearing at low sound frequencies, but high-frequency hearing often suffers. A likely reason for this is that inner ear sensory cells are damaged by surgical trauma and loud sounds generated during the operation. Animal studies have shown that antioxidants such as N-Acetylcysteine can protect the inner ear from noise, surgical trauma, and some ototoxic substances, but it is not known if this works in humans. This trial was performed to determine whether antioxidants improve surgical results at high frequencies.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>We performed a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled parallel group clinical trial at three Swedish university clinics. Using block-stratified randomization, 156 adult patients undergoing stapedotomy were assigned to intravenous N-Acetylcysteine (150 mg/kg body weight) or matching placebo (1:1 ratio), starting one hour before surgery. The primary outcome was the hearing threshold at 6 and 8 kHz; secondary outcomes included the severity of tinnitus and vertigo.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Findings</title><p>One year after surgery, high-frequency hearing had improved 2.7 &#x000b1; 3.8 dB in the placebo group (67 patients analysed) and 2.4 &#x000b1; 3.7 dB in the treated group (72 patients; means &#x000b1; 95% confidence interval, p = 0.54; linear mixed model). Surgery improved tinnitus, but there was no significant intergroup difference. Post-operative balance disturbance was common but improved during the first year, without significant difference between groups. Four patients receiving N-Acetylcysteine experienced mild side effects such as nausea and vomiting.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>N-Acetylcysteine has no effect on hearing thresholds, tinnitus, or balance disturbance after stapedotomy.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00525551">NCT00525551</ext-link>

Surgery is a well-established treatment option, where the diseased stapes is bypassed by a prosthesis. This improves low-frequency hearing by 25&#x02013;30 dB, but high-frequency hearing often suffers [<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For instance, in the study by Bauchet St. Martin et al [<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], the average air conduction thresholds at 8 kHz were 8 dB worse six weeks after surgery. Improvement was seen in most patients over time, but an average decline of 4 dB remained at 9 months. Similarly, patients examined by Mair and Laukli [<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] had 7 dB deterioration in hearing at 8 kHz one year after surgery; high frequency audiometry demonstrated a 15-dB average worsening of hearing thresholds at 10 kHz and even larger losses at 12 and 14 kHz. In Bauchet St Martin&#x02019;s study [<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], 49% of patients had worse hearing at 8 kHz 9 months after surgery. Str&#x000f6;mb&#x000e4;ck et al [<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] used a more conservative measure, the average change in hearing across the three frequencies 4, 6, and 8 kHz, and found that 6.5% of patients had threshold deterioration larger than 10 dB after surgery. Finally, recent studies [<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] that extended the frequency range of bone conduction measurements demonstrated that 8-kHz thresholds are worse in 54% of patients six weeks after surgery; 25% of patients had bone conduction threshold losses that were 10 dB or larger. These studies indicate that deterioration of high-frequency hearing occurs in a substantial fraction of patients undergoing stapes surgery, despite the great benefit observed at lower frequencies.</p><p>High-frequency loss after stapes surgery may be a result of surgical trauma, perilymph leakage, and loud sounds generated by drilling close to the delicate sensory cells in the inner ear [<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Studies suggest that pharmacological intervention can target some of these factors. For instance, loud sound causes toxic free radicals to be generated in the hearing organ [<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and animal studies consequently demonstrate that hearing loss induced by noise can be decreased by antioxidants, such as N-Acetylcysteine [<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. N-Acetylcysteine has also shown some effectiveness against surgical inner ear trauma in animal models [<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>It is not known if the human ear can be protected by antioxidants, but N-Acetylcysteine is nonetheless incorporated in treatment programs for noise-exposed soldiers, and marketed as a nutritional supplement for protecting the ear against noise [<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Hearing loss that follows from noise or other trauma may be temporary or permanent. The temporary component can last for up to four weeks and is thought to depend on mechanisms other than free radical generation [<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Nevertheless, three small, short-term, randomized studies tested the effect of N-Acetylcysteine on temporary threshold shifts in humans [<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Minor but significant effects were observed in one of these trials [<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but the effect of antioxidants on permanent threshold shifts have not been examined.</p><p>We performed a clinical trial to determine if N-Acetylcysteine can improve high-frequency hearing (6 and 8 kHz) after stapedotomy. Patients were followed for one year after surgery, using audiograms as well as questionnaires designed to probe the severity of tinnitus and balance disturbance and the general satisfaction with surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Study design, oversight, and ethics statement</title><p>This randomized, placebo-controlled, and double-blind parallel-group trial was performed at three university clinics in Sweden.

We excluded patients with asthma [<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], hypersensitivity to the study drug, only one functioning ear, and those with previous middle ear surgeries. In premenopausal patients not using hormonal anticonception or intrauterine devices, serum chorionic gonadotropin was measured before administering the study drug; levels &#x0003e;5 IU / l led to exclusion.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Study procedures</title><p>Hearing was measured in soundproof booths with patients wearing calibrated TDH 39 headphones. Pure tones at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 kHz were presented to one ear at a time. Thresholds for bone-conducted sound (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 kHz) were measured by placing a calibrated vibrator on the mastoid process. Patients indicated stimulus perception by pressing a button; the threshold was identified using the modified Hughson-Westlake method as recommended by the International Standards Organization (ISO8253-1). Speech discrimination was tested using a set of 50 phonemically balanced words presented at the patient&#x02019;s most comfortable level (commonly located 30 dB above the average hearing threshold at 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz).</p><p>Patients graded the severity of tinnitus during the past week using a rating scale where zero was defined as no tinnitus and 10 as a high degree of disturbing tinnitus. A similar strategy assessed subjective vertigo. Satisfaction with hearing quality was estimated using a scale where zero corresponded to very low and ten indicated very high satisfaction.</p><p>The measures listed above were performed before surgery, 6&#x02013;8 weeks thereafter, and at one year. At the last two time points, patients also graded the overall outcome, zero corresponding to very poor and 10 indicating a very good result.</p><p>On the evening after surgery, physicians scored facial nerve function and gustation as normal or abnormal and nystagmus as present or absent. Patients also scored tinnitus and vertigo at this time point.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p>Subjects eligible for the study were divided in four strata based on age (over or under 45 years) and hearing threshold for bone-conducted sound at 4 kHz (better or worse than 40 dB hearing level). Stratified randomization with a block size of 6 was used to assign patients to intravenous N-Acetylcysteine (150 mg/kg body weight, mixed with physiological saline to a final volume of 300 ml) or matching placebo (300 ml of identical-appearing saline solution; the allocation ratio was 1:1). Infusions started one hour before surgery at a rate of 100 ml/h. The randomization lists were computer-generated by the pharmacy prior to the start of the study and kept at a central facility. Patients and all personnel involved in the study were unaware of treatment assignments.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Surgery</title><p>Eight experienced otologic surgeons performed operations. Surgeons were free to choose the technique they deemed best. Hence, in 35 of 156 cases a laser was used for thinning the stapes footplate and for vaporizing the tendon and the posterior and anterior crus of the stapes, and a skeeter microdrill utilized for stapedotomy. A microdrill was used throughout surgery in remaining cases. Periauricular infiltration of lidocaine-epinephrine was used in all patients; 10% also received general anaesthesia. Sedatives and antiemetics were used liberally, including betamethasone in 17 patients in the actively treated group and 25 patients in the placebo group. A separate statistical analysis showed that betamethasone lacked effect on primary or secondary outcomes. A teflon / platinum Fisch prosthesis with 0.4 mm diameter was used in 98% of cases.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Outcomes</title><p>In animal experiments, N-Acetylcysteine protects from loss of sensory cells but is less effective against the reversible hearing impairment that follows immediately after trauma [<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Because the 6&#x02013;8 week data may reflect temporary effects, the primary outcome was the hearing threshold at 6 and 8 kHz one year after surgery.</p><p>Secondary measures of efficacy included hearing thresholds at those frequencies 8 weeks after surgery, and the severity of tinnitus and vertigo at these two time points. Tinnitus was included as a secondary outcome measure because of its well-established relation to high-frequency hearing loss [<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and balance problems appear to be more common in patients where the inner ear is subject to greater surgical trauma.</p><p>To assess safety, we monitored facial nerve problems, gustation loss, and nystagmus, and the incidence of side effects from N-Acetylcysteine, such as exanthema, urticaria, bronchospasm, and anaphylactoid reactions [<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Estimations showed that 150 patients would result in 90% power to detect an intergroup difference in hearing thresholds of 10 dB at a significance level of 0.05.

The trial therefore continued until the number of patients dictated by the power analysis had been reached.</p><p>Data were analysed using linear mixed models with Gaussian error distribution [<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. To correct for patient age, sex, weight and the fact that the postoperative hearing recovery depended on stimulus frequency, we included these terms as independent variables. Pearson correlation, ANOVAs and &#x003c7;2-tests were used to test for collinearity among predictor variables. T-tests, the Wilcoxon rank sum test and the &#x003c7;2-test were used to compare baseline patient characteristics.</p><p>Linear mixed models were used to analyse the effect of medical treatment on the change in hearing thresholds after surgery. To account for the autocorrelation arising from the longitudinal data collection performed during audiometry, a patient-specific intercept was used as the random effect, and predictor variables mentioned above treated as fixed effects. Likelihood ratio testing (&#x003c7;2 test) was used to construct the optimal linear mixed model by starting from a full model and removing model terms in a stepwise manner. Finally, a likelihood ratio test compared the null model (including patient-specific intercept) to the final model, to evaluate the significance of adding that set of predictor variables. The intercept was significant (p &#x0003c; 0.001), confirming the appropriateness of the linear mixed model.</p><p>Tinnitus, dizziness and the perceived quality of hearing were analysed using ordered logistic regression.

However, it is also clear that surgical results are worse at stimulus frequencies &#x0003e;4 kHz than they are at low frequencies [<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; a recent study showed that 54% of patients had decline in bone-conduction thresholds at 8 kHz six weeks after surgery [<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The relatively poor high-frequency results may be an effect of surgical trauma and loud sounds generated during perforation of the stapes footplate. Some patients describe the sound of the microdrill as the &#x0201c;worst I ever heard&#x0201d;, and attempts at measuring the sound pressure generated by drilling has shown values in the range between 117 and 131 dB SPL [<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which is loud enough to cause significant hearing loss. Barotrauma, accidental suctioning of perilymph, and leakage of perilymph during prosthesis insertion may also contribute [<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

We therefore expected antioxidants to improve surgical results by modifying the effects of surgical trauma and any loud sound generated during footplate perforation. However, high-dose N-Acetylcysteine did not improve hearing thresholds or tinnitus. The perceived quality of hearing was worse in the N-Acetylcysteine group at 6 weeks, but this difference was only marginally significant and not present at 1 year. Vertigo was worse in the placebo group at 6 weeks, but again the difference was only marginally significant and not sustained. Given their inconsistency and low magnitude, it is likely that these differences were the result of chance.</p><p>Previous studies suggest that patients with normal or near normal high-frequency hearing thresholds have the highest risk of developing post-surgical hearing loss [<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These patients may have normally functioning sensory cells at the base of the cochlea and a small loss of such cells may be sufficient to measurably decrease hearing. Hence, a protective effect from antioxidants could be present in this subgroup of patients, but the group is not large, making recruitment for such a trial a challenge.</p><p>Short follow-up times were used in all previous human trials of antioxidants for hearing protection [<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This is problematic, because temporary threshold shifts are thought to depend on mechanisms where antioxidants are not expected to be optimally effective [<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A long follow-uptime is therefore important, although we note that there were only minor changes in hearing between weeks 6 and 52 in the present study. Hence, future trials in this area could probably be restricted to a 6-week time window without significant loss of power.</p><p>Previous trials also used relatively low oral doses of antioxidants. In the case of N-Acetylcysteine, this is a problem because only 6&#x02013;10% of an oral dose reaches the systemic circulation [<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and the half-life is approximately 2 h. Intravenous treatment was therefore used in the current study. Although it is difficult to extrapolate doses from animals to humans, the dose used here is within the range found effective in animals [<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and the average dose is around 9 times that used in human trials published to date [<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115657.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Pharmacological inner ear protection is difficult to study in humans, since people cannot be exposed to loud sounds to determine if their ears will be protected. A potential solution is to study military personnel or other groups with frequent noise exposure, but hearing loss will often develop slowly even in these groups, which makes studies time-consuming, expensive, and prone to compliance problems. Stapes surgery may be a setting where the effects of protective drugs can be studied, since the operation leads to a temporally well-defined trauma on the high-frequency parts of the inner ear.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0115657.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>Consort 2010 checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0115657.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0115657.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>English translation of study protocol as approved by the Regional Ethics Board in Stockholm.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0115657.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank study nurses Maria Axelsson and Carina Jankevics and audiologist Zohreh Nekoei for excellent assistance throughout the study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0115657.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
