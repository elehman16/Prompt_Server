All the patients were randomly stratified into 3 levels, based on the difficulty of the surgical procedure. Subsequently, the sequence numbers were allocated to either the TA group or the placebo group by the computer-generated random assignment. The protocol assigned for the enrolled patients was also coded. On the day of surgery, a nurse trained in performing the protocol before the study, who was not involved with the trial or was not a personnel caring for the patients, opened the sealed envelope in an isolated room away from the operating room, and prepared the treatment. The bottle with the bolus dose and the syringe with the maintenance intravenous infusion were marked only with the sequence number and the acronym of the patient's name. All the apparatus was indistinguishable between the TA and placebo groups. After the treatment preparation, the envelopes were resealed until disclosed by the statistician. The anesthesiologist, surgeons, researchers, and patients were blinded to the procedure.</p></sec><sec><label>2.4</label><title>Unblinding for medical emergencies</title><p>In case, the anesthesiologist or surgeon suspected medical emergencies associated with TA, such as allergic shock, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, stroke, or ischemic heart disease, the nature of the treatment was disclosed.</p></sec><sec><label>2.5</label><title>Administration program</title><p>Patients receiving a loading dose of 30&#x0200a;mg/kg TA over 15&#x0200a;minutes before skin incision followed by a maintenance infusion of TA (2&#x0200a;mg/kg/h) were continued until skin closure in the TA group. Equivalent normal saline was administered in the placebo group.</p></sec><sec><label>2.6</label><title>Anesthesia and monitoring</title><p>The standard general anesthesia applied to all patients was induced with intravenous drugs, including midazolam, sufentanil, propofol, and atracurium. The anesthesia was maintained using sevoflurane and atracurium. Consecutive to standard monitoring, the arterial blood pressure was also continuously monitored by a radial arterial line during operations. The mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was controlled at about 20% below the preoperative baseline pressure in both the groups, until the procedures of decompression, fusion, and instrumentation were completed following which it was returned to the baseline.</p><p>The maintenance fluid requirements and third-space losses were regulated by colloid and crystal solution.</p><p>The transfusion threshold for the intraoperative Hb level was &#x0003c;7.0&#x0200a;g/dL, which was guided by arterial blood gas analysis, arterial blood pressure, central venous catheter, and urinary output.</p></sec><sec><label>2.7</label><title>Surgical procedure</title><p>All the surgeries in both the TA group and placebo group patients were performed by 2 surgeons: one with 12 years&#x02019; experience in spinal surgery and the other with 17 years. The attending surgeons completed a short questionnaire about the difficulty of surgery, a day before the operation. The operations were divided into 3 levels based on surgical difficulty (level I: low difficulty; level II: medium difficulty; level III: high difficulty). Conventionally, the decompression fusion and fixation of 1&#x02013;2 segments were defined as level I, 3&#x02013;4 segments as level II, and more than 4 segments as level III.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup></p><p>Surgeries involved revision, extensive decompression, severe ASA physical status, and corpulent patients, which would increase the surgical difficulty,<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> requiring the surgeons to adjust the assessment of surgical difficulty.</p><p>All patients were placed in a prone position on the Hall&#x02013;Relton frame or the Jackson table with abdomen free and underwent posterior decompression interbody fusion and fixation with the pedicle screw. Using the posterior midline approach, the lamina, facet joints, and spinous processes of fixation segment were exposed. After the pedicle screws system had been implanted, and the appropriate location confirmed by radiography, the 2 connecting rods were installed. Next, semilaminectomy and removal of the disc in the decompression segment and a CAGE with autogenous bone granules tamponade was placed into the intervertebral space. Then, radiography was used to confirm the position of CAGE at the appropriate region. The iliac crest bone was not used for grafting. During the procedure of decompression and fusion, it is essential that surgeon carefully protects the nerve root and dura mater spinalis, and avert any injury to venous plexus. Before closing the wound, the bleeding is cautiously stanched, and drainage placed routinely.</p></sec><sec><label>2.8</label><title>Data collection</title><p>The primary outcomes were intraoperative estimated blood loss and total blood loss. The intraoperative estimated blood loss was estimated by a trained nurse before starting the trial and was blinded to the treatment and patient groups. The intraoperative estimated blood loss was evaluated by adding the weight of gauzes and sponges to the volume of blood in the negative pressure suction bottles, and subtracting the volume of irrigation fluids. The postoperative drainage was recorded daily from the volume of blood accumulated in the negative pressure drainage bottles until the drainage was removed (when the volume of drainage was less than 30&#x0200a;mL/d). The total amount of bleeding was equal to the intraoperative estimated blood loss plus postoperative drainage. The second outcome was receiving packed red blood cells, as well as postoperative hemoglobin, hematocrit levels.</p><p>Postoperatively, the laboratory parameters such as Hb, HCT, PLT, PT, APTT, as well as, fibrinogen and D-dimer were estimated on postoperative days 1 and 3.</p><p>When the postoperative Hb level was &#x0003c;70&#x0200a;g/L, 7.0 to10.0&#x0200a;g/dL and patients exhibited symptomatic anemia, such as tachycardia, fatigue, lethargy, poor appetite, and pallor, packed red blood cells were administered.</p><p>Data were collected on patients&#x02019; demographics, laboratory values, intra- and postoperative blood loss, the surgical procedure to be performed, and blood products transfused perioperatively. The inpatients were daily observed for putative complications and unexpected events associated with treatment, such as the clinical symptoms of ischemic heart disease, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. All discharged patients were followed-up each week until the day 35 after the operation.</p></sec><sec><label>2.9</label><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The data were analyzed by SPSS software version 17 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). A previous study showed that the mean perioperative blood loss for lumbar posterior interbody fusion was 500&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;350&#x0200a;mL when treated at our institution. Presuming a 30% reduction in the perioperative blood loss, 2-tailed test with 0.05 alpha error, and a statistical power of 0.8, 46 patients were needed for each group. Therefore, we strategized to enroll 50 patients in each group.</p><p>The qualitative data were expressed numerically and also as a percentage. The parametric quantitative data were expressed as mean and standard deviation, whereas the nonparametric quantitative data were expressed as median (range). The qualitative data were compared with the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher's exact test. The parametric quantitative data were analyzed using an unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test, whereas the nonparametric quantitative data were compared with the Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. Correlation analysis was used to explore the potential impact factors for total blood loss. Then, in order to find the weight of potential risk factors for significant bleeding, we used multiple logistic regression analysis to construct the formula model. <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>3</label><title>Results</title><p>A cohort of 126 consecutive patients was screened, and 100 patients aged 22 to 78 years were enrolled. These patients presented lumbar spinal stenosis or lumbar spondylolisthesis and were undergoing posterior decompression interbody fusion fixation with the pedicle screw. In total, 51 patients were randomly assigned in the TA group and 49 in the placebo group (mean ages, 56 and 54 years, respectively). During the operation, 3 patients changed to the simple procedure (1 in the TA group and 2 in the placebo group), and dural tear occurred in 1 patient in the placebo group. Thus, 4 patients were excluded from all the analyses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Moreover, any statistical differences were not observed between the 2 groups with respect to age, sex, MAP, weight, ASA physical status, and diagnosis.

Only 1 patient showed the occurrence of a dural tear in the placebo group; no other adverse events with the use of TA were seen in our study.</p><p>Previous studies showed that ASA physical status, body weight, different surgical techniques, the number of fusion segment, attending surgeons, duration of operation, and heterogeneous patient populations for various diagnosis may impact the perioperative blood loss.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> In our study, the patient profile, diagnosis, ASA physical status, and level of difficulty did not differ between the 2 groups. Moreover, the operation time and the patients treated by the 2 attending surgeons between the 2 groups did not exhibit any statistical difference.

This meant TA still significantly reduced the blood loss in this subgroup. Nevertheless, the intraoperative time and total blood loss were not significantly different between the 2 groups when the operative time was more than 180 minutes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>). Although TA did not lead to significant reduction in the perioperative blood loss, there were only 16 patients in this subgroup, which may be inadequate to detect a difference in the variables.</p><table-wrap id="T6" position="float"><label>Table 6</label><caption><p>Subgroup analysis of perioperative blood loss in different operative time.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-96-e5718-g008"/></table-wrap><p>The etiology of the perioperative blood loss for spinal surgery is multifactorial.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> The increased fibrinolytic activity and spinal venous plexus injury are critical factors contributing toward the perioperative blood loss.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> TA can competitively inhibit plasmin and plasminogen, thereby impeding the fibrinolysis and stabilizing the blood clot.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> Previous studies demonstrated that TA could inhibit the fibrinolytic activity and decrease blood loss in spinal deformity surgery or long segment fixation and fusion surgery.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> Elwatidy et al<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> showed that TA reduced 49% blood loss in the spinal surgery. Berney et al<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> reported that TA decreased nearly 50% intraoperative estimated blood loss in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis surgery. The surgery for lumbar stenosis and spondylolisthesis is not identical to the deformity correction surgery or simple long segment fixation and fusion surgery. The vertebral venous plexus is common in patients with lumbar stenosis or spondylolisthesis,<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> when injured during the operation, renders hemostasis difficult.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> TA can supposedly stabilize the blood clot to block the epidural venous plexus vascular rupture, thus, reducing the bleeding.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup></p><p>Nevertheless, the hemostatic efficacy of TA is yet unconfirmed in the patients undergoing posterior lumbar surgery for stenosis or spondylolisthesis. Wang et al<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> administered 15&#x0200a;mg/kg TA, which reduced 13% total blood loss in patients undergoing posterior lumbar interbody fusion for stenosis in a randomized controlled trial, and the total blood loss was statistically different between the TA and placebo groups. This study subtly assists the clinicians to make operative decisions. Although the study designed by Wang et al was rudimentary, it was composed on a well-balanced baseline index, and the blood loss was observed to be remarkably different between the treatment and control groups. Moreover, the study did not describe any sample size or test power analysis. Typically, any intervention evaluated in a randomized controlled trial only reduces more than 25%, which calls for attention.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> The 13% reduction of the total blood loss could not provide reliable evidence for the usage of TA. The present study manifested administering 30&#x0200a;mg/kg initial dose and 2&#x0200a;mg/kg/h maintenance dosage, which lessened 41% total blood loss. This prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study differed from that of Wang et al as we assumed 30% reduction in blood loss, which was clinically significant. The sample size could be recalculated based on the study. The 41% reduction of total blood loss in the present study could provide reliable evidence for the standard use of TA in the surgery for lumbar stenosis or spondylolisthesis. Another difference between Wang et al and our study was the patient population. Only patients with surgical difficulty levels II and III were enrolled in their study, whereas our study also included the difficulty level I patients. The level I is a huge cohort in clinical practice, and any measures to reduce the bleeding should not be ignored in this population. Therefore, we used stratified randomization to prevent interference by the difficulty levels. The composition of the population between the groups was not statistically different. The subgroup analysis exhibited that TA not only lessened the perioperative blood loss in medium and high-level difficulty surgeries for stenosis or spondylolisthesis but also decreased the blood loss in the low difficulty surgeries for these diseases (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">7</xref>). These results showed the similar effect to those in previous studies.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> The third difference with Wang et al was the administered dose regimen. More than 15&#x0200a;mg/kg is considered as a high dose regimen.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> Karski<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> conducted a comparison of different dose regimens of TA in cardiac surgery. They found that 100&#x0200a;mg/kg TA has better hemostasis effect than that of 50&#x0200a;mg/kg TA. Using a initial dose of 30&#x0200a;mg/kg TA i.v. and a maintenance dosage of 2&#x0200a;mg/kg/h TA, Elwatidy et al<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> had a similar result to our study. So our study maybe partly support that the high dose of TA have better effect than the low dose of TA in spinal surgeries.</p><table-wrap id="T7" position="float"><label>Table 7</label><caption><p>Subgroup analysis of perioperative blood loss in different difficulty level surgeries.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-96-e5718-g009"/></table-wrap><p>There was an interesting phenomenon that the perioperative blood loss was significantly different between TA and PL groups, whereas postoperative Hb and HCT were not significantly different. We aboratively analyzed the data, and then found that although there was no statistically significant difference in the blood transfusion requirement between the 2 groups, the patients number received packed red blood cells in the placebo group was obviously larger than that of the TA group (4 patients in PL group vs 1 patient in TA group). This may lessen the difference of Hb/HCT between the 2 groups. This is in line with previous studies.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup></p><p>The postoperative epidural hematoma is a severe complication of after lumbar decompression surgery.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> TA inhibits fibrinolysis and stabilizes blood clot, thereby decreasing the epidural and subcutaneous hematoma formation.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> All patients were followed-up for more than 35 days after the operation. Any hematoma formation in either of the groups, due to the low incidence of hematoma, was not seen<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup>; since the sample size was small, the difference may be not discovered.</p><p>A common concern related to the use of TA is its potential for inducing thromboembolic events. Several studies have confirmed that TA does not increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> In our study, no clinical symptoms of deep vein thrombosis or signs of pulmonary embolism were revealed. Any complications associated with TA, such as allergic reaction, stroke, ischemic heart disease, and dysfunction of liver and kidney, also did not occur. Thus, TA can be safely administered in patients undergoing posterior interbody fusion surgery for lumbar stenosis or spondylolisthesis.</p><p>However, the present study conferred some limitations. Due to more than 50% patients belonging to the population with low difficulty surgeries, the effect of the test for patients with the difficulty of level II and III would be lessened. We carried out a subgroup analysis based on the level of difficulty. Patients with only the difficulty levels II and III did not show any statistical difference between the 2 groups in intraoperative estimated blood loss, the reduction trend was visible (less 26%); the total blood loss in the TA group was significantly less than the placebo group (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">7</xref>), which is in agreement with the previous studies.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> Nevertheless, future studies would be designed to adequately decrease the number of patients with difficulty level I, and increase the population of level II and III. The second limitation was single dose treatment regimen, as the optimal dose regimen in this kind of spinal surgery is not known. A simultaneous efficacy comparison of different dose regimens of TA will also be investigated. The third limitation was that there were 2 surgeons included in our study. Some documents reported that surgeons may be a potential factor affecting the amount of bleeding during the perioperative period. However, the operative time, intraoperative estimated blood loss, and total blood loss were not statistically different and the correlation analysis showed the surgeons were not significant factor for total blood loss. The significance of surgeons&#x02019; effects may be minimal, given the fact the patients were equally distributed in both groups, and the surgeons equally taken part in surgeries between the groups, as well as all procedures were similarly performed in the same institution. The present study agrees with the previous documents.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>TA efficacy can safely reduce the perioperative blood loss in patients undergoing posterior decompression interbody instrumentation for stenosis or spondylolisthesis.
