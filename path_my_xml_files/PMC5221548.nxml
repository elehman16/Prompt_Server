Changes in PGE<sub>2</sub> could be used to quantify the COX2 inhibition after ibuprofen administration. This study investigated the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationships for COX2 inhibition according to three formulations of ibuprofen in healthy male subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><p>A randomized, open-label, single-dose, three-treatment, six-sequence crossover study was performed in 36 healthy South Korean male volunteers. Enrolled subjects received the following three 200 mg ibuprofen formulations: ibuprofen arginine, solubilized ibuprofen capsule, and standard ibuprofen. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic blood samples were collected for 16 hours following treatment. For pharmacodynamic evaluations, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced PGE<sub>2</sub> inhibition at each time point compared to predose was measured. Noncompartmental analysis was used for pharmacokinetic assessment, and time-weighted average inhibition (WAI) of PGE<sub>2</sub> was applied to the pharmacodynamic evaluation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After a single oral dose of the ibuprofen formulations, the median times to maximum concentration were 0.42, 0.5, and 1.25 hours in ibuprofen arginine, solubilized ibuprofen capsule, and ibuprofen, respectively. The maximum observed plasma concentration was lower in ibuprofen, and the area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve was comparable among the three formulations. A significant difference was observed between fast-acting formulations and standard ibuprofen tablets for both maximum concentration and time taken to reach it. Individual formulations had an effect on PGE<sub>2</sub> WAI during the 8 hours following treatment, resulting in significantly lower WAI in standard ibuprofen: ibuprofen arginine 18.4%, solubilized ibuprofen capsule 18.4%, and standard ibuprofen 11.6%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Rapid absorption and higher peak concentration were observed in ibuprofen arginine and the solubilized ibuprofen capsule. Additionally, fast-acting formulations had more predominant inhibitory activity on the COX2 enzyme.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>ibuprofen</kwd><kwd>different formulation</kwd><kwd>COX2-inhibitory effects</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The severity of pain is influenced by several factors, including the amount of damage and emotional and environmental factors, and pharmacological treatment, interventional techniques, and behavioral therapies are available for pain management.<xref rid="b1-dddt-11-135" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Oral pharmacologic agents have been the primary option, and the use of drugs has increased exponentially.

At the time points for pharmacokinetic evaluation, 6 mL of blood was drawn into a sodium heparin tube and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C. Separated plasma samples were frozen and stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C until analysis. Pharmacokinetic samples were analyzed using positive-ion liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (Biosuntek Laboratory Co Ltd, Seongnam, South Korea).</p><p>For pharmacodynamic evaluation of PGE<sub>2</sub>, blood samples were collected at 0, 0.17, 0.33, 0.5, 0.67, 0.83, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 16 hours.

The PGE<sub>2</sub> level in plasma was determined using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA; Department of Pharmacology, Dong-A University College of Medicine).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Bioanalytical methods</title><p>The plasma concentration of ibuprofen was estimated using positive-ion LC (Agilent 1200 series; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and LC-MS/MS (Agilent 6410 triple-quadrupole LC/MS system). The plasma specimens were mixed with methanol in the presence of an internal standard (ibuprofen-d<sub>3</sub>). Chromatography was performed at 45&#x000b0;C on a Unison UK-C8 column (75&#x000d7;2 mm, 3 &#x003bc;m) with mobile phase A (0.1% acetic acid in 1 mM ammonium acetate) and mobile phase B (methanol). The flow rate was 0.3 mL/min. The calibration curves were linear within the range of 0.1&#x02013;60 &#x003bc;g/mL. Coefficients of variation of intra- and interassay accuracy and precision were less than 10%.</p><p>PGE<sub>2</sub> is synthesized and released into the extracellular space when cells are activated or exogenous free arachidonate is supplied. PGE<sub>2</sub> is rapidly converted to an inactive metabolite (13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub>) by the PG15-dehydrogenase pathway. COX2 activity (PGE<sub>2</sub> level) in plasma was determined using commercially available EIA kits (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Both samples and standards were assayed in parallel. The detection limit of PGE<sub>2</sub> quantification was 15 pg/mL. The reaction solution consisted of 50 &#x003bc;L of human plasma sample per well with 50 &#x003bc;L of EIA, PGE<sub>2</sub> AChE tracer, and PGE<sub>2</sub> monoclonal antibody.

The time to the maximum concentration observed in plasma (T<sub>max</sub>) and maximum observed plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) were directly obtained from the plasma concentration&#x02013;time profiles. The area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>) after the administration of the study drug was calculated by the linear-up and log-down trapezoidal method.

The time-weighted average inhibition (WAI) for PGE<sub>2</sub> was calculated from the AUC (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;8</sub>) on the linear trapezoidal method up to 8 hours after individual ibuprofen administration.

Also, to assess the treatment effect, differences in the WAI for PGE<sub>2</sub> were evaluated based on the 90% CI between the treatments. In the mixed-effect model, the sequence, period, and treatment were considered fixed effects, and the subject nested within a sequence was used as a random effect.

After the oral intake of 200 mg of ibuprofen, when evaluating the systemic exposures of solubilized ibuprofen capsule and ibuprofen compared to ibuprofen arginine, the C<sub>max</sub> was lower in ibuprofen and the AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> was equivalent.

Ibuprofen arginine and ibuprofen had faster COX2-inhibition effects than solubilized ibuprofen capsules (both <italic>P</italic>=0.001). The maximum inhibition (I<sub>max</sub>) and WAI of PGE<sub>2</sub> after three ibuprofen formulations at doses of 200 mg are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-dddt-11-135">Table 2</xref>.

Pharmacodynamic profiles were demonstrated as a mediator between pharmacokinetic characteristics and clinical efficacy after a single dose of three ibuprofen formulations. Two formulations are fast-acting, ibuprofen arginine and solubilized ibuprofen capsule, and the other was a standard ibuprofen-formulation tablet. A dose of 200 mg was selected based on consideration of the common clinical initial dosage for managing pain. A validated method using changes in PGE<sub>2</sub> production from predose level in LPS-stimulated whole blood was chosen as an index of COX2 enzyme activities.<xref rid="b12-dddt-11-135" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-dddt-11-135" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>The absorption rate and extent depend on multiple factors, including the administration route, physiological status, site of absorption, and physicochemical properties of compounds.<xref rid="b14-dddt-11-135" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Because ibuprofen is a relatively weak acid with a pKa of 4.4 and aqueous solubility under acidic conditions is low, dissolution and water solubility might be the key factors influencing drug absorption.<xref rid="b5-dddt-11-135" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b15-dddt-11-135" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> To improve the aqueous solubility and dissolution rate, salt formation is a commonly applied method that does not change the chemical structure or biological properties.<xref rid="b16-dddt-11-135" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In a previous report, the fast-dissolving ibuprofen formulation had faster absorption, resulting in a greater C<sub>max</sub> and shorter T<sub>max</sub>.<xref rid="b15-dddt-11-135" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Based on the results of our clinical study, the C<sub>max</sub> values of ibuprofen arginine and solubilized ibuprofen capsule were 125.1% and 119.1%, respectively, compared to standard ibuprofen after the oral administration of a 200 mg single dose. Also, the median T<sub>max</sub> for ibuprofen was significantly delayed compared to those of the other formulations. Conversely, the individual formulations had little effect on the AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>, and the 90% CIs of geometric mean ratios between formulations were within the range of 0.8&#x02013;1.25. With respect to distribution and elimination, the volume of distribution and apparent clearance were comparable among ibuprofen formulations. Consequently, the change of formulations into ibuprofen arginine or a solubilized ibuprofen capsule led to a rapid absorption process, including a higher C<sub>max</sub> and earlier T<sub>max</sub>, conserving other pharmacokinetic processes, such as distribution or elimination.</p><p>Inhibition of PGE<sub>2</sub> synthesis by NSAIDs was based on blocking the COX-mediated transformation of arachidonic acid to thromboxane and PGs, resulting in anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects.<xref rid="b8-dddt-11-135" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> An analgesic effect was reported to have a positive relationship with the plasma concentration of NSAIDs, and the COX2-inhibition mechanism was time-dependent and irreversible, in contrast to the instantaneous and competitively reversible inhibition of COX1.<xref rid="b17-dddt-11-135" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18-dddt-11-135" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In this clinical trial, direct comparison of pharmacodynamic parameters was conducted using an ex vivo assay of COX2 inhibition. PGE<sub>2</sub> production with LPS stimulation was more effectively suppressed in ibuprofen arginine and the solubilized ibuprofen capsule than in standard ibuprofen. The average inhibition of COX2 was similar between ibuprofen arginine and solubilized ibuprofen capsules. Generally, better or faster pain relief for acute pain management was possible in soluble or rapidly absorbed formulations, and delays in the absorption or reduction of the drug concentration may cause treatment failure.<xref rid="b4-dddt-11-135" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b18-dddt-11-135" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> However, the significant difference in the COX2-inhibition activities of various NSAIDs did not represent superior clinical efficacy in the long-term management of rheumatoid arthritis pain and inflammation when comparing diclofenac to celecoxib and diclofenac to etoricoxib.<xref rid="b19-dddt-11-135" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b21-dddt-11-135" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>From this pharmacokinetic&#x02013;pharmacodynamic study, fast-acting ibuprofen arginine provided a shorter T<sub>max</sub> and remarkable inhibition of PGE<sub>2</sub> formation. Also, the solubilized ibuprofen capsule inhibited PGE<sub>2</sub> better than standard ibuprofen. These results were consistent with a previous report that ibuprofen formulations with early pharmacokinetic profiles achieved pharmacodynamic advantages.<xref rid="b4-dddt-11-135" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Considering that the effect of ibuprofen on COX2 depends on time and there are therapeutic advantages of NSAIDs with early pharmacokinetic characteristics, the T<sub>max</sub> and I<sub>max</sub> in the time course of COX2 inhibition did not have a major impact on the clinical efficacy or therapeutic end point. Furthermore, in terms of clinically effective analgesic activity, full PGE<sub>2</sub> inhibition is not required. If plasma ibuprofen concentration reaches the minimum level required to inhibit COX2 to achieve a clinical effect, pain relief is possible in the early phase following drug administration, regardless of the T<sub>max</sub> or I<sub>max</sub>.<xref rid="b22-dddt-11-135" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b23-dddt-11-135" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>Although these results clearly describe the pharmacokinetic&#x02013;pharmacodynamic relationship of ibuprofen according to different formulations, there were some limitations in this clinical study. Because this study was a single study with a relatively low dose, considering the sigmoidal concentration&#x02013;effect curves, complete or full-range COX2 inhibition was not routinely observed.<xref rid="b24-dddt-11-135" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Because this study was conducted on a small number of healthy, young, male volunteers, the result could not fully reflect the clinical pathophysiology of pain or inflammatory disease. A direct comparison between COX2 inhibition and clinical efficacy, including pain relief or anti-inflammation biomarkers, will be helpful for understanding the mechanistic process of pain control and achieving therapeutic goals.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data indicated that fast-acting ibuprofen formulations act on the absorption phase and inhibit PGE<sub>2</sub> in healthy subjects. Based on the rapid absorption, the fast-acting formulations were able to induce stronger, more persistent inhibition of PGE<sub>2</sub> synthesis. Collectively, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic advantages of fast-acting formulations can be considered favorable for early, potent, and more sustainable therapeutic success.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was sponsored by Ildong Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, South Korea.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-dddt-11-135"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Turk</surname><given-names>DC</given-names></name><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>HD</given-names></name><name><surname>Cahana</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Treatment of chronic non-cancer pain</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2011</year><volume>377</volume><issue>9784</issue><fpage>2226</fpage><lpage>2235</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21704872</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-dddt-11-135"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>BI</given-names></name><name><surname>Deyo</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><name><surname>Mirza</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Expenditures and health status among adults with back and neck problems</article-title><source>JAMA</source><year>2008</year><volume>299</volume><issue>6</issue><fpage>656</fpage><lpage>664</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18270354</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3-dddt-11-135"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Roelofs</surname><given-names>PD</given-names></name><name><surname>Deyo</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><name><surname>Koes</surname><given-names>BW</given-names></name><name><surname>Scholten</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name><name><surname>van Tulder</surname><given-names>MW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for low back pain</article-title><source>Cochrane Database Syst Rev</source><year>2008</year><volume>1</volume><fpage>CD000396</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="b4-dddt-11-135"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><name><surname>Derry</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Straube</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Ireson-Paine</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Wiffen</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Faster, higher, stronger?
