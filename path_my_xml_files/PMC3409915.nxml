It is known that clomiphene citrate results in an ovulation rate of 60&#x02013;85% but a conception rate of only about 20%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] CC has a long half-life (2 weeks), and this may have a negative effect on the cervical mucus and endometrium, leading to discrepancy between ovulation and conception rates.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] There has been a search for a compound capable of inducing ovulation but devoid of the adverse antiestrogen effects of CC. Recent studies have suggested that Letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, does not possess the adverse antiestrogenic effects of clomiphene and is associated with higher pregnancy rates than CC treatment in patients with PCOS.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Though evidence from larger trials is still awaited, some encouragement may be taken from the success of preliminary results showing aromatase inhibitor Letrozole may be regarded as a possible replacement for CC for the first-time treatment of anovulatory infertility.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] The aim of this present prospective randomized trial was to compare results of letrozole with CC in patients with PCOS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This prospective randomized controlled trial was performed at a tertiary care hospital from January 2005 to January 2010. The necessary ethical approval was taken from Institutional Review Board to conduct this study. The patients were counseled, and informed consent was taken before randomization. The inclusion criteria included patients in the age group of 20&#x02013;35 years having infertility for more than one year, body mass index (BMI) &#x0003c;28, and patients of anovulatory PCOS. The patients of PCOS were recruited in the presence of oligomenorrhea (i.e., interval between periods were &#x02265;35 days) or amenorrhea (i.e., absence of vaginal bleeding for 6 months), hirsutism, enlarged ovaries with multiple follicles (&#x02265;10 measuring 2&#x02013;8 mm in diameter) as per Rotterdam's criteria on transvaginal ultrasonography (USG), and/or elevated serum testosterone. Finally the diagnosis of PCOS was made on the basis of revised Rotterdam 2003 criteria.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Presence of two out of three criteria (oligo and/or anovulation, clinical biochemical sign of hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries) was recommended as a diagnostic of PCOS.</p><p>In all patients, a comprehensive infertility work-up was done. This included tubal patency test, pelvic ultrasonography, husband semen analysis, and serum hormone measurements (FSH, LH, prolactin, estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone) on the 2<sup>nd</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> day of the cycle. Patients having abnormality in any of these tests, which may be responsible for reproductive failure, were excluded form the study. All patients underwent laparoscopy and patients who had other factors, found on laparoscopy, which may be responsible for infertility, were also excluded from the study. Sample size was calculated using pregnancy rate as a primary outcome measure. On basis of previous studies,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] to achieve a statistically valid comparison of pregnancy rates in the two groups, with a type I error of 0.05 and a power of 80%, a sample size of at least 40 women in each arm was required.</p><p>Randomization of recruited women was carried out using online software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com">http://www.randomization.com</ext-link>) to generate a random number table. All patients were randomized to receive one of the two drugs to be given over the next 3 months. Randomization codes (A, B) were packed into sealed opaque envelopes by an individual not involved in enrollment, treatment and follow-up of subjects to ensure concealment of allocation. One resident had the responsibility for dispensing the trial drugs to the patient based on the unique randomization code. At the end of allocation, the resident provided us with a randomization list.</p><p>Patients in letrozole group received ovulation induction with letrozole with starting dose of 2.5 mg, increasing up to 5 mg daily. Patients in clomiphene citrate group received CC with starting dose of 50 mg, increasing up to 100 mg daily. In both the groups, treatments were administered from Day 3 to Day 7 (total of 5 days) of a spontaneous cycle or withdrawal bleeding after a 5-day course of 10 mg/day medroxyprogesterone acetate. Serial transvaginal ultrasound was performed in each cycle in both the groups from 12<sup>th</sup> to 16<sup>th</sup> day until a mature follicle of diameter 18 mm or more and trilaminar layer of endometrial pattern were seen. The number of follicles and endometrial thickness (ET) in each cycle in patients of both the groups were documented. Ultrasound in all patients was demonstrated by single observer (first author) to remove the inter-observer bias. Injection hCG 10,000 IU intramuscularly was given to the patients when a dominant follicle &#x02265;18 mm and ET &#x02265;6 mm were observed. Ovulation was confirmed by seeing follicle collapse on subsequent USG and elevated serum progesterone (&#x02265;25 nmol/L). Each woman was asked to have timed intercourse 24 h to 36 h after ovulatory dose of hCG. Women in both the groups without evidence of ovulation and with negative pregnancy tests were asked to follow the respective schedule of treatment in subsequent cycles. Duration of treatment in both the groups was 3 months. Chemical pregnancy was assessed by serum level of beta hCG measurement once the patient missed her period.</p><p>Documentation of at least one gestational sac in USG was confirmed as clinical pregnancy. The mean number of follicles, endometrial thickness, ovulatory cycle rate, conception rate, and pregnancy outcome were compared in both the groups. The sample was divided into two groups using random allocated software. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS 13 software. Student's t-test, Chi-square and Fisher's exact testes were used when appropriate. Results were expressed as mean and standard errors of mean. The <italic>P</italic> value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>During the study period, a total of 250 patients were analyzed for recruitment. 38 patients did not meet inclusion criteria and eight patients were lost to follow-up in between the study, and therefore, 204 patients entered and completed the study.

It is generally accepted that CC reduces uterine receptivity, and thus reduces the chances of conception.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] It is associated with endometrial thinning in 15&#x02013;50% of patients, probably due to estrogen receptor depletion.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Furthermore, the use of CC may block estrogen receptors in the cervix, producing a negative effect on the quality and quantity of cervical mucus.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Inappropriate development of the endometrium is associated with low implantation rate and early pregnancy loss due to luteal phase defect.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Aromatase inhibitors are non-steroidal compounds that suppress estrogen biosynthesis by blocking the action of the enzyme, aromatase, which converts androstenedione and testosterone to estrogens. Letrozole is a potent reversible oral aromatase inhibitor, which has been widely used in post-menopausal women with metastatic breast cancer.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] It is given in a dose of 2.5&#x02013;5 mg/day and has been shown to achieve optimal suppression of serum estrogen level and is almost free of side effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] The efficient estrogen-lowering property of letrozole could be utilized to temporarily release the hypothalamus from negative feedback effect of estrogen and thereby inducing an increased discharge of FSH.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] With letrozole, estrogen production is eventually advanced by the induced FSH discharge, but in contrast to the use of CC, the hypothalamus is able to respond to estrogen feedback with a negative feedback mechanism.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] This helps in modulating an overzealous discharge of FSH, which in turn is more likely to result in a mono-follicular ovulation with moderate estrogen concentration. Letrozole also has an added positive effect, because peripherally, it may increase follicular sensitivity to FSH through amplification of FSH receptor gene expression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] Although letrozole creates an estrogen-deficient environment, it has no negative effect on the endometrium and cervix due to its short half-life (45 h).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] In contrast, CC has a long half-life (2 weeks), and it is possible that CC concentrations could accumulate over subsequent cycles.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] This could lead to increased risk of adverse endometrial or cervical mucus changes. Therefore, ovulation induction by letrozole is superior to CC in terms of follicular growth and endometrial response.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] In contrast, one study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] did not show any advantage to the use of letrozole over CC as a first-line treatment for induction of ovulation in women with PCOS. It is reported that using 2.5&#x02013;5 mg/day of letrozole has a better endometrial response compared with endometrial response using CC in the dose of 50&#x02013;100 mg/day.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] This has also been reported that when letrozole is used in the dose of 7.5 mg and compared with 100 mg of CC, there was no significant difference in ET.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] In contrast, another study reported that the endometrial development was higher in letrozole group using 7.5 mg of letrozole compared with that of 150 mg of CC.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] Most commonly used doses in previous studies has been between 2.5 and 7.5 mg.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] In our study, we used 2.5 mg daily of letrozole, increased to maximum 5 mg daily.</p><p>In the present study, though the mean number of dominant follicles (&#x02265;18 mm) was comparable in both the letrozole and CC group, the mean endometrial thickness was significantly better in letrozole group [(9.1&#x000b1;0.3 mm) compared with CC group (6.3&#x000b1;1.1 mm)]. Similar findings were reported in our previous study, which demonstrated that endometrial thickness and sub-endometrial blood flow were significantly better in cases receiving induction with letrozole than CC despite comparable follicular response.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] Al-Fozan <italic>et al</italic>. also reported similar result in a randomized control trial of letrozole versus CC in women undergoing superovulation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Similar to our previous study,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] there was no positive correlation between ET and number of dominant follicles in both the group in the present study. It has been reported that serum E<sub>2</sub> level on the day of hCG administration was statistically significantly lower in the letrozole group than the CC group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] In our study, we have also found that the mean total E<sub>2</sub> on the day of hCG administration was significantly higher in CC group as compared with letrozole group. Unlike CC, which blocks and depletes estrogen receptors, letrozole has no effect on estrogen receptors. This explains a significantly higher ET on the day of hCG administration with letrozole compared with CC. hCG was routinely administered to these women to allow follicle maturation and exactly time the intercourse for these couples, to increase the favorable outcome. It has been proved that routine documentation of follicle monitoring, individualization of hCG dose, and documentation of ovulation has been especially beneficial in PCOS patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>]</p><p>With CC, supraphysiologic levels of estrogen can occur without control suppression of FSH because the normal estrogen receptor-mediated feedback mechanisms are blocked. This results in multiple follicular growth and higher multiple pregnancy rates with CC than are found in letrozole cycles.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] Rashida Begam <italic>et al</italic>. reported higher ovulation rate (62.5%) with letrozole compared with 37.50% with CC.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] Mitwally and Casper[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] using 2.5 mg/day of letrozole achieved 75% and 100% ovulation in anovulatory and ovulatory patients respectively. Higher ovulation rate with letrozole was also reported in other studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] Ovulation rate was found to be similar reported by Bayer <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] (81% in letrozole group versus 85% in CC group). In the present study, we found comparable ovulatory rates (66.6% in letrozole group and 67.9% in CC group).</p><p>Though number of pregnancies in the present study is significantly higher in letrozole group (43.8%) compared with CC group (26.4%), there was no significant difference in pregnancy rate per cycle. This may be due to the fact that pregnancy depends on multiple factors in a particular cycle and therefore may not reflect the difference. Similar result was reported with use of 7.5 mg/day of letrozole and 150 mg/day of CC in patients of PCOS who failed to ovulate with 100 mg of CC in previous cycle.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] Letrozole producing mono-follicular development reduces the chances of multiple pregnancies compared with CC. Mitwally <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] reported low multiple gestation rates with aromatase inhibitors for ovulation induction. In our study, there was no multiple gestation in letrozole group compared with three multiple pregnancies in CC group.</p><p>Efficacy of letrozole in inducing ovulation with successful outcomes has been studied even in assisted reproduction for intrauterine insemination (IUI) and <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization techniques.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] Besides ovulation induction in anovulatory infertility, extended letrozole regimen had a superior efficacy as compared with clomiphene citrate in patients of unexplained infertility undergoing superovulation and IUI.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>] Letrozole has even been compared with recombinant FSH in inducing ovulation in women with PCOS and has been found to be a suitable and cost-effective inducing agent.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>]</p><p>Similar to previous studies,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] there was no difference in the number of miscarriage in two groups in our study.
