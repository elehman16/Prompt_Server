It has been studied in numerous phase II and III trials in combination with different drugs or as single agent. Recently, pemetrexed has been approved in combination with cisplatin for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC other than squamous cell histology. The toxicity is acceptable and similar to that of other NSCLC regimens. The postinduction maintenance therapy with pemetrexed is being evaluated in a phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pemetrexed</kwd><kwd>non-small cell lung cancer</kwd><kwd>non-squamous carcinoma</kwd><kwd>first-line setting</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains the leading cause of cancer-related death in both men and women in most of the Western world, with an estimated 900,000 deaths per year worldwide.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-tcrm-5-781">1</xref> Occupational and environmental exposure to carcinogenic substances (eg, radon, asbestos, diesel exhaust fumes and metals) may increase the risk of developing lung cancer, but the risk is small compared with that associated with tobacco use.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-tcrm-5-781">2</xref> Most patients (approximately 80%) present with locally advanced stage III or metastatic stage IV NSCLC and are ineligible for curative surgery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-tcrm-5-781">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-tcrm-5-781">4</xref> The long-term prognosis for patients with NSCLC remains poor, the 5-year survival rate ranging from 8% to 15%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-tcrm-5-781">5</xref></p><p>Some progress has been made in the treatment of advanced NSCLC during the past decade.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-tcrm-5-781">6</xref> Chemotherapy with cisplatin-based regimens was shown to prolong survival, relieve symptoms in most cases, and improve quality of life.

Eighty-seven patients received treatment. Tumor response rates were 4.5% and 11.6% respectively for the pemetrexed and pemetrexed/gemcitabine arms. Median overall survival time was 4.7 months for the pemetrexed arm and 5.4 months for the pemetrexed/gemcitabine arms. Both hematological and non-hematological toxicities were mild.

The first study was conducted in Germany and included 36 chemotherapy-naive NSCLC patients. Median patient age was 58 years. The overall response rate was 39%, with a median survival rate of 10.9 months.

Overall response rate was 45%, median overall survival was 8.9 months and 1-year survival rate was 49%. The regimen was well tolerated.

Gemcitabine was infused over 30 minutes, followed by pemetrexed administered over 10 minutes on day 1 of a 14-day cycle. Treatment continued for 12 cycles or until disease progression. All patients received folic acid, vitamin B12, and steroid prophylaxis. Dudek demonstrated that twice-monthly gemcitabine and pemetrexed was well tolerated, with overall survival and clinical benefit indicating disease activity in NSCLC patients.</p><p>Pemetrexed has also been evaluated in combination with vinorelbine.

The investigators enrolled 437 patients. Of patients enrolled, 22% had poor performance status (PS = 2), and 18% were &#x0003e;75 years old, so the starting dose administered to elderly patients was reduced to 75% and the number of cycle permitted was 4.

Patients with non-squamous carcinoma had a median progression free survival of 4.37 months with pemetrexed and a median progression free survival of 1.84 months with placebo. The number of large cell patients was small, but the difference was significant in the adenocarcinoma subgroup; in these patients, median progression free survival was 4.60 with pemetrexed and 2.66 months with placebo. There was also a significant benefit in overall survival in the subset of non-squamous patients; preliminary analysis showed a median overall survival of 14.4 months with pemetrexed and 9.4 months with placebo.</p><p>There were no significant toxicity differences between arms except for grade 3&#x02013;4 anemia (pemetrexed 3.9%, placebo 0.9%). Postinduction maintenance therapy with pemetrexed was well tolerated, and confirmed that pemetrexed was more efficacious in patients with non-squamous histology. Pemetrexed is a good candidate for maintenance therapy for its efficacy, ease of administration and favorable toxicity profile.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Pemetrexed is active against advanced or metastatic NSCLC as both first- and second-line treatment.</p><p>It has the potential to play a key role in improving efficacy and toxicity, having demonstrated activity as a single or combination agent, other than predominantly squamous cell histology.</p><p>Postinduction maintenance therapy with pemetrexed is being evaluated in a phase III, double-blind, placebo controlled study.</p><p>The benefit with maintenance pemetrexed is a real change in the treatment paradigm, because in the past we had not seen any activity of an agent in the maintenance setting. Because pemetrexed can be administered over a prolonged period without cumulative toxicity, it may allow the disease to convert to a &#x0201c;chronic&#x0201d; state.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosures</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
