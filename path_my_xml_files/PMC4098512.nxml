The aim of this prospective randomized clinical trial was to assess the effects of a combination formula of probiotics and prebiotics (Synbiotic 2000 Forte; Medifarm, Sweden) versus prebiotics only (fiber) in critically ill, long-term mechanically ventilated trauma patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Patients were randomized to either treatment for a 2-week treatment period. Synbiotic 2000 Forte consists of 10<sup>10 </sup>CFU of each of <italic>Pediococcus pentoseceus </italic>5&#x02013;33:3, <italic>Leuconostoc mesenteroides </italic>32&#x02013;77:1, <italic>L. paracasei </italic>ssp paracasei 19 and <italic>L. plantarum </italic>2362, as well as 2.5 g inulin, oat bran, pectin and resistant starch. Blood samples were collected on days 0, 4, 7 and 15 for measurements of CRP, PCT, MDA, tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-6. Days under ventilatory support, days of total stay in the ICU, gut motility, antibiotic-associated diarrheas, infections, and septic morbidity as well as overall mortality were also recorded.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Patients were well matched regarding age and sex distribution, APACHE II and Glasgow scores. From day 7, all patients of the Synbiotic group exhibited a progressive reduction of all inflammatory indexes in relation to the prebiotics only group (<italic>P </italic>= 0.05). Similarly, they had a significantly shorter ICU stay and days on mechanical ventilation (<italic>P </italic>= 0.04), less episodes of antibiotic-associated diarrheas and less distension and cramps after enteral nutrition, in relation to the prebiotics group. The overall infection rate was 34% versus 90%, respectively, while three patients from the prebiotics group died after sepsis and MODS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The administration of the Synbiotic 2000 Forte formula in critically ill ventilated trauma patients favorably altered the systemic inflammatory response and seemed to be associated with measurable clinical benefits.</p></sec></body></article>
