These fermentable carbohydrates in thick liquid preparations may contribute significantly to the dental caries potential in young patients <xref rid="pone.0055558-Feigal1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Furthermore, preoccupation with the main medical problem often results in neglect of oral health, and sugars are frequently offered to patients as a demonstration of comfort or as a necessary source of energy <xref rid="pone.0055558-Moynihan1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0055558-Roberts1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

Nevertheless, some studies have suggested that bacterial species other than <italic>S. mutans</italic> should play important roles in the initial caries process <xref rid="pone.0055558-Aas1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and that over 60% of the oral bacterial flora is represented by not-yet-cultivated phylotypes <xref rid="pone.0055558-Aas2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. For these reasons, the target microbial population evaluated in the present study was the total microbiota (not only the known caries-related microorganisms) of dental biofilm by using conventional culture analysis and a molecular assay as well.</p><p>The role of antibiotics on oral microbiota is still a controversial issue.

<xref rid="pone.0055558-Mariri1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, however, did not show either a contributing or a protective effect of medically administered antibiotics on dental caries experience in primary dentition. That finding was pointed out by the authors as probably due to the stronger relationships between diet, fluoride and dental caries, which may have overwhelmed the effects of antibiotics. The authors also discussed a possible role of the substantial amounts of sugar present in some antibiotic suspensions counter-balancing the antibiotic effects <xref rid="pone.0055558-Mariri1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>The clinical studies investigating the association between medicines and dental caries mentioned above have shown many advantages when compared with experimental ones. However, the study of multifactorial diseases like dental caries may be compromised by confounding factors if not adequately controlled in clinical situations. Therefore, a good alternative to study the role of substances on dental caries are the <italic>in situ</italic> caries models, which involve the use of appliances or other devices that create defined conditions in the human mouth to simulate the process of dental caries <xref rid="pone.0055558-Wefel1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, we chose an antibiotic suspension containing amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium not only because it is a largely prescribed antibiotic for children, but also because it is available as a sugar-free formulation.

These findings could be explained by the feast-or-famine lifestyle lived by bacteria in the oral cavity, where only some of them are able to survive long periods of carbohydrate starvation and sudden exposure to an excess amount of sugar. Therefore, only the bacteria able to develop physiologic and genetic mechanisms to regulate sugar metabolism according to source and availability will survive in the dental biofilms <xref rid="pone.0055558-Lemos1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Furthermore, despite a lower number of total microbiota counts in the presence of sucrose for both treatments, total biofilm weight was significantly higher when sucrose was added to this <italic>in situ</italic> model, which could be explained by the production of sucrose-derived extracellular polysaccharides (EPS), increasing the bulk and porosity of the dental biofilm matrix <xref rid="pone.0055558-Dibdin1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>This is the first <italic>in situ</italic> study which attempted to check a possible effect of a medically prescribed sugar-free pediatric antibiotic on the total microbiota counts. As a broad-spectrum antibiotic, amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium was expected to reduce total microbiota counts and enhances CFU counts of <italic>Candida</italic> spp when compared with its placebo <xref rid="pone.0055558-Gammelsrud1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. These conditions were partially verified in the present study because although the antibiotic group showed higher CFU counts of <italic>Candida</italic> spp. in the presence of sucrose (especially at the high cariogenic challenge, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), lower total microbiota counts were not identified for the antibiotic when compared to the placebo at the 8-time daily frequency of sucrose exposure. Those contrasting results at the highest frequency of sucrose exposure should be interpret with caution because it could be due to an increased contribution of fungi in the total microbiota counts of the biofilm treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium once blood agar plates were incubated in microaerophilic condition (candle jar).</p><p>In terms of microbial ecology, the DGGE technique has been a useful tool for detecting changes of predominant microbiota <xref rid="pone.0055558-Ling1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.

Irrespective of the frequency of sucrose exposure, the mean number of bands (number of bacterial species) detected in the DGGE profiles were higher for the placebo group when compared with antibiotic, but no statistically significant difference was found. Also, the mean rank of bands (mean position in the DGGE profile) was lower for placebo when compared with amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium, with no statistical significance between them for all the tested sucrose daily frequencies. The lack of statistical significance should be carefully interpreted because it could be due to the large inter-individual variability in the microbial profiles from the participants.</p><p>Cluster analyses of DGGE bacterial profiles from each volunteer demonstrated that the presence of sucrose in the <italic>in situ</italic> model increased, in some cases, the percentage similarity algorithm between samples of placebo and antibiotic when compared with the similarity observed between treatments' samples in the absence of sucrose. This finding could be due to a limitation of the DGGE technique characterized by the detection of nonviable microorganisms, which would be dependent on rapid turnover of dead cells and degradation of associated DNA within the evaluated microbial community <xref rid="pone.0055558-McBain1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. This issue would, in part, explain why banding patterns were so similar for placebo and antibiotic in the presence of sucrose. In this situation, there would be more EPS in dental biofilm resulting in a thick undisturbed biomass, from which turnover of dead cells could hardly occur.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both conventional culture and DGGE have demonstrated some differences on total microbiota of the dental biofilm when exposed to antibiotic or placebo suspensions, mainly in the absence of sucrose.
