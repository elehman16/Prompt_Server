Yet, pain and anxiety can be reduced by supporting the mother by a doula. Thus, the present study aims to compare the effects of doula supportive care and acupressure at the BL32 point on the mother's anxiety level and delivery outcome.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>The present clinical trial was conducted on 150 pregnant women who had referred to the Shoushtari Hospital, Shiraz, Iran for delivery in 2012. The subjects were randomly divided into two intervention groups (supportive care and acupressure) and a control group (hospital routine care). The mothers&#x02019; anxiety score was assessed before and after the intervention, using the Spielberger questionnaire. The delivery outcomes were evaluated, as well.

Childbirth is in fact one of the major phenomena a woman experiences in her life. Therefore, a negative experience of childbirth can have negative impacts on both the woman and her family.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Delivery anxiety is related to the mother's worry and fear about pregnancy, the neuroendocrine changes during pregnancy, and predictions about the birth outcome. In general, anxiety refers to distress that might occur in response to stress.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Korukcu conducted a study in Turkey in order to investigate the relationship between fear of delivery and anxiety levels. In that study, 49.4% of the nulliparous women and 50.6% of the multiparous ones were afraid of delivery and a significant relationship was found between fear and anxiety.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Fear and anxiety resulting from delivery pain increased the mother's pain and discomfort during the delivery process.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Thus, interventions are required to be conducted in order to decrease the negative effects of the maternal physiological processes that occur due to the mother's pain and anxiety and lead to maternal and fetal damage.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Supporting a woman in labor is an old concept that has been investigated by the anthropologists in 150 various cultures. Such women were usually supported by a family member, friend, or a woman during labor.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The support is most effective in case it is started at the beginning of the labor and the supporter does not work in the service providing institute. For example, a doula can be of great help in supporting a woman in labor. The doula's support includes emotional support (continuous presence, reassurance, encouragement, and admiration), physical support (reduction of thirst, hunger, and pain), providing information about the delivery process and how to cope with it, respecting the woman's decision, and helping her create relationships with other caregivers.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>By calming the woman and suggesting various positions during the labor, the doula increases the fetus&#x02019; descent. Besides, continuously supporting the mother leads to reduction of labor length, less utilization of oxytocin for augmentation, a lower rate of instrumental delivery, less utilization of epidural anesthesia and narcotics, and a lower rate of the Cesarean section.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In addition to the mother's movements, the doula also recommends special positions that enhance the labor progress and improve the maternal problems, such as backache and inappropriate uterine contractions.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Pelvic dimensions tend to change because of the mother's movements; thus, the mother's movements help the fetus rotation and descent and sedate the pain related to inappropriate positions or long-term labor.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In the study by Kennel <italic>et al</italic>., (1991), continuous support by a doula reduced the labor length by one to two hours, increased the mother's capability for controlling the labor, shaped a positive delivery experience, and increased the mother's breast feeding ability during the first month after birth.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Acupressure is another non-pharmacological method for decreasing pain and anxiety. Acupressure is a type of massage therapy developed in ancient China. It is similar in nature to acupuncture and is a non-invasive method. Acupressure stimulates the body for production of endorphin and opioid, and consequently, reduces the pain. Relaxation by stimulation of the acupressure point increases the feeling of good health and reduces muscle fatigue.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Chao (2007) and Chung (2003) emphasized the effectiveness of acupressure in reducing labor pain.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Agarwal <italic>et al</italic>., (2005) also reported that acupressure at some special points could reduce anxiety.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>As helping two vulnerable groups of the society; that is, mothers and children, are the main priorities in the health and treatment system, sedating the mothers&#x02019; pain and reducing their anxiety during labor are of utmost importance.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Therefore, the present study aims to compare the effects of doula supportive care and acupressure at the BL32 point on the mother's anxiety level and delivery outcome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This randomized clinical trial was conducted in the delivery ward of the selected educational center of the Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (Shoushtari Hospital), in 2012. Taking into consideration, d = 5, &#x003b1; = 0.05, 1-&#x003b2; =0.90, SD = 7, and the following formula, a 150-subject sample size (50 subjects in each group) was determined for the study:</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="IJNMR-20-239-g001.jpg"/></p><p>The subjects were selected through simple random sampling and were divided into supportive care, acupressure, and control groups, using stratified block randomization. In doing so, a number was randomly selected from the table of random numbers and the researcher moved toward the right or left column or row and wrote the five-digit numbers down. As the participants were divided into three groups in this study, the three-therapy method was used and classification was performed as follows: A: Supportive care group, B: Acupressure group, and C: Control group. Accordingly, ABC: 1, ACB: 2, BAC: 3, BCA: 4, CAB: 5, and CBA: 6. It should be noted that numbers 0, 7, and 9 were ignored.</p><p>The inclusion criteria of the study were, a gestational age of 37&#x02013;41 weeks based on the date of the last menstrual cycle or first and second trimester ultrasound, first or second pregnancy, being between 18 and 35 years old, single pregnancy, head presentation, lack of obvious chromosomal abnormalities and fetal anomalies, not using any special drugs during pregnancy, and having at least middle school education. On the other hand, the exclusion criteria of the study were maternal diabetes, growth restriction, Rhesus (RH) incompatibility, history of smoking, history of tobacco use, pre-eclampsia, oligohydramnios, placenta previa, placental abruption, thick meconium, suffering from any physical or mental disorder, and receiving any kind of medication, including, pethidine, hyoscine, oxytocin, and atropine.</p><p>The demographic information questionnaire was completed by the researcher through interviewing the mothers. In addition, the Spielberger questionnaire was used in order to assess the anxiety level. This questionnaire included 40 questions in two 20-item scales. The first 20 questions measured the state anxiety, which was defined as a feeling of worry and tension resulting from situational stress. The second 20 questions assessed the trait anxiety, which referred to individual differences in the tendency toward evaluating the situations as threatening or dangerous.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In Iran, Aghamohammadi <italic>et al</italic>., (2007) used this questionnaire on 150 patients undergoing surgery and reported its reliability as 97%, which was the basis for the present study.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The supportive care and acupressure groups completed this questionnaire before (the start of the active phase of labor) and after (at the end of the first stage) the intervention. In the control group, the questionnaire was completed at the beginning of the active phase of the labor and at the end of the first stage.</p><p>In the first group, the researcher was beside the mother from her entrance into the department, calmed and encouraged her, and recommended appropriate positions to the mother based on the labor stages. In 3&#x02013;8 cm dilatation, the mother was placed at activity positions, such as lunge, tailor stretching, leaning, and straddle a chair, for 20 minutes, and at relaxing positions, such as semi-setting and side-lying, for 10 minutes. At the 8&#x02013;10 cm dilatation, the mother was placed at the positions, such as dangle, squatting, and hands and knees, which were effective in the fetus&#x02019; head descent[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The positions were selected in such a way that they prevented fatigue and monotony of the condition. Moreover, 20 minutes was considered for changing the mothers&#x02019; position during labor, because during the active phase, the cervix opens for 1.2&#x02013;1.5 cm each hour and as the delivery progresses, the pain and anxiety increase.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Mother's position.

With regard to the level of education, the highest and lowest frequencies were related to middle school (43.3%) and academic degrees (23.3%), respectively. Distribution of occupation was also similar in the three study groups and most of the subjects were homemakers (74.7% compared to 25.3% employees). Besides, the highest and lowest gestational age was 41.2 and 37.0 weeks, respectively, and the mean gestational age was 38.9&#x000b1; 1.1 weeks.</p><p>According to the results of one-way ANOVA, no significant difference was found among the three groups regarding the state (<italic>P</italic> = 0.900) and trait anxiety (<italic>P</italic> = 0.318) before the intervention.

In Scott's study also, the women supported by the doula had lower state anxiety, positive delivery experience, and higher self-confidence. Furthermore, Teixeira <italic>et al</italic>., (1999), investigated the relationship between the mother's anxiety and increase in vascular resistance of the uterine arteries. They found a significant relationship between the increase in vascular resistance of the uterine arteries and the state and trait anxiety scores, which was more significant with regard to the state anxiety.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Pilkington <italic>et al</italic>., (2007), also expressed the effect of acupressure on the patients&#x02019; anxiety level, based on the Spielberger scale.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Therefore, it could be concluded that the mother's anxiety, which was accompanied by an increase in uterine vessel resistance and decrease in oxygenation, played a major role in the fetal as well as maternal outcomes. This emphasized the necessity for performing interventions through labor in order to reduce the mothers&#x02019; anxiety.</p><p>After the intervention (at the end of the first stage) in the current study, the mean score of anxiety increased in the control group, while it decreased in the supportive care and acupressure groups, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Various studies have shown that acupressure, without any complications, controls and reduces anxiety by stimulating brain responses and hormonal activities, by increasing the blood flow and mediating the metabolism.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Chao <italic>et al</italic>., (2007), also performed acupressure at various points and expressed that this non-pharmacological method was effective in the reduction of women's pain and anxiety during labor. These results were consistent with those of the present study, as a 34.8% decrease was observed in the acupressure group's anxiety score after the intervention in this study.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Mendez and Davim investigated the non-pharmacological methods, such as moving and changing the pregnant women's positions, and concluded that in addition to being appropriate and practical, these methods were highly effective in improving the delivery pain. Pain and anxiety have mutual effects; that is, as one decreases, the other decreases, as well.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] These findings were in agreement with those of the present study.</p><p>In contrast to the present study results, Langer <italic>et al</italic>., (1998), showed that supporting the women through labor was not effective in the need for medical interventions and mothers&#x02019; anxiety, pain, self-confidence, and satisfaction.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] The difference between that study and the present one might be due to the intervention methods, hospital policies, women's cultural background, short period of support, and types of activities of the doulas&#x02019;. Yet, the support provided by the nurses and the staff might have also been effective in reducing the difference between the two groups.</p><p>In the present study, the mean length of the first and second stages of labor in the control group was 187.3 and 188.3 minutes higher compared to that of the supportive care and acupressure groups, respectively. Also, the control group's mean score of anxiety was 69.5 and 72.3 points higher compared to the supportive care and acupressure groups. Essentially, effective and continuous support during labor and delivery turns off the fear-stress-pain cycle.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Continuously supporting the mothers during labor and delivery not only reduces their pain and worry, but it also creates a calmness and leads to secretion of catecholamines. Therefore, it reduces the pain, decreases the length of delivery by improving the uterine contraction power, and leads to progress of the physiological delivery.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>According to the present study findings, the supportive care group's mean score of anxiety was lower in comparison to the acupressure and control groups. Consequently, the length of the first and second stages of labor was also lower in the supportive care group. Saisto <italic>et al</italic>., (1999), stated that labor pain mostly results from anxiety, which slows the delivery process down. In addition, they showed that by reducing the anxiety, labor took a shorter period of time.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] The results of the present study were in agreement with those of the study by Saisto.</p><p>The findings of the current study have revealed no significant relationship between the labor length and the mother's anxiety in the acupressure group after the intervention. Several studies have shown that acupressure leads to release of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, which can affect the individuals&#x02019; tranquillity.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Other studies have also indicated that acupressure leads to the release of special peptides, which have analgesic and sedative effects. They particularly reduce the sympathoadrenal system's activity, which is activated during anxiety and labor.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] In the present study, the three groups were similar with respect to the state and trait anxiety at the beginning of the study. After the intervention, the length of the labor stages and anxiety were lower in the acupressure group compared to the control group; however, no significant relationship was found between the labor length and the mean score of anxiety. As BL32 was one of the effective points in delivery augmentation,[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] acupressure at this point strengthened the uterine contractions. As the contractions are more effective and the interval between the contractions is shorter, labor lasts for a shorter period of time. Although the level of anxiety was lower in the acupressure group compared to the control group, acupressure at the BL32 point was effective in reducing the length of the labor stages. This might have caused the insignificant relationship between the labor length and the mean score of anxiety.</p><p>In the control group, the mean score of anxiety and length of the first and second stages of labor were higher compared to the supportive care and acupressure groups, which might explain the significant relationship between the labor length and the mean score of anxiety in the control group. In this regard, Enkin (1996), stated that anxiety decreased the effective uterine contractions through increasing the secretion of the mother's plasma catecholamine, which had a negative impact on the uterine blood flow.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</p><p>In the current study, the highest rate of Cesarean delivery (40.8%) was related to the control group with average and severe anxiety levels, while the lowest rate (14.3%) was related to the supportive care group with mild anxiety levels.</p><p>Stress and anxiety led to secretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine. Via the beta-adrenergic receptors in the uterus, epinephrine led to uterine muscle hypoxia, disruption in the uteroplacental blood perfusion, and fetal hypoxia. In addition, via alpha-adrenergic receptors, norepinephrine caused disruption in uterine contractions and slowed down the delivery progress,[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] which might be effective in the performance of the Cesarean section. In general, the mother's anxiety level is related to the incidence of an emergency Cesarean section during labor.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</p><p>Doula as a supportive person increases the woman's self-confidence and helps her adapt to the delivery process and pain.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] During the painful uterine contractions, the doula also helps the mother to maintain her tranquillity and control, instead of showing anxious and restless reactions, which facilitate the natural process of the delivery. Biologically, it is assumed that reducing the mother's stress and creating a calm, noiseless environment, leads to the release of oxytocin and this shows the key role played by the doula.</p><p>In this study, the anxiety level and rate of Cesarean section were lower in the two intervention groups compared to the control group, which was consistent with the studies by Hodnett,[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] Zhang,[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] Scott,[<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] Klaus,[<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] Hatem,[<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] Albers,[<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and Chang.[<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] In these studies also, doula support and acupressure increased the mothers&#x02019; self-confidence, reduced their anxiety, and decreased the rate of Cesarean delivery. In the same line, Saisto[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and Teixeira[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] mentioned that the mother's anxiety was related to an increase of vascular resistance, increase of labor pain, and low labor progress, which increased the chance of a Cesarean delivery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>The findings of the present study and similar studies conducted on the issue showed that doula supportive behaviors, including physical and psychological support and changing the mother's positions during labor, through creating an effective relationship with the woman in labor and drawing her active cooperation through the delivery process, could decrease the extra anxiety and tension, reduce anxiety during the delivery process, and make the delivery a desirable experience. Thus, considering the national and international approach toward physiological delivery, this inexpensive, available method, which can easily be taught and executed, is recommended to be used when faced with delivery pain. The findings of the current study also showed that acupressure at the BL32 point for 20 minutes decreased the anxiety level during labor pain. Thus, acupressure could also be used as a simple, inexpensive, non-invasive method for reducing stress during labor.</p><p>In this manner, pregnant women are persuaded to select natural vaginal delivery and experience the delivery process with lower stress, which eventually leads to reduction in the rate of Cesarean deliveries and their resultant complications, as well as in the treatment expenditure.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>A<sc>CKNOWLEDGEMENT</sc></title><p>The present article was extracted from Mrs. Zahra Masoudi M.Sc. thesis (proposal NO. 6356, IRCT 2012120911706N1).
