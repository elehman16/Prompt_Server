Effective long-term and low-cost strategies to keep these patients' physically active are needed. However, maintaining physical activity behaviour is difficult once formalised interventions end. Structured exercise training supported by mobile technology and remote feedback is potentially an effective strategy. The objective of the trial is to investigate whether mobile health support using the InterWalk application for smartphones is effective in increasing physical activity levels in persons with T2D over time compared with standard care. We investigate whether Interval Walking Training using the InterWalk application is superior to Danish municipality-based rehabilitation in increasing moderate-and-vigorous physical activity levels in patients with T2D across 52&#x02005;weeks. Secondary, we hypothesise that a motivational programme added from end of intervention to 52&#x02005;weeks further increases level of physical activity in everyday life in patients with T2D.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The trial is a parallel-group, open-labelled, randomised controlled trial with long-term follow-up at 52&#x02005;week including patients with T2D. The primary outcome is change in moderate-and-vigorous physical activity. The key secondary outcome includes motivation for physical activity behaviour change. Other secondary outcomes are VO<sub>2</sub>-peak, strength in the lower extremities. Exclusion criterion is medical contraindication to exercise. We include up to 246 patients and randomly allocate them into a control (standard group) or an experimental group (8&#x02013;12&#x02005;weeks of IWT supported by the smartphone-based InterWalk application) in a 1:2 fashion. After intervention, the experimental group is randomly allocated into two follow-up conditions with unsupervised IWT with or without motivational support until 52-week follow-up. The intention-to-treat principle is applied.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The local regional Research Ethics Committee in Denmark (H-1-2014-074) and the Danish Data Protection Agency (j.nr. 2014-54-0897) have approved the trial.

The municipality of Copenhagen is the first collaborator in the trial. Patients were referred to rehabilitation by their general practitioner (GP). Trained health professionals (physical therapists, nurses and staff with a master's degree) working at the health promotion centres recruit the patients, deliver the interventions and conduct all testing. The overall organisation of healthcare in Denmark is fully tax-financed with universal access to healthcare services. The Danish model is described in detail elsewhere<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>

The setting depends on stage of the disease, presence of complications and comorbidities, for example, severe heart conditions, depression or mental illness. The municipality-based rehabilitation primarily includes non-complicated patients (&#x0223c;80% of all patients).<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> If complications or comorbidities are present, patients are referred to treatment at a specialised clinic at a hospital. Patients with a non-complicated course of disease receive rehabilitation consisting of: (1) disease-specific patient education, (2) diet counselling, (3) smoking cessation and (4) exercise. The composition of the individual rehabilitation programme depends, however, on disease progression and on the rehabilitation offered in the municipality-based programme or at the hospital. The general focus is patient empowerment, disease-related self-care and prevention of a decay of the functional capacity of patients with T2D.</p><p>The InterWalk application is approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (2008-58-0035).

The interventions are designed to reflect the clinical rehabilitation settings in Denmark to increase the likelihood of implementation of the programme following this trial, if proven superior. Health professionals from the municipalities already providing the rehabilitation deliver all interventions in the control and experimental groups during the trial period. The investigators (LSV, CB and HL) led four workshops (16&#x02005;hours in total) with the health professionals during year 2014, in which the interventions of the study and work routines were discussed in detail. Furthermore, all participating health professionals underwent a thorough education programme (15&#x02005;hours in total) involving all procedures and manuals in the trial. This was carried out to ensure standardisation of all procedures throughout the trial. In addition, workshops were held from the start of the trial (January 2014) and hereafter every second month. This is carried out to secure that the health professionals follow all procedures and prepared manuals throughout the trial. The applicability of the trial results is increased here, as the interventions are already part of the rehabilitation programme offered to patients with T2D in the municipalities.</p><p>The interventions in the trial consist of two phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016014036F1">figure 1</xref>). In phase I (8&#x02013;12&#x02005;weeks), patients are randomised to either a standard care group (control intervention) or an experimental group doing IWT using the InterWalk app. The present trial uses the standard care programme as control intervention and is conducted directly in the clinical setting. All patients receive supervision across phase I. In phase II (40&#x02013;44&#x02005;weeks), patients in the standard care group have no follow-up until 52&#x02005;weeks postbaseline. Patients in the experimental intervention group are in phase II randomly allocated to either IWT with or without motivational support (see section Experimental intervention&#x02014;IWT with the InterWalk application). Additional rehabilitation care (cointerventions) with disease-specific patient education, diet counselling and smoking cessation is offered to all patients across the intervention groups.

Several approaches are described for handling missing data in the ITT analysis, and among them &#x02018;baseline observation carried forward&#x02019; (BOCF: ie, a null-responder imputation, where the level at baseline is also considered the last). A linear mixed model analysis includes all patients with a baseline assessment, and includes fixed and random factors.

PA and exercise have beneficial effect on patients with T2D when the interventions are conducted in well-designed efficacy studies.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> However, little is known on whether this effect also is present in effectiveness studies or &#x02018;real-world setting&#x02019; studies. These studies are of great importance and relevance regarding evidence-based medicine highlighting the importance of the InterWalk trial.</p><p>The InterWalk trial has a pragmatic design that allows for different intervention periods in the participating municipalities. Furthermore, the interventions are conducted directly in the clinical setting giving a more reliable frame of the experienced challenges in a population with T2D. We believe that the implementation of the study results will have a smoother implementation phase, as the health professionals already are familiar with the preceding's.</p><p>The trial gives valuable insight into the impact of different motivational and supportive tools as well as knowledge about individual motivation and the impact on sustaining a newly acquired behaviour change regarding PA in everyday life.</p><p>IWT is expected to be a suitable and effective way of providing moderate-to-vigorous PA for at large group of patients with T2D. IWT can be carried out at anytime and anywhere and is thus integrated and tailored to fit individual everyday life. The overall objective is to promote lifelong PA for the individual and we believe that experiences from the present trial can help when planning future interventions with IWT to patients with various lifestyle diseases, for example, coronary heart diseases.</p><p>It is a major advantage that the trial is designed as a randomised controlled trial in a &#x02018;real-world setting&#x02019; with a study population representing patients with T2D referred to rehabilitation. Furthermore, data and results are collected consecutively and directly in the clinical setting in which the interventions are to be used after the trial. Together with the very limited number of inclusion and exclusion criteria and a stratification of patients on gender secures external validity of the trial and thus will add important information to the current body of evidence on T2D treatment.</p><p>All data from eHealth solutions as the InterWalk app are electronically monitored. The patient is not dependent on opening hours at the health promotion centre as the InterWalk is either installed on an iPhone or an iPod. This gives a unique possibility for the patient to be physically active whenever it fits in their everyday life.</p><p>We acknowledge that PA only has effect when adherence is high, which is why we first compare standard care with interval walking for a shorter period (phase I) followed by a reallocation of patients in the experimental group to either interval walking with or without motivational support (phase II). All groups have a 52-week follow-up. The trial design enables us to investigate if patients are able to maintain a newly acquired behaviour change with PA in everyday life with or without motivational support for a longer period.</p><p>All personalised data and measures are stored on a central online-based database developed to logistically handle all data collected at baseline and during follow-up. The back-end system (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.runsafe.dk/mtd/admin/">https://www.runsafe.dk/mtd/admin/</ext-link>) secures all information from each patient. The construction of the database with personalised usernames, passwords and specific permissions to all health professionals and administering permissions to scientific staff in the back end secures all data. Furthermore, all activities are logged.</p><p>All outcomes measures are assessed blinded to allocation at baseline and the primary outcome is assessed blinded to intervention in the experimental group after the intervention period. All measures are conducted by the health professionals at the health promotion centres and are blinded for allocation after intervention in the experimental group with IWT until after return of the PA monitors by the patient.

The patients answer questionnaires independently of the health professionals at the health promotion centres.</p><p>The secondary outcomes of motivation for PA and behaviour change are of highly importance as knowledge concerning motivational support and maintenance of effect (new habits with PA) to the best of our knowledge is lacking in patients with T2D. This knowledge will help health professionals to better tailor the treatment and herby potentially achieve a higher adherence to the programme following the supervised intervention.</p><p>The limitations in this trial are similar to those of other exercise trials where physical testing and time-of-day and day-to-day variation constitute a challenge. We have standardised all testing protocols for all procedures to reduce the variation and run a routine programme of ongoing calibration and training of the health professionals.</p><p>The trial is conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration II.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> All eligible patients receive written and oral informed consent prior to inclusion before any additional trial procedures.
