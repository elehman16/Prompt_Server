improve muscular function in order to prevent and treat Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease in elderly
people. [Subjects and Methods] Elderly patients with mild dementia were randomly assigned
to an elastic band resistance exercise group (74.21&#x000b1;6.09&#x02005;years). The experimental group
(n=23) performed upper and lower extremity exercises three times per week for five months.
Physical fitness was measured according to chair leg squat, one-leg stance, timed
up-and-go test, 2-minute walking test, and gait ability before and after exercise.
[Results] Static balance ability in which the participant stood on one foot with eyes open
(left and right) increased significantly, but the dynamic balancing ability in the timed
up-and-go test did not improve significantly. Cardiorespiratory function and gait speed
improved significantly. [Conclusion] The five-month elastic band resistance exercise
program improved muscle strength and endurance, cardiovascular function, and gait speed.
Therefore, it may be an effective rehabilitation program for elderly patients with
Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease</kwd><kwd>Exercise</kwd><kwd>Muscular strength</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD) is an acquired neurologic disease that produces many difficulties
in social and daily life owing to multiple cognitive impairments. Exercise is a method for
preventing the risk factors of AD. Regular exercise is effective for increasing brain
metabolism, which increases the secretion of neuronal transmitters and cerebral blood flow;
in turn, these enhance muscle flexibility and balance ability, reducing the risk of
falls<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the PS2 gene model mice of
AD, treadmill running exercise performed for three months significantly decreased amyloid
beta peptide concentration<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. A combination
exercise program consisting of elastic band, ball, and balancing posture exercises improved
the proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation system and helped maintain correct posture in
elderly women<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. These findings suggest
exercise improves the deficits induced by AD or Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, specifically
deactivation of cholinergic activity and the difficulties due to the lack of
neurotransmitters<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Exercise increases muscle strength and endurance, which aid the
activities of daily living of AD patients<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. As an exercise training program for improving muscular strength in
the elderly, ACSM (American College of Sports Medicine) increases protein synthesis<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Snijders et al. report that resistance
exercise increases muscle mass, improves muscle function, and prevents the aging-related
decrease in the number of satellite cells in elderly people<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Muscle function is well known as an important factor for balance
ability<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> and cognitive function<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> in the elderly. Therefore, the present
study analyzed the effects of an exercise program aiming to improve muscle functions in
order to prevent and alleviate AD in the elderly. We used elastic band exercises, targeting
elderly patients with AD, in order to examine its effects on physical fitness and gait
ability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Elderly patients with mild dementia (i.e., MMSE-K score, 10&#x02013;19 points) were randomly
divided into elastic band resistance exercise group (n=23, 74.21&#x000b1;6.09&#x02005;years). The exercise
group performed exercise three times per week for five months. The muscle strength of the
lower extremities and gait ability were analyzed before and after the exercise program.
Informed consent was obtained from all study participants. The study protocol was in
compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The resistance exercise program mainly consisted of the joint movement, which involves
gait ability, of the hip and lower extremities with gradual increasing resistance. We used
elastic bands to perform resistance exercise three times per week over five months. The
use of elastic bands is specifically recommended for this population, because intensity is
easily moderated, which is an important concern for people who have low physical fitness
levels, such as the elderly. The target heart rate was maintained (within the range of &#x000b1;5
bpm) for 30&#x02013;40 minutes using medium-intensity exercise at 60% maximum heart rate. The RPE
(Ratings of Perceived Exertion) scale was checked during exercise to maintain a level of
10&#x02013;12, so that the individual&#x02019;s condition and 60% of medium-intensity exercise could be
maintained. Exercise intensity was determined by the extensibility of the elastic band;
the yellow band, which is the easiest (i.e., lowest resistance), was used in the initial
stage of exercise. The participant switched to the red or green band according to their
exercise capacity in order to increase the level of resistance. Exercises of the lower
extremities (i.e., bending, flexion and extension movements of the hip joint, knee joint,
thighs, and ankle joint) and upper extremities (i.e., bending, flexion and extension of
the upper arms, and shoulder joint movement) were performed repeatedly to improve muscle
strength (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Elastic band resistance exercise program</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stage</th><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Contents</th><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Time<break/>(min)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Warm-up</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Arms: raise both arms, stretching; trunk: twist,

Lower extremity endurance was tested by the chair squat on a chair 46&#x02005;cm
tall without armrests; the number of repetitions in 30&#x02005;s was recorded. Static balance
ability was evaluated by the one-leg stance test, in which the participant stood on one
foot with their eyes open. The timed up-and-go test (TUG) was used to evaluate dynamic
balance ability. The number of gait on the same spot was measured for 2&#x02005;min to measure
cardiorespiratory function. Temporal distance gait analysis was performed by measuring the
time it took to walk 8&#x02005;m. Gait speed was determined by the total distance moved (8 m)
divided by the total time spent (cm/s). Data are presented as mean &#x000b1; SD and were analyzed
by using SPSS version 17.0. Independent t-tests were used to compare the means of the two
groups. Meanwhile, paired t-tests were used to compare changes before and after exercise
in the exercise group. The level of significance was set at p&#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Regarding muscle endurance, the number of chair squats increased significantly (p&#x0003c;0.001)

cerebral infarction, cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral embolism, and depression. They also had
metabolic diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, and heart failure as well as joint diseases such as arthritis, spinal fracture,
upper-arm fracture, and osteoporosis. Resistance exercise not only increases muscle
strength, but also enhances the ability to perform functional tasks and gait speed<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, resistance exercise should be
emphasized to break the chain reaction of inactivity, muscle weakening, loss of functional
ability, and development of metabolic diseases. Hunter et al. conducted resistance exercise
on elderly patients 61&#x02013;77&#x02005;years old for 26 weeks; the subjects gained an average of 2&#x02005;kg
muscle mass and lost 2.7&#x02005;kg body fat<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In addition, Shin et al. report that resistance exercise using elastic bands increases
muscle strength in elderly women and improves ambulatory ability<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Frontera et al. report resistance exercise of the lower
extremities improves muscle volume and strength<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study reports moderate to intense elastic band resistance
training for muscle strengthening in inactive healthy and frail elderly subjects increases
muscle strength 3&#x02013;17% and 6&#x02013;18%, respectively<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Shin et al. used elastic band resistance exercises for the hips
and lower extremities, which are related to gait ability, on elderly women aged 58&#x02013;67&#x02005;years;
after training 60&#x02005;min twice per week for eight weeks, balance ability and muscle endurance
increased significantly<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, static balance ability increased significantly after resistance
exercise. This indicates the ability to stand on one foot and functions of the lower
extremities, which were enhanced as a result of elastic band resistance exercise, can
enhance and maintain balance ability in elderly people. Furthermore, significant
improvements in cardiorespiratory endurance and gait speed were observed after exercise,
showing that the elastic band resistance exercise program is effective for increasing muscle
function and thus promoting active lifestyles for AD patients. As the five-month elastic
band resistance exercise program improves the muscle strength and endurance, cardiovascular
endurance, and gait speed of elderly AD patients, it can be used as an effective
rehabilitation program for elderly AD patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Toulotte</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Fabre</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Dangremont</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Effects of physical training on the physical capacity of
