SOD and SDD resulted in crude LYG of +0.04 and +0.25, respectively, as compared with SC, implying that both SDD and SOD are dominant (ie, cheaper and more beneficial) over SC. In cost-effectiveness acceptability curves probabilities for cost-effectiveness, compared with standard care, ranged from 89% to 93% for SOD and from 63% to 72% for SDD, for acceptable costs for 1 LYG ranging from &#x020ac;0 to &#x020ac;20&#x02005;000. Sensitivity analysis for mechanical ventilation and discount rates did not change interpretation. Yet, if costs of the topical component of SDD and SOD would increase 40-fold to &#x020ac;400/day and &#x020ac;40/day (maximum values based on free market prices in 2012), the estimated ICER as compared with SC for SDD would be &#x020ac;21&#x02005;590 per LYG.

During SOD topical antibiotics are exclusively applied to the oropharynx throughout the ICU-stay. During SDD topical antibiotics are not only applied to the oropharynx but also to the intestinal tract throughout the&#x000a0;ICU-stay, in combination with intravenous administration of cefotaxime during the first 4&#x02005;days in ICU, to pre-emptively treat infections with commensal respiratory tract bacteria.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> SDD has been a widely evaluated but highly controversial intervention in ICU.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> Many, but not all, studies reported statistically significant reductions in the incidence of Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP), but only few were able to demonstrate outcome benefits such as reduced mortality and length of ICU-stay.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> In the absence of indisputably documented outcome benefits, the fear for selection of antibiotic resistance has prevailed and SDD has not been recommended in most infection prevention guidelines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6 R7 R8 R9">6&#x02013;9</xref> In a cluster-randomised study in 13 Dutch ICUs, SDD and SOD were associated with relative risk (RR) reductions of mortality on day 28 of 13% and 11%, respectively, as compared with standard care (SC; ie, no SDD or SOD).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> Although SOD and SDD are currently widely used in Dutch ICUs, the costs and effects of both regimens have not yet been determined. We, therefore, conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), comparing SC, SOD and SDD using data from the Dutch multicentre trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Data collection</title><p>A post hoc analysis of the cluster randomised crossover trial comparing SOD and SDD to SC was performed. The trial was conducted in 13 Dutch ICUs and included 5939 patients (2045 received SDD, 1904 received SOD and 1990 were treated according to SC). All centres were assigned to all three regimens during periods of 6&#x02005;months; however, the order of implementation of SC, SOD and SDD was randomised per centre.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></p><p>SOD and SDD have been described in detail elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> In short, SOD consists of a paste applied to the oropharynx, containing polymyxin E, tobramycin and amphotericin B (all in a 2% concentration, applied every 6&#x02005;h). SDD consists, besides the paste used in SOD, also of a 10&#x02005;ml suspension of 100&#x02005;mg polymyxin E, 80&#x02005;mg tobramycin and 500&#x02005;mg amphotericin B that is applied via a nasogastric tube, every 6&#x02005;h, and of cefotaxime (1000&#x02005;mg, every 6&#x02005;h) applied intravenously during the first 4&#x02005;days of ICU-admission. The topical antibiotics of both regimens are applied until ICU-discharge. During the trial there were no restrictions to systemic antibiotic use during SC and SOD. During SDD, the use of antibiotics with antianaerobic activity was discouraged. This resulted in a marked increase of cephalosporin use and lower usage of penicillins, carbapenem and clindamycin.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> Surveillance cultures of endotracheal aspirates, oropharynx and rectum were obtained upon admission and twice weekly during SDD. During SOD surveillance, cultures of endotracheal aspirates and the oropharynx were obtained upon admission and twice weekly thereafter. During SC no surveillance cultures were obtained. Clinical cultures were obtained on clinical suspicion of infection in all three periods.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Approach for economic evaluation</title><p>We performed a CEA from a healthcare perspective, hence, only including direct medical costs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10 R11 R12">10&#x02013;12</xref> The time horizon of the study was the period from ICU-admission until hospital-discharge. Life Years Gained (LYG) was used as effectiveness measure. The outcome of the CEA was the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as cost per LYG. The informal Dutch threshold for cost-effectiveness is &#x020ac;20&#x02005;000/LYG.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> Data from all individual patients were used for analyses. The CEA was performed post hoc, however, using data that were prospectively collected in Case Report Forms during the trial. Total direct medical costs of the three regimens consisted of three main categories: Length of Stay (LOS), antibiotic use and microbiology costs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012002529TB1">table 1</xref>). LOS was based on the length of ICU-stay and the number of days on a hospital ward after ICU-discharge. Costs for days in ICU and other hospital days were based on the Dutch guidelines for costing research in health economic studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> Days in ICU were categorised in days with and without mechanical ventilation; days with mechanical ventilation were considered to be 15% more expensive than ICU-days without mechanical ventilation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15 R16 R17">15&#x02013;17</xref> Antibiotic use consisted of the topical components of the SDD-regimen and SOD-regimen, hereafter referred to as study medication, and of all systemic antibiotics used in ICU during all periods, including the 4&#x02005;days cefotaxime during SDD as part of the SDD-protocol. The price of study medication was &#x020ac;0.87 and &#x020ac;10.48/day, for SOD and SDD, respectively. Costs of systemic antibiotics were based upon prices per Defined Daily Dose (DDD) provided by the Dutch information project on medication and medical devices (Genees- en hulpmiddelen Informatie Project (GIP)-database<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). For microbiology costs blood cultures, broncheoalveolar lavages, sputum, throat and rectal cultures were considered. Rectal cultures were only obtained during SDD as part of SDD-surveillance. Cultures obtained from the other sites were either obtained as part of the surveillance (throat and sputum cultures during SDD/SOD) or as part of daily clinical practice. Microbiological costs were obtained as the internal tariffs applied within the University Medical Center, Utrecht. These costs included costs for the microbiological culture, order tariff and extra costs for species determination and susceptibility resistance testing in case of relevant bacterial growth, irrespective of the species. The year 2009 was taken as the reference year for all costs. Costs that were not available for 2009 were corrected for inflation (with respect to 2009) based on the price index.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> An overview of all unit costs used in the analysis is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012002529TB1">table 1</xref>.

The ICER was defined as the incremental difference between the mean cost of treatment regimens, divided by the incremental difference in mean effect between treatment regimens. To estimate confidence limits for the ICER, bootstrapping (25&#x02005;000 repeats) was performed, as this does not depend on parametric assumptions about the distribution of the data.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> Results of the bootstrap procedure were plotted in a cost-effectiveness plane that graphically represents the cost-difference and effect difference between either SDD or SOD and SC, and for SDD versus SOD, for each of the bootstrap replications. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEAC) were plotted to express the probability that treatment regimens were cost-effective as compared with SC, for a range of willingness to pay levels for one LYG (&#x003bb;).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> The curves display the proportion of bootstrapped ICER-pairs that are cost-effective, meaning that they either fall within the south-east quadrant of the cost-effectiveness plane or remain below the &#x003bb; threshold in the north-east and south-west quadrants of the plane. In addition, sensitivity analyses were performed: the discounted results (at 1.5% a year) were compared with results without discounting and to a discount rate of 3% a year; costs for ICU-days with mechanical ventilation were analysed for 0% and 30% extra per ICU-day as compared with 15% additional costs in base case analysis; daily costs of study medication were analysed with maximum values based upon free market prices in 2012 (&#x020ac;40 for SOD and &#x020ac;400 for SDD). Mann-Whitney U test was used to calculate p values. p Value &#x0003c;0.05 was considered to denote statistical significance and all reported p values are two-sided.

To stay below the Dutch threshold of &#x020ac;20&#x02005;000 per LYG, the maximum daily price for the topical SDD-components should be &#x020ac;375.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2012002529TB5" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>Sensitivity analysis</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">SC</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">SOD</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">SDD</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">ICER analyses SC vs SOD</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">ICER analyses SC vs SDD</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">ICER analyses SDD vs SOD</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="7" rowspan="1">Sensitivity analysis discounting effects (life years lost)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;BC+1.5%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.27 (3.96 to 4.57)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.02 (3.72 to 4.32)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.23 (3.94 to 4.53)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">SC=dominated by SOD</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">SC=dominated by SDD</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">SDD=dominated by SOD</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;+0%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.07 (5.58 to 6.55)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.62 (5.15 to 6.08)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.97 (5.50 to 6.44)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">SC=dominated by SOD</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">SC=dominated by SDD</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">SDD=dominated by SOD</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;+3%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.82 (2.63 to 3.01)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.68 (2.49 to 2.87)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.82 (2.63 to 3.00)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">SC=dominated by SOD</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">SC=dominated by SDD</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">SDD=dominated by SOD</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sensitivity analysis mechanical ventilation&#x02020;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;BC+15%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x020ac;41940.79 (&#x020ac;40183.93 to &#x020ac;43697.66)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x020ac;40433.42 (&#x020ac;38837.50 to &#x020ac;42029.35)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x020ac;41183.12 (&#x020ac;39408.39 to &#x020ac;42957.85)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">SC=dominated by SOD</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">SC=dominated by SDD</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">SDD=dominated by SOD</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;+0%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x020ac;38715.73 (&#x020ac;37112.32 to &#x020ac;40319.14)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x020ac;37117.07 (&#x020ac;35659.90 to &#x020ac;38574.24)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x020ac;37874.94 (&#x020ac;36270.73 to &#x020ac;39479.15)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">SC=dominated by SOD</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">SC=dominated by SDD</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">SDD=dominated by SOD</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;+30%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x020ac;45165.85 (&#x020ac;43251.01 to &#x020ac;47080.69)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x020ac;43749.78 (&#x020ac;42010.47 to &#x020ac;45489.09)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x020ac;44491.30 (&#x020ac;42542.03 to &#x020ac;46440.57)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">SC=dominated by SOD</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">SC=dominated by SDD</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">SDD=dominated by SOD</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sensitivity analysis price study regimen*,&#x02020;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x020ac;41940.79 (&#x020ac;40183.93 to &#x020ac;43697.66)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x020ac;40493.15 (&#x020ac;38996.62 to &#x020ac;42189.67)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x020ac;42720.23 (&#x020ac;40943.82 to &#x020ac;44.496.65)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">SC=dominated by SOD</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ICER 21590</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">SDD=dominated by SOD</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>*Price SOD &#x020ac;40 and SDD &#x020ac;400 per day.</p></fn><fn><p>&#x02020;Effects are discounted 1.5% a year.</p></fn><fn><p>BC, base case results;

These findings were insensitive to changes in discount rates and extra expenses for ventilation days. Furthermore, for SOD, but not for SDD, these findings were insensitive to current (higher) market-prices of the topical components. The probabilities that SOD and SDD are cost-effective for a willingness to pay threshold of &#x020ac;20&#x02005;000 per LYG as compared with SC, were 93% and 63%, respectively.</p><p>This is the first head-to-head comparison of the costs and benefits of SDD and SOD and the first comparison of both interventions versus SC. Strengths of the present study include the large study size and the completeness of data collection.</p><p>Limitations of the study are the baseline differences between the three study periods. Patients receiving SC were younger, had lower APACHE II scores and were less likely to receive mechanical ventilation and, therefore, seemed to have a better prognosis. In the original trial random effects logistic regression modelling was applied to adjust for these differences.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> Here we have used crude data, without any adjustments for baseline differences. Our analysis points at superiority of SOD and SDD when compared with SC, despite the somewhat more favourable prognosis at the time of ICU-admission of patients receiving SC. Our findings on the cost-effectiveness of both interventions are, therefore, conservative estimates. Furthermore, patients receiving SOD were, on average, 1&#x02005;year younger than those receiving SDD, which may have affected the difference in LYL between both interventions. Other limitations are the restriction of cost data to the healthcare setting and the absence of antibiotic and microbiology cost data after ICU-discharge, which could not be obtained retrospectively. Finally, this trial was performed in ICU-settings with low endemicity of antibiotic resistance, which may limit generalisability to other settings.</p><p>The main contributor to the total costs was LOS, which was composed of stay in ICU and hospital after ICU-discharge. The other costs, microbiology and antibiotics, were the highest for SDD, which had been reported previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> Some relatively small single-centre studies, also determined the effects of SDD on costs of days in ICU or in the hospital. In a German study SOD with cefotaxime prophylaxis resulted in lower average costs for antibiotic therapy and for days on ventilation than during SC.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> In a French study of trauma patients both daily ICU-costs as well as mean antibiotic costs, including SDD treatment, were lower during SDD compared with SC.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> In a Spanish study mean costs of systemic antibiotics were lower and less diagnostic procedures for infections were performed during SDD, compared with those during SC, which resulted in a 21% reduction of total costs per survivor in the SDD-treated group.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> Yet, in none of these studies a formal CEA was performed.</p><p>VAP incidences were not determined in the Dutch SDD-SOD trial<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> because of the perceived difficulties in uniformly diagnosing VAP in 13 ICUs. Yet, both SDD and SOD have been associated with reduced incidences of VAP, as compared with SC.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> In addition to SDD and SOD there are other preventive measures that have been associated with reductions in the incidence of VAP, such as the use of silver-coated endotracheal tubes and continuous subglottic suctioning (CSS). In a large multicentre randomised controlled trial silver-coated endotracheal tubes were associated with an RR reduction of the incidence of VAP of 35.9%, without discernible beneficial effects on patient outcome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> In a CEA of this trial the use of silver-coated tubes, although 45-fold more expensive than normal tubes ($90 vs $2 per tube), yielded savings of $12&#x02005;840 per episode of VAP prevented.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> CSS was, in a recent meta-analysis of 13 randomised trials, associated with a 45% reduction in the incidence of VAP (RR 0.55 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.66), but also without discernible beneficial effects on patient outcome (RR 1.01 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.20).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> The intervention appeared cost saving in two studies, saving $4992 and &#x020ac;1176 per episode of VAP prevented.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> However, these analyses were based on extrapolated costs per episode of VAP, rather than on the true costs generated during the trials. Other widely recommended measures to prevent VAP, such as the semirecumbent patient position and different bundle approaches have not been associated with documented improvements in patient outcome and have not been evaluated with formal cost-effectiveness analyses.</p><p>In conclusion, both SOD and SDD appeared more beneficial and cost saving as compared with SC and even if the costs of both measures would increase 40-fold SOD will remain cost-saving and the ICER of SDD will be around the Dutch threshold for cost-effectiveness of &#x020ac;20&#x02005;000 per LYG. The higher price for medication follows from the higher costs for amphotericine B, which could be alleviated by replacing amphotericine B by nystatin, which has also good antifungal activity in topical application.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref> With 1180 ICU-beds in a country of 16.6 million inhabitants (year 2010), extrapolation of our findings suggests that nationwide implementation of SOD or SDD in ICUs, as occurred after the trial, has saved, per year, 18&#x02013;36 million Euros.</p><p>The Dutch multicentre study on SDD and SOD provided evidence of better patient outcome,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> lower antibiotic resistance prevalence in the ICUs,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref> lower incidence of ICU-acquired bacteraemia and ICU-acquired colonisation of the respiratory tract with multiresistant bacteria,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref> effective eradication of intestinal carriage with cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref> and low rates of resistance development to colistin.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref> Importantly, these beneficial effects were obtained in ICUs with low levels of antibiotic resistance, reflected by incidence rates of bloodstream infections caused by methicillin-resistant <italic>S aureus</italic>, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and highly-resistant Enterobacteriaceae of &#x0003c;0.1, &#x0003c;0.1 and 0.5 per 1000 patient at risk, respectively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref> Whether these benefits can be realised in ICUs with different bacterial ecology remain to be determined,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref> but given the potential gains careful scientific evaluation is warranted.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e422" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-002529.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e423" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-002529.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Collaborators:</bold> The Dutch SOD&#x02013;SDD trialists group include the following persons and sites: Cor J Kalkman, Hans (J) C A Joore, Maurine A.
