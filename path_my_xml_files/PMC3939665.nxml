<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Over the past two decades, an increasing body of literature has identified the impact of hysterectomy on disease risk.

In such studies, hysterectomy status is almost invariably ascertained by asking women whether they have had a hysterectomy or removal of the womb. However, there is a paucity of studies which analyse the accuracy of self-reporting of hysterectomy as a reliable method of data collection. We are aware of five small studies involving 79&#x02013;455 women who have verified the validity of self-reported hysterectomy by review of medical notes or electronic records (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2013004421TB1">table 1</xref>).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;13</xref> Four of the five studies report an agreement of 91% or over with one study of 452 women reporting a validity of only 66%, as the hospital records could not confirm that the procedure had been undertaken.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2013004421TB1" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Studies comparing validity of self-reported hysterectomy compared to hospital/medical records</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Author (year)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Study design</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Self-reported hysterectomy compared to source</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N, reporting hysterectomy</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N, who had hysterectomy status confirmed</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N, where confirmation was impossible</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Quoted validity of self report (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Brett and Madans (1994)<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cross-sectional</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hospital records</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">452</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">298</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">33</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">66</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Green <italic>et al</italic> (1997)<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Case&#x02013;control</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Medical records, surgeon's report, or GP</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">206</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">127</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">73</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">96</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Phipps and Buist (2009)<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cross-sectional</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Surgical pathology report (10%), imaging reports (35%) and transcribed medical history (48%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">79</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">72</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">91</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Colditz <italic>et al</italic> (1987)<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cross-sectional</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Medical records</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">212</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">199</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">99</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">(Horwitz (1986)<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Case&#x02013;control</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Medical records</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">455</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">440</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">34</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">97</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>GP, general practitioner.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>In the ultrasound screening group of the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS),<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> 50&#x02005;639 women were randomised to an ultrasound scan of the pelvis following completion of a baseline questionnaire which included a question on hysterectomy.

Between April 2001 and October 2005, 202&#x02005;638 apparently healthy women aged 50&#x02013;74 were recruited to the trial through 13 regional trial centres located in National Health Service (NHS) Trusts in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Women completed a baseline questionnaire on lifestyle and medical history, which included a question on hysterectomy: &#x02018;Have you ever had a hysterectomy (removal of the womb)?&#x02019; (questionnaire format, recruitment questionnaire (RQ)). The women were then randomised to screening either with (1) transvaginal ultrasound (ultrasound group, USS; n=50&#x02005;639); (2) CA125 interpreted by the Risk of Ovarian Cancer (ROC) algorithm (multimodal group, MMS; n=50&#x02005;640) or (3) control (no screening, n=101&#x02005;359).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>The women randomised to the ultrasound arm of UKCTOCS were invited to attend for a transvaginal scan (TVS). At this visit, they were again questioned by the ultrasonographer about previous hysterectomy prior to the scan (interview format, IF). At each scan, in addition to data regarding the adnexae, the sonographer recorded the endometrial thickness (ET) and presence of any endometrial or uterine abnormalities. They also recorded any other relevant data as &#x02018;text&#x02019; in the notes section.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Interpretation of the scan findings</title><p>The scan data were used to ascertain the presence or absence of a uterus. The uterus was deemed to be present if ET was measured or uterine abnormality, for example, &#x02018;fibroids&#x02019; was noted. In addition, the uterus was considered to be present if the sonographer noted an abnormal uterine position, the presence of an intrauterine device or made specific comments regarding uterine visualisation in the notes section. The uterus was deemed to be absent if there were no ET measurements or if none of the above were captured as text in the notes field. Scans with poor visualisation of the pelvis or where the procedure was abandoned due to discomfort were classified as &#x02018;inconclusive&#x02019; and these women were excluded from the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Self-reported hysterectomy status on the questionnaire or at the interview was compared to ultrasound findings of the presence or absence of a uterus.</p><p>We estimated sensitivity as the proportion of women with an absent uterus confirmed on scan, who self-reported hysterectomy on RQ, at IF or both. Specificity was calculated as the proportion of women with a uterus confirmed on scan, who self-reported not having a hysterectomy. Positive predictive value (PPV) was calculated as the proportion of women who did self-reported hysterectomy, where the scan confirmed the absence of a uterus. Negative predictive value (NPV) was calculated as the proportion of women who did not self-report hysterectomy, where the scan confirmed the presence of a uterus. Validity was calculated as the proportion of women who were accurate in their reporting (self-reported hysterectomy with uterus absent and those who did not report it with uterus present) out of all women.</p><p>We further evaluated whether age at randomisation or socioeconomic status as derived from the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) could affect the validity of reporting.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Between 2001 and 2005, 50&#x02005;639 women randomised to the ultrasound arm of UKCTOCS completed the RQ which included self-reported hysterectomy. Of them, 48&#x02005;215 underwent the first (initial) scan on the trial. Of these women, 42&#x02005;401 had a TVS, 4325 a transabdominal (TA) scan and 1489 had both performed at the same time. The median time from randomisation to scan was 2.7&#x02005;weeks (IQR, 1.7&#x02013;4.0). The uterus was reported to be present on the scan report in 38&#x02005;221 and absent in 9398 women. The latter included three women who had congenital uterine agenesis. In 593 women, the ultrasound report was inconclusive with regard to the presence or absence of a uterus on this initial scan. Of these women, 242 had a TVS, 299 had a TA and 52 had both scans performed. As the 593 women went on to have 2&#x02013;11 annual scans as part of the trial, these and all the other scans they have had were then queried to ascertain the presence or absence of a uterus. On subsequent scans, in 353 the presence of a uterus was recorded, 22 had the absence of a uterus clearly stated and 218 remained inconclusive due to difficulty in visualising the pelvis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2013004421F1">figure 1</xref>).

Self-reporting of hysterectomy was correct in 99.6% of cases, indicating that self-reporting (as captured in epidemiological studies) is an accurate measure of hysterectomy status. The validity of capturing hysterectomy using the questionnaire or interview was similar (99.6% vs 98.9%) though statistically significant. As the data on hysterectomy collected in most studies are usually ascertained through self-reporting, we feel that the data presented here can inform epidemiologists about the reliability of self-reporting of this variable.</p><p>The strengths of our study are (1) the size, (2) prospective design and (3) the fact that UKCTOCS participants were recruited from 13 centres across England, Wales and Northern Ireland through invitation from population registries&#x02014;they are therefore as representative of the general female population aged 50&#x02013;74 as is possible in clinical research.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> We have previously observed a &#x02018;healthy volunteer effect&#x02019; in the trial,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> so the women participating in UKCTOCS may be more health-conscious and aware of medical procedures than the general population, therefore being highly accurate in reporting. All women randomised to the ultrasound arm of UKCTOCS who attended for the initial scan were included in the analysis.

Furthermore, two types of self-reporting (questionnaire vs interview) were assessed and their validity compared.</p><p>In our study, nearly 48&#x02005;000 women were included in the analysis with prospective evaluation of hysterectomy. Previous studies have been retrospective with a medical note review used to confirm hysterectomy status. Logistical issues have meant that these studies were relatively small. They frequently encountered difficulties in acquiring notes because they relied on patients remembering details of hospitals where a procedure, which potentially occurred decades ago, was undertaken and there was often poor recording of events.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In the multicentre Study of Women Across the Nation (SWAN), of the 3302 participants, 239 reported hysterectomies of which for only 165 (69.3%) of the women the procedure could be confirmed. The remaining 74 could not be reviewed due to consent issues, loss to follow-up or unavailability of medical records.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In addition, some studies have used self-reported hysterectomy transcribed in medical histories as part of validation.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> This has resulted in agreement of self-reported hysterectomy with medical records ranging from 66% to 99%.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;13</xref> A methodology that avoids several of these difficulties is to identify a cohort of women who have undergone hysterectomy using electronic outpatient records and subsequently investigate their self-reported hysterectomy status. Phipps and Buist,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> using this approach, found that of 1935 women with confirmed hysterectomy, 1757 self-reported correctly, giving a sensitivity of 91%.</p><p>Our study showed validity of self-reported hysterectomy of 99% in the UK women from the general population, aged 50&#x02013;74. These figures are similar to the 100% accuracy rates reported in a subgroup of 200 women, for whom medical records could be obtained, participating in the Nurses&#x02019; Health Study.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, this cohort was composed entirely of women with a nursing background who are well aware of the procedure, making it difficult to extrapolate to the wider population. Our results indicate that self-reporting of hysterectomy is highly accurate in women from the UK, and we feel that our findings are applicable to women from other developed countries. However, it is possible that the validity of self-reporting of hysterectomy may be lower in those societies where there is a stigma attached to having undergone this procedure.</p><p>A limitation of our study is that the sonographer was not asked to specifically capture the presence or absence of a uterus. ET or endometrial abnormality were the only uterine details that were recorded.</p><p>A small proportion of women reported hysterectomy at recruitment but failed to do so at the scan. The reason for this discrepancy may be that either the sonographer did not question the woman or the woman did not hear the question at the time of the scan.</p><p>The women who were accurate in their reporting were younger than those who were inaccurate in their reporting of the presence or absence of a uterus. One of the reasons for this may be due to the procedure being carried out many years, even decades previously.</p><p>In our study, 1.2% of women (576 of 47&#x02005;994) were inconsistent in their self-reporting of hysterectomy status between the RQ and the interview carried out at a median 2.7&#x02005;weeks later. Similarly, studies examining the agreement of self-reports report a low rate of inconsistency, but these were made several years apart.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> One of the reasons for this may be that the women were more accurate in reporting on the questionnaire as they had more time to fill this in compared to those attending their first scan in a busy clinic. Our data and previous data indicate that capturing data via an interviewer-administered questionnaire is a valid method to capture self-reported medical history.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data indicate that self-reported hysterectomy, whether through a questionnaire or interview, is highly accurate and is a reliable data source for studying long-term associations of hysterectomy with disease onset.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e204" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-004421.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e205" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-004421.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are particularly grateful to the women throughout the UK who are participating in the trial and to the entire medical, nursing and administrative staff who work on the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS).</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> UM and AG-M were involved in study design and concept and drafted the manuscript.
