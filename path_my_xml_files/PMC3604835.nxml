On day 3, volume of ovary was acquired, ovarian volume was defined by VOCAL, and Sono AVC was used to count the number of antral follicles. Sum total of antral follicles in both ovaries was taken as total antral follicle count (AFC). AMH was measured on the same day. Long agonist protocol with recombinant FSH (rFSH) was used for IVF stimulation till at least two follicles of 18 mm were seen. hCG 10,000 iu was given and ovum pick up was done after 34-35 h.

Ovarian reserve was conventionally assessed by serum FSH (S. FSH). AMH (Anti-mullerian hormone) has lately been found to be a very reliable and more accurate than S.FSH, for assessment of ovarian reserve. Anti-mullerian hormone is produced by pre-antral follicles. The highest level of AMH expression is present in granulosa cells of secondary, pre-antral and small antral follicles up to 6 mm in diameter.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Therefore, level of AMH may represent the population of these follicles. It has been shown that the number of antral follicles in the ovaries is proportionally related to the size of primordial follicle stock from which they were recruited.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Therefore, the antral follicle count (AFC) is believed to represent the quantitative aspect of ovarian aging.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] With advancement in ultrasound technology it is now possible to count antral follicles. This study was therefore designed to find out if there was any correlation between AFC and AMH and to analyze which of the two is more reliable. Comparison of AMH and AFC has been done in two groups: Polycystic ovaries PCOs and non-PCOs (normal ovaries). S. FSH did show high values for low reserve ovaries but its values are not found to be different for normal and hyper-responding &#x02013; PCO groups. These two groups were selected for the study, therefore to assess whether values of these new markers were different in these groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>OBJECTIVE</title><p>The study aims to find out whether AFC or AMH is more reliable parameter for assessment of ovarian reserve based on computation of correlation between AFC and AMH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-3"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Seventy-five patients with PCOs, with BMI (Body mass index) between 22 and 26 (mean 24.5) undergoing IVF (<italic>In-vitro</italic> fertilization) were randomized with 75 patients with same BMI (mean 23.2) but non-PCO (normal responding) ovaries undergoing IVF (<italic>In-vitro</italic> fertilization) for the study. In both groups, patients recruited were of 24-32 years of age. Mean age in PCO group was 28.7 years and mean age in non-PCO group was 29.2 years.</p><p>Patients in PCO group were confirmed to have PCO by Rotterdam criteria, whereas patients in non-PCO group had normal responding ovaries (ovarian diameter between 2 and 3 cm, ovarian volume between 3 and 6.6 cc, AFC 5-12), with regular menstrual cycles and no biochemical or clinical signs of hyperandrogenemia. Patients with other endocrinal derangements like thyroid or prolactin were excluded from the study.</p><p>Baseline scan was done for all these women on day 3 of the menstrual cycle using 3D US (ultrasound). After acquiring a 3D volume of the ovary, VOCAL (Volume calculation software) was used to define the ovarian volume. Angle of rotation for VOCAL was 15&#x000b0;. Then Sono AVC (Automated volume calculation) was used to count the number of antral follicles in each ovary. Antral follicles are the follicles between 2 and 9 mm on day 3 of menstrual cycle. Sono AVC is based on inversion mode and color codes each follicle along with its diameter in all three orthogonal planes (<italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>, <italic>z</italic>), mean diameter and follicular volume. Post-processing of Sono AVC was done in all patients to count the number of antral follicles more accurately. Post-processing includes manually adding the follicles that were missed on automatic counting, removing the areas that were erroneously counted as antral follicles on automatic counting, cutting the area that was over-measured on automatic calculation and merging the areas that were part of the same follicle but was counted as separate follicles. The sum total of antral follicles in both ovaries was taken as total AFC. All the scans were done by a single operator on Voluson E8 (GE Healthcare), with 5-9 MHz transvaginal volume probe. Anti-mullerian hormone level in patient's blood was measured in all patients on the same day.</p><p>Measurement of serum AMH levels was performed using AMH/MIS enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Beckman Coulter Immunotech Com., Fullerton, CA). The lowest detection rate limit and intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 1 pmol/l or 0.14 ng/mL, 12.3%, and 14.2%, respectively. The unit of measurement for AMH used was ng/ml.</p><p>All patients were down-regulated by long agonist protocol (Leuprolide acetate 1 mg daily from day 21 of previous cycle and 0.5 mg daily from the day of menstruation till the day of hCG). Recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (rFSH), (Inj. Gonal F, Merck Serono) 150 iu was used for ovulation induction in all patients starting from day 2 of the period. Transvaginal ultrasound scan (TVS) was done on day 6 of stimulation. If at least 2-3 follicles of 10 mm or more were seen, the same dose was continued. If not the dose of rFSH was increased. Stimulation was continued till there were at least 2-3 follicles of 18 mm. These follicles were assessed by color Doppler for their physiological maturity. Follicles when showed flow covering at least &#x000be;<sup>th</sup> of its circumference with resistance index (RI) of &#x0003c;0.48 and peak systolic velocity (PSV) of &#x0003e;10 cm/s, hCG 10,000 was given for ovulation trigger. Ovum pick up was done 34-35 h after hCG.</p><p>For both groups the primary end point was number of follicles larger than 12 mm seen on the day of hCG. The final end point was the number of ova retrieved on ovum pick up. In both groups, correlation of AFC and AMH was checked with both these endpoints and correlation of AFC was also checked with AMH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-4"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In PCO group, the AFC ranged from 25 to 59 with an average of 34 and in non-PCO group, the AFC ranged from 11 to 23 follicles with an average of 14.

This can be decided only by proper assessment of ovarian reserve before commencing ovarian stimulation. Various tests have been tried at different times for assessment of ovarian reserve like S.FSH, AMH, AFC, Inhibin B, etc., Several studies have been done and published at different times assessing these different markers for assessment of ovarian reserve. AMH and AFC have been shown to be the most sensitive ones for assessment of ovarian reserve in these studies. AFC and ovarian volume provide direct measurements of ovarian reserve, while AMH, inhibin B and oestradiol are released from growing follicles and so their levels reflect the size of developing follicle cohort.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>AFC can be reliably and accurately calculated by 3D US. 3D US with SonoAVC was used for the purpose of more accuracy and reproducibility. Inversion mode is most convenient method for counting antral follicles when they are multiple.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Number of follicles &#x0003e;12 mm on day of oocyte retrieval correlated significantly with AFC counted by 3D US rather than 2D US. Studies have been done to compare the accuracy and reliability of AFC and AMH for prediction of low response or for prediction of ovarian hyperstimulation.</p><p>Serum AMH levels have been shown to strongly correlate with the number of antral follicles[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] and have appeared to be cycle independent.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] The ROC curves do not suggest a clearly better predictive ability for AMH than for AFC, and the difference was not statistically significant. This implies that the best poor response predictor to date, AFC,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] has obtained company from a test that may have some crucial advantages.</p><p>This implies that AFC can predict the response of ovary to stimulation and can be used for selection of individual cycle for ovulation induction, but adding AMH also allows to assess the quality of the resultant ova and embryo.</p><p>Broer <italic>et al</italic>. have compared AFC and AMH and have shown that sensitivity and specificity for AMH were 82 and 76%, respectively, and 82 and 80%, respectively, for AFC. Comparison of the summary estimates and ROC curves for AMH and AFC showed no statistical difference in this study. Both AMH and AFC are accurate predictors of excessive response to ovarian hyperstimulation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>Another study by Aflatoonian <italic>et al</italic>. has shown that small AFC and anti-m&#x000fc;llerian hormone have similar predictive accuracy for high ovarian response with area under curve of 0.961 and 0.922, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for prediction of high ovarian response were 89% and 92% for small AFC and 93% and 78% for anti-m&#x000fc;llerian hormone at the cutoff values of &#x02265;16 and &#x02265;34.5 pmol/l, respectively.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>Still one more study compares AMH and AFC for assessment of ovarian response. Number of retrieved oocytes was statistically significant and correlated with D3 AMH, AFC, DhCG AMH, DhCG inhibin B, FSH, and age (<italic>r</italic> = 0.885, 0.874, 0.742, 0.732, &#x02212;0.521, &#x02212;0.385, respectively).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>In a metaanalysis by Broer <italic>et al</italic>., it has been shown that AMH has at least the same level of accuracy and clinical value for the prediction of poor response and non-pregnancy as AFC.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>AMH may provide a more accurate assessment of the follicle pool in young hypergonadotropic patients, especially in the clinically challenging subgroups of patients with elevated FSH and regular menses (i.e., IOF: incipient ovarian failure) and in hypergonadotropic women with cycle disturbances not fulfilling the POF diagnostic criteria (i.e., TOF: transistional ovarian failure).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>AFC and AMH are the most significant predictors of poor response to ovarian stimulation. Both alone or in combination have a similar predictive power. Combination of both tests do not significantly increase the predictive power.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>Comparing AFC and AMH for assessment of ovarian reserve in poor responding ovaries has been done in several studies. But assessment of both as predictor for normal response or for hyperstimulation has been done only in a few. Therefore, the two groups PCO and non-PCO (normal responding ovaries) were selected for this study. The purpose was to decrease the number of tests that a patient undergoing ART, has to take, to decrease the stress as well as financial burden, without compromising with the information gained. Ultrasound is as such done before starting the ovarian stimulation for ART and AFC is a part of it. The study has shown that both AFC and AMH are equally accurate for assessment of ovarian reserve, in PCO as well as in patients with normal ovaries. AFC therefore may be thought of as a single test for assessment of ovarian reserve.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-6"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The results suggest that AFC and AMH both correlate with each other but have independent significance for estimating follicles larger than 12 mm on the day of hCG. But for estimation of ova expected on OPU, the difference of correlation coefficient between AFC and AMH is minimally significant in non-PCO and is not significant in PCO group. As the ultimate end result is ova retrieved on OPU, it can be concluded that for both groups, AFC alone may suffice as a test for estimation of ovarian reserve. This is so because the z values for both non-PCO as well as PCO group is equal to or below the tabulated one-tailed significance value.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-7"><title>ENDNOTE</title><p>
