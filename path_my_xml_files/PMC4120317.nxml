The current standard of care is treatment with biologicals that bind to or inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Biologicals need to be injected into the vitreous cavity of the eye at 4&#x02013;8-week intervals. However, the first treatment convincingly shown to be effective in preventing vision loss (ranibizumab, Lucentis<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) is expensive (&#x000a3;742/dose in the UK<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Another anti-VEGF biological, bevacizumab (Avastin), is licensed to treat cancer and has been used to treat nAMD, using smaller doses that cost much less than ranibizumab. Small non-randomised studies on bevacizumab have reported outcomes that were as good as those achievable with ranibizumab.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Comparative effectiveness randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of ranibizumab versus bevacizumab were therefore needed to provide unbiased estimates of relative efficacy and safety. The UK Inhibition of VEGF in Age-related choroidal Neovascularisation (IVAN) trial<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and the US Comparison of Age-related macular degeneration Treatments Trials (CATT)<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> were among the first such trials to report findings.</p><p>Two-year IVAN results demonstrated that ranibizumab and bevacizumab produced similar improvements in visual function, with no significant difference in arteriothrombotic events or hospital admissions for heart failure, which have previously been linked with anti-VEGF therapy.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> IVAN also compared discontinuous (as-needed) treatment against continuous monthly injections. Continuous and discontinuous treatment produced similar improvements in visual function, although mortality was significantly lower with continuous treatment (p=0.05).</p><p>Given the rising demands for healthcare and limited budgets, it is important to assess cost-effectiveness as well as the clinical effectiveness and safety of medical interventions. Evidence on incremental cost and cost-effectiveness is of particular importance in nAMD, owing to the potential savings and health implications of either reducing treatment frequency or substituting a much cheaper alternative (bevacizumab) for a more expensive drug (ranibizumab). Although ranibizumab costs many times more than bevacizumab, it is important to consider all relevant costs and assess cost-effectiveness to determine whether the more expensive therapy has added health benefits that justify the additional costs or lead to savings that offset the price difference.</p><p>A recent systematic review<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> identified nine economic evaluations of ranibizumab and three of bevacizumab. Seven further studies evaluating ranibizumab<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;16</xref> and two studies evaluating bevacizumab<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> have since been published. Most studies found ranibizumab to be cost-effective versus other treatments, such as pegaptanib. Five studies concluded that bevacizumab was likely to be cost-effective compared with ranibizumab, of which four studies relied on observational data<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> or assumptions about relative efficacy.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> We are unaware of any other RCT-based economic evaluation that has estimated the cost-effectiveness of anti-VEGF treatment for nAMD.</p><p>A key objective of the IVAN trial was to assess the incremental cost and incremental cost-effectiveness of continuous and discontinuous regimens of bevacizumab and ranibizumab in nAMD from the perspective of the UK National Health Service (NHS). The results of these analyses are reported here.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was based on the 2-year results from the IVAN trial (ISRCTN92166560), which provided high-quality data on resource use and outcomes and comprises the only UK trial directly comparing these interventions. Trial design and methods have been described previously<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>; in brief, this was a factorial, multicentre non-inferiority trial in which 610 patients not previously treated for nAMD in their study eyes were randomised to either bevacizumab (1.25&#x02005;mg/dose) or ranibizumab (0.5&#x02005;mg/dose) and to either discontinuous treatment or continuous monthly injections for 2&#x02005;years. Discontinuous treatment comprised an initial course of three monthly injections, followed by further courses of three injections given monthly if prespecified clinical and optical coherence tomography (OCT) retreatment criteria were met. The economic evaluation took a 2-year time horizon to estimate within-trial cost-effectiveness as incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) appeared to be relatively stable over time. Following UK guidelines,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> we took the perspective of the UK NHS, which excludes costs incurred by patients and their families or employers. Detailed methods and additional results will be published as a monograph in <italic>Health Technology Assessment</italic>.</p><p>As IVAN was factorial, it was important to consider the likelihood of interactions, that is, whether the differences in costs and/or quality of life between bevacizumab and ranibizumab differ between treatment regimens. Although no interactions were anticipated for visual acuity,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> large interactions between drug and treatment regimen were expected for costs and cost-effectiveness, as reducing the number of injections would have a proportionately greater effect on drug costs for ranibizumab than for less expensive bevacizumab. Interactions for quality of life or costs were also possible if the number of injections required for discontinuous treatment differed between drugs. We therefore estimated the mean costs and mean QALYs for each of the four treatment combinations and interpreted the results based on four pairwise comparisons:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Continuous ranibizumab versus discontinuous ranibizumab,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Continuous bevacizumab versus discontinuous bevacizumab,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Continuous ranibizumab versus continuous bevacizumab,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Discontinuous ranibizumab versus discontinuous bevacizumab.</p></list-item></list></p><p>We report two forms of economic evaluation. Comparisons between drugs were based on cost-minimisation analysis, which compares costs between treatments that are assumed to have identical health effects.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Cost-minimisation analysis is appropriate only if the difference in cost is so large that no plausible difference in efficacy could cause the more costly treatment to be cost-effective.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> This approach is justified for the comparisons between drugs because the large difference in drug costs was inevitably going to be the main influence on the incremental cost-effectiveness of ranibizumab versus bevacizumab. We therefore prespecified that ranibizumab and bevacizumab would be compared using cost-minimisation analysis unless ranibizumab-treated patients accrued &#x02265;0.05 more EQ-5D QALYs than those receiving bevacizumab. In contrast, we used cost-utility analysis, in which health outcomes are measured in QALYs, to compare continuous and discontinuous treatment, where incremental costs are smaller.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Measurement and valuation of resource use</title><p>Our base case analysis also focused on resource use associated with the study eye or associated with adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs) that were &#x02018;expected&#x02019;, that is, previously linked to anti-VEGF treatment (see online supplementary appendix). Concomitant medications, hospitalisations and ambulatory consultations that were neither associated with the study eye nor attributable to expected AEs or expected SAEs were excluded to avoid including episodes of high healthcare resource use unrelated to treatment (eg, renal failure or cancer), which might otherwise have swamped the main effect of treatment on costs.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>After enrolment, participants were monitored for disease activity on a monthly basis with visual acuity assessments, colour fundus imaging and OCT. Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) was undertaken at specified visits and when OCT was insufficient to reach a decision on disease activity. A prespecified algorithm was used to determine the need for retreatment. Patients allocated to discontinuous treatment began a new course of three monthly injections whenever they met retreatment criteria. However, costing analyses excluded protocol-driven resource use; in particular, we assumed that patients would not require colour fundus photography, OCT or FFA unless this would affect treatment decisions. As such, patients on discontinuous treatment were assumed not to require these investigations at the second or third visit in a course of three injections, when treatment was mandated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014005094F1">figure 1</xref>). Similarly, patients on continuous treatment were assumed to require monitoring consultations only once every 3&#x02005;months, on the grounds that ophthalmologists would want information about disease progression periodically, irrespective of whether treatment decisions are required.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2014005094F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Schematic illustrating the assumptions made about the frequency of injection and monitoring consultations within the costing analysis.

All concomitant medications, contacts with medical professionals and hospitalisations were recorded at each monthly clinic visit. Concomitant medications applied to the study eye or indicated for any expected SAE/AE were valued using list prices.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Costs of other medications, including those applied to the fellow eye, were excluded from the analysis.

<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> These costs were applied to ambulatory consultations that were either related to the eye or that occurred within 30&#x02005;days of an expected SAE/AE.

We assumed that utility changed linearly between consecutive EQ-5D measurements in the absence of SAEs. As linear changes are unlikely for patients with SAEs, we assumed that SAEs and reductions in visual acuity caused a sudden drop in utility on the day of onset, followed by a linear rise as the patient recovered; the rate of this linear rise was estimated using mixed models (see online supplementary appendix).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Linear regression models were used to estimate the effect of drug and treatment regimen on QALYs, drug costs, administration/monitoring costs and medication/medical service use in each 3-month period or &#x02018;quarter&#x02019; (see online supplementary appendix). Interactions between drug and treatment regimen were included in the models for quarters 2&#x02013;8 if they were either statistically significant or were larger than the main effect for drug or for treatment regimen. The analysis of QALYs, drug costs and medication/medical service use in quarters 2&#x02013;8 therefore took account of interactions, while drug and treatment regimen were assumed to have additive effects on administration/monitoring costs.

<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> was used to account for patients withdrawing early from the trial and excludes differences in mortality unrelated to treatment; regression predictions of quarterly costs and QALYs were weighted by the proportion of patients alive at the start of each quarter. Costs and QALYs accrued in year 2 were discounted at 3.5% to allow for time preference (ie, the tendency to prefer benefits sooner and costs later).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Uncertainty around quarterly costs and QALYs was quantified by estimating models separately for 130 non-parametric bootstrap draws on each of 100 data sets generated in multiple imputation to capture the uncertainty around imputed utilities.

By contrast, in the USA, ophthalmologists use bevacizumab freely.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> National guidance (rather than local hospital/clinician policies) is therefore needed in the UK to direct the choice between bevacizumab and ranibizumab. CATT and IVAN provide robust data to guide regulators in this decision, demonstrating that ranibizumab and bevacizumab have comparable effects on vision and similar safety profiles,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> but that (based on the current analysis of IVAN) ranibizumab costs &#x000a3;3.5 million per QALY compared with bevacizumab.</p><p>The base case analysis found that continuous bevacizumab costs &#x000a3;30&#x02005;220 ($47&#x02005;445) per QALY gained compared with discontinuous bevacizumab, suggesting that discontinuous bevacizumab is the most cost-effective strategy evaluated in IVAN if the NHS is willing to pay up to &#x000a3;20&#x02005;000/QALY gained. However, there remains substantial uncertainty around this conclusion and there is a 37% chance that continuous bevacizumab is cost-effective. The finding of non-significantly higher QALYs with continuous treatment contradicts our prior hypothesis that avoiding monthly injections might improve quality of life, although the observed difference could be due to chance. Nevertheless, discontinuous bevacizumab would remain the most cost-effective strategy even if there were no difference in quality of life between treatment regimens. Other considerations may affect the choice of the anti-VEGF delivery model. In particular, as discontinuous treatment requires regular clinical review and access to retinal imaging, it may be more practical to provide treatment every month, with monitoring restricted to specified points in time (eg, 6 or 12&#x02005;months after initiation of therapy). Indeed, the label for the newest anti-VEGF (aflibercept) incorporates a limited clinical monitoring regime.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> The discontinuous treatment regimen evaluated in the IVAN trial was chosen partly to minimise the possibility of disadvantage to participants in these groups and partly to minimise the number of retreatment decisions required. Neither monthly treatment nor treatments given as blocks of three are used widely in routine practice, although following the publication of IVAN,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> there appears to be increased interest in the &#x02018;IVAN regimen&#x02019;. The cost-effectiveness of monthly treatment versus intermittent treatment will therefore vary between treatment centres depending on local costs and clinical practice.</p><p>Unlike previous studies, our analysis is based on high-quality data from an RCT with prospective measurements of costs and quality of life, which was powered to exclude any clinically meaningful difference in visual acuity. It therefore provides unequivocally unbiased estimates of incremental costs and QALYs. Nevertheless, our analysis confirms the findings of previous economic evaluations, namely that ranibizumab is not cost-effective compared with bevacizumab.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> We are also (to the best of our knowledge) the first to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the discontinuous treatment regimen used in IVAN. In addition to following best practice for trial-based economic evaluation, this study includes several novel aspects, such as measuring quality of life after SAEs, excluding chance differences in deaths unrelated to treatment and allowing for the factorial design by including only large or statistically significant interactions.</p><p>The study also estimates the cost of consultations to administer ranibizumab/bevacizumab and monitor outcomes, which could be used in other economic evaluations. Microcosting shows the main drivers of consultation costs and highlighted substantial variation in costs between centres; this variation means that the cost-effectiveness of continuous versus discontinuous bevacizumab (but not ranibizumab vs bevacizumab) will vary between centres. It is important to note that the costs were calculated to assess incremental cost-effectiveness in IVAN and should not be used to set the prices at which hospitals are reimbursed. In particular, they are bottom-up estimates that exclude unpaid overtime and VAT and make assumptions about overheads and proportion of staff-time spent on patient contacts. In most settings, it is likely that the costs to healthcare commissioners will be higher and subject to local negotiations with care providers.</p><p>The base case analysis focused on mortality attributable to study medication and the costs associated with &#x02018;expected&#x02019; SAEs/AEs and excluded other costs. This reduced the risk that chance differences in resource use not associated with study medication could distort our conclusions. However, it also meant that the unanticipated increase in the incidence of other SAEs (eg, gastrointestinal events) with bevacizumab<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> (which comprised the only difference in SAEs between drugs) was not taken into account in the costing analysis. However, sensitivity analyses including the cost of all SAEs/AEs gave the same conclusions. Although hospitals receive a commercial-in-confidence discount off the list price of ranibizumab and the price of bevacizumab varies between hospitals, the conclusions were robust to substantial changes in drug price. The study focused on the period of follow-up in the trial and excluded costs and benefits beyond year 2. However, as incremental costs and QALYs remained reasonably stable over time, this is unlikely to have affected the conclusions. The analysis also uses data only from IVAN, rather than synthesising all available evidence.</p><p>Further research is needed to assess the extent to which the cost-effectiveness findings generalise to other countries with different relative prices and management of nAMD and SAEs/AEs. For example, the incidence of SAEs was substantially lower in IVAN than CATT,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> although sensitivity analyses doubling the impact of SAEs on costs and QALYs suggested that this did not change the conclusions. The costs of the two drugs may vary between centres within the UK as hospitals may use different bevacizumab suppliers or have different discounts on ranibizumab. Nevertheless, as we collected very detailed information on resource use, policymakers in other countries can review these data against their own to examine their similarity and hence the applicability of our findings to their setting. Future work combining data from IVAN with that from other trials, such as CATT,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> may help reduce uncertainty and evaluate the extent to which the results can be generalised. However, we believe that our primary finding of ranibizumab representing very poor value for money compared with bevacizumab does apply throughout the world.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e290" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-005094.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e291" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-005094.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the IVAN participants and the clinicians, nurses and clinic managers who completed the resource use questionnaires.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Collaborators:</bold> The IVAN study investigators are listed online (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aaojournal.org">http://aaojournal.org</ext-link>) in supplementary appendix 1 of ref. <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> SW, CAR, JR, SPH, AJL, SMD, BCR and UC conceived, designed and conducted the IVAN trial.
