NSAIDS are most commonly prescribed drugs for acute and chronic pain or for long-term anti-inflammatory therapy. They inhibit the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme, reduce prostaglandin synthesis (particularly PGE<sub>1</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> that promote inflammation), and other inflammatory agents.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Opioid analgesics block mu receptors in CNS and relieve pain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] However, these medications are not devoid of side effects. In fact, some drugs have been associated with serious adverse drug reactions and dependence liability. Of the total number of patients seeking treatment for pain, 50% are not satisfied with the available pharmacological options.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Developing an ideal pain model to evaluate analgesics in healthy human volunteers is difficult. Various established pain models are used for evaluating analgesic action. The parameters recorded in these models are &#x0201c;pain threshold&#x0201d; (time between the stimulus applied and the feeling of pain sensation) and &#x0201c;pain tolerance&#x0201d; (time interval from feeling of pain to unbearable pain causing withdrawal of hand away from painful stimulus).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested a pain management protocol which states that simple analgesics should be selected first and in case the patient does not respond to that, one can choose any other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and thereafter give a combination of NSAID with opioid analgesic. There is no place for fixed dose combination (FDC) of two NSAIDs in it. Currently FDC of diclofenac with paracetamol are available in Indian market and are widely used for pain relief.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Two drugs having the same mechanism of action are ideally not combined in a FDC, as they serve no added advantage and their adverse drugs reactions are additive, which may increase the potential of developing serious consequences.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] However, limited data show that addition of NSAID to paracetamol may confer additional analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity compared to paracetamol alone.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] The FDC of tramadol hydrochloride 50 mg with paracetamol 375 mg are also in use as the drugs act by different mechanism and synergism is proven.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] This FDC is effective in acute postoperative pain of dental,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] orthopedic and abdominal surgery,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] fibromyalgia,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] low back pain,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] migraine,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] and as add-on therapy for osteoarthritis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] and rheumatoid arthritis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] The efficacy of fixed-dose combination of tramadol with paracetamol in the management of moderate to severe pain has been reported.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare the analgesic activity of fixed dose combination of paracetamol + diclofenac sodium and paracetamol + tramadol on different human pain models in healthy volunteers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A randomized double blind crossover study carried out in the clinical pharmacology unit of Department of Pharmacology after prior approval from Institutional Ethics Committee. The participants were explained the nature, purpose, and risks and benefits involved in the study and a written informed consent obtained.

Human experimental pain models for the evaluation of analgesic efficacy use different algesic stimuli like heat, cold, pressure, ischemia, electricity, etc. for pain production. Mechanical, chemical, thermal, freezing, and ultraviolet A or B radiation are used to study the analgesic effect of NSAID.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] Electrically induced pain models are able to discriminate the effect of diclofenac from placebo. It also differentiates the gender effect in response to ibuprofen.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] In a laser-induced pain model paracetamol shows significant analgesic activity compared to placebo. However, paracetamol is less effective compared to the combined effect of paracetamol plus codeine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, three different pain models are used. The parameter taken to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of study drugs is pain tolerance. The wide difference in the pain tolerance at the baseline, though not statistically significant, can be because of individual variations in pain perception. Results of the cold-water stress test show no statistically significant difference between the efficacies of two groups in both the sessions possibly because of lack of inflammation or hyperalgesia in this model leading to inconsistent and unreliable results.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] A cold-pressure test is known to activate the &#x0201c;diffuse noxious inhibitory control system,&#x0201d; which is a system of descending neuronal pathways arising in the brain stem that exerts negative feed-back control on the incoming activity to the spinal cord.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] Other have also shown inconsistent analgesic effects of several NSAID in the cold-water stress pain model.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>]</p><p>In the radiant heat method, paracetamol with tramadol treatment significantly increased pain tolerance at 2 hours and 3 hours (P 0.028 and 0.055 respectively) compared to that of the paracetamol with diclofenac group. In this model there is rapid skin heating (more than 1&#x000b0;C/s) which activates A-&#x003b4; fibers that evoke pain sensation within 0.4 seconds and is called &#x0201c;first pain.&#x0201d;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Slow heating less than 1&#x000b0;C/s preferentially activates C-fibers to cause &#x0201c;second pain.&#x0201d; It is thought to be due to activation of peripheral opioid receptors and is considered best for evaluation of the opioid analgesics. Radiant heat delivers fast heat so the evaluation of the &#x0201c;second pain&#x0201d; is not possible with this model. Lasers probably stimulate A-&#x003b4; fibers giving a pricking pain followed by C-fiber mediated second pain. Compared to heat pain, the neuronal activation after cold pain is not completely described but it probably involves a mosaic of primary afferent input with a definite involvement of C-fibers.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>]</p><p>Results of the BP cuff inflammation method did not show statistically significant difference between the efficacies of two groups in both the sessions. This is an established method for evaluating inflammatory component of the pain. A FDC of paracetamol with diclofenac sodium has been justified stating that diclofenac sodium adds the anti-inflammatory component to the combination. Our results show that there is no superior efficacy of the FDC of paracetamol with diclofenac in the inflammatory pain model in this study.</p><p>Concerns over the marketing of increasing number of drug combinations by pharmaceutical companies, particularly in the developing countries, have been raised. A variety of NSAID combinations are available, often as over the counter products.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] These FDC are an easy way to sell two drugs when one (or even none) may be needed. These FDC have become the largest selling antiinflammatory/analgesic/antipyretic products[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] and &#x0201c;single&#x0201d; drugs have almost become redundant and &#x0201c;old fashioned.&#x0201d; Combination of two drugs acting by same mechanism is not synergistic. Combining two NSAIDs or NSAID with analgesics like paracetamol does not improve the efficacy of treatment but imposes unnecessary financial burden, increases adverse effects leading to hospitalization, and deteriorate quality of life.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>]</p><p>In conclusion, the FDC of paracetamol with tramadol is more effective than the FDC of paracetamol with diclofenac sodium on the radiant heat model but the cold stress and blood pressure cuff inflation models did not show any difference between the two.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Dr. Hetal Pandya, Department of Medicine, for clinical examination of the volunteers.
