We aimed to observe the extubation process and the recovery characteristics in pediatric patients undergoing tonsillectomy while anesthetized with either high-concentration sevoflurane alone or low-concentration sevoflurane combined with pre-medication of single dose of intravenous dexmedetomidine.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Seventy-five patients (ASA I or II, aged 3&#x02013;7 years) undergoing tonsillectomy were randomized into three equal groups: to receive intravenous saline (Group D0), dexmedetomidine 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg (Group D1), or dexmedetomidine 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg (Group D2) approximately 10&#x000a0;min before anesthesia. Before the end of surgery, sevoflurane were adjusted to 1.5 times, 1.0 time and 0.8 times the minimal effective concentration in groups D<sub>0</sub>, D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub>, respectively. The sevoflurane concentration for each group was maintained for at least 10&#x000a0;min before the tracheal deep-extubation was performed. The extubation event, recovery characteristics and post-op respiratory complications were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All tracheal tubes in three groups were removed successfully during deep anesthesia. Nine patients in Group D<sub>0</sub>, three patients in Group D<sub>1</sub>, and two patients in Group D<sub>2</sub> required oral airway to maintain a patent airway after extubation. The frequency of oral airway usage in groups D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> were significantly lower than that in Group D<sub>0</sub>. The percentages of patients with ED and the requirements of fentanyl in groups D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> were also significantly lower than those in Group D<sub>0</sub>. The time from extubation to spontaneous eye opening in Group D<sub>2</sub> was longer than that in groups D<sub>0</sub> and D<sub>1</sub>. The times of post-anesthesia care unit discharge in groups D<sub>0</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> were longer than that in Group D<sub>1</sub>. No other respiratory complications and vomiting were observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A single dose of intravenous dexmedetomidine as pre-medication in combination with low-concentration sevoflurane at the end of surgery provided safe and smooth deep extubation condition and it also lowered the emergence agitation in sevoflurane-anaesthetized children undergoing tonsillectomy.

Deep tracheal extubation technique has advantages over awake extubation by avoiding some of those complications and it has been safely performed after anesthesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, major concerns of airway complications remain hunting in anesthesiologist&#x02019;s mind, particularly in young children undergoing airway surgeries, and with co-existing obstructive airway diseases and when anesthetized with inhaled volatile agent, such as sevoflurane.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine, a highly selective &#x003b1;-2 adrenergic agonist, is widely employed perioperatively in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and it can reduce the requirement for anesthetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], as shown by a previous study that dexmedetomidine could produce a dose-dependent decrease of sevoflurane in children, from 33 to 60% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Guler et al. have found that a single-dose injection of dexmedetomidine facilitated smooth awake extubation by attenuating the extubation-induced airway-circulatory reflexes in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we hypothesized that dexmedetomidine, combined with a low-concentration sevoflurane would create a smooth deep-extubation condition compared to the high-concentration sevoflurane anesthesia without dexmedetomidine in children undergoing adenotonsillectomy. The emergence characteristics, recovery time and incidence of airway complications were all of interest to be observed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was approved by the Hospital Ethics Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of WenZhou Medical University. After a written informed consent was obtained from the parents, a total of 75 children, aged 3&#x02013;7 years old, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I or II, scheduled to undergo an adenotonsillectomy during the period of May 2016 to July 2016, were enrolled in this observational study (trial registry identifier, ChiCTR-IOR-16008423). Patients with suspected difficult airway, current upper respiratory infections, asthma, mental diseases, or other congenital and neurological diseases were excluded from the study.</p><p>All patients were required to follow the ASA fasting guideline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In the morning on the day of surgery, an intravenous (IV) line was placed in the ward, and patients were sent to a pre-anesthesia holding room approximately 20&#x000a0;min before surgery in the presence of one parent. Prior to any pre-medication, noninvasive blood pressure, ECG, oxygen saturation (SPO<sub>2</sub>) and heart rate were measured as baseline and then, were recorded continuously. Subjects were randomly allocated to one of three groups (Group D<sub>1</sub>, Group D<sub>2</sub> and Group D<sub>0</sub>, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;25 per group) by a computer-generated table of random numbers. Prior to anesthesia induction, patients in Group D<sub>1</sub> and Group D<sub>2</sub> received IV infusion of dexmedetomidine (4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL normal saline) at 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg and 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg over 10&#x000a0;min respectively. Patients in Group D<sub>0</sub> received saline infusion over 10&#x000a0;min.</p><p>Upon the completion of premed infusion, the patients were transferred to the operating room. The monitoring of vital signs were initiated and then, continued after. Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane (8%) in oxygen at 5&#x000a0;L/min. When the pupils were deemed to be small and central, the trachea intubation was performed without muscle relaxants. Respiratory rate, tidal volume, end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure (ETCO<sub>2</sub>), and minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane were monitored. Patients who received rocuronium (0.6&#x000a0;mg/kg) for failed intubation during the first 30&#x000a0;s attempt, or who were persistently coughing after tracheal intubation were excluded from the study. Prior to the surgical incision, fentanyl (0.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg), ondansetron hydrochloride (0.1&#x000a0;mg/kg) and dexamethasone (0.2&#x000a0;mg/kg) were administrated to all children, and 0.2% ropivacaine (0.25&#x000a0;mg/kg) with 1:200 000 epinephrine was injected locally to the tonsil bed to provide additional postoperative analgesia when surgery was finished. An adequate depth of anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, and the patients were allowed breathing spontaneously throughout. Before the end of surgery, sevoflurane were set to 1.5, 1.0 and 0.8 MAC in groups D<sub>0</sub>, D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub>, respectively, and were maintained at the same level for at least 10&#x000a0;min to achieve equilibration between the alveolar and brain. The concentration of sevoflurane for group D<sub>0</sub> was chosen based on the precious study in which sevoflurane at 1.5 MAC may provide a satisfactory deep extubation condition in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The concentrations of sevoflurane for group D<sub>1</sub> and group D<sub>2</sub> were determined based on the study which was conducted in children, 1.0&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg dexmedetomidine followed by a continuous infusion of 0.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/h reduced ED50TI (50% excellent tracheal intubation conditions) of sevoflurane by 33%, and 2.0&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg dexmedetomidine followed by a continuous infusion of 1.0&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/h reduced ED50TI of sevoflurane by 60% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and based on the results of our pilot study.</p><p>Adequate spontaneous respiration was defined as a normal ETCO<sub>2</sub> waveform and an ETCO<sub>2</sub> concentration less than 6.0 kPa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The ventilation was assisted manually when ETCO<sub>2</sub> concentration was over 7.2 kPa.</p><p>After surgery, patient was positioned on his or her lateral side, the oropharynx was gently suctioned, and the tracheal tube cuff was deflated. Once a stable spontaneous respiratory pattern was confirmed by ETCO<sub>2</sub> monitoring, the endotracheal tube was removed gently and quickly. Sevoflurane was discontinued and oxygen (8&#x000a0;L/min) was administered via a facemask immediately after extubation. An oral airway was placed only if the patient had signs of obstructed airway. In addition, propofol 2&#x000a0;mg/kg and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) would be used if patients developed breath holding or laryngospasm. Smooth tracheal extubation was defined as no gross purposeful muscular movement, such as coughing, breath holding or laryngospasm within 1&#x000a0;min immediately after tracheal tube removal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Quality of extubation was assessed by using a 5 point rating scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] (Extubation Quality Score): 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;no coughing; 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;minimal coughing (1 or 2 times); 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;moderate coughing (3 or 4 times); 4&#x02009;=&#x02009;severe coughing (5&#x02013;10 times) and straining; and 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;poor extubation, very uncomfortable (laryngospasm and coughing&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;10 times). A research observer who was blinded to the groups and the drugs which the patient received was assigned to evaluate the quality of extubation and the respiratory complications (breathe holding, laryngospasm, bronchospasm and hypoxemia) and comply the data. Respiratory and hemodynamic profiles were continuously monitored throughout the procedure and until 5&#x000a0;min after extubation. Anesthesia time (time from sevoflurane induction to sevoflurane discontinuation) and surgery time were registered. The requirement of oral airway and airway support were both noted.</p><p>Patients were transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) positioning on their lateral side when a patent airway and adequate spontaneous ventilation were assured after extubation. The adequacy of the airway was assessed by the criteria of SpO<sub>2</sub>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;97% with 100% oxygen, clear breath sounds and normal chest wall movement. The pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium scale (PAED) was used to diagnose the emergence agitation (EA) in the PACU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. EA was defined to a total score&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;10. AS a rescue analgesic, fentanyl (0.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg) was administrated to the children who had EA. Patients were discharged from the PACU when they had an Aldrete score of 9&#x02013;10, present of being calm, no pain and nausea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. PAED score and the incidence of emergence agitation, postoperative vomiting, any respiratory complications and the fentainyl administration were recorded. The recovery time (from extubation to spontaneous eye opening) and the actual time to discharge from PACU were both noted.</p><p>Fan reported that the incidence of smooth extubation was 88% in adult patients receiving 1.0 MAC sevoflurane combined with dexmedetomidine 0.7&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A power analysis performed before the initiation of our study suggested that a sample size of 24 patients for each group should be adequate to detect a 70% smooth extubation at the 0.05 level with a power of 0.8.</p><p>The results were expressed in terms of [mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;standard deviation (SD), n (%)] unless otherwise noted.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study results showed that a single intravenous injection of dexmedetomidine (1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg or 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg) as pre-medication allowed safe and smooth tracheal extubation in children who were undergoing tonsillectomy and anesthetized with low concentrations of sevoflurane, and it also effectively prevented emergence agitation from anesthesia. And dexmedetomidine at 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg in combination with sevoflurane 1.0 MAC did not delay discharge time from anesthesia.</p><p>Airway surgery in children, particularly tonsillectomy posts a higher airway complications perioperatively which frequently occurs following tracheal extubation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. There has been ongoing debate regarding the tracheal extubation strategies. Awake extubation technique may increase the risk of complications, such as tonsillar hemorrhage, over deep extubation, but, several other studies did not find any differences of the perioperative respiratory complications between two approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, patients who experience the deep extubation will have increased overall comfort as opposed to strenuous coughing and gagging over the tube, less risk of hemodynamic swings, less concern of tonsil bleeding and less cough after extubation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In addition, deep extubation could improve recovery, and prevent wound dehiscence and bronchial spasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. While an extremely unpleasant experience of awake extubation may increase the incidence of postoperative emergence agitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], which has untoward impact on children in their early recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is a selective &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist. Intravenous dexmedetomidine completely blocked histamine-induced bronchoconstriction in dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Dexmedetomidine might benefical to decrease airway reacitivity. Fan et al. found that, after intravenous injection of dexmedetomidine at 0.7&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg 10&#x000a0;min before the end of surgery, adjunctive sevoflurane could ensure deep extubation without complications during spontaneous breathing in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Some clinicians have used dexmedetomidine in combination with propofol to achieve the adequate anesthesia plane for deep extubation in children after airway reconstruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The purpose of our study was to find out whether dexmedetomidine in combination with low sevoflurane was able to facilitate deep extubation in children undergoing tonsillectomy.</p><p>For inhalation anesthesia, a certain concentration of inhaled anesthetic agent is required to meet the criteria of deep extubation. Studies have shown that in the absence of analgesic drugs, sevoflurane at 1.5 MAC may provide a satisfactory deep extubation condition in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The dose of sevoflurane required could be significantly lowered if dexmedetomidine was given as a pre-medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. He et al. found that a single injection of dexmedetomidine at 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg before anesthesia induction, then followed by continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine at 0.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/h could reduce ED<sub>50</sub>TI of sevoflurane by 33%, and a single injection of dexmedetomidine at 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg before anesthesia induction followed by continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine at 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg<sup>/</sup>h reduced ED<sub>50</sub>TI of sevoflurane by 66%, showing that dexmedetomidine played a role in a dose-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The distribution half-life of dexmedetomidine was 3.2-5.5&#x000a0;min, and the elimination half-life of dexmedetomidine is 2&#x000a0;h in children. Evidence showed that dexmedetomidine at 0.4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg before anesthesia induction could assist a minor ophthalmological clinic surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. An uncomplicated tonsillectomy is a common short-time surgery in children and may be completed within 30&#x000a0;min. In this study, intravenous saline, dexmedetomidine 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg and dexmedetomidine 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg were given prior to anesthesia induction in group D<sub>0</sub>, D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> respectively. A smooth extubation was observed in all of the three groups even a lower sevoflurane was used in group D1 (MAC 1.0) and group D<sub>2</sub> (MAC 0.8) compared to the sevoflurane-only D<sub>0</sub> group (MAC 1.5). Moderate to severe cough was not observed, too. Our results indicated that Dexmedetomidine can facilitate deep extubation process with less inhaled agent required.</p><p>Emergence agitation after general anesthesia with sevoflurane is another major concern in children undergoing ENT surgery, and the causes are multi-factor directed. Among those, a brief exposure of sevoflurane anesthesia is one of the major contributors. The incidence of emergence agitation is high (up to 80%) depending on the definitions and methods of evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Deep extubation technique has been conducted by some investigators, aiming to reduce emergence agitation after sevoflurane anesthesia. However, the results from a few other studies showed that the incidence of emergence agitation in deep extubation was similar to that after awake extubation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It has been known that preoperative anxiety was closely related to the increased incidence of postoperative emergence agitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Theoretically, anti-anxiety pre-medication would help to reduce the incidence of post-operative agitation and delirium. DEX is widely used in children as pre-medication to alleviate preoperative anxiety and nervousness, to optimize anesthesia induction by sevoflurane, and to improve postoperative recovery after anesthesia. Yao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] confirmed that intranasal dexmedetomidine at 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg relieved the preoperative anxiety and decreased postoperative agitation. Bhadla et al. reported that a bolus injection of dexmedetomidine at 0.4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg before surgery could significantly lower the incidence of emergence agitation after ophthalmological minor clinic surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Our results showed that patients pre-medicated with a single intravenous dexmedetomidine at 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg in Group D<sub>1</sub> and dexmedetomidine at 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg in Group D<sub>2</sub> had significantly lower incidence of postoperative emergence agitation compared to patients in group D<sub>0</sub>. Thus, the data suggest that preoperative dexmedetomidine administration do reduce postoperative emergence agitation in a wide dosing range.</p><p>The sedation effect of dexmedetomidine was dose dependent. The higher the dose of dexmedetomidine goes, the better the sedation will be, but the concern is that a high dose of dexmedetomidine may prolong the postoperative recovery time. In addition, sevoflurane concentration is also related to recovery time after anesthesia. In the present study, the median recovery time was 23.6&#x000a0;min in Group D<sub>0</sub>, which was comparable to the reported by Valley et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The time in Group D<sub>1</sub> was 19.8&#x000a0;min, which was a rapid awakening, whereas the time in Group D<sub>2</sub> was much longer (27.5&#x000a0;min) than in Group D0 and Group D1. The difference might be due to the different concentrations of sevoflurane and different doses of dexmedetomidine pre-medication between the groups. The discharge time in patients from Group D<sub>0</sub>, and D<sub>2</sub> was comparable, but much longer than in Group D<sub>1</sub> patients. The presumptive explanation would be that patients in group D<sub>0</sub> received additional fentanyl for treatment of emergence agitation and patients in group D<sub>2</sub> had higher dose of dexmedetomidine (2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg).</p><p>The potential complications during deep extubation include aspiration, airway obstruction, oxygen desaturation, and airway spasm. In this study, the absence of airway responsiveness and the continuation of regular and spontaneous respiration after laryngopharyngeal suction and the deflation of the endotracheal tube cuff were used to determine whether patients were ready for deep extubation. The recorded respiratory frequency, tidal volume, and ETCO<sub>2</sub> prior to extubation were comparable among groups, which was consistent with the perception of dexmedetomidine having minimal effect on respiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Dexmedetomidine has a very safe therapeutic window with respect to respiratory depression, even if dexmedetomidine at a high dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, 36% of children in Group D<sub>0</sub> required an oral airway after extubation, and this rate was significantly higher than patients in groups D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub>, which may be related to muscle relaxation induced by a high concentration of sevoflurane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>Rapid bolus i.v. administration of dexmedetomidine has possible hemodynamic side effect, it may alter the hemodynamics, for example, by slowing heart rate and modifying blood pressure, which are potential disadvantages of dexmedetomidine. However, these adverse effects can be minimized by slow IV infusion of dexmedetomidine over 10&#x000a0;min. Our results showed that the hemodynamics remained stable during extubation in the three groups.</p><p>One of the limitations for this study was that the plasma concentration of dexmedetomidine was not monitored during anesthesia. The correlation between the length and depth of sedation and the hemodynamic changes of dexmedetomidine in blood could not be analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In children undergoing tonsillectomy, single intravenous dexmedetomidine pre-medication at 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg or 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg could facilitate deep extubation in the presence of inhaled low-concentration sevoflurane, which also reduces the incidence of emergence agitation. Dexmedetomidine at 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg pre-medication did not prolong postoperative recovery time.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ASA</term><def><p>American society of anesthesiologists</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CPAP</term><def><p>Continuous positive airway pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EA</term><def><p>emergence agitation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ED<sub>50</sub>TI</term><def><p>50% excellent tracheal intubation conditions</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ETCO2</term><def><p>End-tidal carbon dioxide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MAC</term><def><p>Minimum alveolar concentration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PACU</term><def><p>Post-anesthesia care unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAED</term><def><p>Pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SPO<sub>2</sub></term><def><p>oxygen saturation.</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>The authors thank all the children and their families who participated in this study, thank the team of anesthesiologists, surgeons, and anesthesia assistants at our hospital (The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of WenZhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China) for help and cooperation.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This study was partly funded by Clinical Research Fundation of Zhejiang Medical Association: 2015ZYC-A29, Wenzhou science and Technology Bureau: Y20160379, Health and Family Planning Commission of Zhejiang Province: 2016KYA142.
