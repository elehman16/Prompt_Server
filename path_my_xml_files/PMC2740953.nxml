The study population consisted of 284 patients aged between 41 and 86 years (185 males, 122 females, mean age 69.4, standard deviation [SD] 8.3 years). All subjects gave formal consent and the study was approved by the Hospital Ethics Committee. Study subjects were categorized into two groups. The study group was defined as group A. This group was made up of 222 patients aged between 41 and 86 years (149 males, 96 females, mean age 69.2, SD 8.6 years) referred between January and December 2006 to the Pulmonary Rehabilitation Unit of the Istituti Clinici di Perfezionamento of Milan, all undergoing a six-week PR program. The study group included patients with COPD and was divided in four subgroups according to the Global Initiative for chronic Lung Disease (GOLD) stages, based on forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) values;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-copd-4-315">1</xref> group 1 comprised patients with FEV<sub>1</sub> not lower than 80%, group 2 patients with FEV<sub>1</sub> between 80% and 50%, group 3 between 50% and 30%, and group 4 patients with FEV<sub>1</sub> values lower than 30%.</p><p>The control group was defined as group B, consisting of 62 patients aged between 43 and 81 years (36 males, 26 females, mean age 70.3, SD 7.6 years) treated only with pharmacological therapy without any kind of PR. This group included patients for whom PR was planned in subsequent months. They were asked to repeat the 6MWT after six weeks so to have the same time-interval as the study group. In both study and control groups the drug treatment by bronchodilators and, when needed, inhaled corticosteroids was adjusted to optimal dosage and inhalation technique.</p></sec><sec><title>Pulmonary rehabilitation</title><p>The program was conducted following a schedule of 12 visits in a six-week period in a day hospital setting. Subjects followed an exercise program using either a cycle ergometer or treadmill, according to the patient&#x02019;s capacity, for 30 minutes; upper-limb and trunk exercise training, with warm-up and limbering exercises focusing on arm, shoulder and trunk muscle groups for 30 minutes; and respiratory muscle training done by low pressure peak expiratory pressure (PEP) using a bottle at 6&#x02013;8 cm H<sub>2</sub>O with a 80-cm long, 1-cm wide tube, again for 30 minutes. In addition, patients attended a standard COPD education course, and were taught how to perform muscle exercises and respiratory training every day at home for the entire duration of the program.</p></sec><sec><title>Six-minute walk test</title><p>The 6MWT was conducted according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-copd-4-315">8</xref> and supervised by qualified technicians, who were not told which group each patient belonged to. In brief, each patient was instructed to walk at his or her own pace along a straight, flat 27 m hospital corridor marked at both extremities. Heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and Borg score (based on an exertion scale where 0 = no exertion and 10 = very severe exertion) were measured at the start (0 min) and at the end (six minutes) of the walk test. Patients were asked to cover as much ground as possible in six minutes but were allowed to stop if they showed symptoms of dyspnea or leg pain. The distance in meters was recorded at the end of the six minutes. The 6MWT was performed immediately before and after PR in the study group and with the same time interval (six weeks) in the control group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The effectiveness of PR in inducing an improvement of at least 54 m with the 6MWT was analyzed by the NNT, which is a treatment-specific measurement and demonstrates the difference between treatment and control in achieving a particular outcome. According to its original formulation,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-copd-4-315">12</xref> NNT is calculated as the inverse of the absolute risk reduction (ARR), where ARR = control event rate &#x02212; experimental event rate. NNT value and confidence intervals (CI) for the overall group of patients undergoing PR and for single subgroups defined by COPD severity was analyzed using GraphPad Prism (Graph Pad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).</p><p>The rate of patients obtaining the 54-m increase in the different groups was compared by the chi-squared test, setting the significance at p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-copd-4-315">Table 1</xref> reports the main characteristics of patients at baseline. Considering all patients of group A, 142 out of 222 (64%) had an increase of at least 54 m in the 6MWT following PR. In group B, 8 out of 62 patients (12.9%) had an increase of 54 m in the 6MWT after the same time interval with no PR. This difference was significant (p &#x0003c; 0.001) with the chi-squared test. In the study subjects, 36% did not achieve the significant increase, compared to 87.1% of the control subjects. The absolute risk reduction was 47.5% (95% CI: 37.1% to 57.9%). The NNT obtained was 2 (95% CI: 1.6 to 2.5).</p><p>The subgroups of patients in group A were formed as follows: group in GOLD stage 1, 37 patients (24 males, 13females, mean age 64.6 &#x000b1; 9.8 years, range 41 to 83 years); group in GOLD stage 2, 95 patients (61 males, 34 females, mean age 72.7 &#x000b1; 8 years, range 41 to 86 years); group in GOLD stage 3, 47 patients (29 males, 18 females, mean age 67.6 &#x000b1; 6.6. years, range 57 to 82 years); group in GOLD stage 4, 43 patients (27 males, 16 females, mean age 68 &#x000b1; 6.9 years, range 58 to 86). There were no significant differences in the distribution of males and females in the different groups. <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-copd-4-315">Table 2</xref> shows the results of the 6MWT and the NNT values in the subgroups of patients. The difference in the number of patients obtaining a 54-m increase versus control group was nonsignificant for group 1, but significant for groups 2, 3, and 4, with a p value &#x0003c; 0.001 in each group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The impairment of exercise capacity in patients with COPD is a central issue in the natural history of this disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-copd-4-315">1</xref> A recent study reported that in more severe GOLD stages of COPD there is an higher decrease in exercise capacity than in FEV<sub>1</sub> predicted values,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-copd-4-315">13</xref> which however remains the parameter classifying the severity of COPD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-copd-4-315">1</xref> The six-minute walk distance (6MWD) is an accepted method to measure exercise capacity,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-copd-4-315">8</xref> which was also recently validated by mathematical models.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-copd-4-315">5</xref> By such test, an increase of 54 m from the baseline value is considered a significant improvement in physical capacity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-copd-4-315">11</xref></p><p>PR is a valuable treatment for COPD patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-copd-4-315">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-copd-4-315">15</xref> The evidence-based clinical practice guidelines by the Joint Commission of the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and the American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation (AACVPR) stated 25 evidence-based recommendations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-copd-4-315">9</xref> These statements include the capacity of PR to improve the symptoms of dyspnea (grade1A) and the health-related quality of life (grade 1A), but no statement concerns the improvement of physical capacity. In fact, studies on this particular issue reported different observations: in 1999 a meta-analysis detected a significant improvement in the 6MWD after PR, corresponding to a mean value of 49 m;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-copd-4-315">16</xref> in a more recent Cochrane systematic review, which included 16trials, a very similar but not significant increase of 48m was found. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-copd-4-315">17</xref> In any case, both values were below the threshold of clinical significance, ie, the 54 m increase.</p><p>In the present study, considering the overall population of patients undergoing PR, the mean distances walked before and after PR were 296.8 m and 384.7 m, respectively, corresponding to a mean increase of 87.9 m, which is above the threshold of clinical significance. The lesser heterogeneity of our patients in respect to the meta-analyses, which included different studies, may account for such a finding. Analyzing the difference according to COPD severity, stage 1 of disease had the lower increase (63 m), while the increase in walked distance was 68.5 m for stage 2, 89.1m for stage 3, and 132 m for stage 4. It has been reported that females have a higher 6MWD,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-copd-4-315">5</xref> which could possibly influence the results of global analyses, but in our groups there were no significant differences in the distribution of females in the different groups. However, the aim of the study was to evaluate by NNT the effectiveness of PR in improving the physical capacity in COPD patients. This statistical analysis was introduced in 1988 as a measure able to assess more precisely the consequences of a medical treatment,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-copd-4-315">12</xref> and was initially greeted with enthusiasm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-copd-4-315">18</xref> but was later the object of some criticism.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-copd-4-315">19</xref> In particular, when measuring the effectiveness of interventions targeting chronic diseases, NNT varies over time and thus does not capture the crucial time component.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-copd-4-315">19</xref> For example, in analyzing the effectiveness of finasteride for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, the NNT for avoiding prostate-related surgery was 31 (21 to 61) over 24 months but was 18 (14 to 27) over 48 months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-copd-4-315">20</xref></p><p>In our study the time bias was not present as the NNT was calculated after the first cycle of PR, the only point when the comparison with baseline values can be made. Subsequent cycles generally maintain improved exercise capacity,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-copd-4-315">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-copd-4-315">23</xref> but further increases over the threshold of clinical significance are not expected.</p><p>Some studies have used the NNT to evaluate the outcome of pulmonary rehabilitation in COPD patients: a recent meta-analysis of six trials which included 219 patients undergoing PR after exacerbations of COPD found a NNT of 3 in reducing subsequent hospital admissions and of 6 in reducing mortality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-copd-4-315">24</xref> In a Canadian study, NNT was calculated by focusing on the quality of life assessed by the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) and ranged from 2.5 for mastery to 4.4 for fatigue.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-copd-4-315">25</xref> Regarding the 6MWT, the improvement is generally analyzed calculating the difference in the mean distance walked<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-copd-4-315">17</xref> and only one study, to the best of our knowledge, analyzed the NNT.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-copd-4-315">26</xref> This particular study evaluated 34 patients with stable COPD receiving a PR program for six months versus 28 patients receiving usual medical care, and found a NNT of 3. The NNT obtained in the present study, including 222 patients versus 62 controls, was 2. The different time intervals in the two studies &#x02013; six months versus six weeks &#x02013; is likely to account for the difference, taking into consideration that, in the study by Troosters and colleagues,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-copd-4-315">26</xref> the most intense training was done in the first three months.</p><p>Dividing the patients into the GOLD severity stages, we found a different result in patients with initial stage &#x02013; NNT corresponding to 8 &#x02013; compared to patients with advances stages, in whom the NNT was 2. We did not include the GOLD stage 0 in our analysis, which is considered in the initial classification of severity, but not in the last update of GOLD guidelines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-copd-4-315">27</xref> The significance of the observation is that in mild stage of COPD, with a FEV<sub>1</sub> value not lower than 80% of predicted, eight patients must be treated by PR to have one patient with a significant increase of exercise capacity. This confirms the current indication to apply PR in COPD patients starting from the GOLD stage 2.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-copd-4-315">9</xref></p><p>In conclusion, this study found that a PR program with physical training, upper-limb and trunk exercise training, and respiratory muscle training is highly effective in improving the exercise capacity of patients with COPD, as demonstrated by a NNT of 2.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosures</bold></p><p>This trial is registered at Eudract; protocol number ICP001.
