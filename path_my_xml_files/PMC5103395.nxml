Healthy child development up to the age of 5&#x000a0;years provides the basis for a prosperous and sustainable society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The material and psychosocial context of poverty adversely affects multiple aspects of development in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and developmental deficits associated with poverty start before birth and can be detected as early as infancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The best available knowledge on the basic principles of neuroscience indicate that providing supportive conditions for early childhood development is more effective and less costly than attempting to address the consequences of early adversity later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Indeed, early life experiences from birth to school entry are essential to build strong neurodevelopmental trajectories crucial for long-term social and occupational functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Specifically, the first 5&#x000a0;years of life are important for the development of executive functions (EFs). EFs are often conceived as higher-order cognitive control processes, which consist of three inter-related functions. The first, working memory, is involved in &#x0201c;holding information in mind and working with it&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], which is important for everything from understanding language to mental mathematics and reasoning. Central to working memory is the activation of information via attention. Inhibition, by contrast, involves &#x0201c;inhibiting (or suppressing) attention [or action] to other things in the environment (distracters) so you can stay focused on what you want&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Lastly, cognitive flexibility involves an ability &#x0201c;to shift mental sets or see something from different perspectives&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Together, these cognitive control processes enable us to perform the full range of everyday and extra-ordinary tasks that are essential for adaptive human function.</p><p>The cognitive control provided by EFs is essential for the behavioural, emotional and social controls that contribute to positive life trajectories. That is, ample research has indicated a link between EFs and school readiness, academic success, social and emotional development, criminality and employment success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Moreover, in the largest prospective study of self-regulation conducted thus far conducted so far (1000 children who were followed from birth to age 32), it was reported that childhood self-control (at ages 3 to 11) predicted better physical health, less substance dependence, higher personal finances and less criminal offending outcomes in adulthood, following a gradient of self-regulation, even after adjusting the analysis for IQ, sex, and social class while growing up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. More than fixed trajectories of self-regulatory development, this study also demonstrated the malleability of self-regulation over time, as well as improved trajectories when this occurred.</p><p>Early EFs are also considered the &#x0201c;<italic>biological foundation for school readiness&#x0201d;</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and a better predictor of academic achievement than IQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It has been shown that EF skills at the age of 4&#x000a0;years provided children with an immediate advantage in the school learning environment and a head start in maths and reading that was maintained through to the age of 7&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Fitzpatrick et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] reported that early working memory (at the age of 29 and 41&#x000a0;months) predicted later (at 74&#x000a0;months of age) classroom engagement, number knowledge and receptive vocabulary, independent of sex, non-verbal intellectual skills and socio-economic status.</p><p>Cognitive development is affected by several socio-economic and environmental factors. Disadvantaged children usually experience less cognitive stimulation and enrichment, watch more television, attend lower quality childcare, and have poorer diets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These children may also be exposed to stressful environments and receive less warmth, stability and support from their families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The cumulative effect of these risk factors during a sensitive period of brain expansion and growth can compromise neurocognitive development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Indeed, the educational and cognitive differences associated with low socioeconomic status begin early in life and tend to persist throughout life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For example, Lipina et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] reported that infants (aged 6 to 14&#x000a0;months) from disadvantaged families had, on average, less developed working memory and inhibitory control abilities compared to those from non-disadvantaged families. Evans and Schamberg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] also reported a prospective association between the duration of childhood poverty and adult working memory, an association that appeared to be explained in part by elevated chronic stress during childhood. Therefore, targeting EF, in early childhood in order to improve school readiness and later academic success seems crucial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and may constitute an important tool to reduce the academic achievement gap between more and less-advantaged children.</p><p>In a 2011 review, Diamond and Lee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] identified six types of interventions that successfully improve EFs in children aged 4 to 12&#x000a0;years: computerised training; a hybrid of computer and noncomputer games; classroom curricula; adds-ons to classroom curricula; aerobic exercise and martial arts and mindfulness practices. These interventions have revealed that: (i) children with lower EF (including those from socially disadvantaged backgrounds) benefit the most from any EF intervention; (ii) EF training in one area seems to transfer to other EFs, but this transfer is limited; and (iii) executive demands need to be repeated and continually incremented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. All of these interventions have two important features in common: first, &#x0201c;<italic>the programs tend to reduce stress in the classroom, cultivate pride, joy and self-confidence, and foster social bonding</italic>&#x0201d;; and second, &#x0201c;<italic>they do not expect children to sit still for long&#x02014;such expectations are not developmentally appropriate, increase teacher-student tensions, and lead some children to dread school and/or to be wrongly labels as having Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</italic>&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Although these types of interventions have been successful from 4&#x000a0;years of age, recent evidence recommends that they should start even earlier than the pre-school period&#x02014;i.e. between 1 and 2&#x000a0;years of age&#x02014;to attenuate the impact of disadvantage on the children&#x02019;s cognitive development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. New ideas and new approaches are therefore necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>It has been long recognised that PA is positively associated with cognitive performance in school-aged children (aged 4 to 18&#x000a0;years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and across the lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In infants, passive cycling for 2&#x000a0;months during the first year of life resulted in positive motor (body control balance, grasping), adaptive (hand&#x02013;eye coordination) and language gains (communication by facial expression, sounds, vocalizations, and babble) compared to controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Early childhood is also a critical period to establish long-term sedentary and physical activity (PA) behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Sedentary behaviour (SB) refers to waking activities that do not increase energy expenditure substantially above the resting level, while in a sitting or lying position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. It has been suggested that SB should be explicitly measured either for surveillance purposes or research studies instead of being defined as lack of PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] as sedentariness and PA are two independent and not mutually exclusive behaviours with potentially different effects on development and health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>Studies assessing PA and SB levels in infants and toddlers are scarce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], particularly using objective measures of PA and SB. Recently, Cardon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] summarised the literature and reported that PA rates are low, infants and toddlers spend a large proportion of their time being sedentary. Television viewing is already common at these ages. For example, in the US it is estimated that 17&#x000a0;% of 0&#x02013;11 month old and 48&#x000a0;% of 12&#x02013;23 months old children exceed the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines (&#x0003c;2&#x000a0;h/day) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and that 40&#x000a0;% of 3-months old babies and 90&#x000a0;% of 2&#x000a0;years old toddlers watch TV regularly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Some studies have shown that PA levels of children aged 0 to 5&#x000a0;years are typically low and SB high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In a meta-analysis of objectively measured PA, Bornesteins et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] reported that pre-schoolers spend on average only 5.5&#x000a0;% of their waking time in moderate-to vigorous-intensity PA. Australian pre-school children also are characterized as highly inactive, with only 5&#x000a0;% meeting the current national recommendations of 3&#x000a0;h/day of PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. ECEC settings may be extremely inactive and sedentary environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] with children spending only 15&#x000a0;% of their childcare day engaged in PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and up to 80&#x000a0;% of their day in sedentary activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. This suggests that young children may not be provided with the opportunity to move in ways that are natural and developmentally appropriate even at ECEC centres. This is particularly concerning, given that several studies have reported beneficial associations between PA and several health indicators and developmental aspects in early childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and also the deleterious health effects of excessive SB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p>High levels of SB (particularly screen time) during early childhood have shown to be associated with higher adiposity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], higher blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], less bone accrual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], attention problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] language development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], psychosocial health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] and cognitive development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. However, a recent systematic review showed that different types of SB may have different associations with cognitive development during early childhood: reading/being read to was positively associated with cognitive development in contrast to screen-based activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Moreover, a longitudinal study has documented that the time spent watching television under the age of five was negatively related to cognitive development, short-term memory and academic achievement 1 to 3&#x000a0;years later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p><p>Evidence suggests that there are several neurological pathways that may explain the adverse links between sitting and cognitive development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. These include pathways involving the birth of new neurons (neurogenesis) that occurs mainly in the hippocampus, a critical area in the brain for learning and memory processes. Prolonged sitting may promote increased activation of stress systems through its rapid effect on metabolic and inflammatory pathways, and chronic stress activation may slow the rate of neurogenesis. Sitting may also negatively affect synaptic plasticity (creation of new or strengthening of existing synaptic connections during learning) through pathways involving insulin and adipose-driven leptin. Additionally, Growth Factors (BDNF, VEGF, IGF-1) play multiple roles in the survival and maturation of new neurons, which are critical for neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity and angiogenesis (growth of new blood vessels); over-abundance of insulin caused by prolonged sitting may suppress systemic IGF-1 signaling that promotes neuronal growth and repair. Since insulin-sensitivity is disrupted shortly after breaking up prolonged sitting, IGF-1 signaling may also be affected. It is known that PA improves cerebral blood flow due to increases in artery diameter, the sprouting of new capillaries from existing vessels, and the bioavailability of endogenous nitric oxide. It has been hypothesized that prolonged sitting decreases nitric oxide and may promote endothelium dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Despite this evidence, the influence of PA and SB on cognitive development in toddlers remains poorly understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p>In this context, and in an attempt to respond to recent calls on innovative approaches and fresh thinking on how to improve cognitive development in disadvantaged children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], the primary aim of this study is to assess the effects of reducing sitting time during ECEC on cognitive development, in a cluster randomised controlled trial with toddlers from low socio-economic families. It is hypothesized that at 12-month follow-up, toddlers in centres allocated to the intervention group will have improved their cognitive development by 0.5 SD more than toddlers in ECEC centres randomly allocated to the control group. The secondary aims are to examine the effects of reducing sitting time on toddler&#x02019;s cardiovascular health and bone density.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>We will implement a 12-months 2-arm parallel group cluster randomised controlled trial. Cluster randomization was chosen for practical reasons and to prevent contamination. The selection of the ECEC services (clusters) will be based on the ECEC&#x02019; postcode using the Australian Socio-economic Indexes for Areas 2011 (SEIFA-Index of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. We will consider the centres belonging in the first and second quartile of this Index (extreme-low and moderate-low socio-economic status) in the Illawarra Region, NSW, Australia. Eight services will be randomly allocated to the intervention group and eight to the control group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study context</title><p>Early childhood education and care for toddlers is not compulsory in Australia. Australian children in their toddler years are enrolled in Child Care by their families&#x02019; choice. In Australia, 22.2&#x000a0;% of children aged 0&#x02013;1&#x000a0;year and 54.1&#x000a0;% of children aged 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;years attend formal care at least once a week (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.abs.gov.au">http://www.abs.gov.au</ext-link>).</p><p>There are four types of formal care in Australia being Long Day Care, Occasional Care, Family Day Care and In Home Care; these services must be registered and approved by the Department of Education and Communities to operate. The Government in each state regulates Child Care Services. The following standards of practice in Child Care are adhered to: The National Childcare Accreditation Council Standards; Education and Care Services National Regulations; Children Education and Services National Law Act 2010; the Early Years Learning Framework; the United Nations Conventions on the Rights of the Child and the Australian Early Childhood Code of Ethics. In Australia the ratio educators/childcare workers per child is 1:4 for 0 to 1&#x000a0;year-olds and 1:8 for 2 to 3&#x000a0;year-olds (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.acecqa.gov.au/">www.acecqa.gov.au</ext-link>).</p><p>ECEC services in Australia are income tested. Families earning under $152,147/annum with one child are able to apply for Child Care Benefit and Child Care Rebate from the Government. The income threshold goes up with each additional child in the family. However, the eligibility for this benefit is also dependant on the child&#x02019;s immunisation status. The average fee for a Long Day Care service is $102/day (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.abs.com.au/">www.abs.com.au</ext-link>).</p><p>Some Long Day Care Services provide all the necessary meals of (breakfast, morning and afternoon tea and lunch) whilst others may provide only a snack and parents are required to bring lunch and other snacks.

Social Cognitive Theory posits that behaviour is learned, modified and sustained through the interplay of personal, behavioural and environmental factors. The intervention will focus on these factors and how they influence sitting behaviours. All components of the intervention have been designed to address the four key learning processes suggested by Bandura [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] to enhance behaviour change (<italic>attention, retention, production</italic>, <italic>motivation).</italic> The intervention has also been designed to target Social Cognitive Theory mediators, such as educator self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p><p>The intervention has been designed in response to formative research conducted by the authors within similar ECEC services in disadvantaged locations. In 2013, 12 focus groups were held with educators from 11 services. Educators were provided with data on how much time children in their service spent sitting and asked to identify by how much they would like to reduce this proportion of time. The most common reduction was 50&#x000a0;% of the time currently spent sitting. Based on the proportions presented above, this would result in reducing a &#x0201c;typical&#x0201d; day (50&#x000a0;% of the time in childcare spent sitting) to 25&#x000a0;% of the time spent sitting. Educators were then asked to complete a daily routine log for their service, which described the modifications that would take place to allow the halving of time spent sitting. Researchers then provided further ideas. The ideas provided by educators largely focused on changes to practices and modifications to the physical environment. Included in these ideas were ways to ensure no bouts of sitting exceeded 15&#x000a0;min. These example schedules will be used by each of the intervention ECEC services to design their own daily schedule to reduce total sitting time by 50&#x000a0;% and to reduce bouts of sitting to &#x0003c;15&#x000a0;min.</p><p>We mapped the intervention step-by step as proposed by Robinson and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. We began by identifying the target behaviours and then worked backwards to define activities and strategies and potential mediators. (see Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). To attain our goal of improving toddler&#x02019;s executive functions we will implement four main strategies, which are based on the principles of the Bandura&#x02019;s Social Cognitive Theory: (i) Professional Development for Educators, (ii) Provision of Resources and Instrumental Materials (ii) Follow-up Support and (iv) Performance Monitoring and Feedback (as described in detail in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), to reduce toddler&#x02019;s total sitting time by 50&#x000a0;% and to reduce bouts of sitting to less than 15&#x000a0;min, while toddlers are in the ECEC centre.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Effects of reduced sitting time on toddlers&#x02019; cognitive development: a cluster randomized controlled trial.

For example, when telling a story about a horse, every time the children hear the word horse (or the horse character&#x02019;s name) they have to jump up and pretend to be a horse for 5&#x000a0;s. Repeat this throughout the story. The group can be broken up into smaller groups of frogs, crocodiles, horses etc. Where each group has to stand up at only their prompt. This activity works for Executive Function abilities&#x02014;working memory&#x02014;as children have to remember what animal they are and it decreases sedentary behaviour.</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Stand on a dot or a hoop to gather children as a group.</td><td>Asking children to stand on a dot or in a hoop would replace sitting on the floor to gather them as a group. This activity would still give the control and structure of gathering and focusing the children, but reducing sitting time. The children can also be gathered and asked to hold hands while waiting for the others to arrive. In doing this children are making their own barrier and focusing their attention on the group.</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Musical painting table</td><td>When the children are painting at a standing table, put on some music, after 2&#x000a0;min stop the music and the children have to put down their paintbrushes/pencils and change spots around the table. Then the music starts and they start painting again. The painting can be done on a big sheet of paper on the table, or a sheet on the table, or on individual pieces of paper.</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Apply sunscreen with the toddlers standing</td><td>Have all children standing while applying the sunscreen.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Indoor environment</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Locating play/learning spaces/areas near the wall</td><td>By locating play/learning spaces/areas near the wall and leaving the centre of the room with an open space, children have increased opportunities to move freely from one place to other.</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Standing table</td><td>Remove the chairs away from the table so that the children can be standing while painting, doing puzzles or other activities.</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Move pencils/brushes away form the painting table</td><td>Place the pencils and brushes in a separate table so that children can move from one table to other to change pencils/brushes.</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Move bins away from the tables during meal times</td><td>Place the bins away from the tables during meal times, so that children need to walk to bin after the meals.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Outdoor environment</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Remove chairs and tables from the outdoor space</td><td>Remove all equipment that promotes sitting (chairs and tables) from the outdoor space</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Use a tree in the yard as an easel</td><td>Attach paper to the tree and do chalk rubbings of the bark from the tree.

</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>Primary Outcome</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Cognitive development</title><p>Cognitive development and executive functions will be assessed using the cognitive sub-test from the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development&#x02014;Third edition (Bayley-III) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. This sub-test assesses sensorimotor development, exploration and manipulation, object relatedness, concept formation, memory, and problem solving. The Cognitive subset of the Bayley scales will be applied and scored according to standard procedures described in the Bayley-III manual for the age of the child at the starting point. For those children who have turned 3 at follow-up, an additional four executive function from the Early Years Toolbox will be used to ensure assessments are comprehensive. These iPad-based tasks assess the three core aspects of EF, and have been developmental and psychometrically evaluated with large samples of preschool-aged children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. All iPad apps have built-in auditory instructions so the data collectors could ensure the participant understood the instructions, clarified where necessary and remained on task.</p><p>The Early Years Toolbox go/no-go task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] evaluates the ability to inhibit a dominant behavioural response in response to a less frequently presented &#x02018;no-go&#x02019; stimulus. In this game, a child is asked to &#x02018;catch the fish&#x02019; by tapping on the screen when they appear (&#x02018;go&#x02019; response) and &#x02018;avoid the sharks&#x02019; by not pressing anything when the less-frequent sharks appear (&#x02018;no-go&#x02019; response). The task is evenly split into three mixed blocks of 25 stimuli, each consisting of 80&#x000a0;% &#x02018;go&#x02019; trials, so as not to exceed 1&#x000a0;min for each block and to provide participants with a short break between each block. Animated stimuli (swimming from left to right across the screen) are presented in random order for 1500&#x000a0;ms each, followed by a 1000&#x000a0;ms interval between stimuli. Scores represent the product of proportional go and no-go accuracy.</p><p>The Early Years Toolbox Mr. Ant task assesses visual-spatial working memory, or the amount of visual information that concurrently can be activated in the mind. The child is presented with an image of a cartoon ant, which has coloured dots on different spatial locations on his body. Mr Ant, with his coloured dots, is presented for five seconds, followed by a blank screen for four seconds, and then an image of Mr. Ant without any coloured dot appears and the participant indicates the recalled locations by tapping on the recalled locations. In the first level, with a single dot, children must remember a single spatial location. The task proceeds until the earlier of failure on all three trials at a given level of difficulty or level eight (with the location of eight coloured dots to recall). Performance is indexed by a point score, such that each successive level with at least two trials correct receives 1 point, and all correct trials thereafter receive 1/3 of a point.</p><p>The third Early Years Toolbox task, a card sorting task, is a measure of cognitive flexibility (the ability to disengage and re-direct attention) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. In this task, children are presented with stimuli, one at a time, which vary in shape and colour (red rabbit and a blue boat). Children are asked to sort the shapes into castles (denoted by a blue rabbit and red boat) first by one dimension (colour) and then, after six trials, by another dimension (shape). Successful completion of at least five pre-switch and post-switch trials results in administration of a border version of the task, in which children must flexibly switch between these sorting rules depending on whether the stimulus does or does not have a border. Scores represent the number of correct trials once the initial switch has been made.</p><p>Cognitive assessments and EF tests will be conducted individually in a private area and will be scheduled on separate days, where possible, to minimise cognitive fatigue.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Secondary Outcomes</title><sec id="FPar2"><title>Sitting time</title><p>Total time spent sitting and bouts of sitting during childcare hours will be assessed over a 1&#x000a0;week period using an activPAL accelerometer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].

Potential moderators of the intervention effects (e.g., child age and gender) will also be explored using multi-level modelling.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Discussion</title><p>Evidence suggests that early childhood development is critical for the establishment of the foundations for future learning, and social and health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and even small improvements in cognitive development and EF during early childhood &#x0201c;could shift the entire distribution of outcomes in a salutary direction and yield large improvements in health, wealth and crime rate for a nation&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The proposed RCT represents the first study aimed to assess the effects of decreased sitting on cognitive development and EF in toddlers. The results of this study could significantly inform SB and PA guidelines for the early years, as SB experimental studies and studies with toddlers using objectively-measured SB and PA have been identified as critical to enhance the quality of the evidence base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. Moreover, research regarding the potential harms of excessive sitting and benefits of PA in toddlers are scarce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and a call has been made for further research on cognitive and psychosocial development to inform SB guidelines for the early years due to the lack of evidence in this area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. This RCT aims to address this knowledge deficit.</p><p>This RCT will also take an innovative approach and use unique methodologies to significantly increase current understanding. In children SBs such as television viewing and overall screen time have been commonly studied and rely on parent-proxy reports; however, they do not represent the total amount of habitual sedentary time. This project will provide new insights on SB and cognitive development in toddlers by: (i) including direct comprehensive and standardized measures of cognitive development for young children; (ii) objectively assessing SB and PA with accelerometry (iii) testing independent associations of SB and cognitive development (e.g. adjusting the analysis for PA levels); (iv) testing mediators of change in cognitive development and moderators of the intervention effects and (v) using a cluster RCT design which is critical for establishing cause and effect relationships and dose-response associations.</p><p>Through better understanding of the effects of reducing sitting time on cognitive development and EF in disadvantaged toddlers, this RCT has the potential to inform programs and policies designed to optimize developmental and health outcomes in young children, specifically in those from a disadvantaged backgrounds.</p><p>This project has the potential to inform future government policies and programs focused on SB and PA such as updating the National Physical Activity Recommendations for Children 0&#x02013;5 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, the knowledge generated by this project could be beneficial, nationally and internationally, for: i) parents aiming to optimize developmental outcomes for their children; ii) early childhood educators, clinicians, health care providers, and health promoters, aiming to enhance developmental outcomes in young children through intervention programs; iii) government departments seeking to develop evidence-based guidelines; and iv) researchers seeking to evaluate and translate effective programs to give young children the best start in life.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec25"><title>Additional file</title><p>
