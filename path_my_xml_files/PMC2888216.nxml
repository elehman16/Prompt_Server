Endpoints included the proportion of all subjects with sUA &#x0003c;6.0 mg/dL and the proportion of subjects with mild/moderate renal impairment and sUA &#x0003c;6.0 mg/dL. Safety assessments included blinded adjudication of each cardiovascular (CV) adverse event (AE) and death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Comorbidities included: renal impairment (65%); obesity (64%); hyperlipidemia (42%); and hypertension (53%). In febuxostat 40 mg, febuxostat 80 mg, and allopurinol groups, primary endpoint was achieved in 45%, 67%, and 42%, respectively. Febuxostat 40 mg UL was statistically non-inferior to allopurinol, but febuxostat 80 mg was superior to both (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001). Achievement of target sUA in subjects with renal impairment was also superior with febuxostat 80 mg (72%; <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001) compared with febuxostat 40 mg (50%) or allopurinol (42%), but febuxostat 40 mg showed greater efficacy than allopurinol (<italic>P </italic>= 0.021). Rates of AEs did not differ across treatment groups. Adjudicated (APTC) CV event rates were 0.0% for febuxostat 40 mg and 0.4% for both febuxostat 80 mg and allopurinol. One death occurred in each febuxostat group and three in the allopurinol group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Urate-lowering efficacy of febuxostat 80 mg exceeded that of febuxostat 40 mg and allopurinol (300/200 mg), which were comparable. In subjects with mild/moderate renal impairment, both febuxostat doses were more efficacious than allopurinol and equally safe. At the doses tested, safety of febuxostat and allopurinol was comparable.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration</title><p>NCT00430248</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Gout is an increasingly common disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] characterized by hyperuricemia (serum urate concentration (sUA) exceeding 6.8 mg/dL, the limit of urate solubility) and by acute and chronic consequences of urate crystal deposition: episodic gout flares, deforming gouty arthropathy, tophi, and urolithiasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Long-term management of recurrent or progressive gout focuses on urate-lowering therapy (ULT) aimed at maintaining sUA in a sub-saturating range, often chosen as &#x0003c;6.0 mg/dL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Achievement of this goal results in eventual cessation (and even reversal) of urate crystal deposition and clinical signs and symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Pharmacological approaches to ULT have, for over 40 years, involved either enhancement of renal uric acid excretion with a uricosuric, such as probenecid, or inhibition of urate production with the purine base analogue allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitor. In the United States, over 90% of ULT prescriptions are for allopurinol, approved at doses up to 800 mg daily but rarely (&#x0003c;5% of patients) prescribed at doses exceeding 300 mg daily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Several recent publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] have documented poor urate-lowering (UL) efficacy and/or clinical outcomes in gout patients, including progression to gout-related disability and impaired quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Gout patients also have high incidences of major comorbidities that may be associated with hyperuricemia or gout or both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Thus, gout patients not only suffer potentially disabling and deforming arthritic disease, but are also at high risk for cardiovascular (CV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and metabolic disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Febuxostat, a non-purine analogue XO inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], has recently received regulatory approval in the United States for treatment of hyperuricemia in gout patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Three published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in subjects with gout and baseline sUA &#x02265; 8.0 mg/dL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] have established superior UL efficacy (proportion of subjects achieving sUA &#x0003c;6.0 mg/dL) for febuxostat (in daily doses from 80 to 240 mg) compared with placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] or with allopurinol 300 mg daily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were similar across treatment groups in these studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], but CV disorders, although uncommon, occurred numerically more often in febuxostat- than allopurinol-treated. Subjects who experienced these events had a prior history of CV disease (CVD) and/or underlying CV risk factors. This imbalance was not statistically significant or explained by known actions of febuxostat but warranted further study.</p><p>Here we report results of the CONFIRMS trial, a Phase 3, double-blind RCT further examining the comparative UL efficacy and safety of febuxostat and allopurinol in a greater number of gout subjects than the total participating in prior comparative trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The three-fold objectives of this study were: 1) to compare the UL efficacy of febuxostat at a dose of 40 mg with that of allopurinol at doses most commonly utilized in clinical practice; 2) to evaluate UL efficacies of 80 mg and 40 mg daily doses of febuxostat compared with that of allopurinol in subjects with mild or moderate renal impairment; and 3) to gain prospective, uniformly reviewed information regarding the safety of these agents, particularly their comparative CV safety.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Subjects, study design, and procedures</title><p>Subjects aged 18 to 85 years with a diagnosis of gout fulfilling American Rheumatology Association preliminary criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and sUA &#x02265; 8.0 mg/dL were eligible for enrollment. Subjects were enrolled at 324 sites in the United States. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained, and all subjects provided written informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act authorization prior to any study-related procedure. At least 35% of subjects enrolled were to have mild or moderate renal impairment, defined as baseline estimated creatinine clearance (eCLcr) of 60 to 89 ml/minutes or 30 to 59 ml/minutes, respectively, calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula corrected for ideal body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Subjects successfully completing either of two previously reported long-term, open-label febuxostat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] or febuxostat/allopurinol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] extension studies were also eligible for enrollment.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included: secondary hyperuricemia (for example, due to myeloproliferative disorder); xanthinuria; severe renal impairment (eCLcr &#x0003c;30 ml/minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]); alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase values &#x0003e;1.5 times the upper limit of normal; consumption of more than 14 alcoholic drinks per week or a history of alcoholism or drug abuse within five years; or a medical condition that, in the investigator's opinion, would interfere with treatment, safety, or adherence to the protocol.</p><p>Subject screening evaluations included: physical examination and vital signs; medical history, a pre-specified CV history/risk form; laboratory tests (sUA, complete chemistry panel, hematology, urinalysis, and, for women, pregnancy test); echocardiogram; assessment for tophi and gout flare; and concomitant medication use. With the exception of tophus assessment, these elements, along with compliance, were repeated at bimonthly visits during the six-month treatment period. sUA was blinded after baseline determination at Day-4.</p><p>An Interactive Voice Response System was utilized by site personnel during screening visits to initiate double-blind randomization. Subjects were randomized 1:1:1 on Day 1 to receive daily febuxostat 40 mg, febuxostat 80 mg, or allopurinol (Apotex; Weston, FL, USA). Randomization was stratified by baseline renal function and prior completion of either of two open-label extension trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Among subjects randomized to allopurinol, those with normal renal function or mild renal impairment received 300 mg daily, and those with moderate renal impairment received 200 mg.</p><p>During a 30-day washout period for subjects receiving prior ULT, and throughout the subsequent six-month treatment period for all subjects, prophylaxis for gout flares was given either as colchicine, 0.6 mg daily (West-Ward Pharmaceutical Corporation, Eatontown, NJ, USA) or naproxen, 250 mg twice daily (West-Ward Pharmaceutical Corporation). All subjects receiving naproxen prophylaxis also received lansoprazole 15 mg daily (Takeda Global Research &#x00026; Development Center, Inc., Deerfield, IL, USA). Choice of prophylaxis regimen was made by the investigator and subject, taking into account prior drug tolerance and prophylaxis experience. In addition, subjects with eCLcr &#x0003c;50 ml/minute were not to receive naproxen. Gout flares were regarded as expected gout manifestations rather than as AEs.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy analyses</title><p>While 2,269 subjects were randomized to receive at least one dose of febuxostat 40 mg, febuxostat 80 mg, or allopurinol (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), one subject randomized to the allopurinol treatment group was excluded from the efficacy analyses because baseline sUA was &#x0003c;8.0 mg/dL.

A major objective of this study was to evaluate the UL efficacy of febuxostat 40 mg; therefore, this treatment group was compared with the allopurinol group with regard to non-inferiority in UL. Binomial 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the difference between the two groups in achieving final sUA &#x0003c;6.0 mg/dL. Non-inferiority to allopurinol was to be declared for febuxostat 40 mg if the value of the lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in achieving the endpoint was greater than -10%. If non-inferiority of febuxostat 40 mg was established, superiority to allopurinol was to be assessed using Fisher's exact test (two-tailed, 0.05 significance level). Efficacy comparisons were also to be made comparing febuxostat 80 mg to allopurinol and to febuxostat 40 mg, using Fisher's exact test (two-tailed, 0.05 significance level).</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of sample size</title><p>A total of 750 subjects per treatment group was required to achieve 90% power to meet the non-inferiority criteria between febuxostat 40 mg and allopurinol for the primary efficacy variable, and to detect a 10% difference between febuxostat 40 mg and allopurinol for the primary efficacy variable, and between febuxostat 40 mg and 80 mg for the primary efficacy variable.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary efficacy endpoints</title><p>Secondary efficacy variables included: the proportion of subjects with mild or moderate renal impairment and final sUA &#x0003c;6.0 mg/dL; and the proportion of subjects with sUA &#x0003c;6.0 mg/dL, &#x0003c;5.0 mg/dL, and &#x0003c;4.0 mg/dL at each visit.

Five subjects died during the study: one subject each receiving febuxostat 40 mg (anaphylactic reaction after 50 fire ant stings) and febuxostat 80 mg (brain edema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease); and three subjects receiving allopurinol (hypertensive heart disease; necrotizing pneumonia and sepsis after surgery for lung adenocarcinoma; and sudden death). No deaths were judged by investigators to be related to a study drug.</p><p>Differences among treatment groups in premature discontinuation rates due to AEs occurring during the study were not significant and are detailed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. The most common AEs leading to discontinuation were investigator-defined liver function abnormalities (reported in 2%, 1%, and 1% of subjects receiving febuxostat 40 mg, febuxostat 80 mg, and allopurinol, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>AEs in specific organ systems</title><p>Rash AEs were reported by 6%, 6%, and 7% of subjects receiving febuxostat 40 mg, febuxostat 80 mg, and allopurinol, respectively. The most frequently reported rash AEs were dermatitis and eczema (2%, 2%, and 3%, respectively) and rashes, eruptions, and exanthems (2%, 2%, and 1%, respectively). With the exception of contact dermatitis, no specific rash was experienced by &#x0003e;1% of subjects in any treatment group, and differences in incidence between groups were not significant. Eighteen subjects withdrew prematurely due to a rash AE, including one subject, receiving allopurinol, who had a severe desquamating eruption requiring parenteral corticosteroid therapy.</p><p>Rates of liver function abnormalities are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>. Aminotransferase elevations were generally mild (not exceeding three-fold the upper limit of normal), transient even with continued study drug treatment, and of similar frequency in febuxostat- and allopurinol-treated subjects. No subjects with combined transaminase increases and serum bilirubin levels exceeding twice the upper limit of normal were observed. Among subjects taking colchicine for flare prophylaxis, the incidence of increased transaminases was similar across treatment groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Cardiovascular AEs</title><p>At least one CV AE was investigator-reported in 5% of all subjects: 5%, 5%, and 6% of subjects in the febuxostat 40 mg, febuxostat 80 mg, and allopurinol groups, respectively. No difference between treatment groups in specific CV AEs was detected. Pre-specified adjudication of all deaths and all AEs reported to be CV system-related identified a total of six subjects experiencing an adjudicated APTC event: three in the febuxostat 80 mg group and three in the allopurinol group (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). All subjects experiencing an adjudicated APTC event had prior medical histories of or underlying risk factors for CVD. Differences in the rates of adjudicated non-APTC CV events between treatment groups were not significant.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In a previous RCT in subjects with gout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], the UL efficacy of febuxostat at a daily dose of 40 mg was superior to that of placebo. Here, the UL efficacy of febuxostat 40 mg was confirmed as comparable to that of allopurinol 300 mg. At all levels of renal function studied, daily dosing of febuxostat 80 mg was superior in UL efficacy to that of febuxostat 40 mg or allopurinol. However, in subjects with impaired renal function, febuxostat 40 mg was also superior to allopurinol 300 mg daily (mild renal impairment) or 200 mg daily (moderate renal impairment), suggesting that treatment with either dose of febuxostat is more likely to achieve sUA &#x0003c;6.0 mg/dL than is allopurinol treatment at the reduced doses widely recommended for such individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Indicators of higher body urate pools (baseline presence of tophi or sUA &#x02265; 10.0 mg/dL) were also identified as factors reducing rates of responsiveness to ULT.</p><p>If goal range urate levels are not achieved and maintained with febuxostat 40 mg daily or allopurinol, the current data suggest that dose titration to febuxostat 80 mg would be a rational alternative to increasing allopurinol doses beyond 300 mg. In fact, RCT evidence to support the safety and efficacy of allopurinol administered at doses exceeding 300 mg daily is limited to a recent four-month trial in which 13 of 17 subjects (eCLcr &#x02265; 50 ml/minute) failing to achieve sUA &#x0003c;5.0 mg/dL while receiving allopurinol 300 mg daily safely reached this efficacy endpoint when treated with 600 mg daily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>Failure to achieve sUA &#x0003c;6.0 mg/dL among individuals with or without renal impairment receiving guideline-recommended doses of allopurinol has been documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The common practice of prescribing allopurinol at a fixed daily dose of 300 mg for gout patients with mildly impaired or normal renal function and less for those with moderate renal impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] may further decrease the likelihood of achieving sUA &#x0003c;6.0 mg/dL. In this study, there was no titration of allopurinol doses; subjects were assigned the standard daily dose of 300 mg unless they had moderate renal impairment. For this reason and due to the paucity of controlled data cited above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], we are reluctant to speculate as to whether allopurinol dose escalation would have safely increased the proportion of subjects who achieved target sUA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>The prior RCTs comparing febuxostat and allopurinol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] did not establish significant differences between these agents in the clinical outcomes of flare rate and tophus size reductions in the first 6 to 12 months of treatment. As such, clinical outcomes were not endpoints in the current trial. Nevertheless, subjects who had successfully completed prior the long-term open-label UL studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and then enrolled in CONFIRMS had reduced rates of baseline tophi and, during the additional six months of ULT, showed higher rates of UL efficacy and reduced rates of gout flares compared with those who did not have prior trial participation. These data support the concept that persistent UL to sub-saturating sUA eventually results in relief of clinical symptoms of both acute (flares) and chronic (tophi) gout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] likely by depletion of excessive miscible and non-miscible (crystalline) extracellular urate pools characteristic of gout patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p>In all treatment groups, rates of gout flares requiring treatment diminished slowly after Month 2 and did not affect more than 15% of subjects per month after Week 8 of the study (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This result contrasts with sharp increases in flare rates (30% to 40% of subjects per month) encountered after cessation of flare prophylaxis at Month 2 in prior comparative RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. These results seem likely due to differences in the duration of prophylaxis and are in accord with the results of an RCT that established the efficacy of colchicine flare prophylaxis during the first six months after initiation of allopurinol therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. We thus recommend gout flare prophylaxis co-therapy for at least the first six months of ULT.</p><p>As in prior febuxostat clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], no severe rashes or hypersensitivity reactions were observed during febuxostat treatment in the current trial. In these trials, serum transaminase elevations (&#x02265;three times upper limit of normal) were numerically more frequent with febuxostat than with allopurinol, but neither concurrent serum bilirubin levels exceeding 2 mg/dL nor clinically-manifested liver-related symptoms were encountered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In the entire febuxostat development program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], neither febuxostat nor allopurinol treatment was associated with combined serum transaminase and bilirubin increases, except when explained by cholecystitis or by bile duct obstruction due to stones or malignancy. Nevertheless, administration of allopurinol or febuxostat to a gout population with significant rates of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and alcohol use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] is accompanied by liver function test abnormalities more frequently than is placebo administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Consequently, we recommend periodic liver function testing during treatment with either febuxostat or allopurinol.</p><p>A lack of significant differences in overall rates of AEs or of the most frequently occurring treatment emergent AEs across febuxostat and allopurinol treatment groups in CONFIRMS recapitulate safety results previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In addition, in this study encompassing a greater number of subjects than all prior febuxostat/allopurinol RCTs combined, no significant differences between treatment groups were observed in the rates of reported CV AEs, adjudicated APTC, or non-APTC events. Gout and hyperuricemia are strongly associated with CVD and CVD-related death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], and all subjects who experienced adjudicated CV events had prior medical histories or risk factors for CVD. Thus, despite the fact that the small number of severe CV AEs encountered in febuxostat/allopurinol comparative RCTs did not identify a differential CV risk of these agents, we recommend continued attention to monitoring and management of CV health, particularly among gout patients at high risk for CV events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Results of the CONFIRMS trial establish equivalent UL efficacy for febuxostat 40 mg daily and allopurinol 300/200 mg daily. At all levels of renal function studied, UL efficacy of febuxostat 80 mg daily was superior to that of febuxostat 40 mg or allopurinol 300/200 mg, and was comparably safe. In subjects with mildly or moderately impaired renal function, however, febuxostat 40 mg daily was significantly more effective in lowering sUA than allopurinol. At the doses studied, safety of febuxostat and allopurinol, including CV safety, was comparable. Febuxostat, at 40 mg or 80 mg daily, offers a well-tolerated UL alternative to allopurinol, particularly for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AE: adverse event; APTC: Antiplatelet Trialists Collaboration; BMI: body mass index; CI: confidence interval; CV: cardiovascular; CVD: cardiovascular disease; eCLcr: estimated creatinine clearance; mITT: modified intent-to-treat; RCT: randomized controlled trial; sUA: serum urate; UL: urate lowering; ULT: urate-lowering therapy; XO: xanthine oxidase.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>MAB has served as a consultant for Takeda Global Research &#x00026; Development Center, Inc. and Savient Pharmaceuticals (&#x0003e;$10,000) and for Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Proctor &#x00026; Gamble, Inc., and URL Pharma (&#x0003c;$10,000).
