The patients with heart blocks, significant bradyarrthymias, left ventricular failure, hematological disease, bleeding or coagulation test abnormalities, psychiatric diseases, diabetes, history of drug abuse, allergy to local anesthetics of the amide type and pregnant and lactating women were excluded from the study. Patients were randomly allocated to one of the following two groups in a double blinded fashion using a computer-generated code: Bupivacaine + dexmedetomidine (A), Bupivacaine + clonidine (B) and were administered tablet ranitidine 150 mg as premedicant a night before and on the morning of the surgery.</p><p>In the operation theater, an intravenous (IV) access was secured and monitoring devices were attached which included electrocardiograph, pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>), noninvasive blood pressure (BP) and the baseline parameters were recorded. Patients were administered epidural block with 18 gauge Tuohy Needle - Portex Continious Epidural (Smith Med. Inc.) and catheter was secured 3-4 cm into the epidural space. The catheter was then anchored in place on the back of the patient using adhesive tape and a test dose of 3 ml of 2% lignocaine hydrochloride solution containing adrenaline 1:200,000 was injected. After 4-6 min of administering the test dose, patients in Group A received 15 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine and 1 &#x003bc;g/kg of dexmedetomidine. Patients in Group B were administered 15 ml solution of 0.5% bupivacaine and 2 &#x003bc;g/kg of clonidine. The drug preparation was done by an anesthesia technician who was unaware of the randomization The sensory level was assessed by response to pin-prick while the motor weakness was evaluated using a modified Bromage scale (0 = No block, 1 = Inability to raise extended leg, 2 = Inability to flex knee and 3 = Inability to flex ankle and foot). This was assessed every 5 min for 30 min and then every 30 min. The patient was positioned for surgery after 25-30 min of epidural administration of the drugs and ensuring effective sensory and motor block. Surgery was performed by one of four consultant surgeons of similar clinical experience; they were blinded to the allocation group. The following variables were observed for and recorded: The time taken for onset of sensory block at T10; the highest dermatomal level of sensory analgesia; the complete establishment of motor blockade (Bromage 3), the time to two segment regression of analgesic level, regression of analgesic level to S1 dermatome using pin-prick method. Grading of sedation was evaluated by a five-point scale:</p><p>

Nausea and vomiting were treated with 0.1 mg/kg of IV ondansetron. Shivering was treated with injection tramadol 50 mg IV.

We also could not assess pain; quality and effectiveness of analgesia postoperatively on limb movement. We were unable to assess the total dose of local anesthetic consumption postoperatively, as a different mode of analgesia was chosen.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Further scope for study</title><p>Clinical studies can be done to find the equivalent epidural doses of dexmedetomidine and clonidine.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Dexmedetomidine appears to be a better alternative to clonidine as an epidural adjuvant as it provides comparable stable hemodynamics, early onset and establishment of sensory and motor anesthesia, prolonged postoperative analgesia and superior sedation levels. Overall the clinical experience with dexmedetomidine was satisfactory for surgery under regional anesthesia, for the patient, the anesthetist, and the surgeon as compared to clonidine because of its superior sedative and block characteristics during the surgical procedure.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Schultz</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name><name><surname>Werba</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Ulbing</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Gollmann</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Lehofer</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Peri-operative thoracic epidural analgesia for thoracotomy</article-title><source>Eur J Anaesthesiol</source><year>1997</year><volume>14</volume><fpage>600</fpage><lpage>3</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9466095</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>H&#x000f6;hener</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Blumenthal</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Borgeat</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Sedation and regional anaesthesia in the adult patient</article-title><source>Br J Anaesth</source><year>2008</year><volume>100</volume><fpage>8</fpage><lpage>16</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18070783</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Helgeson</surname><given-names>LE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Sedation during regional anesthesia: Inhalation versus intravenous</article-title><source>Curr Opin Anaesthesiol</source><year>2005</year><volume>18</volume><fpage>534</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16534289</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>N&#x000e9;methy</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Paroli</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Williams-Russo</surname><given-names>PG</given-names></name><name><surname>Blanck</surname><given-names>TJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Assessing sedation with regional anesthesia: Inter-rater agreement on a modified Wilson sedation scale</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>2002</year><volume>94</volume><fpage>723</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11867405</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bajwa</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Bajwa</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name><name><surname>Kaur</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Arora</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Gupta</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Dexmedetomidine and clonidine in epidural anaesthesia: A comparative evaluation</article-title><source>Indian J Anaesth</source><year>2011</year><volume>55</volume><fpage>116</fpage><lpage>21</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21712865</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Khan</surname><given-names>ZP</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferguson</surname><given-names>CN</given-names></name><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>RM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>alpha-2 and imidazoline receptor agonists.
