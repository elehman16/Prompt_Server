Exclusion criteria included current smokers or history of smoking within the past 12&#x02005;months (including e-cigarettes). 163 participants were randomised to the study (mean participant age 38&#x02005;years, 57% females).</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>Participants were randomised to CS1002 (Unicough) or simple linctus (SL), a widely used cough treatment, and treatment duration was 7&#x02005;days or until resolution of cough.</p></sec><sec><title>Main outcome measures</title><p>The primary analysis was intention-to-treat (157 participants) and comprised cough severity assessed using a VAS after 3&#x02005;days' treatment (prespecified primary end point at day 4). Cough frequency, sleep disruption, health status (Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ-acute)) and cough resolution were also assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At day 4 (primary end point), the adjusted mean difference (95% CI) in cough severity VAS between CS1002 and SL was &#x02212;5.9&#x02005;mm (&#x02212;14.4 to 2.7), p=0.18. At the end of the study (day 7) the mean difference in cough severity VAS was &#x02212;4.2&#x02005;mm (&#x02212;12.2 to 3.9), p=0.31. CS1002 was associated with a greater reduction in cough sleep disruption (mean difference &#x02212;11.6&#x02005;mm (&#x02212;20.6 to 2.7), p=0.01) and cough frequency (mean difference &#x02212;8.1&#x02005;mm (&#x02212;16.2 to 0.1), p=0.05) compared with SL. There was greater improvement in LCQ-acute quality of life scores with CS1002 compared with SL: mean difference (95% CI) 1.2 (0.05 to 2.36), p=0.04 after 5 days' treatment. More participants prematurely stopped treatment due to cough improvement in the CS1002 group (24.4%) compared with SL (10.7%; p=0.02). Adverse events (AEs) were comparable between CS1002 (20.5%) and SL (27.6%) and largely related to the study indication. 6 participants (7%) in the CS1002 group reduced the dose of medication due to drowsiness/tiredness, which subsequently resolved.

In 2014, &#x000a3;98.7 million was spent in the UK on OTC cough treatments.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> OTC cough medicines include antitussives, expectorants, mucolytics, antihistamines, decongestants and numerous drug combinations.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> There is a lack of data supporting the efficacy of OTC medicines in the treatment of acute cough associated with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). In 2012, a Cochrane systematic review concluded there was no strong evidence for or against their effectiveness.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Methodological flaws in clinical trial design, paucity of placebo-controlled trials, use of unvalidated outcome measures and inefficacy of medicines were some of the reasons for the poor evidence base.</p><p>CS1002 is an OTC cough medicine that contains three active ingredients: diphenhydramine, levomenthol and ammonium chloride in a cocoa-based demulcent preparation. Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine that has been reported to reduce the heightened cough reflex sensitivity in participants with cough associated with an URTI.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Menthol and eucalyptus have been used for many centuries for treating coughs and colds.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Menthol is obtained from mint oils, mainly peppermint, or made synthetically from coal tar. It has a pungent odour that provides a cooling and soothing effect in the mouth and throat and is often used to relieve congestion.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Menthol has also been reported to inhibit cough reflex sensitivity compared with placebo.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Ammonium chloride is an acid-forming salt that is thought to exert an expectorant effect by loosening sputum.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The effectiveness and mode of action of ammonium chloride remains controversial.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The cocoa-based demulcent preparation used in CS1002 is more viscous than most available OTC cough medicines. Demulcents are thought to reduce cough and cold symptoms because of a soothing effect on the mucus membrane.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of CS1002, an OTC cough medicine for cough associated with URTI, in a randomised controlled trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This multicentre, randomised, parallel group, controlled, single-blinded study was conducted in 4 GP surgeries and 14 pharmacies in the UK between 30 December 2014 and 9 May 2015.

No imputation was used for missing data (ie, only observed data were used). A mixed model for repeated measures analysis was used to compare the effect of study treatments on cough parameters from baseline. The model included effects for treatment group, day, pooled centre, baseline cough severity, and treatment-by-day and baseline-by-day cough severity interaction terms. Residual plots and a normality test were used to assess normality. The results were also repeated for the per-protocol set (PPS), defined as participants in the ITT population who did not have an important protocol violation. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to assess the robustness of the primary efficacy results to the method of handling missing data, using a last observation carried forward approach and a baseline observation carried forward approach for participants with no on-treatment data. Parametric data were presented as mean and either SD, SEM or 95% CIs. Statistical significance was defined as p&#x02264;0.05. The proportions of participants with cough resolution were compared using a stratified (by centre) Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test.

This is one of the largest multiple dosing, randomised controlled trials in participants with URTI-associated cough to date, and the first to recruit participants seeking cough medicines at pharmacies. The study did not achieve a significant reduction in primary end point cough severity after 3&#x02005;days of treatment, but there were greater reductions in cough frequency and sleep disruption and resolution of cough in participants receiving CS1002 compared with SL.</p><p>Our trial represents a significant advance in the study of URTI-associated cough for a number of reasons. A Cochrane systematic review of cough medicines concluded that there was no evidence for or against cough medicines for URTI-associated cough.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Previous trials of cough medicines have been hampered by the recruitment of small numbers of participants, the recruitment of participants not representative of URTI-associated cough, uncontrolled study design and the use of unvalidated end points. We conducted a randomised clinical trial that included validated cough outcome measures. Our primary outcome measure, the VAS, is widely used in studies of cough.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> We recruited participants with an URTI-associated cough who were otherwise healthy and seeking an antitussive medicine. Our participants were unselected for the category of cough, and included a broad range of participants with self-reported dry, chesty and tickly cough. We conducted a large study, recruiting participants from 18 sites. This is the first study to recruit participants presenting to pharmacies, and therefore the study population is more likely to resemble the broader population seeking cough medicines. There were few participants that dropped out of the trial, and therefore our data completeness was good. The efficacy of the interventions was evaluated with widely used and validated end points of cough severity VAS and LCQ-acute HRQoL questionnaires.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> We conducted a controlled trial and the comparator was a widely used OTC treatment. SL, which costs less than many OTC medicines to purchase but like most cough medicines, it lacks a strong evidence base. Its efficacy has not been compared with natural recovery, placebo or to other cough medicines. The rate of reduction of cough severity VAS associated with SL in our study does appear to be greater than that reported for natural recovery.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The mechanism of action of SL is poorly understood, but is thought to be related to a demulcent effect and the hypersalivation resulting from the sugary taste.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>There was a clinically significant reduction in primary end point cough severity VAS at day 4 in both groups. However, CS1002 did not achieve the primary end point of a greater reduction in cough severity at day 4 compared with SL. There were, however, greater reductions in secondary end points of sleep disruption and cough frequency, and improvements in HRQoL associated with CS1002 compared with SL. There was also a trend favouring greater resolution of cough at day 4 with CS1002 compared with SL, with a near doubling of the proportion of participants whose cough had resolved. This was supported by a post hoc analysis that found a significantly greater number of participants had discontinued their medication due to resolution of cough by day 4 (CS1002, 24.4% vs SL, 10.7%: p=0.02). The MID for cough outcome measures of frequency VAS, sleep disruption VAS and cough resolution have not been reported in URTI-associated cough, and this should be studied in future to facilitate the clinical interpretation of data. CS1002 was well tolerated, and there were few significant AEs, including drowsiness. Drowsiness was managed with dose reduction, and no participants discontinued the medication because of this symptom. Participants were compliant with both medications, and this was verified by counting the doses of medication returned at the end of the study. The mechanism of action of CS1002 is poorly understood. There are a number of possibilities, which include a reduction in cough reflex sensitivity,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> promotion of more restful sleep and a demulcent action. CS1002 contains a cocoa-flavoured demulcent that is more viscous than most available OTC cough medicines, and this may potentially promote palatability.</p><p>There are a number of important limitations with our study. We did not use a placebo comparator, and the study was not double-blinded. The limitations of a single-blinded study were reduced by informing the participants that they were going to receive a cough medicine, but not the characteristics of the medicine. The investigators were blinded to the study because both medicines were contained in identical packaging, and participants were instructed to start their medication outside the pharmacy or GP clinic. We used SL as the comparator since this is a widely used cough treatment. It is possible that there may have been greater differences in efficacy outcome measures if we had used an inactive placebo. Another option for comparator that should be considered in future studies is the demulcent used in CS1002. It is likely that there was also significant natural recovery in our study. Our data highlight the difficulty in evaluating cough medicines in a rapidly resolving condition. We do not know whether the cough at study entry was worsening or improving and this could have impacted on our findings. We were short of our recruitment target of 180 participants; we recruited 163 participants. This was due to a delay in the start of the study, and consequently a reduced time window for recruitment during the cough and cold winter season. We think it is unlikely that the slight under-recruitment of participants would have altered our study conclusions. The reasons for screen failures were not recorded for many patients, particularly at busy pharmacy sites. The reasons were, however, recorded for 2238 participants and suggest that a large number of participants approached had duration of cough &#x0003e;7&#x02005;days. It is possible that the discontinuation of medication could have reflected lack of efficacy as well as recovery. We did not investigate the cause of the acute cough, and future studies should possibly assess viruses, pertussis and bacterial causes. We did not assess cough with objective outcome measures, such as cough frequency monitoring.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Recently, there have been significant advances in cough monitoring technology, and this should be possible in future studies.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>In conclusion, the OTC cough medicine CS1002 did not achieve a significant reduction in the primary end point cough severity, but it was associated with a greater reduction in cough frequency and sleep disruption, and increased resolution of cough leading to early discontinuation of medication and improved HRQoL compared with comparator SL. Further studies should investigate the impact of natural recovery and placebo on cough outcome measures to facilitate the optimal study protocol in URTI-associated cough.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge all the doctors and pharmacists who recruited participants for this study: Dr Mark Blagden, Ashgate Medical Practice, Chesterfield; Dr Naseem Gill, CH Medical, Oldham; Dr Paula Evans, Acomb Surgery, York; Dr Mark Roman, Woodthorpe Surgery, York; Dr Astrid Henckel, Monkgate Surgery, York; Maimuna Sultana, Peak Pharmacy, Manchester; Amanda Gilchrist, Peak Pharmacy, Cheadle; Deborah Kelly, Tims and Parker, Manchester; Jonathan Hill, Peak Pharmacy, Manchester; Anthony Parker, Tims and Parker, Manchester; Rahbeia Najeeb, Peak Pharmacy, Manchester; Johanne Nesbit, Davey's Pharmacy, Liverpool; Manjeet Patter, Jhoots Pharmacy, Darlaston; Keval Jagatiya, Jhoots Pharmacy, Dudley; Rumeesha Damaree, Jhoots Pharmacy, Rowley Regis; Rashimi Sharma, Jhoots Pharmacy, Wolverhampton; David Meddings, Jhoots Pharmacy, Rowley Regis; David Bott, Jhoots Pharmacy, Cradley Heath; Aasma Ahmed, Jhoots Pharmacy, Birmingham; Fezza Hassan, Jhoots Pharmacy, Birmingham; Kiranjit Sidhu, Jhoots Pharmacy, Birmingham; Indira Panchal, Meiklejohn Pharmacy, Bedford; Mohammed Fahim, Wexham Road Pharmacy, Slough; Zahoor Sharif, Oxford Road Pharmacy, Reading.
