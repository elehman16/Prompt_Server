However, little is known regarding yoga&#x02019;s optimal dose or its effectiveness for more severe CLBP in diverse lower SES populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>From September-December 2011, we conducted a 12-week RCT comparing once vs. twice-weekly standardized 75-minute hatha yoga classes for 95 adults with nonspecific CLBP. Recruitment and classes occurred in a large safety-net hospital and five affiliated community health centers in Boston, Massachusetts. Primary outcomes were mean low back pain intensity in the previous week (0-10) and back-related function (Modified Roland-Morris Disability, MRMD, 0-23). We used two-sample t-tests to compare once/week vs. twice/week mean change scores (baseline-12 weeks) for pain and MRMD. Analyses used the intention-to-treat principle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Participants were on average 48 years old, 76% female, 82% non-white, 63% with annual household incomes <underline>&#x0003c;</underline>$30,000, and 35% with high school education or less. Baseline pain intensity (6.9, SD 1.6) and MRMD (13.7, SD 5.0) were consistent with moderate-severe CLBP. Baseline characteristics of the once/week (n=49) and twice/week (n=46) groups were similar. Overall class attendance was 73% and 62% for the once/week and twice/week participants, respectively. Both groups practiced yoga at home on average 3-4 days/week. Each group experienced statistically significant (p&#x0003c;.0001) and clinically meaningful improvements in pain and function: Mean pain change scores for the once/week and twice/week groups were -2.1 (SD 2.7) and -2.4 (SD 2.2), respectively. Mean MRMD change scores for the once/week and twice/week groups were -5.2 (SD 6.5) and -4.9 (SD 4.4), respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups for pain or MRMD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Twelve weeks of either once or twice-weekly hatha yoga classes augmented by home practice were similarly effective for moderate to severe CLBP in a diverse predominantly lower SES population.</p></sec></body></article>
