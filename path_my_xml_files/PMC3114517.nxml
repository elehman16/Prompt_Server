Ginseng root extract (GRE) is one of the most popular herbal products and is used by more than 6 million Americans each year. Ginseng has been a part of Eastern medicine for more than 4,000 years and is purported to prevent and treat diabetes. There are 11 commercially available species of ginseng, but most reports evaluated Asian (<italic>Panax ginseng)</italic> or American (<italic>Panax quinquefolius L.)</italic> ginseng. The physiological effects of ginseng are attributed to its triterpene &#x003b2;-glycosides, known as ginsenosides; more than 150 types of ginsenosides have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>Data from studies conducted in animal models and cell culture systems have shown that ginseng extract and specific ginsenosides have beneficial effects on insulin action and glucose metabolism. In diabetic mice, treatment with <italic>P. ginseng</italic> radix or <italic>P. ginseng</italic> (Korean ginseng) stimulates insulin release and improves glucose tolerance and glycemic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Ginsenoside Re increases insulin sensitivity (IS) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) and in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice when administered intraperitoneally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). It is not clear whether consumption of ginseng or ginsenosides affects IS and glucose homeostasis in humans. Most studies conducted in human subjects only evaluated the effect of a single oral dose of ginseng. Of these studies, most (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), but not all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), found that a single dose lowered blood glucose area under the curve (AUC) during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Two studies evaluated the effect of more prolonged daily treatment with GRE or ginsenoside Re on glycemic control in subjects with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). However, the interpretation of the results from these studies is unclear because of confounding factors that could have influenced the outcome measures, such as changes in body weight and physical activity, changes in diabetes medications, and large drop-out rates.</p><p>The purpose of the current study was to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the therapeutic potential of ginseng therapy in overweight and obese subjects with impaired glucose tolerance or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Subjects were randomized to 4 weeks of treatment with GRE (Korean red ginseng), ginsenoside Re, or placebo. The euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp procedure in conjunction with stable isotopically labeled tracer infusion and the frequently sampled modified OGTT (FSOGTT) were used to determine <italic>1</italic>) oral glucose tolerance; <italic>2</italic>) glucose and fatty acid kinetics; <italic>3</italic>) insulin action in adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle; and <italic>4</italic>) &#x003b2;-cell function. Because of variability among ginseng products, we confirmed that our ginseng extract and ginsenoside Re had biological effects on insulin-mediated glucose uptake in isolated muscle strips (D.H. Han and J.O. Holloszy, submitted for publication).</p><sec id="s5"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s6"><title>Study subjects</title><p>Fifteen overweight and obese adults (1 man, 14 women; age: 46 &#x000b1; 3 years, BMI 34 &#x000b1; 2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) participated in this study. Subjects were identified from the Washington University Volunteer for Health database and completed medical evaluation, blood tests, and a 2-h OGTT. Subjects were required to have a new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance and be overweight and/or obese. Potential participants who had any serious medical illnesses were excluded. Subjects had stable weight and were sedentary for at least 3 months before the study. The study was approved by the Human Research Protection Office of Washington University School of Medicine, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Experimental protocol</title><sec id="s8"><title>Body composition.</title><p>Body fat mass and fat-free mass (FFM) were determined by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Hologic QDR 4500; Waltham, MA).</p></sec><sec id="s9"><title>FSOGTT.</title><p>Subjects were admitted to the Clinical Research Unit at 0700 h after subjects fasted overnight. A catheter was inserted into a hand vein, which was heated to 55&#x000b0;C by using a thermostatically controlled box, to obtain arterialized blood samples. Blood samples were obtained to determine plasma glucose, C-peptide, and insulin concentrations before (&#x02212;15 min and 0 min) and after (10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, and 300 min) consuming a 75-g glucose drink.</p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure.</title><p>In the evening on the day of admission, subjects consumed a standard meal, containing 15 kcal/kg FFM at &#x0223c;1800 h, and then fasted until completion of the clamp procedure. At 0600 h, a catheter was inserted into an antecubital vein of one arm for intravenous infusion, and another catheter was inserted in a vein in the opposite hand, which was heated to 55&#x000b0;C by using a thermostatically controlled box, to obtain arterialized blood samples. At &#x0223c;0700 h, a primed, continuous infusion of [6,6-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>]glucose (infusion rate: 0.25 &#x003bc;mol &#x000b7; min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; priming dose: 22.5 &#x003bc;mol/kg), and a primed, continuous infusion of [1,1,2,3,3-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>5</sub>]glycerol (infusion rate 0.08 &#x003bc;mol &#x000b7; min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; priming dose 1.2 &#x003bc;mol/kg) was maintained for 7 h.

Dextrose (20%), enriched with [6,6-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>]glucose to &#x0223c;2.5%, was infused to maintain a plasma glucose concentration of 100 mg/dL. The infusion rates of [<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>]glucose and [<sup>2</sup>H<sub>5</sub>]glycerol were decreased by 75% during the clamp procedure (from 210 to 420 min) to account for the decline in hepatic glucose production and rate of glycerol release into plasma. Blood samples were obtained before the start of the infusions to determine background plasma glucose and glycerol tracer-to-tracee ratios (TTRs) and every 10 min during the final 30 min of the basal and clamp periods to determine glucose, free fatty acid and insulin concentrations, and substrate kinetics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s11"><title>Intervention</title><p>After baseline studies were completed, subjects were randomly assigned to 4 weeks of treatment with either: <italic>1</italic>) placebo capsules (<italic>n</italic> = 5); <italic>2</italic>) Korean red ginseng extract (Spectrum Laboratories, Gardena, CA) (3 g/day for 2 weeks and then 8 g/day for 2 weeks, <italic>n</italic> = 5); <italic>3</italic>) ginsenoside Re (AIPOP, Gangdown-Do, Korea) (250 mg/day &#x000d7; 2 weeks followed by 500 mg/day &#x000d7; 2 weeks, <italic>n</italic> = 5) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc10-2299/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>). The relative content of ginsenoside Re in the GRE used in this study was 13.7 &#x000b1; 1.4%, which is similar to the ginsenoside Re content reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). We confirmed that the batches of ginseng and ginsenoside Re used in this study had biological activity by demonstrating that incubation with ginseng and ginsenoside Re markedly improved insulin-mediated glucose uptake in isolated epitrochlearis muscles obtained from diet-induced insulin resistant rodents (D.H. Han and J.O. Holloszy, unpublished finding) and rectus abdominus strips obtained from obese subjects undergoing gastric bypass surgery (D.H. Han and J.O. Holloszy, unpublished observations). Randomization to group assignment was performed by The Barnes-Jewish Hospital research pharmacist by using a fixed randomization scheme generated by the Moses-Oakford algorithm, with a block size of three and an allocation ratio of 1:1:1. All subjects, investigators, and laboratory personnel performing the analyses were blinded to group allocation until completion of all primary outcome measures. Subjects were seen once per week by a member of the research team during the intervention to assess compliance by history and pill counts and to check for potential adverse events. Subjects consumed &#x0003e;90% of assigned pills, and no adverse events were reported. At the end of the 4-week period, all baseline studies were repeated. Subjects ingested their study medication (placebo, ginseng, or ginsenoside Re) in the morning 30 min before the start of the FSOGTT and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure.</p></sec><sec id="s12"><title>Sample processing and analyses</title><p>Plasma glucose was measured by using an automated glucose analyzer (YSI, Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, OH). Plasma insulin and C-peptide concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay. Plasma glucose and glycerol TTRs were determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>Plasma ginsenoside Re content was evaluated at every time point during the FSOGTT. An aliquot of 100 &#x003bc;L plasma was acidified with perchloric acid (35%) and centrifuged at 1,100<italic>g</italic> for 30 min. The supernatant was added to a solid-phase cartridge (Oasis HLB 1 cc; Waters Corporation, Milford, MA). After the sample was absorbed by the cartridge, the cartridge was washed with 4 mL water. Ginsenosides were eluted with 1 mL 95% methanol in water and evaporated in a SpeedVac (Savant Instruments, Inc., Farmingdale, NY) at 40&#x000b0;C. The residue was reconstituted in 100 &#x003bc;L 95% methanol. After centrifugation at 20,000<italic>g</italic> for 15 min, ginsenoside Re, Rb<sub>1</sub>, and Rb<sub>2</sub> content in the supernatant was evaluated by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). A standard curve was generated using ginsenoside Re of known concentration. This method has a detection limit of 8.0 ng/mL (8.4 nmol/L), which is the minimal concentration of ginseng that is necessary to demonstrate biological activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s13"><title>Calculations</title><sec id="s14"><title>FSOGTT.</title><p>Total AUC for glucose, insulin, and C-peptide during the first 120 min of the FSOGTT were calculated by using the trapezoidal method.

Data from studies conducted in animal models have identified ginsenoside Re as a component of ginseng that affects IS and improves glycemic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Therefore, we conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to determine whether treatment with ginseng or ginsenoside Re improves oral glucose tolerance, &#x003b2;-cell function, and IS in humans. Only subjects with impaired glucose tolerance or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, who presumably have more reversible metabolic dysfunction, were studied to increase our ability to detect a beneficial effect of therapy. Moreover, we used specific sources of ginseng and ginsenoside Re that we found improved skeletal muscle IS in vitro in rodent and human muscle strips. Our data demonstrate that 4 weeks of oral ginseng and ginsenoside Re therapy do not improve oral glucose tolerance, &#x003b2;-cell function, or multiorgan IS. These results refute the popular notion that ingestion of ginseng and its putative active ginsenoside component has beneficial metabolic effects on glucose homeostasis.</p><p>Data from studies conducted in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and in obese, insulin-resistant rodent models have found that GRE and several ginsenoside species (Re, Rb<sub>1</sub>) improve insulin-stimulated glucose disposal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). In most of these animal studies, ginseng and ginsenosides were given intraperitoneally. Oral administration of ginseng or ginsenosides has also been reported to improve oral glucose tolerance and increase insulin-stimulated glucose disposal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). However, the results from these studies are confounded by concomitant weight loss, so it is unclear whether the improvements in IS occurred because of weight loss or because of the insulin-sensitizing properties of ginsenosides. Few studies have evaluated the effect of ginseng in human subjects, and the interpretation of data from these studies is difficult because of differences in experimental design and contradictory results among studies. A single dose of oral ginseng given &#x0223c;40 min before glucose ingestion reduced the glucose AUC during an OGTT by &#x0223c;20% in some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) but had no beneficial effect in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Longer term oral ginseng therapy was evaluated in subjects with type 2 diabetes in two studies. In one study, ginseng treatment (6 g/day for 12 weeks) lowered plasma insulin concentration but did not change HbA<sub>1c</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), whereas ginseng treatment (100&#x02013;200 mg/day for 8 weeks) in the other study was associated with a decrease in fasting plasma glucose concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). However, the interpretation of the results from both studies is confounded by either a large drop-out rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) or concomitant weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Oral ginseng therapy (3 g/day for 14 days) did not improve insulin-mediated glucose disposal, assessed by using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure, in subjects with indinavir-induced skeletal muscle insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p><p>We were unable to detect ginsenoside Re, Rb<sub>1</sub>, or Rb<sub>2</sub> in plasma in our subjects, even though they were prescribed large daily oral doses of ginseng and ginsenoside Re for 30 days and ingested the last dose &#x0223c;30 min before a series of blood samples were obtained to assess blood concentrations. The method we used to measure ginsenoside Re, Rb<sub>1</sub>, or Rb<sub>2</sub> has a threshold of detection of 8 ng/mL, which is below the minimal concentration necessary for biological activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Therefore, our results suggest that ginsenoside Re is poorly absorbed from oral ingestion of ginseng or ginsenoside Re itself. The limited systemic bioavailability of ginseng Re in our subjects helps explain the discrepancy between our findings and the positive effects observed in studies that involved intraperitoneal ginseng injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) or in vitro incubation with ginseng (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Data from pharmacokinetic studies conducted in rodents and people have found that absorption of ginseng metabolites is poor after oral ingestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Plasma ginseng or ginsenoside concentrations were not reported in previous studies that found metabolic benefits of ginseng therapy in study subjects. We are aware of only one study that evaluated oral ginsenoside absorption in human subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). This study was conducted in two subjects who were studied for 12 h after ingesting GRE. Ginsenoside Rb<sub>1</sub> and Rb<sub>1</sub> were detected at very low levels in plasma (&#x0223c;5 nmol/L) in one subject, but ginseng components were not detected in the other subject. Very low levels of ginsenoside Re were found in urine for up to 3 h after ingestion. The poor absorption of orally ingested ginsenosides is likely related to its saponin ring structure, which is poorly soluble in aqueous solutions. In addition, protopanaxtriols (e.g., ginsenoside Re) are rapidly hydrolyzed to ginsenoside Rb<sub>1</sub> in mildly acidic conditions, such as in the stomach, suggesting that the bioavailability of orally administered ginsenoside Re is particularly poor. Our results, in conjunction with data from other studies, suggest that oral ginsenoside products are too poorly absorbed to provide adequate systemic availability to influence metabolic function. We cannot exclude the possibility that other ginsenosides and their metabolites or nonginsenoside components of GRE are bioavailable when given enterally.</p><p>Although it is possible that our study missed a therapeutic effect of ginseng or ginsenoside Re because of the small number of study subjects, we believe that this is unlikely. We used the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure, in conjunction with stable isotopically labeled tracer infusion, to evaluate IS. We have demonstrated that this procedure is very sensitive and reproducible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and would allow us to detect a 25% improvement in insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in the current study with a power of 0.8. Our data did not even detect a trend toward treatment-induced improvement in any of our study outcome measures. Ginsenoside composition varies between commercially available products, so our study cannot eliminate the possibility that other ginseng products could have metabolic benefits.</p><p>In summary, despite the popular use of ginseng products to improve glucose homeostasis and treat type 2 diabetes, we found no evidence that oral ginseng or ginsenoside Re therapy improves &#x003b2;-cell function or IS in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Although parenteral ginseng and ginsenoside Re can markedly enhance insulin action in animal models, our data suggest that minimal bioavailability after oral ingestion limits its therapeutic efficacy in people.</p></sec>
