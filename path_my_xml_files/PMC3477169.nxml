VS411, the first-in-class AV-HALT, combined low-dose, slow-release didanosine with low-dose hydroxycarbamide to accomplish both objectives with a favorable toxicity profile during short-term administration. Five dose combinations were administered as VS411 to test the AV-HALT Proof-of-Concept in HIV-1-infected subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Multinational, double-blind, 28-day Phase 2a dose-ranging Proof-of-Concept study of antiviral activity, immunological parameters, safety, and genotypic resistance in 58 evaluable antiretroviral-na&#x000ef;ve HIV-1-infected adults. Randomization and allocation to study arms were carried out by a central computer system. Results were analyzed by ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, ANCOVA, and two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic> tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>VS411 was well-tolerated, produced significant reductions of HIV-1 RNA levels, increased CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts, and led to significant, rapid, unprecedented reductions of immune activation markers after 28 days despite incomplete viral suppression and without inhibiting HIV-1-specific immune responses. The didanosine 200 mg/HC 900 mg once-daily formulation demonstrated the greatest antiviral efficacy (HIV-1 RNA: &#x02212;1.47 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL; CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell count: +135 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) and fewest adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>VS411 successfully established the Proof-of-Concept that AV-HALTs can combine antiviral efficacy with rapid, potentially beneficial reductions in the excessive immune system activation associated with HIV-1 disease. Rapid reductions in markers of immune system hyperactivation and cellular proliferation were obtained despite the fact that VS411 did not attain maximal suppression of HIV RNA, suggesting this effect was due to the HALT component.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ITEudraCT 2007-002460-98</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>No current external funding sources for this study.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>During viral infections, in particular with Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) infection, if the pathogen is not cleared (ie, chronic disease) a well-documented hyperactivation of the immune system occurs <xref rid="pone.0047485-Mahalingam1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047485-Hunt1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047485-Grossman1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047485-Brenchley1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, leading to a continuous cycle of increased T cell hyperproliferation and, ultimately, systemic inflammation. In HIV disease, however, chronic immune stimulation due to persistent HIV-1 replication, microbial translocation and other factors results in the eventual exhaustion of the immune system, accelerated senescence and, consequently, the onset of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) despite maximally suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens <xref rid="pone.0047485-Finkel1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047485-Grossman2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047485-McCune1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047485-Hellerstein1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>With more than 20 antiretroviral medications available in six major classes <xref rid="pone.0047485-Lubinski1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> the use of multi-drug regimens has resulted in substantial reductions in progression to AIDS, opportunistic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths <xref rid="pone.0047485-Sterne1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.

In order to address this unmet need, researchers at ViroStatics have developed an innovative core platform of antiviral-immune protective compounds called AntiViral-HyperActivation Limiting Therapeutics (AV-HALTs) designed to reduce both HIV-1 RNA levels and excessive chronic immune system hyperactivation. To accelerate drug development and establish the AV-HALT Proof-of-Concept in the treatment of HIV-1 in man, two available generic drugs, a direct-acting antiviral (didanosine) and a hyperactivation-limiting agent (hydroxycarbamide [HC]) were combined in a fixed-dose-combination (FDC) capsule known as VS411.

The study began upon receiving written regulatory approval from the national authorities and local ethical committees operating according to The International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) and the World Health Organization&#x02019;s Guidelines for good clinical (GCP) for trials on pharmaceutical products. All subjects provided written informed consent.</p><p>Eligible subjects were chronically infected adult males or non-lactating females with HIV-1 who were HIV-1 antiretroviral treatment-na&#x000ef;ve with plasma HIV-1 RNA levels greater than 5,000 copies/mL, CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts greater than 250 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, and falling under CDC AIDS Surveillance Case Definition classification stage A or B. To allow for the randomized dosing of didanosine at 400 mg per day, subjects had to weight 60 kilograms or more. Sexually active subjects were required to use adequate and reliable forms of contraception during the study, starting at least one month prior to study drug administration for females and continuing for 30 days after discontinuation of study medication.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included HIV-2 co-infection; primary (acute) HIV-1 infection; less than 60 kg body weight; a series of clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities indicative of anemia, leucopenia, elevated triglycerides, elevated liver transaminases, elevated bilirubin, elevated amylase, elevated lipase, or decreased estimated creatinine clearance; use of co-medication with a known clinically significant pharmacological interaction with one or more of the study drugs; active alcohol or drug abuse (methadone use was allowed); use of proton pump inhibitors; anticipated non-compliance with the protocol; anticipated need to start HAART within the study period; presence of a newly (within 30 days) diagnosed HIV-related opportunistic infection or condition requiring acute therapy at the time of enrolment; having received any investigational drug 30 days prior to the start of the study; chronic active viral hepatitis B or hepatitis C, current or previous pancreatitis; pregnancy; history of, or currently receiving, interferon therapy; presence of didanosine-associated resistance mutations; current or recent (within the prior three months) use of immunomodulatory agents (including vaccines); current or recent (within the prior three months) use of ribavarin; and known allergy to the active or inactive components of VS411.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study Monitoring, Data Collection, Analysis and Statistical Methods</title><p>The study was monitored by an independent CRO, IATEC, who also provided data management. Data were described by means and standard deviations or median and interquartile ranges. The changes from baseline in log-transformed plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and immunological parameters were analyzed by a repeated measurements procedure using a generalized linear model (PROC MIXED of SAS software, SAS version 9.1). The incidence of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities were tabulated and compared between study arms using the chi-square test. All tests of hypotheses were two-sided and used a 5% level of significance. The described analyses were performed on a modified Intent-to-treat (mITT) population (defined as all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study medication [N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;58]), the On-Treatment (OT) population (defined as all subjects who took 75% or more of the planned doses of study medication and complete the study without major protocol violations [N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;56]). Data presented in this paper reflect the mITT population.</p><p>Two sub-populations were also studied to document changes in immunological parameters. Pre- and post-treatment time points were selected for these analyses due to the short nature of the study (ie, 28 days). These analyses were intended to be conducted only on a subset of the total population due to the logistical complexity of adequately collecting, processing and shipping viable cells at multiple time points. Analyses of the panel of four biomarkers were performed upon viable cells obtained from 38 subjects from sites that had the capacity to properly collect, store, and ship viable cell samples per the protocol. An analysis of changes in HIV-1-specific immune responses was performed in a subset of 22 of those 38 subjects with a sufficient number of viable cells remaining after the biomarker analyses. Comparisons of each sub-population to the mITT population showed them to be statistically similar in terms of response to study therapy (data not shown) and baseline demographics. The baseline demographics for the two sub-studies are available as supporting information; see Sub-Study Demographics S1.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>HIV-1 RNA</title><p>Eurofins Medinet B.V.

However, recent discoveries in HIV disease pathogenesis, combined with long-term observations of individuals who experience increased morbidities and mortality while maintaining undetectable HIV-1 RNA levels on ART regimens, suggest that these therapies may not be adequately treating the entire disease state. To do so, future treatment strategies must be disease modifying, seeking to significantly reduce the state of chronic immune hyperactivation that exists in HIV disease and results in the loss of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and the emergence of both AIDS-defining and non-AIDS complications such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, liver or kidney failure, and cognitive disorders reported in HIV-1-infected individuals receiving long-term ART.</p><p>VS411 represents the first entry in a new class known as AV-HALTs that seeks to combine traditional antiviral efficacy (AV) with novel, potentially beneficial reductions in the excessive immune system activation (HALT) associated with HIV-1 disease. Unlike VS411 that possesses both AV and HALT properties, other drugs under evaluation to address immune system hyperactivation, such as atorvastatin, leflunomide and chloroquine (CQ), are thought to possess only the HALT (or HALT-like) activity. As regulatory authorities require antiretrovirals to demonstrate significant reductions in HIV-1 RNA for approval, it will be difficult for agents such as these that lack direct antiviral activity to achieve an HIV indication.</p><p>The effects of statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) on HIV-1 infection have been studied <xref rid="pone.0047485-Giguere1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047485-Moncunill1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047485-Montoya1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. In a Phase 2 clinical trial with HIV-1-infected, ART-na&#x000ef;ve individuals receiving high dose atorvastatin for eight weeks, modest but significant reductions in immune activation markers (CD38 and HLA-DR) on T cells were observed although HIV-1 RNA levels were unaffected <xref rid="pone.0047485-Ganesan1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.</p><p>Another pilot study of the immunomodulatory agent leflunomide for 28 days was performed in HIV-1-infected persons not receiving antiretroviral therapy. Although there was no statistically significant decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA, treatment with leflunomide reduced expression of activation markers (HLA-DR/CD38 co-expression) on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, suggesting that targeting immune activation with immunomodulatory agents may be a feasible strategy, although the presence of the hyperactivation limiting component alone does not seem to be effective in suppressing HIV replication <xref rid="pone.0047485-Read1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.</p><p>CQ significantly reduced the frequency of CD38<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells as well as Ki-67 expression in CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells after one month of therapy <xref rid="pone.0047485-Murray1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. In another study, treatment with a related drug, hydroxychloroquine, lowered several parameters of immune activation in immunological non-responders <xref rid="pone.0047485-Piconi1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>.</p><p>The novelty of the AV-HALT approach is illustrated by the fact that VS411 was specifically designed as a combination of two drugs &#x02013; one an &#x0201c;AV,&#x0201d; the other a &#x0201c;HALT&#x0201d; &#x02013; to simultaneously and efficiently target both excessive immune activation and viral replication. In this Phase 2a study, VS411 successfully achieved Proof-of-Concept for the new AV-HALT class.</p><p>VS411 safely lowered HIV-1 replication (antiviral &#x0201c;AV&#x0201d; effect) over 28 days by a median of 1.5 log<sub>10</sub> without selecting for antiretroviral resistance. The lack of selection for drug resistance was expected as, unlike traditional antiretrovirals, HC targets a highly conserved human cellular enzyme (ribonucleotide reductase) with little, if any, potential for selection of resistance <xref rid="pone.0047485-Donehower1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Moreover, viruses genotypically resistant to didanosine regain phenotypic sensitivity in the presence of HC <xref rid="pone.0047485-Lori3" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047485-Palmer1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>.</p><p>VS411 significantly increased median CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts over 28 days by as much as 135 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. Reducing the doses of HC contained in VS411 from those traditionally administered in the treatment of HIV disease allowed the agent to act as a cytostatic, rather than cytotoxic, drug. As a result, the &#x0201c;blunting&#x0201d; of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell increases historically seen with the didanosine/HC combination was not seen with VS411. In fact, the largest CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell count increase was seen in the didanosine 200 mg/HC 900 mg arm in which doses of both drugs were lowered from their historic dosing.</p><p>This 28-day Phase 2a study also incorporated pre- and post-therapy measurements of four accepted markers of immune system activation &#x02013; Ki-67, PD-1, CD38, and HLA-DR whose expressions were rapidly and significantly reduced by 29.0%, 26.1%, 9.7% and 19.3%, respectively, despite incomplete suppression of HIV-1 RNA levels, suggesting that the effect was due to the HALT component of this AV-HALT combination. After only 28 days of treatment with VS411, the median percentages of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells co-expressing CD38 and HLA-DR were significantly decreased, reaching levels similar to those documented in HIV-1-infected subjects receiving 20 months of ART and with plasma HIV-1 RNA below 1000 copies/mL <xref rid="pone.0047485-Hunt1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Interestingly, the didanosine 200 mg/HC 900 mg arm reduced T cell activation nearly to the level reported for Elite Controllers, for both CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (4.4% versus 3.8%, respectively) and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (16.0% versus 15.5%, respectively) <xref rid="pone.0047485-Hunt2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. These results were achieved in a population mirroring the global pandemic: 50% female and 50% black from both the northern and southern hemispheres.</p><p>Two commercially available drugs, didanosine and HC, were combined into VS411 to be used in this study to test the concept that it is possible to rapidly reduce markers of cellular hyperactivation and proliferation with the new AV-HALT class. Although judged to be safe for short-term use as in this study, this two-drug combination is not, however, a candidate for further drug development or as a treatment for HIV-1 disease due to significant long-term toxicities now associated with didanosine including pancreatitis, lactic acidosis/severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, and non-cirrhotic portal hypertension <xref rid="pone.0047485-VIDEXECpackage1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>.</p><p>The ultimate goal is to discover and develop single-molecule compounds that provide both the &#x0201c;AV&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;HALT&#x0201d; activities. Based upon this successful Proof-of-Concept study utilizing VS411, additional work is now underway to screen, identify and develop new agents that combine both attributes of AV-HALTs, a direct reduction of HIV-1 RNA with reductions of markers of excessive immune activation in a single molecule. By combining the clinical results obtained with VS411 with the in vitro profile of the two drugs comprising it, VS411 can now function as a comparator prototype for identifying additional AV-HALTs. Potential candidates for these &#x02018;second-generation&#x02019; AV-HALTs include molecules targeting additional cellular factors involved in the cell cycle and cellular proliferation that are also known to play critical roles in the life cycle of HIV-1 and other viruses. By targeting human rather than viral enzymes, these single-molecule AV-HALTs could provide additional benefits such as a lower propensity to select for viral resistance and a lack of cross resistance and cross toxicities with currently marketed antivirals.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this Phase 2a study, the two-drug, first-generation AV-HALT VS411 successfully established the Proof-of-Concept that AV-HALTs can combine antiviral efficacy with rapid and potentially beneficial reductions in the excessive immune system activation associated with HIV-1 disease. The rapid reductions in markers of immune system hyperactivation and cellular proliferation were obtained despite the fact that VS411 did not attain maximal suppression of HIV-1 RNA levels, suggesting this effect was due to the HALT component. Although VS411 is not being developed further due to concerns over the long-term toxicities associated with didanosine, VS411 can serve as a comparator AV-HALT prototype reflecting both the desired in vitro and clinical attributes of the this new class. Work is now underway to screen, identify and develop single-molecule, second-generation AV-HALTs as disease-modifying therapies for addition to the armamentarium targeting the HIV and other viruses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0047485.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
