We investigate whether a government-run unconditional cash transfer paid directly to women in poor households had an impact on self-reported happiness. The evaluation was designed as a cluster-randomized controlled trial in rural Zambia across 90 communities. The program led to a 7.5 to 10 percentage point impact on women&#x02019;s happiness after 36- and 48-months, respectively (or 0.19&#x02013;0.25 standard deviations over the control group mean). In addition, women have higher overall satisfaction regarding their young children&#x02019;s well-being, including indicators of satisfaction with their children&#x02019;s health and positive outlook on their children&#x02019;s future. Complementary analysis suggests that self-assessed relative poverty (as measured by comparison to other households in the community) is a more important mediator of program effects on happiness than absolute poverty (as measured by household consumption expenditures). Although typically not the focus of such evaluations, impacts on psychosocial indicators, including happiness, should not be discounted as important outcomes, as they capture different, non-material, holistic aspects of an individual&#x02019;s overall level of well-being.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0015"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="li0005"><list-item id="u0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0005">A government run unconditional cash transfer targeted to households with young children in Zambia increased women&#x02019;s self-reported happiness.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">A randomized control trial (RCT) was used to estimate causal impacts.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">Self-assessed relative poverty is a much larger mediator of program effects than absolute poverty.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="keys0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Happiness</kwd><kwd>Subjective well-being</kwd><kwd>Income</kwd><kwd>Cash transfers</kwd><kwd>Zambia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction and motivation</title><p id="p0020"><disp-quote><p><disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;Happiness is the meaning and the purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence&#x02019;</italic></p></disp-quote></p></disp-quote></p><p id="p0025">Aristotle.</p><p id="p0030">In the past two decades, alternative measures of human progress beyond gross domestic product (GDP) gained importance, shifting focus from solely economic output to more holistic measures of wellbeing (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Stiglitz, Sen, &#x00026; Fitoussi, 2009</xref>). Measures like subjective wellbeing (SWB) provide multi-dimensional and complementary knowledge of the lives and living conditions of individuals and may capture, among others, the evaluation of one&#x02019;s life and levels of emotional health and happiness. Consequently, SWB has become an important and relevant outcome to understand the impact of public policy beyond monetary dimensions (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Kolev &#x00026; Tassot, 2016</xref>). The economics of happiness, or SWB, has focused primarily on the evaluative (or cognitive) aspects of SWB (such as the assessment of life&#x02019;s satisfaction) and to a lesser extent on the emotional or hedonic account of SWB (such as self-reported happiness) (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">MacKerron, 2012</xref>). However, the concepts of life satisfaction and happiness are often used interchangeably in the literature on the assumption that these measures are highly correlated (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">MacKerron, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Stevenson and Wolfers, 2008</xref>).<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">1</xref></p><p id="p0035">The relationship between SWB and income has been at the center of a vibrant debate. Generally, studies have found a positive correlation between income and SWB, a relationship that is stronger at lower income levels (at the micro level) and in poorer countries (at the macro level, albeit controversial) suggesting a diminishing marginal utility of income (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Veenhoven, 1991</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Diener et al., 1993</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Inglehart, 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Frey and Stutzer, 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Diener and Biswas-Diener, 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Blanchflower and Oswald, 2004</xref>). Understanding whether income increases SWB is of intrinsic and instrumental importance. SWB is an end in itself, but it can also be a means to achieve better educational and health outcomes, improve social relationships and economic outcomes including productivity, savings and consumption (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">De Neve et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Oswald et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Bryson et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Gutman and Vorhaus, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Guven, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">De Neve and Oswald, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Goudie et al., 2014</xref>). SWB is also an important determinant of behavior in most spheres of life including eating habits, exercise and weight control, and smoking, all of which have important implications for both individual and societal health and welfare (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Blanchflower et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Pettay, 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Schneider et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Garg et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Strine et al., 2008a</xref>, <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Strine et al., 2008b</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Grant et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Kubzansky et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p id="p0040">The literature on happiness and its relation to income is complex. One of the first, and most contested papers examining the income-happiness relationship concluded that better-off people tend to be happier than poorer ones within any society at a specific point in time; however, rising incomes do not make people happier (the so called &#x0201c;Easterlin paradox&#x0201d;; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Easterlin, 1974</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Easterlin, McVey, Switek, Sawangfa, &#x00026; Smith Zweig, 2010</xref>). Hedonic adaptation (and income habituation), or the tendency to return to a relatively stable level of happiness after positive or negative events, is often used to partially explain the phenomena (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Helliwell et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">MacKerron, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">di Tella et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Easterlin, 1995</xref>). The relative income hypothesis (based on <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Duesenberry, 1949</xref>) has also been put forward to explain the Easterlin paradox: it suggests that people get utility by comparing themselves with a reference group. Stated differently, the level and self-evaluation of one&#x02019;s happiness depends upon relative rather than absolute income as individuals care more about their relative position in society (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Easterlin, 1974</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Clark and Oswald, 1996</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al., 2008</xref>). Further, it has been hypothesized that absolute income is important up to a certain threshold (until basic needs are met); beyond this level of income, more money &#x0201c;no longer improve individual&#x02019;s ability to do what matters most to their emotional wellbeing, such as spending time with people they like, avoiding pain and disease, and enjoying leisure&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Kahneman &#x00026; Deaton, 2010</xref>:4).<xref rid="fn2" ref-type="fn">2</xref> The debates on this relationship have continued partially because studies examining the relationship between happiness and income have been fraught with methodological constraints, thus it has been difficult to establish causality and arrive at a definite conclusion (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">MacKerron, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Stutzer and Frey, 2012</xref>). We employ data from a cluster randomized control trial (RCT) of a government-run anti-poverty program&#x02014;an unconditional cash transfer (UCT) targeted to women in households with young children&#x02014;to provide new evidence on whether &#x02018;money can buy happiness.&#x02019; The social experiment involved 2519 households over 90 clusters, that were randomized to the treatment or control condition in three rural districts in Zambia. The study design allows us to measure the effect of an exogenous increase in income on happiness&#x02014;overcoming methodological constraints due to the simultaneity of emotional SWB and income. We investigate whether the program had an impact on happiness of transfer recipients, virtually all of whom are women, after 36- and 48-months of program participation (from 2010 until 2014). We complement this analysis through investigation of women&#x02019;s satisfaction regarding their children&#x02019;s well-being, representing both cognitive and affective SWB such as satisfaction with their children&#x02019;s health and positive outlook on their children&#x02019;s future.</p><p id="p0045">In addition, to shed light on competing theories underlying the income-happiness relationship, we investigate two potential mediating pathways of change from the intervention to our outcome of interest: consumption expenditures (absolute poverty) versus (self-assessed) relative poverty. For example, if the relative income hypothesis used to explain the Easterlin paradox dominates emotional states in our sample, then we would expect relative poverty to be a stronger mediator of happiness as compared to absolute poverty. However, as our sample is comprised of households in extreme poverty in a resource-low setting, without resources to cover their basic needs (e.g. under the &#x02018;threshold&#x02019;), it is also plausible that absolute poverty will be a significant factor in explaining happiness.</p><p id="p0050">We are not the first to utilize a cash transfer impact evaluation to answer this question. In fact, there is increasing empirical evidence showing the impact of cash on psychosocial and SWB from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), both for large-scale Government programs, as well as for non-governmental organization (NGO) programming. Most of these studies however focus on evaluative measures (e.g. assessment of life&#x02019;s satisfaction), rather than emotional measures of SWB (e.g. self-reported happiness), whereas we primarily focus on the latter.<xref rid="fn3" ref-type="fn">3</xref> One of the few studies on Government programming which we are aware of which examines emotional SWB is the unconditional Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) program in Ghana, which was found to increase happiness by 16 percentage points after 24-months (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Daidone et al., 2015</xref>). Examining the Kenyan Government&#x02019;s Cash Transfers for Orphans and Vulnerable Children, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Handa, Martorano, Halpern, Pettifor, and Thirumurthy (2014)</xref> and <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Handa, Martorano, Halpern, Pettifor, and Thirumurthy (2016a)</xref> find strong impacts on a five-question quality of life scale from caregivers and youth (aged 15 to 25 at endline) 48 months after the onset of the program. <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Kilburn, Handa, Angeles, Mvula, and Tsoka (2018)</xref> find that, after 12 months of transfers, the unconditional Government Social Cash Transfer Program in Malawi had a positive impact on adult recipients satisfaction with own life as measured by a eight-question scale. <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Haushofer and Shapiro (2016)</xref> investigate the impacts of the NGO GiveDirectly&#x02019;s UCT in Eastern Kenya and report impacts over a one-year period on a broad spectrum of outcomes: the program led to a 0.16 standard deviation (SD) increase in happiness (measured using the happiness question from the World Value Survey) and a 0.17&#x0202f;SD increase in life satisfaction. All these studies utilize experimental methods (RCTs), with the exception of the LEAP evaluation, which used quasi-experimental methods (matching). In addition, all programs share common features: they are all unconditional, and targeted to vulnerable rural households, thus beneficiaries represent populations in the lower income distribution in each country.</p><p id="p0055">Our results show the CGP improved the happiness of women in rural Zambia; 48-months after the onset of the program the effect is around 10 percentage points or a 0.25&#x0202f;SD increase over the control group. This effect increases over time, despite the likelihood that a proportion of the sample has graduated from the program at 48-months. We also show that the impact on women&#x02019;s happiness has been accompanied by an improvement in satisfaction regarding their young children&#x02019;s wellbeing (measures which include both affective and cognitive SWB). Complementary analysis suggests that relative poverty is an important channel through which the intervention transmits its effect on women&#x02019;s happiness with 39 percent of the total program effect mediated through relative poverty. Alternatively, very little of the program effect is mediated through household consumption, suggesting that even among this very poor population, relative (rather than absolute) poverty appears to be the more dominant determinant of happiness.</p><p id="p0060">Our paper contributes to the broader literature on the income and happiness relationship in low-income settings, as well as the relatively new but growing evidence linking cash transfers to (emotional) SWB in SSA. The particular feature of this paper is that we focus on a sample of women still in their prime child bearing age (97 percent of our sample is aged 15 to 49 years at baseline) and who are the primary caregivers of young children. Given the important linkages highlighted in the literature between maternal mental health and child outcomes, exploring the impact on mother&#x02019;s happiness is relevant as it could also in turn affect children&#x02019;s well-being. In addition to having direct adverse consequences on the mothers, common maternal mental illnesses such as antenatal depression, anxiety and stress can also lead to sustained negative impacts across the lifespan on the physical, cognitive, and socio-emotional health of the foetus, infant and child (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Atif et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Herba et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Kingston and Tough, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Kingston et al., 2012</xref>). The study also benefits from a well implemented RCT design, enabling a clear causal argument with attribution due to the program. Finally, our results are also notable given the relatively long duration of the evaluation and potential for cash to induce sustainability of the impacts over time.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Child Grant Program (CGP) and evaluation design</title><p id="p0065">The CGP was established by the Zambian Ministry of Community Development and Social Services (MCDSS).<xref rid="fn4" ref-type="fn">4</xref> It is a UCT implemented in three of the most remote and rural districts of Zambia characterized by high poverty, high child malnutrition, morbidity and mortality (Kaputa in Northern Province, and Kalabo and Shangombo in Western Province; see map, <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The program was targeted to all households with at least one child under the age of five years at program initiation and was paid directly to the primary caregiver or mother of the target child, 99 percent of whom are women. During the study reference period (2010&#x02013;2014), beneficiary households received a flat transfer of 120 Zambian Kwacha (rebased, ZMW), corresponding to roughly 24 US dollars, on a bi-monthly basis. The transfer represented an increase by almost a third (27 percent) to the household&#x02019;s pre-program monthly expenditure and was calculated as an amount sufficient to purchase food equivalent of one meal monthly per day on average for all household members. The transfer was distributed through a local pay-point manager and evidence suggests that the implementation was operationally successful (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">AIR, 2011</xref>). The primary goal of the CGP was poverty reduction, with specific objectives focusing on young children outcomes (reduction of child mortality and morbidity, stunting and wasting) and broader specific household outcomes including increasing food security and productive asset ownership.<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Map of Child Grant Program study districts in Zambia.</p></caption><alt-text id="at0005">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p><p id="p0070">The impact evaluation of the CGP was commissioned by the Government of Zambia and UNICEF Zambia as part of the Transfer Project, a consortium of international research partners, civil society and national governments to support improving knowledge and practice on cash transfers in SSA. The study was led by the American Institutes for Research (AIR) in collaboration with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (and in later rounds, with the UNICEF Office of Research&#x02014;Innocenti) and national partners Palm Associates. The evaluation was implemented using a clustered RCT whereby 90 clusters, 30 in each district, were randomly assigned to the treatment or control condition. <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> provides the flowchart of the study design. This process led to a randomly selected, representative sample of 2519 beneficiary households. Since design guidelines indicated that households with a child under five were eligible for the transfer, in the evaluation, in order to make sure that beneficiary households receive the cash transfer for at least two years, only households with a child under age three were sampled at baseline. The baseline survey was conducted in October to November 2010 during the lean season; the treatment arm received the first transfer in February 2011 and four follow-up surveys were subsequently collected at 24-, 30-, 36- and 48-months after baseline.<fig id="f0010"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Flowchart of the Child Grant Program study design.</p></caption><alt-text id="at0010">Fig. 2</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr2"/></fig></p><p id="p0075">Power calculations, accounting for attrition and non-response, were carried out to determine the sample size needed to detect significant effects of the program on anthropometric measures of children zero to 59 months (the smallest subsample expected for analysis of key outcomes).

The target woman for this module is typically the primary caregiver of the eligible child and, in treatment communities, also the cash transfer recipient. Of the lean-season surveys, only the 36- and 48-month surveys included this question, thus we primarily utilize these two rounds in conjunction with baseline statistics. Thus, our final analysis sample is the &#x02018;balanced&#x02019; sample of women who completed the empowerment module and had non-missing responses to key analysis indicators at both 36- and 48-months and were present in the household at baseline.</p><p id="p0085"><xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> reports the background characteristics of the analysis sample at baseline, comprised of 2203 women (1,119 in the control sample and 1,084 in the treatment sample).

The former captures positive affect or emotional states (a range of positive emotions and feelings, for instance, &#x02018;I feel very happy&#x02019;) whereas the latter, more commonly used, depicts individuals&#x02019; assessments of one&#x02019;s life overall (for instance, &#x02018;I think I lead a very positive life&#x02019;) (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Helliwell et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">MacKerron, 2012</xref>).

Specifically, in the 48-month follow-up, the mothers or primary caretakers were asked five statements in reference to the &#x02018;index&#x02019; child (approximately aged three to nine at the time of the follow-up), whether: 1) they are satisfied with their children&#x02019;s life; 2) their children enjoy life; 3) they feel positive about their children&#x02019;s future; 4) they are satisfied with their children&#x02019;s health; and 5) their children are generally happy.

As our original sample contained households with children aged zero to three years at baseline, we expect that a portion of households would no longer be eligible for the transfer 48-months later. We conduct an extension to the main analysis exploiting this variation, disaggregating the sample into households that report currently receiving the transfer and those who report no longer receiving the transfer (29 percent at 48-months). Due to the compositional differences between households with different age target children, in this specification we control for the age (in years) of the youngest child in the household (who proxies for the target child).

However, the estimates are not statistically significantly different from one another. Although this evidence is suggestive, and relies on self-report of transfer receipt, and not official records, it suggests that women who no longer receive the cash transfer (e.g. may have &#x02018;graduated&#x02019; from the program) continue to have significantly higher SWB as compared to control women.</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><label>5.2</label><title>Impacts on women&#x02019;s satisfaction with young children&#x02019;s wellbeing</title><p id="p0140">Women report relatively high satisfaction with their children&#x02019;s wellbeing, with individual indicators across five measures at an average of 4 points (they generally &#x02018;agree&#x02019; with statements, out of five points) and the overall scale averaging approximately 20 points (out of 25 points).

These results are supported by a significant negative impact of the program after 48-months on the extreme, as well as moderate poverty headcounts of 10 and 3 percentage points, respectively (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">AIR, 2016</xref>). Positive impacts on food security scales, including food coping behaviors corroborate findings of positive impacts on food consumption (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Handa et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, the intervention had a strong and significant positive impact on additional measures of financial and economic well-being including household&#x02019;s livestock ownership, ability of households to pay back long-term outstanding debts and women&#x02019;s financial position, through increases in women&#x02019;s cash savings (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Handa et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Natali et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="p0155">Relatedly, we hypothesize that beneficiaries could perceive an increase in their relative position in the community or the society at large (<italic>relative poverty channel</italic>). <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Handa et al. (2018)</xref> explore the impact of the CGP on three relevant indicators, all asked to the primary female caregiver: 1) relative poverty with respect to others (external reference point) and, 2) relative poverty with respect to the past and 3) relative poverty with respect to future expectations (internal reference points). Findings indicate that there is a strong and significant impact on relative poverty, and on the probability of reporting to be better off with respect to the previous year. However, there is no significant impact on future expectations (life will be better in either one, three, or five years) (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Handa et al., 2018</xref>). The impacts on relative measures from past to current position are particularly interesting, as they indicate that over time, hedonic adaptation is not eliminating the positive impact of the income gains due to the cash transfer.</p><p id="p0160">We estimate mediation effects by including relative and absolute poverty in the main regression at 48-months (adjusted, see column (4) of <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). According to <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Imai, Keele, and Tingley (2010)</xref>, to confidently estimate causal mediation, sequential ignorability must be achieved. This implies that treatment must be independent of both potential values of outcome and mediating variables. In addition, the mediators must be independent of all potential values of the outcome conditioned on the observed treatment and pretreatment covariates. The first condition is satisfied due to the experimental design of the evaluation. However, the second condition implies that mediators must also act as effectively randomized among treatment arms (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Keele, Tingley, &#x00026; Yamamoto, 2015</xref>). Therefore, we control for all pretreatment covariates that may confound the relationship between the mediators and happiness, including pretreatment levels of each mediator (absolute and relative poverty).</p><p id="p0165">For absolute poverty, we utilize the value of total monthly per-capita household consumption expenditure, measured by adding the value of over 200 food and non-food items reported by the household, converted in monthly terms, deflating to 2010 levels and logging the final value. For relative poverty we utilize a single question in the survey asking whether the respondent considered the household to be &#x02018;non poor&#x02019;, &#x02018;moderately poor&#x02019; or &#x02018;very poor&#x02019; using an external reference point. To standardize the direction of mediators (e.g. higher values = better off), we constructed a dummy equal to one if the respondent felt the household was comparatively less poor (e.g. &#x02018;non poor&#x02019; or &#x02018;moderately poor&#x02019; as opposed to &#x02018;very poor&#x02019;). We conduct mediation for each of absolute and relative poverty separately, as well as together in the same model (<xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The inclusion of per-capita consumption reduced the treatment effect from 0.103 to 0.095, or about 8 percent, however the coefficient of per-capita consumption is not statistically significant. Alternatively, inclusion of relative poverty reduced the treatment effect to 0.063, a 39 percent reduction, and the relative poverty measure itself is a highly significant predictor of happiness. Including both mediators in the same regression led to a reduction in the treatment effect to 0.061, or a 41 percent reduction. These results suggest that even among an extremely poor population, relative poverty has an important mediating effect on SWB, and this effect appears to dominate that of absolute poverty.<table-wrap id="t0020" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Impact of the Child Grant Program on happiness at 48-month including mediators: Absolute versus relative poverty.</p></caption><alt-text id="at0030">Table 4</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>(1)</th><th>(2)</th><th>(3)</th><th>(4)</th></tr><tr><th/><th>48-months adjusted</th><th>48-months adjusted</th><th>48-months adjusted</th><th>48-months adjusted</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Treatment status=CGP beneficiary</td><td>0.103<sup>***</sup></td><td>0.0948<sup>***</sup></td><td>0.0626<sup>***</sup></td><td>0.0606<sup>***</sup></td></tr><tr><td/><td>(0.0224)</td><td>(0.0224)</td><td>(0.0223)</td><td>(0.0227)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02028;&#x02028;</td><td>&#x02028;&#x02028;</td><td>&#x02028;&#x02028;</td><td>&#x02028;&#x02028;</td><td>&#x02028;&#x02028;</td></tr><tr><td>Absolute poverty=Total monthly consumption per capita (logged ZMW)</td><td/><td>0.0307</td><td/><td>0.00775</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>(0.0205)</td><td/><td>(0.0196)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02028;&#x02028;</td><td>&#x02028;&#x02028;</td><td>&#x02028;&#x02028;</td><td>&#x02028;&#x02028;</td><td>&#x02028;&#x02028;</td></tr><tr><td>Relative poverty=Comparatively less poor</td><td/><td/><td>0.155<sup>***</sup></td><td>0.154<sup>***</sup></td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td/><td>(0.0212)</td><td>(0.0210)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02028;&#x02028;</td><td>&#x02028;&#x02028;</td><td>&#x02028;&#x02028;</td><td>&#x02028;&#x02028;</td><td>&#x02028;&#x02028;</td></tr><tr><td>Constant</td><td>0.829<sup>***</sup></td><td>0.645<sup>***</sup></td><td>0.799<sup>***</sup></td><td>0.788<sup>***</sup></td></tr><tr><td/><td>(0.163)</td><td>(0.180)</td><td>(0.158)</td><td>(0.175)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02028;&#x02028;</td><td>&#x02028;&#x02028;</td><td>&#x02028;&#x02028;</td><td>&#x02028;&#x02028;</td><td>&#x02028;&#x02028;</td></tr><tr><td>Mediator=Absolute poverty</td><td/><td>X</td><td/><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Mediator=Relative poverty</td><td/><td/><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>2203</td><td>2201</td><td>2203</td><td>2201</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.055</td><td>0.057</td><td>0.093</td><td>0.094</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Notes: Estimations use single-difference modeling.

Therefore, as a robustness check, we include binary measures of moderate and extreme poverty (as per national poverty line definitions) and find similar results to those presented in <xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> (not presented, however available upon request). A second critique of the approach of utilizing per-capita household consumption is that the measure is a general household measure and may not be specific enough to mediate women&#x02019;s outcomes. A more specific specification would be able to include individual-specific consumption (e.g. women and child specific) to understand if the mediating effect of consumption depended on the type or nature of expenditure. Unfortunately, as the data collected are largely at the household level, we are unable to provide this robustness check and therefore our results must be interpreted with this caveat in mind.</p></sec><sec id="s0045"><label>7</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0175">Researchers have increasingly sought to understand the effects of public policies on SWB, recognizing the importance of going beyond monetary or economic dimensions of human wellbeing. Thanks to the experimental design, our results provide causal evidence that a bi-monthly, poverty-targeted UCT program improved the happiness of rural women living in remote areas of Zambia. Impacts are large at 7.5 and 10 percentage points, corresponding to a 0.19 to 0.25&#x0202f;SD increase in happiness at 36 and 48 months, respectively. The increase in magnitude of impact at 48-months is particularly notable, since according to official documentation, a portion of the beneficiary households should have &#x02018;graduated&#x02019; from the program. Thus, at the same time that a sub-set of the treatment sample reports no longer receiving regular transfers, the magnitude of the overall impact increased, rather than faded out. These findings overall seem to suggest that the Easterlin paradox does not hold within our sample&#x02014;money (in this case a cash transfer) did result in greater happiness. Compared with existing studies examining the impact of UCTs on self-reported happiness, our findings are broadly in line with <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Haushofer and Shapiro (2016)</xref> who report a 0.16&#x0202f;SD increase in happiness in Kenya after approximately 12-months, but lower than the 16 percentage points impact found by <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Daidone et al. (2015)</xref> in Ghana after 24-months. Corroborating these findings, women also have higher overall satisfaction regarding their young children&#x02019;s well-being, including both cognitive and affective measures of SWB, such as satisfaction with their child&#x02019;s health and positive outlook on their child&#x02019;s future. These findings advance our understanding of the income-happiness relationship, as they represent impact among a unique group of reproductive-age women within a government large-scale program and examine a longer time frame as compared to existing studies.</p><p id="p0180">Our results also shed light on theory concerning the income-happiness relationship. We find evidence that the relative poverty pathway dominates the absolute poverty pathway in explaining treatment effects. These results are robust to different specifications and suggest that even in a resource-low setting, without resources to cover their basic needs (e.g. below the &#x02018;threshold&#x02019;), relative poverty is a major factor explaining happiness. Overall the two indicators of relative and absolute poverty account for approximately 40 percent of the program impact on happiness, unsurprisingly indicating the majority of impact on our affective measure is realized through other factors (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Lucas and Diener, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Tov and Au, 2013</xref>). As our study was not designed to explicitly measure all pathways, a comprehensive examination of all mediation factors is beyond the scope of this analysis.</p><p id="p0185">There are other limitations to the analysis worth mentioning. In particular, we do not have additional standard outcomes of SWB to triangulate findings, including for example, women&#x02019;s life satisfaction which is a cognitive and longer-term measure of SWB compared to our affective measure (happiness). However, we do show that the program improved women&#x02019;s satisfaction regarding their young children&#x02019;s life, a proxy for wellbeing and perceived quality of life of children. Additionally, as our outcomes are collected only in latter waves (36 and 48 months), we are unable to do a more rigorous analysis of changes over time. Nonetheless, our results indicate that UCTs can be a powerful tool for increasing SWB among populations of poor and vulnerable women. These impacts on happiness and SWB should not be discounted in development evaluations, as they are intrinsically linked to, and provide a complementary insight to objective and material measures of health and wellbeing.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibliog0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sbref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>American Institutes for Research (AIR)</surname></name></person-group><chapter-title>Zambia&#x02019;s Child Grant Program: Baseline report</chapter-title><year>2011</year><publisher-name>Author</publisher-name><publisher-loc>Washington, DC</publisher-loc></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sbref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>American Institutes for Research (AIR)</surname></name></person-group><chapter-title>Zambia&#x02019;s Child Grant Program: 48-month impact report</chapter-title><year>2016</year><publisher-name>Author</publisher-name><publisher-loc>Washington, DC</publisher-loc></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref3"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Atif</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lovell</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Rahman</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Maternal mental health: The missing &#x0201c;m&#x0201d; in the global maternal and child health agenda</article-title><source>Seminars in Perinatology</source><volume>39</volume><issue>5</issue><year>2015</year><fpage>345</fpage><lpage>352</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">26164538</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref4"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Baird</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>de Hoop</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ozler</surname><given-names>B.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Income shocks and adolescent mental health</article-title><source>Journal of Human Resources 48</source><volume>no. 2</volume><issue>2013</issue><year>2013</year><fpage>370</fpage><lpage>403</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib5"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref5"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Banerjee</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Duflo</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The economic lives of the poor</article-title><source>Journal of Economic Perspective</source><volume>Col. 1</volume><issue>Part A</issue><year>2007</year><fpage>473</fpage><lpage>552</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib6"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref6"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Baron</surname><given-names>R.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kenny</surname><given-names>D.A.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic and statistical considerations</article-title><source>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</source><volume>51</volume><issue>6</issue><year>1986</year><fpage>1173</fpage><lpage>1182</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3806354</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib7"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref7"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Blanchflower</surname><given-names>D.G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Oswald</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Well-being over time in Britain and the USA</article-title><source>Journal of Public Economics</source><volume>88</volume><year>2004</year><fpage>1359</fpage><lpage>1386</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib8"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref8"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Blanchflower</surname><given-names>D.G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Oswald</surname><given-names>A.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Stewart-Brown</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Is psychological well-being linked to the consumption of fruit and vegetables?</article-title><source>Social Indicators Research</source><year>2012</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib9"><mixed-citation publication-type="other" id="othref0005">Bryson, A., Forth, J. &#x00026; Stokes, L.
