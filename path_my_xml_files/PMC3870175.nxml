continued therapy and compliance at home and to resolve any uncertainties that

reinforcement and manual telephone follow-up have resulted in improved adherence to
medications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref> Discharge education and

undergraduate pharmacist on patients&#x02019; compliance to recommended medication and
lifestyle changes post-operation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was carried out at the Cardiac Surgical Ward and Medical Outpatients Clinic
of Mater Dei Hospital, Birkirkara, Malta. Patients stay at the Cardiac Surgical Ward
until they are discharged and the mean postoperative stay was 5.8 days. They are
then seen by appointment eight weeks after surgery at the Medical Outpatients Clinic
of the same hospital. A multidisciplinary healthcare team, which consists of a
Consultant Cardiac Surgeon and his junior staff, ward nurses led by a nursing
officer, physiotherapists and a rehabilitation nurse looks after this ward.</p><p>A discharge medication chart, giving a pictorial explanation of the time of day
together with a colour photograph of each tablet prescribed was developed and
validated. The discharge medication chart had seven columns for; a photo of each
tablet, name of the tablet (generic and trade name) and a pictorial symbol of the
sun/stars at various times of the day and night to explain morning, noon, afternoon
and night. Another column was named &#x02018;other instructions&#x02019; which was intended to give
further advice, (e.g. taking the medication with food or to stopping medication at a
particular date) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Validation of the
chart was performed before the study initiated. Interpretation of the chart was
sought from a heterogenous group of fifteen persons to make sure the patients will
be able to follow the chart with regards to the pictorial explanation of morning,
noon, afternoon and night, recognition of the medication, the number of tablets and
dose, the frequency and the duration of treatment. The chart was also assessed for
test-retest reliability. Ten cardiac surgical patients were asked a set of questions
regarding the chart interpretation and these same questions were repeated fifteen
days later. The percentage of correct answers from the two periods was tested for
reliability and the Guttman split-half coefficient was 0.992 showing a high degree
of test-retest reliability.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Discharge medication Chart</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pharmpract-09-156-g1"/></fig><p>The &#x02018;Past Medical History&#x02019; and &#x02018;Assessing Patient Compliance&#x02019; questionnaires were
also developed and validated. Validation testing was accomplished by having the
questionnaires reviewed by fifteen persons from different sections of society
including 3 elderly persons. The &#x02018;Past Medical History&#x02019; questionnaire was designed
to build a comprehensive database of the patient&#x02019;s complete health picture. The
&#x02018;Assessing Patient Compliance&#x02019; questionnaire was used to compare patient compliance
between two groups of patients. Since the questionnaires were constructed by the
researcher, an evaluation process was carried out to assess inter-rater and
test-retest reliability of the questions using the Guttmann split-half reliability
coefficient. Guttmann split-half reliability coefficient of 0.994 was obtained for
the inter-rater reliability test, indicating that the interviewer was reliably
interviewing patients and a Guttman split-half reliability coefficient of 0.899 was
obtained for the test-retest reliability test, indicating that the patients were
consistent when answering the questionnaires.</p><p>The Local University Research Ethics Committee gave approval for the study and all
patients gave signed informed consent. The inclusion criteria set for this study
were: undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery or open aortic or mitral valve
replacement; above 18 years of age; able to communicate with the investigator;
mentally competent; willing to take part in the study; sign the consent form and
attend the Out-Patient Clinic at Mater Dei Hospital during the time plan of the
study. Mentally competent patients were defined as having the capacity to understand
information, make decisions, and act reasonably. Every patient who met the study
criteria was invited to take part. Patients who could not communicate with the
investigator, were less than 18 years old, lived in a nursing home where the patient
did not self-medicate or were re-admitted to hospital within 8 weeks of discharge
were excluded from the study.</p><p>The hospital discharge policy, at the time of the study, was that on day of
discharge, the doctor gave verbal and written advice to patients regarding
medication regimen, the physiotherapy team explained exercise regimens and the
rehabilitation nurse discussed the lifestyle changes expected post-surgery.</p><p>Eighty consecutive patients undergoing CABG or heart valve surgery by one surgeon
from August 2008 to February 2009 were included in this study. The patients were
randomised to either receive pharmacist advice in addition to the usual advice given
to patients (the experimental group, n=40) or usual advice only (the control group,
n=40). The two groups were chosen according to the last digit of the patient&#x02019;s
identity card. Those patients having their identity card ending with an odd number
were assigned to the control group and those patients&#x02019; identity card ending with an
even number were assigned to the experimental group.</p><p>On the day of discharge, all patients were interviewed using the &#x02018;Past Medical
History&#x02019; questionnaire. Pharmacist intervention was then offered only to the
experimental group of patients. During the pharmacist intervention session
(approximately 15 minutes per patient), identification of medication, medication
doses, dosage interval and instructions were slowly and clearly explained with the
aid of medication photographs and the discharge medication chart. The investigator
(NZ) made sure that every patient understood the pictorial symbols representing the
time of day and discussed the regimen of the first two medications on the discharge
medication chart and then it was left to the patient to interpret the dosage regimen
of the other medications. This method ensured that every patient understood the
chart fully. The method was validated and a pilot study was done on the cardiac
surgical ward prior to actual study. In addition, the importance of compliance to
oral analgesia and exercise training was stressed together with the importance of
avoiding alcohol and smoking during the recovery period. The usual discharge
procedure was provided to control patients. The complexity of the medical drug
regimes was assessed by finding the mean number of medications and the mean number
of doses per day in both the control and the experimental groups as described by
Masoudi <italic>et al</italic>.(2005).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref> All
patients were re-interviewed at the Outpatients Clinic, eight weeks after discharge
using the &#x02018;Assessing Patient Compliance&#x02019; questionnaire.</p><p>Statistical analysis was carried out on using the Statistical Package for the Social
Services (SPSS) software version 17.0 (SPSS Incorporation, Chicago, USA).
Chi-square, One-Way ANOVA and the Two-Way ANOVA tests were used to test whether
there were any statistically significant differences in the patients&#x02019; compliance
between the two patient groups following the intervention. P value &#x0003c;0.05 was
defined as statistically significant. The patients&#x02019; mean percentage compliance was
calculated by adding up the correct answers (dose, dosage interval and instructions)
of each medication prescribed and this number was then worked as a percentage of the
total number of correct and incorrect answers as described in the literature.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 89 patients were screened for eligibility for inclusion in the study.
Three patients were not eligible (it was not possible to communicate coherently with
1 patient and the other 2 lived in an institution and did not self-medicate).
Eighty-six patients consented to the study. Four patients were re-admitted to
hospital within the 8 week follow-up period and two patients did not turn up for the
interview at 8 weeks. They were excluded from the study and 80 patients completed
the study. The demographic characteristics of the 2 groups of patients are shown in
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. The complexity of the medication
on discharge was similar in both groups. The mean number of different medications
was 4.6 and 4.85 in the control and intervention group respectively. There was no
difference between the two group (p=0.359). The mean number of doses per day was 8.8
in the control group and 9.5 in the intervention group. The difference was not
significant (p=0.475).</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic characteristics of the two groups of patients.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="all"><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Demographics</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> Control group (n=40)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> Intervention group (n=40)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> p-Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female Gender</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7 (17.5%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11 (27.5%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.422</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">63.4 (SD=8.7)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.8 (SD=7.8)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.173</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">CABG</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">35 (87.5%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">37 (92.5%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.709</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Level of education </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.479</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Primary</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27 (67.5%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23 (57.5%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Secondary</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 (30.0%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14 (35.0%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tertiary</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (2.5%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (7.5%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Diabetes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18 (45%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 (30.0%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.248</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hypertension</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13 (32.5%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19 (47.5%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.254</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hypercholesterolaemia</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25 (62.5%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22 (55.0%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.650</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Alcohol intake (define amount)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22 (55%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22 (55.0%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.822</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Smoking History</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27 (67.5%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26 (65.0%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.000</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Family history of IHD</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31 (77.5%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27 (67.5%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.453</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The intervention and the control groups had a mean percentage compliance of 88.2%

three month supplies of drugs.</p><p>Katz <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref> showed that the
use of discharge medication charts, pharmaceutical pictograms and medication
photographs have been shown to improve adherence in the elderly and George
<italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref> documented the
need to use combinations of educational and behavioural strategies to improve
medication adherence in the elderly. In our study the effect of pharmacist
intervention was higher in the elderly than their younger counterparts possibly
because elderly patients needed a more robust and detailed intervention to
understand the medication regimens. However small sample numbers prevented the
attainment of statistical significance and may have given the impression that
control younger patients did better than interventional patients in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>In Malta, primary education included children between the ages of 3 and 10 years,
secondary education between 10 and 17 years and tertiary education referred to
individuals above the age of 18 years who continue to further their studies at
University or College. Pharmacist intervention using medication photographs and
discharge medication charts was effective in patients with primary and secondary
levels of education. This suggests the need for the pharmacist to identify patients
with a low level of education for targeting the intervention. It has been
demonstrated in other published research that patients with limited literacy skills
or limited English proficiency benefit more from pharmaceutical pictograms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref></p><p>Patients did not benefit from pharmaceutical counselling regarding compliance to oral
analgesia and exercise training and on the avoidance of alcohol and smoking during
the post-operative phase. Moreover, pharmacist intervention did not have an effect
on patients&#x02019; perception to pain intensity, the frequency of seeking advice and the
frequency of exercise performance post-cardiac operation. It is possible that both
groups receive advice on these aspects as part of the normal hospital discharge
process. The ward physiotherapists regularly counsel patients regarding their
posture, movement, activity and physical exercise postoperatively. All patients are
prescribed at least four weeks of regular analgesia and are specifically told by the
cardiothoracic consultant and his medical staff not to miss analgesics and to
contact the hospital staff if they feel pain despite the analgesia.</p><p>A limitation of this study is the small sample size and that no formal sample size
was calculated before the study was initiated. Another limitation was that the
questionnaires were constructed by the researcher but the evaluation process before
the study commenced showed high inter-rater and test-retest reliability in answering
the questionnaires questions. The investigator knew to which group any patient
belongs and this may give rise to potential bias but the questions in &#x02018;Assessing
Patient Compliance&#x02019; questionnaire were simple requiring a straightforward answer
leaving little room for bias. The results and conclusions of this study depends on
patients&#x02019; replies so misleading or untruthful answers about their medication
regimens effects the outcome of the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Pharmacist intervention together with the use of medication photographs,
pharmaceutical pictograms and discharge medication charts may improve heart surgery
patients&#x02019; compliance during the post-operative period. Such interventions are mostly
effective in the elderly and patients with limited literacy skills. Following the
results of this study the hospital authorities have appointed a part time pharmacist
to the cardiac surgical ward.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Competing interests: None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other"><source>Operating Theatre Activity for 2009</source>. Operating
