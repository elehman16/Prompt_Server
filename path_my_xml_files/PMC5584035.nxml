Observational studies indicate that adults infected with HIV with low vitamin D status may be at increased risk of mortality, pulmonary tuberculosis, and HIV disease progression. Growing observational evidence also suggests that low vitamin D status in pregnancy may increase the risk of adverse birth and infant health outcomes. As a result, antiretroviral therapy (ART) adjunct vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation may improve the health of HIV-infected pregnant women and their children.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">The Trial of Vitamins-5 (ToV5) is an individually randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of maternal vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (cholecalciferol) supplementation conducted among 2300 HIV-infected pregnant women receiving triple-drug ART under Option B+ in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. HIV-infected pregnant women of 12&#x02013;27 weeks gestation are randomized to either: 1) 3000&#x000a0;IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub> taken daily from randomization in pregnancy until trial discharge at 12&#x000a0;months postpartum; or 2) a matching placebo regimen. Maternal participants are followed-up at monthly clinic visits during pregnancy, at delivery, and then with their children at monthly postpartum clinic visits. The primary efficacy outcomes of the trial are: 1) maternal HIV disease progression or death; 2) risk of small-for-gestational age (SGA) births; and 3) risk of infant stunting at 1&#x000a0;year of age. The primary safety outcome of the trial is incident maternal hypercalcemia. Secondary outcomes include a range of clinical and biological maternal and child health outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The ToV5 will provide causal evidence on the effect of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation on HIV progression and death, SGA births, and infant stunting at 1&#x000a0;year of age.

In 2015 the World Health Organization (WHO) updated their PMTCT guidelines to universally recommend Option B+ in which all HIV-infected pregnant women initiate lifelong triple-drug ART, irrespective of clinical or immunologic status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition to avoiding a CD4 T-cell based ART initiation criterion, additional rationales for utilizing Option B+ include that pregnant women take triple antiretrovirals for their own health, ART prevents mother-to-child transmission of HIV for the current, as well as future, pregnancies, and mothers also avoid the risks associated with starting and stopping antiretrovirals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Due to evidence from the Malawian experience with Option B+ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], the HIV care and treatment program in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, started utilizing the Option B+ approach in 2013.</p><p id="Par38">The public health approach of Option B+, if universally implemented, may virtually eliminate mother-to-child HIV transmission, but will also lead to an estimated 1.5 million children per year being born HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) and exposed to triple antiretrovirals in utero [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In resource-limited settings, HEU children have an estimated two- to three-times risk of mortality as compared with children born to HIV-uninfected women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. HEU children also appear to be at increased risk of poor birth outcomes and postnatal growth faltering as compared with HIV-unexposed children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A few potential mechanisms, independent of maternal sociodemographic differences, which may lead to increased risk of poor health outcomes among HEU children include exposure to antiretroviral drugs, increased exposure to pathogens, and deficits in immune responses to vaccination and pathogens, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There is also growing evidence that exposure to triple antiretrovirals in utero among HEU children may lead to increased risk of postnatal growth faltering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A recent study in Botswana found HEU infants exposed to triple antiretrovirals in utero had lower length at birth, and at 6 and 24&#x000a0;months of age compared to HEU infants exposed to zidovudine monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. As a result, low-cost ART adjunct interventions are needed to improve birth outcomes and linear growth of HEU children in resource-limited settings.</p><p id="Par39">Vitamin D is a potent immunomodulator which plays a prominent role in the control of intracellular pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Therefore, HIV-infected individuals with low levels of vitamin D may have poorer control of HIV replication and immunologic response to other intracellular infections, notably <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Multiple observational cohort studies in both high-income and resource-limited settings have determined that HIV-infected adults with low vitamin D status are at increased risk of mortality, incident tuberculosis (TB), and HIV progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, members of our research group have conducted the only cohort study of vitamin D and clinical outcomes among HIV-infected pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In this study of HIV-infected pregnant Tanzanian women conducted prior to the introduction of ART, women with a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;32&#x000a0;ng/mL in the second trimester (12&#x02013;27 weeks gestation) had 25% increased risk of progression to WHO HIV stage III disease, and these morbidity benefits appeared to increase linearly up to 70&#x000a0;ng/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Women in the highest quintile of 25(OH)D also had 42% lower risk of all-cause mortality as compared to those in the lowest quintile. As a result, provision of ART adjunct vitamin D supplementation may improve the health of HIV-infected pregnant women, even in equatorial settings where levels of deficiency may be low.</p><p id="Par40">In addition to the maternal benefits, children born to HIV-infected mothers with adequate levels of vitamin D in pregnancy and during lactation may also experience health benefits. The only published study of maternal vitamin D in pregnancy and child health outcomes among HIV-infected pregnant women is the previously mentioned cohort study of Tanzanian women who did not receive ART conducted by members of our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We found that children born to mothers with low vitamin D concentrations in the second trimester (25(OH)D&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;32&#x000a0;ng/mL) had significantly increased risk of stunting, being underweight, and reporting cough during their first 5&#x000a0;years of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. There was also some indication that low vitamin D levels were associated with increased risk of small-for-gestational age (SGA) infants, but results were not statistically significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">In contrast to the sparse data among HIV-infected pregnant women, a relatively large number of observational maternal vitamin D studies have been conducted among HIV-uninfected women, primarily in high-income settings. A meta-analysis of 24 observational studies conducted among HIV-uninfected women determined that 25(OH)D levels&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;20&#x000a0;ng/mL were associated with an approximate 50% increased risk of SGA and preterm delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Despite supportive observational evidence, few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of vitamin D supplementation have been published to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. A trial conducted by Brooke and colleagues among 126 pregnant women of Asian descent in the UK found some indication that 1000&#x000a0;IU vitamin D/day may decrease the risk of SGA, but results were not statistically significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Similar nonsignificant benefits on SGA were also found in another small trial conducted among 180 pregnant women in the UK which utilized a single bolus dose of 200,000&#x000a0;IU vitamin D or a daily vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplement of 800&#x000a0;IU vitamin D as compared to placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In a recent randomized trial conducted among 160 Bangladeshi pregnant women, infants born to women supplemented with 35,000&#x000a0;IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub> per week in the third trimester of pregnancy had significantly increased length-for-age <italic>z</italic>-scores (LAZ) at 1&#x000a0;year of age compared to infants born to mothers receiving placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A small trial of maternal vitamin D supplementation in Iran also determined that pregnant women with 25(OH)D&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;ng/mL at 24&#x02013;26 weeks gestation randomized to 50,000&#x000a0;IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub> per week or 400&#x000a0;IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub> per day had significantly increased birthweight compared to those receiving placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis of RCTs found that vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy significantly increased birth weight and birth length but had no effect on preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, SGA, preterm birth, and cesarean section [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Overall, small randomized trials suggest that vitamin D supplementation may significantly improve some birth outcomes; however, these trials were likely underpowered to detect moderate differences in maternal and child health outcomes and their small sample size also limits the generalizability of their findings.</p><p id="Par42">The WHO currently does not recommend routine vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy owing to a lack of sufficient evidence for an effect on maternal and child health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

The trial is conducted at five PMTCT sites in Dar es Salaam, including Mnazi Mmoja Hospital, Buguruni Health Center, Mbagala Rangi Tatu Hospital, Sinza Hospital, and Tabata A Dispensary. These sites were selected since they are among the largest PMTCTs in Dar es Salaam in terms of patient numbers according to program records. All PMTCT sites are attached to ANC clinics. Research nurses and clinic staff were uniformly trained before the start of the study and have refresher meetings at least every 6&#x000a0;months or as issues arise.</p><p id="Par51">At the first screening visit, research nurses identify HIV-infected pregnant women and assess eligibility criteria. Study nurses confirm pregnancy with a urine pregnancy test and gestational age is assessed through the report of the last menstrual period. Pregnant women receive HIV testing as part of routine antenatal care in Tanzania and women with unknown HIV status receive HIV testing with two licensed rapid assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. If the HIV rapid assays are inconclusive (first test positive and second negative), the first and second HIV rapid assay are repeated following the same algorithm. If the results are still inconclusive upon repeat testing, the pregnant woman is advised that she may be in the acute HIV infection period and be asked to return for a repeat HIV testing in 2&#x02013;4 weeks. Potential participants self-report the location of their residence and any plans to move out of the study area in the next year. Pregnant women who meet all other eligibility for ToV5 screening are then asked to provide written informed consent for a blood draw to screen for prevalent hypercalcemia. Serum calcium and albumin concentrations are assessed with the Roche Cobas Integra 400 Plus. Albumin-adjusted serum calcium concentration is then calculated using the following equation: calcium (mg/dL)&#x02009;=&#x02009;total calcium (mg/dL)&#x02009;+&#x02009;0.8&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;[4&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;albumin (g/dL)] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].

For pregnant women with normal albumin-adjusted calcium concentrations, study nurses reconfirm enrollment eligibility, including being within the range of 12&#x02013;27 weeks gestation, and written informed consent for trial enrollment is sought.</p><p id="Par52">Pregnant women who consent for ToV5 enrollment are individually randomized 1:1 to the vitamin D<sub>3</sub> or placebo arm. Randomization procedures were designed for complete allocation concealment and blinding of all participants, clinic staff, senior research staff, and trial statisticians. Trial arm allocation is performed according to a computer-generated randomization list (generated off-site by a nonstudy statistician) of 2300 individuals with sequence blocks of 10, stratified by study clinic. Two nonstudy statisticians will hold the randomization list codes until completion of primary analyses or until requested by the DSMB. The ToV5 DSMB reviews event rates every 6&#x000a0;months and will recommend any necessary changes to the trial sample size to maintain statistical power. All serious adverse events (SAEs) that are at least possibly related to the study regimen or activities are reported to all Institutional Review Boards within 24&#x000a0;h of Principal Investigator notification as per regulatory guidelines. An independent study pharmacist prepares the vitamin D<sub>3</sub> and placebo regimen by labeling bottles with participant IDs based on the randomization list. At the randomization visit, allocation concealment is performed by assigning eligible pregnant women who consented for trial randomization to the next available numeric participant ID which corresponds to a set of prelabeled regimen bottles with the participant ID. As a result of these randomization procedures, all trial participants, research staff, and trial statisticians are not able to determine the allocated trial arm for any trial participant or identify trial participants who are on the same trial regimen. Allocation is completely concealed.</p><p id="Par53">At the randomization visit, all study participants receive a full clinical examination from study physicians, they have their HIV disease stage assessed according to the WHO criteria, and all comorbidities are treated as per Tanzanian standard of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Nurses also administer a standardized questionnaire to collect information on sociodemographics, symptoms during the last 30&#x000a0;days (fever, cough, etc.), depression, anxiety, social support, and physical activity.

At all prenatal visits, study physicians perform a full clinical examination, assess WHO HIV disease stage, and treat all comorbidities in accordance with the Tanzanian standard of care. Nurses collect weight, MUAC, fundal height, and blood pressure. Study nurses also assess compliance with the trial regimen by counting the number of unconsumed capsules in returned regimen bottles. At the end of each visit participants are given a new regimen bottle containing 45 capsules of their randomized regimen.

Provision of lifelong ART for all HIV-infected pregnant women may nearly eliminate mother-to-child HIV transmission, but will also lead to exposure of about 1.5 million HEU children every year to triple antiretrovirals in utero [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) infants are at increased risk of mortality, and exposure to triple antiretrovirals in utero may further increase the risk of small-for-gestational age births and linear growth faltering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Accordingly, the ToV5 was designed to examine vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation as a low-cost ART adjunct intervention which may improve maternal health, birth outcomes, and linear growth for HIV-infected Tanzanian pregnant women and their children.</p><p id="Par65">A search of clinicaltrials.gov determined the only other clinical trial of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> among HIV-infected individuals with mortality, HIV progression, or morbidity as primary or secondary outcomes is an ongoing study called the &#x0201c;Trial of Vitamin D in HIV Progression&#x0201d; (NCT01798680). This trial is also conducted by our research group and is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation among HIV-infected men and nonpregnant women conducted in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. As a result, the ToV5 will likely be the first randomized trial to determine the effect of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation on mortality and HIV disease progression among HIV-infected pregnant women. An additional search determined at least two trials of maternal vitamin D supplementation trials for improvement of birth outcomes and child linear growth that are ongoing or completed and to be published. A randomized trial of a maternal (4000&#x000a0;IU daily) and neonatal (400&#x000a0;IU daily) vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation versus placebo on maternal and neonatal complications was completed in rural Pakistan and results are to be published (NCT01229189). In addition a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial called the Maternal Vitamin D for Infant Growth (MDIG) study is currently being conducted in Dhaka, Bangladesh (NCT01924013) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The primary aims of the MDIG are to determine the effect of a range of maternal vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation regimens in pregnancy (4200&#x000a0;IU/week, 16,800&#x000a0;IU/week, and 28,000&#x000a0;IU/week) on infant length at 1&#x000a0;year as compared with placebo and to determine the effect of a postpartum vitamin D<sub>3</sub> regimen of 28,000&#x000a0;IU/week versus placebo on length at 1&#x000a0;year of age among infants of mothers who received 28,000&#x000a0;IU/week vitamin D<sub>3</sub> during pregnancy. As a result, we will likely be the first trial to examine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on birth outcomes and linear growth in the African context and for infants born to HIV-infected mothers.</p><p id="Par66">Overall, the ToV5 will provide causal evidence regarding whether vitamin D<sub>3</sub> should be considered as an ART adjunct intervention to improve maternal health, birth outcomes, and linear growth for Tanzanian HIV-infected pregnant women and their infants. The trial will also provide evidence for the effect of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation on a wide range of secondary maternal and child health outcomes. The trial results will be communicated in academic journals and at the national and local levels in Tanzania through policy briefs and dissemination meetings. The results of ToV5 will likely be generalizable to HIV-infected pregnant women and their children in similar resource-limited settings utilizing the Option B+ approach.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par67">Trial enrollment started on 15 June 2015 and recruitment is ongoing as of 30 July 2017.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec18"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par74">
