Approximately 1 billion individuals worldwide are affected by hypertension.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> In the United States, nearly a third of the adult population is hypertensive, and the prevalence of hypertension increases with age. The lifetime risk for hypertension in middle-aged adults approaches 90% in the United States.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Many patients (46%) with known cardiovascular disease are hypertensive, and 72% of them have experienced a stroke that accounted for approximately 15% of the 2.4 million deaths in 2009.<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> In 2008, the estimated direct and indirect cost of hypertension was $69.9 billion. It has been suggested that individuals with blood pressure (BP) levels greater than 120/80&#x02009;mmHg (systolic/diastolic blood pressure [SBP/DBP]) consider complementary methods to help decrease blood pressure, when clinically appropriate.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>To search for a therapy that offers minimal adverse effects, we need targeted approaches directed at the underlying mechanisms of hypertension. Although Western medical science has developed many treatment strategies to control hypertension, antihypertensive medical therapies are not perfect and are often associated with adverse effects. In this regard, drug therapy indiscriminately blocks many receptors, leading to unwanted responses,<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref></sup> including serious injuries associated with falls in older patients.<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Therefore, it is imperative to identify more effective approaches to achieve optimal control of hypertension.</p><p>Adverse effects of currently available therapy to control hypertension have sparked a growing interest in alternative medical treatments, such as acupuncture.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> However, despite the increasing worldwide interest in complementary medical therapy, including acupuncture,<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> many Western physicians are reluctant to recommend this medical modality because its efficacy in the treatment of hypertension remains controversial and the physiologic mechanisms that account for its hypotensive actions are not clear.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>Several studies have evaluated the BP-lowering actions of acupuncture in patients with hypertension, but their findings are inconclusive.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Some researchers have suggested that acupuncture can decrease elevated blood pressure,<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref></sup> while others have concluded that there is little or no effect.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Prior acupuncture studies had weaknesses. For example, the sample sizes were small and were not calculated a priori, randomization has been rare, and many studies lacked adequate control groups using acupoints that can serve as effective controls.<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The follow-up period after treatment generally has been nonexistent or inadequate.</p><p>Some studies relied on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory involving meridian and Qi hypotheses to apply stimulation rather than applying modern scientific principles to guide the acupuncture therapy.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The practice of TCM depends on history and physical examination to classify patients and to guide the selection of acupoints, ultimately leading to the selection of different acupoints for individual patients.<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Hence, standardized approaches to select acupoints for stimulation are not used in TCM-based studies. While acupuncturists using TCM usually stimulate several acupoints, some of these acupoints have minimal input to cardiovascular centers of the brain.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;21</xref></sup> Furthermore, patients in many studies were receiving antihypertensive medications.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> While this trial design addresses the added value of acupuncture, it can lead to variable results if patients change medication dosing during the clinical trial. Additionally, most studies relied on intermittent cuff BP measurements rather than ambulatory monitoring. Intermittent cuff measurements can introduce observer bias<sup><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and do not reflect BP throughout the day. Thus, rigorous, properly designed clinical trials to evaluate the influence of acupuncture in hypertension are required.</p><p>Mechanistic laboratory studies have demonstrated that acupuncture modulates neurohumoral regulatory systems and hence cardiovascular function.<sup><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25&#x02013;28</xref></sup> We have demonstrated in a series of experimental investigations the mechanisms and actions of acupuncture in models of elevated BP associated with reflex sympathoexcitation.<sup><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> These studies suggest that bilateral electroacupuncture (EA) at select acupoints inhibits sympathetically mediated demand-induced myocardial ischemia by lowering blood pressure to decrease oxygen demand.<sup><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Using a point-specific approach to acupoint stimulation, we further demonstrated that acupuncture at Neiguan-Jianshi and Zusanli-Shangjuxu (PC 5-6 and ST 36-37), in contrast to EA at Pianli-Wenliu and Guanming-Xuanzhong (LI 6-7 and GB 37-39), modulates elevated BP.<sup><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> We also have shown that low-frequency, low-intensity EA (intensity just below motor threshold) causes the largest decreases in reflex-induced hypertension.<sup><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Repeated EA (PC 5-6+ST 36-37) prolongs the lowering of blood pressure.<sup><xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> These experimental findings provided guidance in formulating the current study, which was designed to test the overall hypothesis that weekly EA at PC 5-6+ST 36-37 (active) but not LI 6-7+GB 37-39 (control) acupoints for 8 weeks decreases BP for a prolonged period in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. We used 24-hour ambulatory BP measurements to monitor EA inhibition of peak and average SBP and DBP and to identify high and low responders to EA. We also prospectively investigated the subhypothesis that EA application to active points for 8 weeks reduces peak and average SBP in high responders through reduction in sympathetic activity and therefore ultimately circulating norepinephrine, renin, and aldosterone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s003"><title>Trial design</title><p>We enrolled 98 patients with mild to moderate hypertension, defined as SBP/DBP &#x02265;140&#x02013;180/90&#x02013;99&#x02009;mmHg.<sup><xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> All patients had an SBP or DBP within the hypertensive range.

By using ambulatory monitoring (Spacelabs Healthcare, Snoqualmie, WA), we recorded 24-hour SBP, mean BP, and diastolic BP and heart rate every 30 minutes during daytime and every hour at night. A medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, laboratory evaluation, most recent stress test, and cardiac echocardiogram, if applicable, were obtained for each patient.

No patients fell into this category. Female nonpregnant hypertensive patients were asked to conform to a medically acceptable method of birth control. All procedures were conducted at the Institute of Clinical Translational Sciences (ICTS) in UCI Medical Center and at the UCI campus. Patients were instructed to report any complications, including bleeding, bruising, pain, infection, and any other adverse effects.

Patients were treated in the supine position. Cuff BP was recorded before and after the 30 minutes of weekly treatment. Ambulatory pressures were measured 24 hours before and after EA treatment. Peak and average SBP, DBP, and mean BP were recorded. Peak BP represented the single highest 24-hour recorded pressure. We evaluated pressures surrounding peak pressure to avoid isolated artifacts. After the initial course of 8 weeks of EA at PC 5-6+ST3 6-37 or LI 6-7+GB 37-39, subgroups of patients were selected for their willingness to continue in the follow-up or crossover study. Thus, after the initial course of 8 weeks of EA treatment, BP in a subset of 21 patients was recorded monthly in the absence of EA for 2 additional months of follow-up to evaluate the long-lasting effect of acupuncture. After EA treatment, 6 patients declined to continue with the follow-up despite encouragement. The crossover protocol was applied sequentially to evaluate the BP responses to randomized stimulation of first one set then the second set of acupoints. After the first 8-week period of treatment, at least a 2-week washout period was implemented. Thereafter, an additional 8 weeks of therapy was provided for the other set of points. Thus, 17 patients received stimulation sequentially at both sets of points.</p></sec><sec id="s007"><title>Laboratory Procedures</title><p>Blood was drawn at the onset of the study and within 1 month at end of 8 weeks of EA in a subgroup of patients.

Weekly acupuncture treatment at PC 5-6+ST 36-37 for 8 weeks decreased both SBP and DBP in hypertensive patients. The BP-lowering effect of acupuncture was slow in onset and long-lasting. Peak and average SBP decreased by 8 and 6&#x02009;mmHg, respectively, in response to EA applied to PC 5-6+ST 36-37 acupoints in these patients. DBP was reduced by 4&#x02009;mmHg after 8 weeks of treatment. Weekly stimulation at these points reduced elevated SBP and DBP by 4 weeks of therapy.</p><p>To avoid any influence of changes in medication dosage and to observe the BP response to stand-alone therapy, none of the enrolled patients were taking antihypertensive medications. Our observations contrast with those described in a recent review, which concluded that acupuncture is effective only as an adjunct therapy to antihypertensive drug treatment.<sup><xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> In fact, the current study demonstrated improvements in both SBP and DBP with acupuncture in the absence of antihypertensive drugs. A previous study of patients mostly receiving medications reported a decrease in SBP of 6.4&#x02009;mmHg after 22 treatments over a 6-week period.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Although the current study applied only about one third of the number of treatments and did so less frequently and over a longer period to patients not receiving antihypertensive medication, the reduction in average SBP appears similar to that seen in other trials. This decrease in peak SBP, as noted below, may reflect differences in application of acupuncture and importantly may reduce the risk for aneurysms, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases.<sup><xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup></p><p>Generally, acupuncture treatment at variable points selected by acupuncturists is not standardized but rather is based on TCM symptom diagnosis of hypertensive patients.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> In contrast, we used a standardized set of acupoints that experimentally have been shown to stimulate underlying neural pathways that project to the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus midbrain periaqueductal gray and brain stem cardiovascular centers, which regulate sympathetic outflow. Stimulation at the PC 5-6 and ST 36-37 acupoints is clinically used to treat several cardiovascular conditions, including angina, hypertension, and arrhythmias.<sup><xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48&#x02013;51</xref></sup> Conversely, acupuncture at LI 6-7 and GB 37-39 acupoints, which provide less input to cardiovascular regions in the brain,<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> has been used to treat noncardiovascular conditions, such as throat pain, headache, and leg pain.<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> Similar to experimental observations using low-current, low-frequency EA at PC 5-6+ST 36-37,<sup><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> stimulation of these acupoints in hypertensive patients in the present study was substantially more effective in lowering BP than EA at LI 6-7+GB 37-39. Hence, we consider LI 6-7+GB 37-39 acupoints to be point-specific control points.</p><p>Approximately 70% of patients were highly responsive to acupuncture, a rate that is similarly efficacious to that noted in previous studies of elevated BP and pain.<sup><xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> At the end of 8 weeks of treatment, the efficacy of EA in the high responders was higher than in group overall (average SBP, 11 versus 6&#x02009;mmHg; peak SBP, 16 versus 8&#x02009;mmHg). Furthermore, a small subgroup of high responders demonstrated an average SBP decrease of 16&#x02009;mmHg over a 6-month period of monthly reinforcement treatment. Experimental studies suggest that responsiveness may be related to cholecystokinin-8 in the brain, which antagonizes EA-related opioid actions in brain stem regions that regulate sympathetic outflow during EA.<sup><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> Experimental studies have shown that EA-associated reductions in reflex elevations in BP are related to decreased sympathetic outflow.<sup><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> The present study also found that, compared with low responders, highly responsive patients began the study with higher baseline plasma levels of norepinephrine and responded to EA with decreases in circulating norepinephrine and renin activity. In this regard, the study demonstrated that elevated norepinephrine and renin in hypertensive patients likely participate in the long-lasting BP changes occurring with a course of acupuncture therapy. Although the sample sizes on plasma hormones are small, the data imply that repeated acupuncture application influences sympathetic outflow and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.</p><p>A recent meta-analysis noted substantial variability in findings between high-quality acupuncture BP-lowering trials with Jadad scores of 4&#x02013;5.<sup><xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> The present study relied heavily on our past experimental observations that evaluated the response to EA in acute reflex-induced hypertension.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup> These previous studies guided our selection of sets of standardized acupuncture points (including points that have strong and others that exert negligible effects on elevated BP), as well as the frequency, intensity, and duration of EA stimulation. For example, EA at PC 5-6 and ST 36-37 acupoints have been shown experimentally to decrease elevated BP and sympathetic outflow, including renal nerve activity for prolonged periods.<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> Mechanisms underlying the long-lasting acupuncture effects includes central neural processing through several neurotransmitter systems acting in long-loop neuronal pathways, extending from the ventral hypothalamus through the midbrain to the medulla, and reverberating circuitry as well as transcriptional regulation by enkephalins following repetitive application.<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59&#x02013;62</xref></sup> The present study demonstrates that EA modulation of peak SBP and average SBP lasted for at least a month after EA and that BP eventually returned to pretreatment values by 2 months. Although EA lowering of SBP and DBP was slow in onset, the reductions were effective in a small subgroup of patients and could be prolonged by monthly reinforcement therapy for at least 6 months.</p><p>As such, our observations in hypertensive patients confirm our experimental observations, which have suggested that the effects of EA are slow in onset and long-lasting.<sup><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> The delayed onset of the EA-associated hypotensive response may explain why one study of limited duration did not observe EA hypotensive responses.<sup><xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref></sup> In addition, a study that evaluated the duration of post-EA treatment 3 months after termination may have missed the long-lasting (1-month) acupuncture effect.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>In conclusion, our study suggests that EA has a stronger effect on elevations in SBP than on elevations in DBP. The efficacy of EA in treating systolic hypertension may be especially important for patients who are &#x0003e;60 years of age.<sup><xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> With advancing age, small artery constriction and reduced compliance boost the reflected component of the pulse wave and hence increase SBP, the principal component of BP that is modulated by acupuncture.<sup><xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></sup> Furthermore, EA-associated reductions in SBP decrease the double product and myocardial oxygen consumption<sup><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and are beneficial in reducing demand-induced ischemia.<sup><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Spikes in SBP related to stress and the resulting increase in oxygen demand place patients with coronary disease at greater risk for ischemia, as demonstrated by Holter monitoring detection of transient ST-segment changes consistent with ischemia.<sup><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></sup></p><p>Because EA decreases both peak and average SBP, this therapy may decrease the risk for stroke, peripheral artery disease, heart failure, and myocardial infarction in hypertensive patients.<sup><xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> Even small increases in SBP and DBP increase the risk for aneurysm.<sup><xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> Thus, although decreases in SBP and DBP were relatively small, in the 4&#x02013;13&#x02009;mmHg range, these small reductions by EA potentially are clinically meaningful. It is clear, however, that further studies aimed at acupuncture's potential to reduce cardiovascular risk are warranted.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s020" sec-type="ack"><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We are grateful to Dr. Liang-Wu Fu, who provided critical comments in the preparation of the manuscript, and to Drs.
