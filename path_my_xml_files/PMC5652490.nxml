There has been increasing interest around the sodium&#x02013;glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and their use in patients with HF. Data on the effect of SGLT2 inhibitor use with diuretics are limited. We hypothesise that SGLT2 inhibition may augment the effects of loop diuretics and the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors may extend beyond those of their metabolic (glycaemic parameters and weight loss) and haemodynamic parameters. The effects of SGLT2 inhibitors as an osmotic diuretic and on natriuresis may underlie the cardiovascular and renal benefits demonstrated in the recent EMPA-REG study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>To assess the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors when used in combination with a loop diuretic, the RECEDE-CHF (Renal and Cardiovascular Effects of SGLT2 inhibition in combination with loop Diuretics in diabetic patients with Chronic Heart Failure) trial is a single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial conducted in a secondary care setting within NHS Tayside, Scotland. 34 eligible participants, aged between 18 and 80 years, with stable T2D and CHF will be recruited. Renal physiological testing will be performed at two points (week 1 and week 6) on each arm to assess the effect of 25 mg empagliflozin, on the primary and secondary outcomes. Participants will be enrolled in the trial for a total period between 14 and 16 weeks. The primary outcome will assess the effect of empagliflozin versus placebo on urine output. The secondary outcomes are to assess the effect of empagliflozin on glomerular filtration rate, cystatin C, urinary sodium excretion, urinary protein/creatinine ratio and urinary albumin/creatinine ratio when compared with placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethics approval was obtained by the East of Scotland Research Ethics Service.

In population-based studies and in CHF trials, the prevalence of T2D among patients with symptomatic heart failure (HF) is estimated to be between 12% and 41%.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> T2D has consistently been shown to be an independent predictor of increased morbidity and mortality in patients with CHF.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>For most patients, metformin is the first choice antidiabetic drug in all patients with T2D including those with coincidental HF.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> However, metformin alone is often not enough to keep glycaemia under control and there is a frequent need for a second-line antidiabetic drug in patients with HF. Sulfonylureas (SUs) are commonly prescribed in T2D; however, they are associated with weight gain and hypoglycaemia, while there remain concerns that SUs may increase all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x000a0;although this link is not fully established. Glitazones are contraindicated in New York Heart Association (NYHA) III or IV HF, while their role in milder degrees of HF remains to a certain extent controversial with some observational studies indicating increased hospitalisation or readmission due to HF.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Insulin use has also been associated with increased mortality in patients with CHF.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> More recent agents such as the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors have also, disappointingly, failed to show CV benefit with some concerns raised following the publication of SAVOR-TIMI-53, that they increased HF hospitalisations, although these trials have only been of short duration<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and may not apply to all DPP-IV inhibitors. Therefore, it can be concluded that therapeutic options in diabetes mellitus (DM) and HF are limited due to a lack of evidence-based guidelines on the optimal management of such patients. Indeed, international guidelines recognise the evidence gap on the safety and efficacy of drugs used to treat DM in patients with HF as well as the need for agents that will both improve overall glycaemic control and HF outcomes.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><sec id="s1a"><title>SGLT2 inhibitors and HF</title><p>SGLT2 inhibitors are licensed for use in patients with T2D. These oral antidiabetic agents achieve their effects by blocking the low affinity, high capacity type 2 sodium&#x02013;glucose linked cotransporter (SGLT2), predominantly found in the proximal convoluted tubules of the kidneys, thus causing glycosuria. The recent landmark EMPA-REG outcome study reported a striking 35% relative risk reduction in HF hospitalisations with empagliflozin may provide supportive evidence for beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibition in the setting of CHF.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> A recent analysis of the EMPA-REG study showed that empagliflozin reduced HF hospitalisation and CV death, with a consistent benefit in patients with and without baseline HF.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>The mechanisms behind the beneficial effects of empagliflozin on HF and CV death are unknown.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> However, given that these effects were seen early in the EMPA-REG trial this would suggest that the effect was not caused simply by altering the atherosclerotic process.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>It has been hypothesised that the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors extend beyond those of the glycaemic parameters of weight loss as promoted by glycosuria, but the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on non-glycaemia parameters including blood pressure lowering as well as osmotic diuretic and natriuretic effects which may underlie the CV (and renal) benefits.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Renal effects of SGLT2 inhibition and coprescribing with loop diuretics</title><p>The renal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors are attracting much recent interest as they may confer renal protection.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> There are data to support the potential for direct renoprotective actions arising from SGLT2 inhibition including actions to attenuate T1D associated hyperfiltration through an effect on tubuloglomerular (TG) feedback which may have renal protective effects by decreasing glomerular hydrostatic pressure.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> SGLT2 inhibition has also been shown to attenuate tubular hypertrophy and reduce the tubular toxicity of glucose.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> They may also have indirect renoprotective effects through its blood pressure lowering effects and glycaemia lowering effects which could decrease the renal inflammatory and fibrotic response by blocking glucose entry into the cell.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Consequently, there are now several ongoing SGLT2 inhibitor renal outcome trials in T2D, including the CANVAS-R trial (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01989754) and the CREDENCE trial (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02065791). However, neither trial specifically looks at T2DM patients with CHF.</p><p>Studies relating to diuresis in the context of SGLT2 inhibitors are surprisingly sparse.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Previous studies with empagliflozin and canagliflozin have demonstrated a 24&#x02009;hours urinary increase by 300&#x02009;mL/day after day 1 of treatment but that the daily urinary volume returned to baseline after several weeks.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> One Japanese case report however, in a non-diabetic patient, described successful treatment of fluid overload that was initially resistant to diuretic therapy, with 5 days of treatment of 50&#x02009;mg ipragliflozin.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>In post hoc analysis of EMPA-REG OUTCOME, Fitchett <italic>et al</italic> reported reduced use of furosemide in patients on the empagliflozin arm, suggesting that these patients reached a relative state of euvolaemia.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 12</xref> Heerspink <italic>et al</italic> highlighted that, volume depletion and associated use of loop diuretic is long associated with a prerenal cause of acute kidney injury, and a decrease in loop diuretic may also be relevant in light of the reductions in acute kidney injury, acute renal failure and chronic kidney disease progression endpoints.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 19</xref></p><p>The renal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in combination with furosemide in T2D with CHF are not known but given the relative frequency of both comorbidities they are likely to be prescribed concurrently. This underscores the need for a trial to provide detailed acute and long-term information regarding the renal effects of SGLT2 inhibition in combination with loop diuretics, in patients with T2D and stable CHF.</p><p>We hypothesise that SGLT2 inhibitors may be able to address the issue of diuretic resistance and may augment the diuretic effects of furosemide in patients with T2D and CHF.</p><p>We will recruit patients with diabetic HF taking stable doses of furosemide, or, alternative loop diuretics, with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) greater than 45&#x02009;mL/min/1.73&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup>. This trial will, with careful monitoring, begin the process of uncovering the unrealised potential of this new class of drug which, for the reasons outlined above, is poised to become the second-line antidiabetic agent of choice in patients with HF.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods: participants, interventions and outcomes</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial design</title><p>The RECEDE-CHF (Renal and Cardiovascular Effects of SGLT2 inhibition in combination with loop Diuretics in diabetic patients with Chronic Heart Failure) trial is a single-centre phase IV, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial conducted in NHS Tayside, Scotland, to compare the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin 25&#x02009;mg with placebo.

On each study day, patients will present themselves to our CRC, following an overnight fast. Two days before presenting to the CRC, patients will be required to follow a 2 g sodium and 2&#x02009;L fluid/day controlled diet. A 24&#x02009;hours urinary collection will be requested the day prior to presentation at the CRC for urinary volume and sodium.

Bloods will be drawn for measurement of plasma N-terminal proBNP and cystatin C using standard protocols. A 15&#x02009;mL/kg oral water load will be administered over a 15&#x02009;min period. Thereafter, at 30 min intervals, patients will be requested to void urine until the end of the study period. The volume of urine passed will be measured and an aliquot stored for later analysis. On each occasion, the volume of urine passed will be measured, and an equal volume of water given to drink. In this way, a steady state diuresis will be established over approximately over 3&#x02009;hours, avoiding the need for catheterisation. The last 30&#x02009;min urinary collection during this stabilisation period will be taken as baseline.

One of the inevitable side effects of empagliflozin and other SGLT2 inhibitors with the promotion of glycosuria is urinary tract infections. This typically presents itself as genital mycotic infection, typically <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, which is usually straightforward to treat. However, if patients were to present with infection unresponsive to standard treatment then the trial drug would be discontinued.

A 20% increase is expected in these parameters following SGLT2 inhibition. This increase in urinary volume is based on published percentage increases in urinary volume in patients with T2D that range from 11% to 33% depending on the dose of the SGLT2 inhibitor as shown by List and colleagues<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> in the available data with dapagliflozin (dapagliflozin 2.5&#x02009;mg: 11% increase in 24&#x02009;hours urine volume; dapagliflozin 5&#x02009;mg: 22%&#x02013;11%&#x02009;increase in 24&#x02009;hours urine volume; dapagliflozin 10&#x02009;mg: 24%&#x02013;11%&#x02009;increase in 24&#x02009;hours urine volume; dapagliflozin 20&#x02009;mg: 27%&#x02013;11%&#x02009;increase in 24&#x02009;hours urine volume and dapagliflozin 50&#x02009;mg: 33%&#x02013;11%&#x02009;increase in 24&#x02009;hours urine volume). There is no data of SGLT inhibition together with loop diuretics. As described previously the Japanese case report of a patient with diuretic-resistant HF in whom fluid overload was successfully treated with the SGLT2 inhibitor, ipragliflozin, where a striking 50% increase in urinary volume (following treatment with 50&#x02009;mg daily of oral ipragliflozin for 5 days) was described.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Based on the above, it was determined that a 20% increase in furosemide induced increase in urinary volume and sodium excretion will be reasonable.</p><p>With an alpha 0.05 and power of 90%, 22 participants per arm are required, assuming 35% dropout. Since this trial is using an AB/BA cross-over design, a total of 34 participants will be required, as each participant will be exposed to both arms of the trial. The rationale for the high dropout rate is due to the high intensity RPTs that will occur on four occasions for the participants, from 09:00 to 14:00 hours we feel that anything less than a 35% dropout rate would be conservative.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Methods: data collection, management and analysis</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Data collection</title><p>The data will be collected by the PI or delegate on a paper case report form (CRF) with subsequent transcription to an electronic CRF.

It is noteworthy that osmotic diuretics such as mannitol have been used alone or in combination with loop diuretics such as furosemide to promote diuresis in patients undergoing intracranial surgery<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and in the postoperative period to prevent acute kidney injury.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> In CHF, mannitol was reported to promote effective diuresis in a single-centre study in the USA.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Importantly, in all these settings, mannitol, which is a potent osmotic diuretic when used in combination with furosemide, was shown to be safe and did not result in renal failure or electrolyte disturbances.</p><p>By detailing urinary volumes and sodium excretion via RPTs at two points 3 days and 6 weeks into the investigational medicinal product, the trial&#x02019;s primary aims to assess the change to these markers representative of diuresis in patients on empagliflozin and when compared with placebo. The effects on natriuresis, proteinuria, albuminuria, cystatin C will also be studied as will the safety of add-on SGLT2 inhibition versus placebo.</p><sec id="s5a"><title>Limitations</title><p>While power calculations have been conducted to calculate the sample size, an obvious limitation is that this is a small single-centre trial. The proposed trial will require participants on four occasions to undergo detailed renal physiological tests, (from 09:00 to 14:00 hours) as such a dropout rate has been factored in of 35%.</p><p>HF is a dynamic disease; its natural history is one of the flux as the patient&#x02019;s intravascular volume changes, their loop diuretic requirement may also fluctuate. However, as stipulated on the inclusion criteria, we will be taking patients with HF with evidence of previous LVSD, but with stable symptoms and medications for 3 months, who have not had a hospital admission for HF within this same time frame.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>While the osmotic diuretic hypothesis<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> is frequently discussed in relation to the renal and CV outcomes with SGLT2 inhibition, literature on the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on diuresis is currently limited. At time of writing, no studies have been performed to assess the effect of loop diuretics when used in combination with SGLT2 inhibitors. This proof of concept trial will aim to shed light on the mechanism of the CV and renal outcomes demonstrated in the recent EMPA-REG study by documenting the influence of the SGLT2 inhibitors when used in combination with a loop diuretic on urinary volumes and natriuresis when compared with placebo.</p><p>Further intent of this proposed study is to obtain data that might be relevant to the design of future studies in which SGLT2 inhibitors may be considered as an adjunctive agent to loop diuretics in patients who experience diuretic resistance. Although data are currently limited, since HF and T2D are frequent comorbidities, it is probable that physicians may find patients requiring both SGLT2 inhibitor therapy and furosemide concurrently. Only by studying this, can these fundamental issues be addressed and, perhaps, inspire a change in practice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e168" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-018097.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e169" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-018097.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Our gratitude to all members of staff within the department of Division of Cardiovascular and Diabetes Medicine at the University of Dundee, and the team at the Clinical Research Centre, University of Dundee, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, UK.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> NAM participated in the design of the study, data collection and drafting the manuscript.
