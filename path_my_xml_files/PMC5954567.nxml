</p><p>The henna plant is a glabrous, much branched shrub or quite a small tree with grayish-brown bark. Leaves are opposite, sub-sessile, elliptic, or broadly lanceolate, entire, acute or obtuse, 2 to 3 cm long and 1 to 2 cm wide. Lawsone is the chief constituent responsible for the dying properties of the plant. Dried powdered leaves of henna contain about 0.5% to 1.5% lawsone, traditionally used to produce colorfast orange, red, and brown dyes.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2515690X18772807" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-2515690X18772807" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>
<italic>Lawsonia inermis</italic> is reported to contain carbohydrates, proteins, flavonoids, tannins and phenolic compounds, alkaloids, terpenoids, quinones, coumarins, xanthones, and fatty acids.

Efteli and Gunes<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2515690X18772807" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> also showed that low score of Braden&#x02019;s scale indicated low level of activity and hence high risk for developing decubitus ulcers. In the study of Amirifar et al,<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2515690X18772807" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> it was shown that the lower the score of Braden&#x02019;s scale, the higher the risk for developing decubitus ulcers.

Because in the intervention group prepared henna was applied on sacrum and rinsed with warm water after 30 minutes and then patients&#x02019; skin was dried, they had lower local warmth of sacrum; but the control group did not receive any special measures. European Decubitus Ulcer Advisory Panel has mentioned that for diagnosing decubitus ulcers skin observation must include evaluation of location&#x02019;s warmth, edema, or stiffness, especially in patients with dark skin. Warmth, edema, and stiffness are indicators of developing decubitus ulcers because the signs of decubitus ulcers or redness could not always be seen in patients with dark skin.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2515690X18772807" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> So it could be implied that increase in the local warmth of sacrum could indicate development of decubitus ulcer, and based on the results of the present study, since the mean local warmth of sacrum was lower in the intervention group than in the control group, it could be concluded that applying henna on sacrum might have been effective in lowering the local warmth of sacrum and somehow has prevented increased warmth, which is an indicator of developing decubitus ulcers.</p><p>Although throughout the study the mean warmth of sacrum in the intervention group was lower than in the control group, their difference was not statistically significant. In other words, the difference between the mean of forehead&#x02019;s temperature, which indicates the body temperature, in both groups was not significant. So it could be concluded that the 2 groups were comparable. In the study of Mogarehi and Zarif Sanaiey<sup><xref rid="bibr32-2515690X18772807" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> also it was mentioned that the mean body temperature of patient with decubitus ulcers was 37.2&#x000b0;C and of patients without decubitus ulcers it was 37&#x000b0;C, which indicates that the difference was not significant. Mogarehi and Zarif Sanaiey<sup><xref rid="bibr32-2515690X18772807" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> also showed in their study that the body temperatures in patients with decubitus ulcer were higher. According to the results of the present study, in both the intervention and control groups the warmth of sacrum was higher than the forehead&#x02019;s temperature, but the difference between sacrum&#x02019;s temperature and forehead&#x02019;s temperature in the intervention group was less than in the control group, meaning that the warmth of sacrum in the intervention group has increased less than the control group, which indicates lower risk of developing decubitus ulcers among the patients of the intervention group. Also, results showed that the mean temperature of sacrum and forehead had a significant relation during the study; the relation between local warmth of sacrum and forehead&#x02019;s temperature was direct. Akbari et al<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2515690X18772807" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> in their study mentioned that fever by changing patient&#x02019;s metabolism on one hand and sweating on the other hand would make the patient prone to developing decubitus ulcers. This is similar to the results of the present study.</p><p>In the present study, only 1 patient in the intervention group developed redness in sacrum at the third, fourth, and fifth days of the study, and at the sixth and seventh days of the study, the redness was disappeared, but in the control group redness occurred in 6 patients. The difference was significant. According to the European Decubitus Ulcer Advisory Panel,<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2515690X18772807" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> the definition of type 1 decubitus ulcer includes healthy skin with a pale red region or with a different colored region that usually occurs around bony prominences and could be more painful, smoother, softer, warmer, or colder than adjacent regions. Redness means that body is not able to release from the previous decubitus and needs rest before being decubitus again. Considering the above-mentioned, it could be said that 1 patient in the intervention group and 6 patients in the control group developed decubitus ulcers and the difference was significant in this regard. So the applied intervention has been effective and could have prevented redness in sacrum and eventually decubitus ulcer, especially type 1. In the study of Yucel and Guzin,<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2515690X18772807" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> the authors evaluated the effect of henna on hand-foot syndrome caused by drug capecitabine, and henna, due to its anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects, could have a good therapeutic effect on reduction of this syndrome without the need for reducing drug&#x02019;s dosage.</p><p>According to the results, 1 patient in the intervention group developed type 1 decubitus ulcer, which the redness in sacrum region was resolved after 72 hours, and in the control group 5 patients developed type 1 decubitus ulcer and 1 patient developed type 2 ulcer. The study of Eberlein-Gonska et al<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2515690X18772807" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> also revealed that the lower grades of decubitus ulcers (type 1 or 2) are more common than its higher grades (type 3 or 4) in a way that 41% of patients had type 1 (784 patients out of 1914) and 48% had type 2 (915 patients) decubitus ulcers. In the study of Mistiaen et al,<sup><xref rid="bibr33-2515690X18772807" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> which was conducted for 3 years from 2006 to 2008, nurses who visited patients at home reported all the cases of decubitus ulcer at sacrum region, and from all the patients (2772 patients) 1517 patients had type 1, 820 had type 2, 288 had type 3, and 147 had type 4 ulcers. In the study of Soozani et al,<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2515690X18772807" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> which was conducted in Iran in 72 patients, 53 (73.6%) had type 2 and 16 (22.2%) had type 1 decubitus ulcers. In most of the studies type 1 and type 2 ulcers are more common, which is similar to the present study. Considering that most of the ulcers have low grades and their treatments are costly, preventing these ulcers is a high priority. In the present study, it was shown that 1 patient in the intervention group and 6 patients in the control group developed decubitus ulcer. So it could be said that applying henna on sacrum could have been effective in preventing decubitus ulcer and could be suggested as a clinical preventive method.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section13-2515690X18772807"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Considering all the above-mentioned points about the effects of henna in preventing decubitus ulcers and also the results of the present study, it could be suggested that henna is effective in preventing decubitus ulcers, but due to the limited time of the study and small sample size, it is recommended that a long-term study on larger sample size should be conducted.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-2515690X18772807"><p><bold>Author Contributions:</bold> Davood Hekmatpou, Fatemeh Ahmadian, Maryam Eghbali, and Shadi Farsaei participated in the study design and carried out the experiments.
