No effective EV71 vaccine is available. A randomized and open-label phase I clinical study registered with ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT01268787, aims to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of a formalin-inactivated EV71 vaccine candidate (EV71vac) at 5- and 10-&#x000b5;g doses. In this study we report the cross-neutralizing antibody responses from each volunteer against different subgenotypes of EV71 and CVA16.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Sixty eligible healthy adults were recruited and vaccinated. Blood samples were obtained on day 0, 21 and 42 and tested against B1, B4, B5, C2, C4A, C4B and CVA16 for cross-neutralizing antibody responses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The immunogenicity of both 5- and 10- &#x000b5;g doses were found to be very similar. Approximately 45% of the participants had &#x0003c;8 pre-vaccination neutralization titers (Nt) against the B4 vaccine strain. After the first EV71vac immunization, 95% of vaccinees have &#x0003e;4-fold increase in Nt, but there was no further increase in Nt after the second dose. EV71vac induced very strong cross-neutralizing antibody responses in &#x0003e;85% of volunteers without pre-existing Nt against subgenotype B1, B5 and C4A. EV71vac elicited weak cross-neutralizing antibody responses (&#x0223c;20% of participants) against a C4B and Coxsackie virus A16. Over 90% of vaccinated volunteers did not develop cross-neutralizing antibody responses (Nt&#x0003c;8) against a C2 strain. EV71vac can boost and significantly enhance the neutralizing antibody responses in volunteers who already had pre-vaccination antibodies against EV71 and/or CVA16.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>EV71vac is efficient in eliciting cross-neutralizing antibody responses against EV71 subgenotypes B1, B4, B5, and C4A, and provides the rationale for its evaluation in phase II clinical trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov __<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01268787?term=EV71&#x00026;rank=13&#x00026;submitfldopt=">NCT01268787</ext-link>

id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The lack of an efficacious vaccine against EV71 is a major hurdle in preventing the spread of EV71 in Asia-Pacific regions. A report by Cheng et al. <xref rid="pone.0079783-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> revealed EV71vac to be safe and well tolerated that local reactions at the injection-site and adverse systemic effects were mild. In this report, we focus on the effectiveness of EV71vac at eliciting VNA responses against other EV71 genotypes. Although the control group was not stated in the study, as a biosafety monitoring program in NHRI the blood samples collected from &#x0003e;35 R&#x00026;D staff working in the viral pilot plants were randomly tested every six months for potential exposure to EV71 virus and H5N1 flu virus. The test results so far showed no increase in EV71 neutralizing antibody titers. In addition, during the clinical trial there was no EV71 epidemic occurred in Taiwan (01/2011&#x02013;03/2012) and each volunteer had filled out the report form during the trials. None of them reported that they had been exposed to EV71 and/or Coxsackie virus infection. Therefore, the increased neutralizing antibody responses are elicited by EV71vac immunization.</p><p>The results from current immunogenicity study indicate that a 5-&#x000b5;g dose of EV71vac is highly immunogenic in the tested volunteers. Several important conclusions can therefore be drawn from the study. (1) Based on the rate of seroconversion (&#x02265;4-fold increase in neutralizing antibody titers determined by the B4-based virus neutralization assay), &#x0003e;95% of volunteers sero-converted; (2) EV71vac is capable of eliciting strong VNA responses in naive volunteers (those participants who were determined to most likely not have been exposed to or infected with EV71, and four of these five volunteers sero-converted as their IgG titers and Nt increased by more than 4-fold after a single dose of EV71vac); (3) EV71vac induced very strong VNA responses in &#x0003e;85% of volunteers without pre-existing Nt against subgenotype B1, B5 and C4A; (4) EV71vac elicited weak VNA responses (&#x0223c;20% of participants) against a C4B and CVA16; (5) &#x0003e;90% (51/56) of vaccinated young adults without pre-existing Nt against C2 did not develop VNA responses (Nt&#x0003c;8) against a C2 strain; (6) EV71vac can boost and significantly enhance VNA responses in volunteers who already had pre-vaccination antibodies against EV71 and/or CVA16; and (7) most volunteers vaccinated twice with EV71vac did not show further increase in Nt. To our surprise, a decrease in the GMT of Nt was observed after the booster injection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079783-t001">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079783-t002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079783-t003">3</xref>). The increased EV71 neutralizing antibody level after the 1st vaccination may be caused by recall immunity in humans. This indicates the possibility of cross-priming effect. The cross-priming effect is one of benefits from the recall immunity. The immune systems (B- and T-cell) of the host is primed by either exposed to or immunized with target antigen(s) and has generated B- and T-cell immune responses specific to certain epitopes of the target antigen(s). There would be very strong recall immunity from both memory B- and T-cell when the host is exposed to antigen-like molecules containing some of these antigen-specific epitopes.</p><p>Clinical trial results from Li et al. <xref rid="pone.0079783-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and Meng et al. <xref rid="pone.0079783-Meng1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> indicated that 1 microgram dose could be sufficient. In our recent review article <xref rid="pone.0079783-Chong1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, we reported based on 7 batches of 40 liters pilot-scale production runs, we could produce 50,000 doses of the EV71vac at 1 &#x000b5;g EV71 antigen per dose and the cost was calculated to be 0.4 US dollar/dose. Using our current GMP facility (7,500 sq ft), 1 million doses can be easily produced annually.</p><p>Is the current vaccine derived from an EV71 subgenotype B4 strain the right choice? We did not observe poor VNA responses against C2 in EV71vac immunized mice, rabbits and macaques in pre-clinical studies <xref rid="pone.0079783-Chou1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079783-Liu4" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079783-Chang2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0079783-Chong1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. These immune responses in animal models were confirmed by other studies <xref rid="pone.0079783-Bek1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0079783-Dong1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The C2 strain used in the assay was isolated during the 1998 outbreak and identified as a recombinant virus between EV71 genotype A and Coxsackie virus A8 by Huang <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0079783-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The C2 subgenotype virus was not found in Taiwan since 1998, but still circulates in Thailand <xref rid="pone.0079783-Solomon1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Interestingly, Huang <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0079783-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> also suggested that the current B4 vaccine strain and C4B strain were recombinants between EV71 subgenotype B2/B3 and B2/C2, respectively. The occurrence of intra- and inter-serotyptic recombination could cause genetic evolution and antigenic changes that result in decrease virus cross-neutralization activity as observed in the current results.</p><p>The weak and poor cross-neutralizing antibody responses against C4B, CVA16 and C2, prompted us to test other EV71 isolates in the laboratories. From the preliminary results, Subjects who were previously found to have Nt&#x0003c;8 against C2 strain were shown to have a &#x0003e;4-fold increase in Nt against another C2 strain (EV71/4643) and another C4B (EV71/1757) strain (Dr. J.R. Wang, unpublished results). To settle these discrepancies, we are currently purifying the virus strains and standardizing their viral titer used in the cross-neutralization assay since we have found that different virus strains could generate different amounts of defective particles that could interfere with the neutralization titer. In our previous studies <xref rid="pone.0079783-Chou1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079783-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079783-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, the ratio of defective to infectious particles can vary from 7&#x02236;3 in the current vaccine strain to 1&#x02236;2 for CVA16 (5079/TW98).</p><p>The current study indicate that preexisting antibody due to stealth infections could interfere the efficacy of the vaccine, so we urgently need a good biomarker to pre-screen naive subjects since most young children in epidemic Asian countries have likely been exposed to and/or infected with EV71 and/or CVA16. The EV71 particle-based specific ELISA may be used as a quick screening test of pre-immune sera from volunteers since at the 1/2000 dilution EV71 negative sera correlates with Nt levels &#x0003c;8.</p><p>Although animal immunogenicity study in general is used to evaluate the consistency of immunogenicity among different batches of vaccines, it is of interest to know which animal (rabbit, mouse and macaque) immunogenicity study can be correlated to the potency of EV71vac. Mice immunized with EV71vac mainly produced antibodies against the immunodominant neutralization epitope VP1&#x02013;43 corresponding to residues 205&#x02013;225 (FGEHKQEKDLEYGAC) of VP1 <xref rid="pone.0079783-Liu4" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0079783-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. But our unpublished epitope mapping results show that sera of all participants immunized with EV71vac did not react with the VP1&#x02013;43 peptide, but recognized conformational neutralization epitopes and an immunodominant linear epitope VP1&#x02013;49 (residues 241&#x02013;260). This means that immune responses from mice immunized with EV71vac would not correlate with the potency of the vaccine candidate in human. In contrast, the conformational-dependent neutralizing antibody responses from rabbits and macaques immunized with EV71vac are very similar to those generated in humans. They are characterized by strong virus neutralization titers against subgenotypes B1, B4, B5 and C4A listed in this study, moderate Nt against C4B and C2, but poor responses against CVA16 <xref rid="pone.0079783-Chou1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079783-Dong1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Based on the cost of animals and housing requirements, rabbit immunogenicity study could be the choice for an EV71 vaccine potency test. In addition, the immune responses from animal models and human volunteers vaccinated with EV71 vaccine candidate based on B4 subgenotype have indicated that a multi-valent (B4, C2 and CVA16) vaccine against the hand-foot-mouth diseases may be necessary.</p><p>Overall, the current results indicate that EV71vac based on an EV71 subgenotype B4 strain is a good vaccine candidate. It is safe, well tolerated and effectively elicits cross-neutralizing antibody responses against EV71 subgenotypes B1, B4, B5 and C4A. We should keep in mind that the target population of the EV71 vaccine is young infant and children younger than 5 years old. The cross-neutralization immune responses to EV71vac in children should be investigated. In addition, the vaccination schedule and the long-term immunogenicity should be assessed as well. Therefore, the current results provide a strong rationale for further evaluations of EV71vac in phase II clinical trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0079783.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>
