The study assessed the effects of iron-folic acid and zinc supplementation on child temperament and child eating behaviors in rural Nepal. Children (N = 569) aged 4&#x02013;17 months in Sarlahi district, southern Nepal were randomized to receive daily supplements of placebo, iron-folic acid, zinc, or zinc plus iron-folic acid and followed for approximately 1 year. At baseline and four follow-up visits mothers completed questionnaires including information on demographic characteristics and child temperament and eating behaviors. The main effects of zinc and iron-folic acid supplementation on temperament and eating behaviors were assessed through crude and adjusted differences in mean cumulative score changes between visits 1 and 5. The adjusted rate-of-change for these outcomes was modeled using generalized estimating equations. Mean changes in temperament scores and in eating behavior scores between visits 1 and 5 were not significant in either the zinc or non-zinc group. Children in the iron-folic acid group increased temperament scores by 0.37 points over 5 visits (95% CI 0.02, 0.7), which was not significant after adjustment. Neither the adjusted rate-of-change in temperament scores between zinc and non-zinc (&#x003b2; = &#x02212;0.03, 95% CI &#x02212;0.3, 0.2) or iron-folic acid and non-iron-folic acid (&#x003b2; = 0.08, 95% CI &#x02212;0.2, 0.3) were significantly different. Adjusted rate of change analysis showed no significant difference between zinc and non-zinc (&#x003b2; = &#x02212;0.14, 95% CI &#x02212;0.3, 0.04) or between iron and non-iron eating behavior scores (&#x003b2; = &#x02212;0.11, 95% CI &#x02212;0.3, 0.1). Only among children with iron-deficiency anemia at baseline was there a significant decrease in eating behavior score, indicating better eating behaviors, when supplemented with zinc (&#x003b2; = &#x02212;0.3, 95% CI &#x02212;0.6, &#x02212;0.01), Ultimately, this effect of zinc on eating behaviors was the only effect we observed after approximately one year of micronutrient supplementation.</p><sec id="sec001"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00109551">NCT00109551</ext-link>

The protocol for this trial and CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref rid="pone.0114266.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 CONSORT Checklist</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0114266.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Protocol</xref>. The NNIPS-4 study was conducted in 426 randomized geographic clusters within 30 Village Development Committees (VDCs) using a cluster randomized 2&#x000d7;2 factorial design. This study was conducted in the rural southern district of Sarlahi, Nepal within the Ishwarpur VDC. This was one of the larger VDCs, containing 23 geographic clusters.</p><p>Participants were eligible for participation if they lived in Ishwarpur between January 7 and April 6, 2002 and were between 4 and 17 months of age. The complete date range for participant recruitment and follow-up was January 7<sup>th</sup> 2001 through May 7 2003. A total of 613 eligible infants were identified through a population-based census conducted between December 2000 and March 2001. Only 44 (7%) of the eligible infants did not participate, either because they were not located or their caregivers did not provide consent. The remaining 569 infants were randomized to the 4 study arms: placebo (N = 152), iron-folic acid (N = 129), zinc (N = 126), and zinc plus iron-folic acid (N = 162). Because most participants were illiterate, verbal informed consent was obtained from all caregivers. This was indicated on a box on the enrollment form, which was then signed by the field worker obtaining consent. The study and consent procedure was approved by the Johns Hopkins University Committee on Human Subjects Research and the Nepal Health Research Council.

The duration of participation was approximately one year. During baseline and follow-up visits, demographic and developmental data were collected in addition to temperament and child eating behavior outcomes. Baseline demographic data included the following: infant age in months (4&#x02013;5, 6&#x02013;8, 9&#x02013;11, 12&#x02013;14, or 15&#x02013;17), gender (male or female), caste (higher: Brahmin and Chetri; lower: Vaiysha, Shudra, or Muslim), ethnic group (Pahadi or Madeshi), maternal literacy (not literate, literate), paternal literacy (not literate, literate), and paternal occupation (farmer, including also unskilled worker, laborer, or unemployed; business, including also government, or private sector worker). Time of birth in relation to local festivals and the lunar calendar was used to calculate birth dates when necessary. Field workers identified the presence or ownership of 12 items to determine the socio-economic status (SES) of participants: a latrine at the house, a servant, cattle, bicycle, radio, farmable land, home garden plot, second floor in the house, type of roofing material, TV, electricity at home, and bullock cart. The ownership of these items was used to create a three-category SES scale: low (0&#x02013;1 items), medium (2&#x02013;5 items) and high (6&#x02013;12 items). Baseline health was also measured through anthropometric measurements (weight-for-age, length-for-age, mid-upper-arm circumference, and triceps skinfold thickness), baseline diarrheal disease (yes/no for symptoms in last 5 days) and acute respiratory infection (yes/no in last 5 days), micronutrient status (hemoglobin &#x0003c; 10.0g/dL and zinc protoprophryin &#x0003e; 90 &#x003bc;mol), and iron deficiency anemia (zinc protoporphryin&#x0003e;90 &#x003bc;mol/no/heme and hemoglobin&#x0003c;10.0 g/dL). We also collected information on baseline feeding behaviors, including exclusive breastfeeding (yes/no) and meat eating at baseline (yes/no).</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Exposure</title><p>Iron-folic acid and zinc supplementation were the exposures of interest for this study. Children were randomized to receive a daily supplement of either 1) 10 mg zinc; 2) 12.5 mg iron and 50 &#x003bc;g folic acid; 3) a combination of 10 mg zinc, 12.5 mg iron and 50 &#x003bc;g folic acid; or 4) a sugar placebo. In order to randomize, all combinations of the 4 treatment groups were written on pieces of paper. Senior field personnel blindly and randomly drew pieces of paper from a container that indicated the codes for the first 4 sectors on the list. The paper was replaced and random drawing continued until all sectors were assigned to one of the four supplementation groups. Children under one year of age received half a dose. Vanilla flavored supplements were provided by Nutriset (Malaunay, France) in collaboration with the Department of Child and Adolescent Health and Development (WHO, Geneva, Switzerland). Independent laboratories performed chemical analyses to monitor supplement potency and composition. The children were given the appropriate micronutrient supplements twice a week directly from fieldworkers. Young children were given tablets dissolved in breast milk or purified water when necessary. When possible, study staff administered supplements, but caregivers administered doses when study staff were unavailable or on days without home visits. Field staff monitored compliance by counting the number of tablets consumed since the prior visit. Tablets looked identical and codes and contents were not revealed to any members of the field staff or data analysts until completion of the study, resulting in complete masking of each participating family and all fieldworkers to the randomization of the intervention. Although a treatment code was printed on the micronutrient packaging, all tablets looked identical.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Development Outcomes</title><p>Child temperament was assessed by the caregiver using a scale adapted from the temperament component of the Infant Characteristics Questionnaire.[<xref rid="pone.0114266.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The adapted scale is a twelve-item instrument that includes eleven yes or no questions and a summary question asking about the relative ease or difficulty in caring for the child (easier than average, average or more difficult than average). Temperament questions focused on topics such as intensity of crying, mood, irritability, need for attention, fussiness, and independence. For each question, one point was associated with a poor temperament while zero points were awarded for good temperament. The summary three-category question was dichotomized such that children characterized as &#x0201c;more difficult than average&#x0201d; received one point, while children characterized as &#x0201c;average&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;easier than average&#x0201d; received zero points. The temperament scale was constructed by summing the 12 questions. Temperament scores could range from 0 to 12, with lower scores indicating easier temperament.</p><p>The eating behavior questionnaire consisted of nine commonly used questions about behaviors while eating and appetite. Some examples include the relative amount of eating for age, happiness during eating, and frequency with which the infant requested food. The first eight questions had yes or no response options. One point was awarded to indicate poor eating behaviors, while no points indicated better eating behaviors. The ninth question, assessing the relative quality of the child&#x02019;s appetite, had three response categories (good, average and poor). No points were awarded for the categories &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;average,&#x0201d; while &#x0201c;poor&#x0201d; appetite was awarded one point. The scores from each question were summed to create the composite eating behavior scale. Eating behavior scores could range from 0 to 9, with lower scores indicating better eating behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using STATA 11.0 (Statacorp, College Station, Texas). Baseline comparability between treatment groups was assessed for temperament and eating behaviors using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) to account for the cluster randomization. Compliance with the assigned treatment group was compared to placebo by calculating the mean number of supplements taken.</p><p>In this 2x2 factorial study, one arm received a combination dose of zinc plus iron-folic acid. We tested for an interaction between the effects of zinc-only and iron-folic acid-only to see if the effect of joint administration differed from what would be expected from summing each treatment under the assumption of independence. No interaction effect was found, so the main effects of zinc and iron-folic acid were estimated separately: children who received any zinc were compared to those who did not receive zinc, and children who received any iron-folic acid were compared to those who did not receive iron-folic acid.</p><p>Children were included in the temperament analysis if they had a baseline score and at least one follow-up visit. For child eating behaviors, children whose mothers reported their child consuming only breast milk or water at baseline or any subsequent visits did not complete the module for that visit. If a child began consuming complementary foods, then the eating behavior module could be completed in follow-up visits. The GEE eating behavior analysis included all children with eating behavior data, including those who were not eligible for baseline data collection. Temperament and eating behavior data were counted as missing if more than one third of questions were incomplete for the visit. When less than one third of questions were missing but the module was not complete, the remaining questions were averaged and multiplied by the total number of questions on the respective scales (12 for temperament and 9 for eating behaviors).</p><p>For temperament and eating behaviors separately, we calculated the mean cumulative change in scores between the first and fifth visit. The crude and adjusted difference in mean cumulative change between first and fifth visit scores was also calculated to compare treatment interventions (zinc and iron folic-acid). Adjusted temperament and eating behavior models accounted for baseline differences in SES, ethnicity, caste, and paternal occupation. We also adjusted for the difference in temperament score between treatment groups at baseline, but no adjustment was made for baseline eating behavior scores because they were comparable at baseline. Because of the age-dependent nature of temperament and eating behaviors, all adjusted analyses accounted for age at baseline. The adjusted rate-of-change for temperament and eating behaviors was subsequently modeled using GEE. This GEE analysis accounted for all follow-up visits with complete data. Given baseline differences in levels of iron-deficiency anemia, we performed an unstratified analysis and an analysis stratified by iron-deficiency anemia status. After examining correlation matrices and time series graphs for temperament and eating behavior outcomes, an auto-regressive correlation structure was selected.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec009"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Child Temperament</title><p>Of the total 569 infants randomized to the four study arms, the temperament analysis excluded 1.2% (N = 7) of infants due to missing baseline scores and 3.3% (N = 19) without any follow-up visits. The final analysis accounted for 543 infants remaining in each treatment group: iron-folic acid (N = 122), zinc (N = 123), iron-folic acid plus zinc (N = 152), or placebo (N = 146) (<xref rid="pone.0114266.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Infants with complete outcomes for visits one through five were available for 94.3% of infants receiving iron-folic acid, 86.2% of zinc, 87.5% of iron-folic acid plus zinc, and 80.1% of placebo. Infants were comparable across treatment groups in age, sex, and maternal and paternal literacy. They were not comparable however in caste, ethnicity, SES, paternal occupation and baseline temperament score (<xref rid="pone.0114266.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For infants included in the temperament analysis, compliance with treatment was lowest among the group taking iron-folic acid only and highest among the placebo group. Infants who received any iron took significantly fewer supplements than those not receiving iron, while there was not a significant difference in compliance between those in the zinc and non-zinc groups.

As illustrated in the graphs, temperament scores were relatively constant over the five visits. Overall, child eating behaviors improved with age, reflected by lower scores over time. The scores dropped more in the non-zinc versus the zinc supplementation group and in the non-iron-folic acid versus the iron-folic acid supplementation group, although the difference in the rate of change between groups was not statistically significant.

However, we did detect a modest association suggesting zinc supplementation to be related to better eating behaviors in children with baseline iron-deficiency anemia. We are unaware of other previous studies assessing these associations. Nonetheless, zinc supplementation has been associated with numerous other behavioral outcomes, though results are mixed.[<xref rid="pone.0114266.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0114266.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] For example, Guatemalan children receiving six months of zinc supplementation showed fewer internalizing symptoms than control children, however no associations were found between other behavioral symptoms such as hyperactivity, aggression, or conduct.[<xref rid="pone.0114266.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] In a Brazilian study of one year olds, child responsiveness as well as a composite measure of responsiveness, emotional tone, activity level, cooperation, and vocalization were significantly rated higher in a group of low birth weight term infants receiving 5 mg zinc for eight weeks, compared to similar infants in a placebo group.[<xref rid="pone.0114266.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Attention was shown to be better in Egyptian infants consuming foods high in zinc.[<xref rid="pone.0114266.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] Two studies of infants in India and in Guatemala showed increases in activity in zinc supplementation groups compared to a group given a multivitamin supplement without additional zinc or compared to a non-supplementation group, respectively.[<xref rid="pone.0114266.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0114266.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</p><p>Though the reasons for our finding limited effects are unclear, it is possible that supplementation may only have an effect if the duration is long enough and timing optimal and/or the degree of deficiency in the children is sufficiently severe. Given our study was a year in duration and timing of supplementation overlapped during the peak ages of iron-deficiency in childhood,[<xref rid="pone.0114266.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] it is possible that there is in fact no effect of these micronutrient supplements on our outcomes of interest.

We also had very good retention of participants (86.1% with data for all visits) and adherence to supplementation (91.1% who had at least a baseline and last visit), limiting the possibility of bias due to participant selection or drop-out. One limitation was the use of maternal self-report rather than direct observations of our main outcomes, however videotaping and coding was not possible due to budgetary constraints. Given that mothers reported child behaviors, social desirability could have come into play, since mothers might be reluctant to report their children having difficult temperaments or poor eating behaviors. Nonetheless, maternal reports are considered to be valid measures of child temperament.[<xref rid="pone.0114266.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] There were also some demographic differences resulting from the randomization procedure at baseline including child temperament scores, but we accounted for these differences in our statistical analysis.</p><p>Ideally, future research could use direct observations rather than reported measures of these concepts. At present there is little information about the pathways by which zinc or iron-folic acid supplementation could affect child temperament or eating behaviors. Further, data are inconclusive regarding the ages that zinc or iron supplementation may have the greatest impact. A better understanding of these processes and what aspects of temperament or eating behaviors might be affected may provide insight into identifying the most sensitive measures for future studies.</p><sec id="sec013"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Given that our study showed almost no evidence for effects of zinc or iron supplementation on child temperament or on child eating behaviors, except for an effect of zinc supplementation on better eating behaviors in children with iron-deficiency anemia, more research is needed to confirm these results in other settings, among children of different ages, and with different micronutrient profiles.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec014"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0114266.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0114266.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0114266.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Trial Protocol.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0114266.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0114266.s003"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>Study Data.</title><p>(DTA)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0114266.s003.dta"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0114266.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
