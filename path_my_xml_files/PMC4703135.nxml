The GeneXpert (Xpert CT/NG assay), suited to use at the point-of-care, is being used in the TTANGO randomised controlled trial (RCT) in 12 remote Australian health services with a high burden of sexually transmissible infections (STIs). This represents the first ever routine use of a molecular point-of-care diagnostic for STIs in primary care.

Participants indicated that point-of-care testing had improved management of STIs, resulting in more timely and targeted treatment, earlier commencement of partner notification, and reduced follow up efforts associated with client recall. Staff expressed confidence in point-of-care test results and treating patients on this basis, and reported greater job satisfaction. While point-of-care testing did not negatively impact on client flow, several found the manual documentation processes time consuming, suggesting that improved electronic connectivity and test result transfer between the GeneXpert and patient management systems could overcome this. Managing positive test results in a shorter time frame was challenging for some but most found it satisfying to complete episodes of care more quickly.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In the context of a RCT, health professionals working in remote primary care in Australia found the GeneXpert highly acceptable.

However with the recent availability of the first rapid, accurate, molecular diagnostic system (GeneXpert CT/NG assay) there is wider scope for the use of CT and NG point-of-care tests.[<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The GeneXpert system is also portable, in the sense that it can be packed and moved in a suitable case on wheels by one person, which adds to its utility.</p><p>The GeneXpert CT/NG assay is being utilised in the TTANGO (Test, Treat, ANd GO) trial.[<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] TTANGO is a cross-over cluster randomised controlled trial underway in 12 remote Australian primary health care services in communities with a predominantly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (hereafter referred to as Aboriginal) population. To our knowledge the trial represents the first use of a point-of-care molecular diagnostic test for STIs in a primary health care setting anywhere in the world.[<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] GeneXpert platforms have been used for other infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, but largely in laboratory settings.[<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Provision of accurate testing and timely treatment through primary care services is a key STI control and prevention strategy. Point-of-care tests for CT and NG have the potential to increase the uptake and timeliness of testing and treatment and reduce the average duration of infectiousness,[<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] thereby contributing to improved STI control in remote Australia and similar settings elsewhere. As utilisation of these new molecular point-of-care tests for CT/NG is a substantial change to clinical practice in these remote areas, and generally across the world, the TTANGO trial included comprehensive evaluation of the clinical, operational and cost-effectiveness of CT/NG point-of-care testing as well as its acceptability to health care staff and patients.</p><p>It is well established that the integration of point-of-care testing into STI clinical services in remote settings and elsewhere is not straightforward,[<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and that the mere availability of a point-of-care test does not ensure uptake by service providers or end users.[<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Acceptability of point-of-care testing to health care workers is necessary to support the introduction and sustainability of point-of-care testing, yet there has been a relative scarcity of qualitative research in this area.[<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Acceptability of point-of-care test utilisation by health professionals is influenced by factors including: ease of use, in particular the number of manual steps involved and whether these are timed; reading and interpretation of results, especially if there is an element of subjectivity; specimen collection procedures and how complex or invasive they are; performance characteristics of the test (high sensitivity and specificity) and confidence in this; the extent to which point-of-care testing interrupts clinic workflow; and, the time taken to produce a result.[<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In the context of the TTANGO trial, we report on the acceptability of the GeneXpert CT/NG to primary health care staff working in remote Australian health services.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Ethics, consent and permissions</title><p>Ethical approval for the study was received from the West Australian Aboriginal Health Information and Ethics Committee, the West Australian Community Health Board Research Ethics Committee, the Townsville and Cairns Health Service District Human Research Ethics Committees and, the Aboriginal Health Research Ethics Committee of South Australia.

TTANGO is measuring the impact of STI point-of-care testing on time to treatment and repeat infections, as well as its acceptability to clinicians and their patients. Participating health services were randomly assigned to either point-of-care or routine laboratory testing for CT and NG for one year before crossing to the opposite modality for another year. Nurses and Aboriginal Health Practitioners/Workers received on-site theory and hands on training of 2&#x02013;3 hours duration, covering STI epidemiology, clinical management, and use of the GeneXpert and quality management practices. TTANGO Coordinators provided ongoing support via telephone, email and remote login access, with periodic visits (five over two years) offering face to face support and the opportunity to discuss STI testing data as a means of continuous quality improvement.[<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Sampling and participants</title><p>Interviews were open to all staff in participating health services that were trained and had approximately one year&#x02019;s experience with GeneXpert testing. However, participation was influenced by clinic workload and other commitments on the day of data collection, and by the fly-in-fly-out nature of staffing (some staff were on leave at the time of data collection). Staff willing but unable to take part in a face to face interview were invited to participate in a telephone interview (resulting in three telephone interviews and 13 face to face). Recruitment of interview participants continued until the data were saturated and no new themes emerged.[<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Interviews</title><p>An interview guide was developed to explore staff experiences using the GeneXpert point-of-care test. Informed by a review of the literature, the guide included questions about a range of factors recognised to influence acceptability of point-of-care testing. The guide covered: the extent of participants&#x02019; involvement with GeneXpert testing; views on specimen collection, preparation, the testing process and accuracy of the test; the impact of point-of-care testing on traditional STI management practices and client flow; any particular &#x02018;likes&#x02019; and &#x02018;dislikes&#x02019; about the point-of-care device or the process/procedure; and associated attitudes about point-of-care testing.

They indicated that point-of-care testing had improved STI management, resulting in more timely and more targeted treatment, earlier commencement of partner notification, and reduced follow up efforts associated with client recall. Staff expressed confidence in point-of-care test results and treating patients on this basis, and reported greater job satisfaction&#x02014;feeling more in control of STI testing and patient health, particularly Aboriginal staff. While point-of-care testing did not negatively impact on client flow, several found the required manual documentation processes time consuming, and felt that improved connectivity and automatic transfer of results between the GeneXpert and the patient management system could facilitate better workflow. Managing positive test results in a shorter time frame was challenging for some but most participants found it more satisfying being able to complete the episode of care on the same day.</p><p>The GeneXpert has largely been used in hospital settings for TB testing and more recently for other purposes,[<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]and deployed for TB testing in primary and remote health care settings.[<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] While there is an increasing body of literature on test performance and clinical impact related to these applications, there are few studies that refer to acceptability [<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and none to our knowledge that formally use qualitative methods to explore acceptability or that were conducted in primary care settings. Goldenberg and colleagues explored acceptability and ease of use (using a short questionnaire) of GeneXpert testing for Clostridium Difficile in a hospital setting; most staff found the device easy to use, perceived point-of-care testing to be an acceptable part of their role, liked being able to perform testing themselves, agreed that results were available more quickly than the laboratory based test and that rapid result turn- around facilitated better management of patient beds.[<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] The interview findings described here broadly align with those described by Goldenberg and colleagues, however due to the qualitative nature of our interviews, we provide more information about the reasons for high acceptability and the various factors that impact on this. Our findings also demonstrate for the first time that this technology is acceptable to staff working in small, remote health services, and that staff acceptability should be an enabler to implementation and uptake in this sector. Our findings are also consistent with the Technology Acceptance Model [<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and provide a case study of its application to new technology in remote primary health care settings.</p><p>Our data identified three strong acceptability themes. Consistent with other studies participants generally reported that the point-of-care test system was user-friendly, reliable, and resulted in benefits for them (reducing recall efforts) and for their patients (reducing time to treatment and reducing unnecessary treatment) without disrupting workflow.[<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] When the study commenced, some stakeholders raised concerns about the 90-minute wait for results, identified as an important determinant of staff acceptability in previous research, with 20&#x02013;30 minutes considered by frontline health professionals as acceptable for an STI test.[<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] However the 90-minute wait was not raised as an issue by our participants, possibly because most clients opted to leave the clinic and return in the event of a positive result, so staff workflow was not negatively impacted. Participants may also have felt that this timeframe was acceptable and highly favourable when compared to the time taken to receive routine laboratory results in most remote settings.</p><p>Our finding of high acceptability and, in particular, benefits to staff and patients, needs to be interpreted in the context of sexual health care service delivery in remote Aboriginal communities. In most urban sexual health services, patients are sent their results by text message in a few days. However in remote Aboriginal communities, Aboriginal health practitioners/workers and nurses, who are often responsible for locating patients, are part of and known to the community, so they need to be careful and sensitive about how they seek out individuals, which in turn means recall can be very time consuming. Also mobility is high in remote Aboriginal communities, due to personal, family or cultural reasons, and additional efforts may be needed to locate patients, including contacting other health services to see if they can assist.[<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] These processes in remote Aboriginal communities are similar to systems in countries in the Asia-Pacific region where village health workers or volunteers are tasked with locating community members for a range of health promotion interventions.[<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</p><p>There were also some minor points of dissatisfaction raised by staff interviewed. The lack of automated data flow between the GeneXpert and the patient management system and other concerns relating to connectivity will be addressed before wider implementation of the GeneXpert system in Australia. In addition, it will be important to work with implementing staff to ensure greater clarity around patient and sample identifiers used in the GeneXpert device; this issue could readily be resolved by modifying the software data fields and including additional resource material on this subject in future training materials.</p><p>A few staff had concerns about the risk of cross contamination between samples, however the closed cartridge system and the very low occurrence of discrepant results (specimens tested on the GeneXpert were also tested at reference laboratories for monitoring purposes during TTANGO) suggest that this is unlikely; it is possible that during training we over-emphasised the need to take care with specimen processing to reduce any risk of false positive results, but similarly, the attention to detail in training may be part of the reason that cross contamination of samples has not been an issue.</p><p>One participant noted that the GeneXpert CT/NG test result does not report on NG antibiotic sensitivity, which is otherwise conducted by Australian laboratories using cultured isolates (with one laboratory also using molecular methods to test for penicillinase producing N. gonorrhoea on all positive NG tests).[<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] This issue has been raised by stakeholders in previous research [<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and it is critical that in the future point-of-care NG test processes support specimens to be available for NG antimicrobial resistance surveillance.</p><p>While our findings suggest that ideally one or two staff members should be allocated responsibility to &#x02018;drive&#x02019; point-of-care testing within a service, this may be difficult to sustain given the realities of turnover of staffing in this context of remote Australia. Working in remote primary care is recognised to be extraordinarily challenging.[<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145993.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] Staff face competing demands, with chronic under-staffing and over-reliance on temporary staff to fill essential positions. Those in permanent positions or on longer term contracts are often required to back fill critical roles. High level organisational and management support is therefore critical if point-of-care testing for CT/NG is to be successfully integrated into this sector. It is, however, particularly encouraging that there was a high level of acceptability among Aboriginal health practitioners/workers. These staff are often the most stable members of the remote health workforce, but may perceive themselves to be low in the health workforce hierarchy and have a limited scope of practice. Findings suggested that having a role in GeneXpert testing empowered staff, giving them added responsibility for something very important, that could help improve the health of their community.</p><p>This is the first study to explore acceptability of the GeneXpert CT/NG in remote primary care in Australia or elsewhere. The main strength of this study is that we used qualitative methods, which are well suited to open-ended enquiry or exploratory research where little is known about the issue under study. Our study also has several limitations. The small sample size and non-random nature of the sampling strategy limit the generalisability of the results, however we did interview key staff involved in GeneXpert testing in seven of the 12 services. The interviewer was not completely independent of trial implementation; however there is no reason to believe that her relationship to the project affected responses. At this stage we are unable to comment in detail on whether there were acceptability issues beyond the users themselves.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec045"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Use of the GeneXpert in primary care services is a substantial change to clinical practice. In the context of a RCT, health professionals working in remote primary care in Australia found the GeneXpert CT/NG highly acceptable. These findings have implications for use in other primary care settings around the world. The next phase will involve a long-term program of GeneXpert CT/NG testing and an evaluation of sustainability.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>TTANGO is funded by a National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Project Grant #109902.
