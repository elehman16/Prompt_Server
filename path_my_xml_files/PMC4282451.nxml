This integrated analysis of data from three 12-week, double-blind trials evaluated the effect of prucalopride 2&#x000a0;mg q.d. on common constipation symptoms in women in whom laxatives had failed to provide adequate relief. The effect of prucalopride on bowel function was outside the scope of the analysis and has been described elsewhere.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Women with self-reported inadequate relief from laxatives and included in the prucalopride 2&#x000a0;mg or placebo arm of the trials were selected for analysis. Symptom severity was determined with the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC&#x02013;SYM) questionnaire. Observed changes from baseline in individual item scores were also evaluated by calculating Cohen's D effect sizes using baseline standard deviation (SD) (&#x0003e;0.2&#x02013;0.5, &#x0003e;0.5&#x02013;0.8 and &#x0003e;0.8 for small, moderate and large effects, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Key Results</title><p>Data were analyzed for 936 women. The proportion of women with a PAC-SYM severity score &#x0003e;2 at baseline was 50.0% for abdominal symptoms, 71.4% for stool symptoms, and 15.5% for rectal symptoms. Excluding the women without presence of a symptom at baseline from the effect size calculations showed that prucalopride 2&#x000a0;mg had a large effect (&#x0003e;0.8) on all PAC-SYM items, including abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, bloating, straining, and painful bowel movements. For abdominal symptoms and stool symptoms, effect sizes with prucalopride 2&#x000a0;mg were 1.3&#x02013;2.3 times larger than those with placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions &#x00026; Inferences</title><p>Prucalopride 2&#x000a0;mg q.d. for 12&#x000a0;weeks alleviates common constipation symptoms in women in whom laxatives had failed to provide adequate relief.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>abdominal discomfort</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>bloating</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>chronic constipation</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>PAC-SYM</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>painful bowel movements</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>prucalopride</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="box1" position="float"><caption><title>Key Messages</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This study shows that 12&#x000a0;weeks of treatment with prucalopride 2 mg once daily is associated with significant improvements, compared with placebo, in common constipation symptoms in women in whom previous laxative treatment had failed to provide adequate relief.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Prucalopride is a selective 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor agonist with gastrointestinal prokinetic activities.

The recommended dose is 2&#x000a0;mg once daily. In elderly women (&#x0003e;65&#x000a0;years), the recommended dose is 1&#x000a0;mg once daily (with an increase to 2&#x000a0;mg once daily, if needed).<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>The aim of the present integrated analysis was to evaluate and present the effects of prucalopride 2&#x000a0;mg, the recommended daily dose, on changes in constipation symptoms in women in the phase III trials in whom laxatives had failed to provide adequate relief (the population for which prucalopride is indicated in the EU).

The protocols were approved by independent Institutional Review Boards/independent Ethics Committees, and the trials were conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice, and local laws and regulations. Patients provided written informed consent before the first trial-related procedure. The trials are registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00488137, NCT00483886 and NCT00485940).</p><sec><title>Data source</title><p>Each original trial enrolled men and women &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years of age with chronic constipation. Patients were selected based on modified Rome II criteria for functional constipation, i.e., they had to have on average &#x02264;2 spontaneous (non-laxative induced) complete (resulting in a sensation of complete evacuation) bowel movements per week and one or more of the following, for a minimum of 6&#x000a0;months before trial entry: hard/very hard stools, straining during defecation, or a sensation of incomplete evacuation, with at least a quarter of bowel movements.<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Patients could not participate if their constipation was attributable to a secondary identified cause.</p><p>In each trial, following a 2-week drug-free run-in period, patients were randomized to double-blind treatment with placebo or prucalopride 2 or 4&#x000a0;mg once daily, for 12&#x000a0;weeks. Patients who did not have a bowel movement for three consecutive days were allowed to take bisacodyl (Dulcolax&#x000ae;, Boehringer Ingelheim, Ingelheim, Germany) or to use an enema. All patients entering the trials were asked whether they had used dietary measures, bulk-forming agents and/or other laxatives in the previous 6&#x000a0;months and, if so, whether they would rate the overall therapeutic effect of these measure(s) as &#x02018;adequate&#x02019; or &#x02018;inadequate&#x02019;.</p><p>In the analysis presented here, only female patients who reported &#x02018;inadequate&#x02019; relief from laxatives at trial entry and who received placebo or prucalopride at the recommended dose of 2&#x000a0;mg once daily, were included. Male patients and female patients who received prucalopride 4&#x000a0;mg were excluded from this analysis, because they do not reflect the target population and the recommended dose of prucalopride according to EU prescribing information.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p></sec><sec><title>PAC-SYM questionnaire</title><p>In each original trial, patients were asked to complete the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC-SYM) questionnaire at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12.</p><p>PAC-SYM is a 12-item, self-administered questionnaire used to measure severity of symptoms over the past 2&#x000a0;weeks in patients with constipation.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The questionnaire was developed based on literature review and patient interviews. Initial psychometric testing was performed in 216 constipated patients at nine centers in the United States, showing internal consistency, reproducibility, validity, and responsiveness to changes over time.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> PAC-SYM items are rated on a 5-point scale (0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;absent, 1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;mild, 2&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;moderate, 3&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;severe, 4&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;very severe) and grouped into three subscales related to abdominal symptoms (bloating, discomfort, pain, and cramps), stool symptoms (incomplete bowel movement, false alarm, straining, too hard, and too small), and rectal symptoms (painful bowel movement, burning, and bleeding or tearing). The total score and subscale scores are computed by taking the mean of item responses (score range 0&#x02013;4). A reduction in score reflects an improvement in symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed with Statistical Analysis System (SAS) software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

If more than 50% of items in the total scale/subscale were missing, the score for the total scale/subscale was set to &#x02018;missing&#x02019;. Rates of response to treatment were assessed by the percentage of patients with an improvement from baseline of &#x02265;1 in their PAC-SYM total score or subscale score, which is considered clinically meaningful.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>Changes from baseline in the individual PAC-SYM item scores were also evaluated.

Approximately 90% of patients in the prucalopride 2&#x000a0;mg and placebo groups completed the trials. The main reason for early trial discontinuation was the occurrence of adverse events (placebo: 3.8% and prucalopride 2&#x000a0;mg: 5.5%).

The improvements in PAC-SYM overall score as observed in this female population are similar to those reported previously for the all-patient population of the trials, comprising both men and women with chronic constipation who had or had not obtained self-perceived adequate relief from previous laxative therapy.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Overall, our findings indicate that the therapeutic effects of prucalopride at the recommended dose of 2&#x000a0;mg once daily are not limited to measurable bowel movements, as demonstrated in the individual phase III trials and an integrated analysis of these trials with focus on bowel function,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> but influence a range of symptoms measured by the PAC-SYM questionnaire.

This is noteworthy, because the patient population for the phase III trials used for this integrated analysis was heterogeneous and selected on the basis of their bowel function at trial entry and not on the basis of associated symptoms measured with the PAC-SYM questionnaire.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Unlike previous observations in a population-based sample,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> the most common constipation-related complaint reported at trial entry was infrequent defecation. This is likely due to the inclusion of more patients in the severe spectrum of chronic constipation, who present with very few bowel movements after failing previous therapies. The small effect size observed with prucalopride on symptoms like rectal bleeding/tearing and rectal burning when including all patients is due to the large proportion of patients (more than 50%) who did not have these symptoms at baseline. As such, a large group of patients with a zero baseline severity level was included, which largely contributed to the small effect size for these symptoms.</p><p>Health regulatory authorities in different parts of the world, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, recognize the usefulness of patient-reported outcome instruments in clinical trials when &#x02018;measuring a concept best known by the patient or best measured from the patient's perspective&#x02019;.<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> As such, patient-reported symptom severity can provide a more complete picture of treatment benefit in conditions such as chronic constipation in which patients are the primary source of information regarding symptom changes, in addition to bowel movement frequency. The PAC-SYM questionnaire was developed to capture the full symptom impact of chronic constipation from the patient's perspective.</p><p>A limitation of this integrated analysis relates to the selection of the patient population. The results were analyzed in a population of women in the trials who rated the overall therapeutic effect of dietary measures, bulk-forming agents and/or other laxatives in the previous 6&#x000a0;months as &#x02018;inadequate&#x02019; and who received placebo or prucalopride at the recommended dose of 2&#x000a0;mg once daily. These women comprised 71.0% (936/1318) of the total population in the pivotal trials. In addition, patients were eligible for inclusion in the trials if they met modified Rome II criteria for functional constipation. However, due to the currently accepted international definitions of functional digestive disorders, the edges between functional constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) are rather blurred. Although the Rome criteria present the two entities as mutually exclusive, the distinction remains largely artificial and we cannot exclude that some patients with symptoms resembling IBS-C may also have been included in the trials.</p><p>Based on the integrated analysis presented here, it can be concluded that prucalopride 2&#x000a0;mg once daily, taken for 12&#x000a0;weeks, effectively alleviates common abdominal and stool-related symptoms of chronic constipation in women in whom laxatives have failed to provide adequate relief.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Luc Wouters for his statistical advice, and Slavka Baronikova (Shire-Movetis NV) and Louisa Howard (Oxford PharmaGenesis&#x02122;) for their editorial and project management assistance.</p></ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>The clinical research was funded by the Janssen Research Foundation, Beerse, Belgium.
