What is less evident is the optimal timing of the resistance training stimulus to elicit these significant functional and structural skeletal muscle changes. Therefore, this investigation determined the impact of a single bout of resistance training performed either in the morning or evening upon acute anabolic signalling (insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), myogenic index and differentiation) and catabolic processes (cortisol). Twenty-four male participants (age 21.4&#x000b1;1.9yrs, mass 83.7&#x000b1;13.7kg) with no sustained resistance training experience were allocated to a resistance exercise group (REP). Sixteen of the 24 participants were randomly selected to perform an additional non-exercising control group (CP) protocol. REP performed two bouts of resistance exercise (80% 1RM) in the morning (AM: 0800 hrs) and evening (PM: 1800 hrs), with the sessions separated by a minimum of 72 hours. Venous blood was collected immediately prior to, and 5 min after, each resistance exercise and control sessions. Serum cortisol and IGFBP-3 levels, myogenic index, myotube width, were determined at each sampling period. All data are reported as mean &#x000b1; SEM, statistical significance was set at P&#x02264;0.05. As expected a significant reduction in evening cortisol concentration was observed at pre (AM: 98.4&#x000b1;10.5, PM: 49.8&#x000b1;4.4 ng/ml, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and post (AM: 98.0&#x000b1;9.0, PM: 52.7&#x000b1;6.0 ng/ml, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) exercise. Interestingly, individual cortisol differences pre vs post exercise indicate a time-of-day effect (AM difference: -2&#x000b1;2.6%, PM difference: 14.0&#x000b1;6.7%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.03). A time-of-day related elevation in serum IGFBP-3 (<bold>AM:</bold> 3274.9 &#x000b1; 345.2, <bold>PM:</bold> 3605.1 &#x000b1; 367.5, p = 0.032) was also evident. Pre exercise myogenic index (AM: 8.0&#x000b1;0.6%, PM: 16.8&#x000b1;1.1%) and myotube width (AM: 48.0&#x000b1;3.0, PM: 71.6&#x000b1;1.9 &#x003bc;m) were significantly elevated (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) in the evening. Post exercise myogenic index was greater AM (11.5&#x000b1;1.6%) compared with PM (4.6&#x000b1;0.9%). No difference was observed in myotube width (AM: 48.5&#x000b1;1.5, PM: 47.8&#x000b1;1.8 &#x003bc;m) (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05). Timing of resistance training regimen in the evening appears to augment some markers of hypertrophic potential, with elevated IGFBP-3, suppressed cortisol and a superior cellular environment. Further investigation, to further elucidate the time course of peak anabolic signalling in morning vs evening training conditions, are timely.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information file.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information file.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Throughout a 24-hour period skeletal muscle force production varies; based on endogenous fluctuations described as the &#x02018;circadian rhythm&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Evening peaks in muscular strength are apparent, with enhanced hormonal concentrations, neural activation, body temperature and reaction times all contributing to performance [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].

To date only one other investigation has studied time-of-day effect on muscle hypertrophy, though the mechanisms behind such adaptation were not identified [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Compared with morning (AM, 0800hrs) muscle contractile properties (muscular strength or force production) are enhanced in the evening (PM, 1800hrs) [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, no differences in muscular strength and hypertrophy development have been reported between the chronic AM compared to PM training [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161500.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161500.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Indeed no change in muscular strength or hypertrophy is contradictory to reports indicating an optimal muscle hypertrophic environment with reduced catabolic and elevated anabolic hormones [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>A well established and investigated catabolic hormone is &#x02018;cortisol&#x02019;, which varies in its concentrations throughout a 24-hour period [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Cortisol concentrations peak in the AM at 0700hrs to stimulate metabolism, gluconeogenesis and proteolytic activity, subsequently protein turnover [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Cortisol concentrations elevate post resistance exercise in order to stimulate gluconeogenesis for protein synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, to combine already elevated levels in the AM, with the performance of AM resistance exercise may result in a catabolic environment attenuating protein synthesis. Thus, to exercise in the AM may be counterproductive. In contrast, cortisol levels begin to decline after 0700hrs, with a 92% decline between 0600hrs to 2300hrs, possibly indicating a superior pro-hypertrophic endocrine environment at PM [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Not all hormones and proteins are controlled through the circadian rhythm, in fact no diurnal fluctuations in IGFBPs are observed. Of the six IGFBPs, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) has been identified as by far the most abundant [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161500.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. IGFBP-3 prolongs the circulation and biological action of the protein &#x02018;insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which stimulates muscle hypertrophy [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Post resistance exercise significant increases in both IGFBP-3 and IGF-1 are observed to stimulate protein synthesis, subsequently muscle hypertrophy [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161500.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In fact, IGFBP-3 has been shown to have a significant and direct effect on myoblast differentiation, even without the presence of IGF-1 [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Therefore performing resistance exercise when catabolic hormones are diminished (i.e. in the PM) would suggest the optimal time for muscle hypertrophy development. Thus, to track the concentration of IGFBP-3 in the AM and PM would enable any change in muscle hypertrophy to be ascribed to the presence of the binding protein.</p><p>To date no other investigation has studied a time-of-day effect of IGFBP-3 and cortisol on muscle hypertrophy through the treatment of C2C12 mice cell line within human sera. Thus, the present investigation explores the time-of-day effects of an acute resistance exercise protocol on the hypertrophic potential through the treatment of human sera on a C2C12 mice cell-line. Secondly the concentrations of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) and cortisol will be analysed to help explain any possible difference in cellular differentiation.</p><p>Through understanding that, and controlling for, enhanced physical performance in the evening, along with an expectation of an optimal anabolic and catabolic environment, it was hypothesized that PM exercise (1800hrs) would produce a greater post exercise IGFBP-3 flux compared with AM exercise (0800hrs). Furthermore, it was hypothesized that the evening would present metabolic and endocrine responses favourable to enhanced muscle growth confirmed through C2C12 differentiation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods and Materials</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty-four healthy male university students volunteered to take part in this study (age 21.4&#x000b1;1.9yrs, mass 83.7&#x000b1;13.7kg).

Ours is also the first investigation to illustrate, through in vitro C2C12 cellular differentiation in the presence of human sera sampled at varying exercise conditions, how diurnal hormonal variation may optimise musculoskeletal hypertrophy. With two sessions chosen to coincide with either high or low cortisol levels, our results reveal a time-of-day effect on the IGFBP-3 response to resistance exercise in healthy male adults. More specifically, the overall difference in the acute IGFBP-3 responses of AM versus PM training was significant (a 14.0 &#x000b1; 6.7% difference). Sera volumes cannot explain these changes as there were no AM to PM differences. We can also postulate that with low levels of cortisol in the evening, the cellular environment favours an enhanced anabolic potential as suggested through the high pre-exercise PM myogenic index (%) and myotube width (&#x003bc;m). The above <italic>in vivo</italic> effects may partially be mediated through greater energetic demands on the skeletal muscle systems in the evening, as evidenced through the greater lactate levels at PM both in resting and post-exercise states.</p><p>These findings provide a key insight into the response patterns of the circulating ternary complex (IGF-1, IGBP-3 and acid-labile subunit (ALS) complex) following resistance exercise at different times of the day. A greater increase in IGFBP-3 following resistance exercise in the evening, could suggest an increase in the amount of free IGF-I available [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However we must acknowledge here that the evidence is not necessarily for free IGF-I to increase when IGFBP-3 levels acutely augment with resistance exercise, since the evidence also suggests that IGF-I may in fact attach to different binding proteins depending on the exercise status [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Whatever the case, the present data suggests that the acute effects of high resistance training on the IGF-I system is linked to an alteration in the partitioning of the ternary complex, to a degree that can be detected in the systemic circulation [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>When investigating the daily variation in IGFBP-3 concentrations, previous work has shown a systematic change in the resting levels of this ligand. Thus, a relative plateau is seen between 0800&#x02013;1500hrs after which a lower plateau is observed between 1500&#x02013;2000hrs, followed by a steeper decline between 2000&#x02013;0800hrs [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Our data are very much congruent with these observations. The changes we observe with IGFBP-3 in the current study in the training (but not the control) population would support the idea that total IGF-1 does not have a diurnal rhythm. If we also accept the idea that free IGF-1 levels mirror IGFBP-3 concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], thus, PM provides an environment for increased hypertrophic milieu. In addition, the control group data does in fact reflect that of previous reports [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and supports our interpretations that the changes discussed here are due to an acute training response rather than a circadian effect.</p><p>In terms of previous literature on the hormonal impact of resistance exercise, a previous study found no significant increase in IGFBP-3 immediately following resistance exercise [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Interestingly, while these authors scheduled their exercise session at a similar time to the present investigation&#x02019;s AM session, they reported a mean increase of 12ng/ml (a 0.4% change, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05) following resistance exercise, whereas a -1.7% change, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05 was discovered in the present investigation. Although none of the trends in either ours or this previous report were statistically significant, there is a suggestion of a between studies difference nonetheless, and we propose this effect could have been due to the previous authors including a pre-exercise meal [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This pre-feeding may have influenced the post-exercise IGFBP-3 value and the subsequent increase compared to the fasting pre-exercise IGFBP-3 value in our current investigation. Similarly, reports indicate a significant increase in IGFBP-3 following resistance exercise, however, this increase was compared to a control group rather than a within subject comparison [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Therefore inter-individual differences could have been partly responsible for the 270ng/ml (~7.6%, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) increase in IGFBP-3. In contrast, participants in the present investigation were required to fast for 10 hrs prior to both exercise sessions, in order to limit the influence of prandial state. Furthermore, our blood glucose readings highlight that there was neither a lack of adherence to the fasting request, nor an overlong period of under supplementation of nutrients.</p><p>Regarding the possibility that the changes observed in the hormonal concentrations may have been caused by alterations in blood fluidity, it should be noted that no change was observed in packed blood cell volume when comparing 0800hrs (~41.75%) with ~1800hrs (~42.75%) [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In contrast, previous investigations have reported a reduced plasma volume (~3.5%) at PM measurements when compared with AM [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Furthermore, resistance exercise has shown to reduce plasma volume by 13% [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In fact, the effect of exercise on plasma volume does not appear to alter with time-of-day [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This is an effect we also found in the present investigation in that training did not differentially change the acute plasma volume decrease (probably since the same load was used for the two training sessions). Therefore, with the current research question focussed on the differential acute hormonal response to training, we may conclude that our data demonstrate a time-of-day effect on both IGFBP-3 concentration and total levels changes in response to training.</p><p>Examining time-of-day effect on cell differentiation further supports the idea that training in the evening (1800hrs) may provide an optimal hypertrophic environment. Previous work investigating anabolic and catabolic concentration ratios indicates a superior anabolic environment in the evening [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. More specifically cortisol concentrations are significantly reduced in the evening matching our findings. Furthermore, the greater change in IGFBP-3 in the evening may elicit increased IGF-1 levels, which has shown to reduce glucocorticiod expression and promote protein synthesis through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The capacity of IGF-1 is to rapidly inhibit catabolic processes and increase cellular proliferation and differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Further contributing to this environment, is higher PM body temperature, which would enhance enzyme activity [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>Our cell culture data (C2C12 myogenic index (11.5&#x000b1;1.6% AM vs 4.6&#x000b1;0.9% PM) and myotube width (48.0&#x000b1; 2.0&#x003bc;m AM vs 71.6&#x000b1;1.9&#x003bc;m PM adaptations) illustrate that, of the two time options tested, the optimal time to enhance muscle cross-sectional area is 1800hrs. Indeed together with the pre-exercise lower cortisol concentration, and similar IGFBP-3 concentrations at PM, our observations suggests a positive anabolic environment for the muscle cell, thereby leading to increased protein synthesis potential [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This positive potential may also be attributed to the high PM blood lactate (the latter shown both in the present study and a previous report [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]).</p><p>Interestingly, Foulstone, <italic>et al</italic>. (2003) concluded that timing and amount of IGFBP-3 present within a cellular environment is critical [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. High levels of IGFBP-3 too early during differentiation will prevent the initial round of proliferation producing lower myoblast number and smaller myotubes. However, post-exercise AM saw a significant increase in myogenic index (%) with no change in cortisol and IGFBP-3 concentration. The reduced concentration of IGFBP-3 post-exercise AM may have contributed to the increased myogenic index (%) when considering Foulstone&#x02019;s conclusions.</p><p>With evidence suggesting IGFBP-3 concentration inhibits proliferation when concentrations are &#x02018;too much too early&#x02019; and evidence indicating protein synthesis increases 2&#x02013;3 hours post resistance exercise [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] we must consider all viable possibilities to why post-exercise PM myotube width (&#x003bc;m) did not continue the same pattern as produced by pre-exercise PM. One possibility previously mentioned could be blood lactate concentrations, interestingly blood lactate has correlated with Interleukin-6 which is released post muscular damage and inhibits protein synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. However Pledge, <italic>et al</italic>. (2001) dismissed this conclusion indicating exercise or time of day does not interfere with clinical endocrine profiling of IL-6 [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. A further possibility could be the energy sensing cellular pathway AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) which inhibits protein synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Results presented that immediately following a bout of resistance exercise, AMPK activity increased by 75%, supressing downstream protein synthesis pathways by 36%.</p><p>Unlike the present study, many of the previous studies focusing on the IGFBP-3 and cortisol response to resistance exercise [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], have used varying loads. Notably, Bermon, et al. utilised two sets of 12 repetitions at 12-RM and four sets of 5 repetitions at 5-RM [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. While Nindl et al. [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] alternated between 10- and 5-RM loads, calculated as 70 and 85% 1-RM. Other researchers, including Kraemer et al. [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] used a load (50% 1RM) considerably lower than the load used for the afore-mentioned (&#x02018;variable load&#x02019;) studies. When investigating testosterone:cortisol ratio change in response to resistance exercise, a similar protocol (75% 1RM, 8&#x02013;10 reps x 3 sets) produced comparable results to the present study [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although testosterone was not measured in the present investigation, the increased myotube width (&#x003bc;m) and myogenic index (%) pre PM exercise suggests that high levels of testosterone were present. It is important to consider experimental load when comparing results, as the use of differing loads appear to lead to a differential impact on the hormonal response to the resistance exercise [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Our works nevertheless further supports the idea that heavy resistance exercise protocols elicit an acute hormonal response, which destabilises the tertiary complex, allowing its individual components to impart their physiological effect. Moreover, this is the first demonstration of a diurnal aspect to the magnitude of this hormonal response. Our data therefore pave the way for future research as it provides the rationale for investigations into determining the range and magnitude of the IGF proteins acute response to training, to manipulate endocrine profile simply through time-of-day.</p><p>There is a multitude of endocrine factors involved in the post-training response. Whilst it was beyond the scope of our research to investigate all potential pathways for the key outcome of interest (i.e. muscle hypertrophy), we have investigated the impact of this cocktail of endocrine factors through culture of the C2C12 model, in order to determine the overall impact of the range of hormonal changes on the hypertrophic potential of skeletal muscle cells. However, we recognise that it is not simply the acute signalling changes that are important but the continued endocrine profile. Indeed it is known that the increase in protein synthesis which leads to protein accretion and subsequent muscle growth from an acute bout of resistance exercise lasts for up to 48 hours following exercise [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In relation to this, changes in the ternary complex and subsequently the possibility of changes in free IGF-I, beyond 13 hours after resistance exercise is unknown, as this time lapse is the longest period of time in which the IGFBP-3 and the other constituents of the ternary complex have been monitored. Nonetheless, our work is seminal in specifically aiming to provide the first clue of the changes associated with time-of-day-related hormonal profile impact on the acute training response.</p><p>Future research investigating the cellular response to IGFBP-3 and cortisol to resistance exercise should take account of this and monitor the whole ternary complex for 48 hours following exercise. Future work should also aim to investigate a) the duration of the observed PM-related increased hypertrophic potential i.e. whether it is simply acute or is in fact maintained over up to 48 hours, b) whether the acute (and if found, the 48-hours sustained) endocrine response would have a chronic impact on muscle hypertrophy in vivo. Indeed there is a line of thought that proposes that endocrine factors may not necessarily be markers of hypertrophic potential in adults [<xref rid="pone.0161500.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161500.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Practically, research would need to be carried out where this manipulation of the timing of resistance training would be made in a chronic fashion (e.g. 3 or more weeks when using the more sensitive assessments of lean tissue content such as MRI). Such a study would involve a group training at PM compared to a group training at the proposed &#x02018;less advantageous time-of-day (i.e. AM), in order for any definitive statement regarding the practical importance our current findings to be made. In addition, future work could also use our new model of demonstrating proof of principle of endocrine milieu effects.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0161500.s001">S1 File</xref>) demonstrates that there is a time-of-day effect on the IGFBP-3 response to resistance exercise confirmed through cell culture with the evening exercise session producing an enhanced hypertrophic milieu. The response of the whole ternary complex for an extended period of time in order to identify the mechanisms responsible for IGF-I stimulated satellite cell activity, is warranted in future work. Future work should also look to incubate the cell culture for different time periods, hence extracting information on the time course of the effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0161500.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Individual worksheets containing the data presented in this paper.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0161500.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0161500.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Carrier</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Monk</surname><given-names>TH</given-names></name>. <article-title>Circadian rhythms of performance: new trends</article-title>. <source>Chronobiology international</source>. <year>2000</year>;<volume>17</volume>(<issue>6</issue>):<fpage>719</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>32</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11128289</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0161500.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Drust</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Waterhouse</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Atkinson</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Edwards</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Reilly</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name>. <article-title>Circadian rhythms in sports performance-an update</article-title>. <source>Chronobiology international</source>. <year>2005</year>;<volume>22</volume>(<issue>1</issue>):<fpage>21</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>44</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15865319</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0161500.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Melhim</surname><given-names>AF</given-names></name>. <article-title>Investigation of circadian rhythms in peak power and mean power of female physical education students</article-title>. <source>International Journal of Sports Medicine</source>. <year>1993</year>;<volume>14</volume>(<issue>6</issue>):<fpage>303</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>6</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8407059</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0161500.ref004"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Pearson</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Onambele</surname><given-names>GN</given-names></name>. <article-title>Acute changes in knee-extensors torque, fiber pennation, and tendon characteristics</article-title>. <source>Chronobiol Int</source>. <year>2005</year>;<volume>22</volume>(<issue>6</issue>):<fpage>1013</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>27</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16393705</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0161500.ref005"><label>5</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Refinetti</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Menaker</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>. <article-title>The circadian rhythm of body temperature</article-title>. <source>Physiology &#x00026;
