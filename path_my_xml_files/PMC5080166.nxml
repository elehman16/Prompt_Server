the shoulder function of patients with calcific tendinitis through a 12-week follow-up.
[Subjects and Methods] A total of 34 patients with calcific tendinitis participated in
this study. In the extracorporeal shock wave therapy group, 18 patients received 6-week
extracorporeal shock wave therapy and 12-week follow-up. The Constant-Murley scale was
used to evaluate shoulder joint function. [Results] Analysis of variance showed a
significant difference between the measurement periods. The independent t-test showed
significant differences between the groups at 2, 6, and 12 weeks. [Conclusion]
Extracorporeal shock wave therapy can be an effective treatment method for calcific
tendinitis that affects patients&#x02019; shoulder function.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Extracorporeal shock wave therapy</kwd><kwd>Calcifying tendinitis</kwd><kwd>Constant-Murley scale</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>No specific causes of calcific tendinitis, which is common in women in their forties and

Spontaneous dissolution of calcification deposits may improve symptoms but causes pain due
to the long dissolution time and discomfort in daily life<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Conservative treatments
such as the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, subacromial steroid injection,
ultrasonography, radiation treatment, and physical therapy have been used for calcific
tendinitis of the shoulder joint<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
However, the effects of these methods were reported to be limited. Surgical removal under
arthroscopy and open techniques can be helpful to improve symptoms when calcific tendinitis
is unresponsive to conservative treatment<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Needle insertion may cause severe inflammation and damage to
tendons<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has been reported to be a noninvasive method, to
be associated with decreased enthesopathic pain, and to have a positive treatment effect on
calcific tendinitis<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, only few follow-up and physical therapy research studies
have been conducted for calcific tendinitis treatment using ESWT. The purpose of this study
was to analyze the effect of ESWT on calcific tendinitis through long-term follow-up.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study included a sample of 40 patients with calcific tendinitis, aged 40 to 65&#x02005;years,
who were hospitalized in or visited P hospital in Suncheon City, Jeollanam-do Province,
South Korea. Prior to participation, all the participants were informed of the purpose and
methods of the study, and agreed to participate in the study by providing written consent,
in accordance with the ethical standard of the Declaration of Helsinki. The participants
were randomly divided into the ESWT group (n=20) and control group (n=20). However, 2
patients in the ESWT group and 4 in the control group wished to withdraw from the study and
were excluded. Finally, 34 patients completed the study.</p><p>The selection criteria for the participants were patients with calcific tendinitis
diagnosed on ultrasonography by a specialist. Patients who were identified to have rotator
cuff tear or subacromial bursitis on a clinical test, ultrasonography, and shoulder joint
magnetic resonance imaging, and those with neck bone problems, scapulothoracic joint
inflammation, pregnancy, and neurological symptoms were excluded.</p><p><xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of the study subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ESWT group</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (male/female)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7/11</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/12</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years), mean &#x000b1; SD</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50.2 &#x000b1; 5.6</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">53.0 &#x000b1; 4.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Side (dom/nondom)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16/2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16/2</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>ESWT: extracorporeal shock wave therapy. dom: dominant; nondom: non dominant</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap> shows the general characteristics of the participants. All the participants
received nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for 6 weeks and 20-minute hot pack placement
as basic physical therapy (hot pack), 15-minute transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation
(placing a surface electrode on the aching part of the shoulder joint and stimulating with
asymmetrical biphasic pulsed waves of 100&#x02005;Hz with a density of 20&#x02013;30 mA), and 5-minute
ultrasonographic therapy with a density of 1&#x02005;W/cm<sup>2</sup>, 3 times per week for 12
weeks. In addition, the treatment group received ESWT using OssaTron Orthotripsy (High
Medicial Technology, Kreuzlinern, Switzerland) 960 times, with an energy flux density of
0.14&#x02005;mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>, and a frequency of 4&#x02005;Hz or 240 impulses/minute per therapy. ESWT
was conducted 3 times a week until 6 weeks, but not from 6 to 12 weeks. Functional
assessment of the patients was performed at 2, 6, and 12 weeks.</p><p>The Constant-Murley scale (CMS), a standardized clinical measurement method for shoulder
joint function evaluation, was used in this study. The assessment items were pain (15
points), range of motion (20 points), activities of daily life (40 points), and muscle power
(25 points), and scored up to 100 points. A higher point of each item or total score
indicated greater shoulder joint function.</p><p>For the statistical analysis, the homogeneity test results on the demographic
characteristics of the participants were analyzed with the chi-square test and independent
t-test. Two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to examine the difference
between the measurement periods. An independent t-test was used to analyze the difference
between the groups in each period. Statistical analysis was performed by using the PASW 18.0
software for Windows. The statistical significance level was set at

joint, and surgical treatment was the only alternative. However, nowadays, ESWT is being
discussed as a new treatment method for calcific tendinitis<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Shock wave is a type of
sound wave that can spread through soft tissues without energy loss. It causes the vibration
of tissue molecules and improves the effect of cavitation and fragmentation of calcific
crystal to remove the crystal<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
success rate of ESWT for calcific lesions of the shoulder joint has been reported to range
from 30% to 85%. However, results are controversial because of the differences in the number
of treatment applications, volume, and treatment method<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Shock waves are concentrated on focal areas, and the energy at the focal area is defined as
energy flux density (EFD) per impulse. Low-energy shock waves have an EFD of approximately
0.1&#x02005;mJ/mm<sup>2</sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study
evaluated shoulder function status by using CMS at each period with low-energy shock waves
of 0.14&#x02005;mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>. Loew et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>
analyzed the effect of ESWT in 30 patients with calcific tendinitis. The results of the
3-month follow-up showed that 75% of the patients experienced a CMS increase of 30% and a
decrease in pain. The study of Rompe et al. about ESWT (single shot) showed that 72% of the
40 patients with shoulder joint calcific tendinitis noticed an improvement in symptoms in
the CMS test<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study also showed that ESWT is an effective treatment method because the CMS score
increased more rapidly with remarkable shoulder joint function improvement in the treatment
group. However, side effects such as local flare or subcutaneous hematoma after ESWT have
been reported<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study showed no
side effects due to the application of low-energy shock waves.</p><p>The limitations of this study were as follows: the emphases were on the treatment effect
because the patients who wanted to receive ESWT were assigned in the treatment group, on the
improvement in symptoms due to natural death of calcific tendinitis, and on the effect of
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the treatment outcome. However, this study showed
that low-volume ESWT was also effective for calcific tendinitis. A better-controlled
experimental group and standard protocol for maximizing the treatment effect of ESWT on
calcific tendinitis will be needed in future studies.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Gerdesmeyer</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Wagenpfeil</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Haake</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Extracorporeal shock wave therapy for the treatment of
