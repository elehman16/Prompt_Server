However, methods of treatment may be lacking for patients who are not ideal surgical candidates.<sup>1,2,3</sup> We investigated a novel conservative treatment using the IV-3000 (Smith and Nephew) semipermeable dressing, a ubiquitous medical supply. The dressing allows the fingertip to heal by secondary intention, creating a wound microenvironment with a high rate of moisture transmission and limited re-traumatization.<sup>4,5</sup></p><p><bold>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</bold> All patients with simple distal fingertip injury were treated using the IV-3000 dressing protocol during the study period. This original protocol involves creating a sandwich of two adhesive IV-3000 patches around the digit. Patients reapplied the dressing at home every three to four days and were evaluated in office for re-epithelialization and digit function.</p><p><bold>RESULTS:</bold> Fifteen fingertip injuries were successfully treated with the conservative protocol. There were no significant complications or treatment failures in any of the patients. Wounds showed full re-epithelization in as little as two weeks and were healed by six to eight weeks.</p><p><bold>CONCLUSION:</bold> In conclusion, the IV-3000 wound management protocol is an excellent option for patients unsuited to surgical treatment of fingertip wounds, and it may be easily implemented by plastic surgeons in their daily clinical practice. The dressing allows for outpatient management of fingertip wounds while yielding results that are excellent in terms of aesthetics and preserved digit function.</p><p><bold><italic>DISCLOSURES:</italic></bold>
