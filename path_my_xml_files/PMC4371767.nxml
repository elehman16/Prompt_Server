Three cohorts of HIV-infected adults aged &#x02265;18 years were enrolled: 94 ART recipients with a CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count of &#x02265;200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, 14 ART recipients with a CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count of 50&#x02013;199 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, and 15 ART-naive adults with a CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count of &#x02265;500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>.

Median cell-mediated immune responses peaked after dose 2. Humoral and cell-mediated immune responses persisted until the end of the study (month 18).

The incidence of HZ in the general population is 2.0&#x02013;3.6 cases per 1000 person-years, with higher incidence rates in adults &#x02265;50 years of age and in immunocompromised people, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#x02013;infected individuals [<xref rid="JIU606C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIU606C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) plays a major role in controlling VZV reactivation, and CMI in HIV-infected individuals can be substantially and persistently compromised [<xref rid="JIU606C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIU606C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART), HZ incidence rates were 10&#x02013;20 times higher in HIV-infected adults than in the age-matched general population [<xref rid="JIU606C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="JIU606C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="JIU606C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIU606C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Since ART was introduced, HZ incidence rates have decreased to approximately 10 cases per 1000 person-years but remain 3&#x02013;5 times higher than in the general population [<xref rid="JIU606C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="JIU606C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="JIU606C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

Furthermore, recurrent HZ cases are more frequent in HIV-infected individuals [<xref rid="JIU606C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="JIU606C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="JIU606C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="JIU606C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Similar to the incidence of HZ itself, complication rates are also higher in HIV-infected subjects than in the age-matched general population (27%&#x02013;28% vs 10%&#x02013;13%) [<xref rid="JIU606C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="JIU606C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="JIU606C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and include cutaneous dissemination, chronic atypical skin lesions, or ocular and neurological complications [<xref rid="JIU606C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="JIU606C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="JIU606C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="JIU606C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Because of the high incidence of HZ and its complications, vaccination offers the potential for substantial benefit in HIV-infected individuals. However, concerns exist about the use of the licensed HZ live-attenuated vaccine (Zostavax; Merck) for immunocompromised individuals, including some HIV-infected subpopulations, because of its potential to cause disease [<xref rid="JIU606C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="JIU606C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A recombinant subunit vaccine may thus be an appropriate alternative for preventing HZ in this population [<xref rid="JIU606C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="JIU606C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>VZV glycoprotein E (gE) is a promising HZ vaccine antigen because it is a major target of anti-VZV cellular and humoral immune responses [<xref rid="JIU606C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="JIU606C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIU606C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Phase 1/2 and phase 2 randomized trials showed that a subunit HZ vaccine candidate (HZ/su) consisting of 50 &#x000b5;g gE and the liposome-based adjuvant system AS01<sub>B</sub> induced strong and durable cellular and humoral immune responses and had a clinically acceptable safety profile in healthy older adults [<xref rid="JIU606C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIU606C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In this population, 2 doses of HZ/su were strongly immunogenic. However, in HIV-infected individuals, it is not known whether 2 doses would generate a similarly robust immune response or whether a third dose would substantially enhance it. Thus, in the current study, HIV-infected adults received 3 doses of HZ/su, and immunogenicity was evaluated after 2 and 3 doses. Furthermore, safety and reactogenicity of HZ/su were evaluated in this immunocompromised population.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Design</title><p>This phase 1/2a, randomized, observer-masked, placebo-controlled, multicenter study evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of the HZ/su vaccine candidate (GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines) in comparison to saline when administered as a 3-dose schedule to HIV-infected adults (clinical trials registration: NCT01165203).

First, HZ/su was administered to subjects in the ART/high CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count cohort. Once the safety of 2 HZ/su doses had been evaluated by a safety committee composed of GlaxoSmithKline personnel and 1 non&#x02013;GlaxoSmithKline-affiliated HIV expert for the first 25 subjects in this cohort, enrollment was initiated for subjects in the ART/low CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count and ART-naive/high CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count cohorts. Similarly, the safety of the third dose in the ART/high CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count cohort and of the second dose in the ART/low CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count and ART-naive/high CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count cohorts was evaluated before third doses were administered to the ART/low CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count and ART-naive/high CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count cohorts.

None of them were considered by the investigator to be related to vaccination. One subject withdrew because of 2 SAEs (portal hypertension and esophageal variceal hemorrhage) 97 days after the second HZ/su dose. No deaths and no new onset of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases were reported during the study.</p><p>Fourteen subjects met protocol-defined criteria for a possible worsening of HIV disease through month 7. Nine subjects (12.2%) in the HZ/su group and 5 (10.2%) in the saline group reported at least 1 event of increased HIV RNA loads or decreased CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts to prespecified levels. Of these, an increase in HIV RNA load was reported by 3 subjects (4.1%) in the HZ/su group and 1 (2.0%) in the saline group, whereas a &#x0003e;30% decrease in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count was reported by 7 subjects (9.5%) in the HZ/su group and 4 (8.2%) in the saline group. Overall, vaccination with HZ/su had no sustained impact on CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts or HIV loads, and HZ/su vaccination did not affect mean CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts or the proportion of subjects with an HIV RNA load of &#x02265;40 copies/mL at any time through month 18 (data not shown). No clinically relevant changes in hematological or biochemical parameters were found, and no significant changes to ART (due to increased HIV RNA level or decreased CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count) or AIDS-defining conditions were reported.</p><p>One case of HZ was reported during the study. This case occurred in the HZ/su group 83 days after the subject's first and only vaccine dose.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This study showed that HZ/su elicits strong gE-specific cell-mediated and humoral immune responses in HIV-infected individuals after 2 and 3 doses and that the responses after dose 3 persist over prevaccination levels at least 1 year after the last vaccination. HZ/su also elicited VZV-specific cell-mediated immune responses but to a lesser extent. Furthermore, although the reactogenicity of HZ/su was substantial, no safety concerns arose in this population.</p><p>The primary immunogenicity objective of the study was met. The superiority of HZ/su over saline was demonstrated at month 7 for both humoral and cellular immune responses. These immune responses were comparable to those seen in healthy adults &#x02265;50 years of age [<xref rid="JIU606C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In addition, 1 year after vaccination, the gE-specific CD4(2+) T-cell responses were higher than those seen 1 month after natural HZ [<xref rid="JIU606C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. HZ/su is being evaluated as a 2-dose schedule in immunocompetent older adults, but it was not known whether 2 or 3 doses would be required to trigger a strong immune response in HIV-infected individuals. The administration of a third dose did not show substantial additional benefit over 2 doses in terms of gE-specific humoral and CMI immune responses. These results suggest that, in terms of immunogenicity, a 2-dose schedule (at 0 and 2 months) is appropriate for HIV-infected adults, most of whom were receiving ART and have higher CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts, as it is for healthy older adults [<xref rid="JIU606C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="JIU606C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Moreover, these results were similar to those obtained in another immunocompromised population, adult autologous HSCT recipients, in whom HZ/su was also strongly immunogenic [<xref rid="JIU606C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Local and systemic reactions were common among HZ/su recipients, and up to 1 of 6 subjects experienced a severe solicited reaction, mostly injection site pain and fatigue. However, these reactions were transient, and no subject withdrew from the study because of a solicited reaction. No vaccination-related SAEs, deaths, or new onsets of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases were reported. Furthermore, HZ/su had no sustained impact on either HIV RNA concentrations or CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts over the study period.</p><p>Few previous studies have assessed vaccination against HZ in HIV-infected populations. One study evaluated safety and immunogenicity of 2 doses of a live-attenuated varicella vaccine (Varivax; Merck) as a HZ vaccine candidate in HIV-infected adults with CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts of &#x0003e;400 cells/&#x000b5;L and HIV RNA loads of &#x0003c; 1000 copies/mL [<xref rid="JIU606C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The vaccine was well tolerated and did not worsen HIV disease, but it was modestly immunogenic. When given as 4 doses in HIV-infected adults with &#x02264;200 CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, a heat-inactivated HZ vaccine induced low but significant VZV-specific T-cell and antibody responses and had a favorable safety profile [<xref rid="JIU606C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>This study has some limitations. Because of the widespread use of ART in clinical practice in countries participating in the study, we could not enroll many subjects in the ART/low CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count and ART-naive cohorts. Therefore, because most subjects were in the ART/high CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count cohort, we pooled subjects of the 3 cohorts for analysis. The analyses in the individual ART/low CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count and ART-naive/high CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count cohorts had low statistical power because of the low numbers of subjects enrolled in these cohorts. However, humoral and cellular immune responses were generally higher in the HZ/su groups than in the saline groups in both cohorts. In this study, all subjects were to receive 3 doses of HZ/su; thus, long-term immunopersistence after 2 doses could not be assessed. These data would be of interest because a 2-dose schedule is currently being evaluated in healthy older adults and may also be appropriate for HIV-infected adults.</p><p>One clinically confirmed case of HZ occurred in a subject who received 1 dose of HZ/su; however, this study was not designed to assess vaccine efficacy. Furthermore, in the absence of an immunological correlate of protection for HZ [<xref rid="JIU606C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], correlation between the immune responses described here and the level of clinical protection against HZ cannot be inferred, especially in this immunocompromised population.</p><p>In conclusion, this study showed that HZ/su elicits strong gE-specific cellular and humoral immune responses in HIV-infected individuals after 2 doses and that the third dose added little if any immunological advantage. Immunization with an adjuvanted gE subunit vaccine may be an appropriate approach to reduce the burden of HZ and its complications in HIV-infected adults and avoid any risks specific to a live-attenuated vaccine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/infdis/jiu606/-/DC1">Supplementary materials</ext-link> are available at <italic>The Journal of Infectious Diseases</italic> online (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org">http://jid.oxfordjournals.org</uri>).
