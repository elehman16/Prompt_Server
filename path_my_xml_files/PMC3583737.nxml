Eligible and consenting participants (aged 18&#x000a0;years or older) will be randomised in equal numbers to either a BI delivered by 17 community pharmacists or a non-intervention control condition. The intervention will be a brief motivational discussion to support a reduction in alcohol consumption and will take approximately 10&#x000a0;minutes to deliver. Participants randomised to the control arm will be given an alcohol information leaflet with no opportunity for discussion. Study pharmacists will be volunteers who respond to an invitation to participate, sent to all community pharmacists in the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. Participating pharmacists will receive 7&#x000a0;hours training on trial procedures and the delivery of BI. Pharmacy support staff will also receive training (4&#x000a0;hours) on how to approach and inform pharmacy customers about the study, with formal trial recruitment undertaken by the pharmacist in a consultation room.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Population-level interventions that seek to influence the price, availability and cultural acceptability of heavy drinking are likely to be most effective in reducing these problems
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These may be complemented by individual-level interventions delivered in health services and elsewhere. The UK Department of Health aims to involve community pharmacists in delivering alcohol brief interventions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. It has recommended that pharmacy based alcohol interventions should be piloted and evaluated.</p><p>Brief interventions are discussions which seek to change views of the personal acceptability of excessive drinking and to encourage self-directed behaviour change. They include simple forms of structured advice and brief counselling. Typically, questions about alcohol use are asked to motivate the person to take action to change drinking where this may be beneficial
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. There is strong evidence to support the effectiveness of BI to reduce alcohol consumption in primary healthcare
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In 21 randomised controlled trials conducted in primary health care settings with 7,286 participants, those who received BI reduced their alcohol consumption by 41 grams/week (five U.K. units of alcohol) on average compared to those who did not receive BI
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However there are no trials which have assessed the effectiveness of BI delivered in the community pharmacy setting.</p><p>It is useful to think of three types of drinking that are injurious to health: a) Hazardous drinking (which carries a risk of harmful consequences to the drinker for example occasional binge drinking); b) Harmful drinking (pattern of drinking already causing psychological or physical damage to health) and c) Dependent drinking (which may benefit from specialist intervention)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The World Health Organisation (W.H.O) 10-item Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) screening tool has been extensively validated in identifying those whose drinking is hazardous or harmful, including those who are dependent
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Guided by the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], the design of this trial has been informed by our previous studies assessing pharmacy customers&#x02019; perceptions and the feasibility of BI in community pharmacies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and studies that recommend establishing the acceptability of discussing alcohol use in health care settings
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Our NHS Westminster study which assessed 102 pharmacy customers perceptions of BI established that most customers (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;97, 96%) would find it acceptable to discuss their drinking with the pharmacist
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Our uncontrolled before and after study of BI in community pharmacies in Lambeth involved training 29 community pharmacists in BI and monitoring change in drinking among a cohort of service users
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Experiences of receiving the service, and the barriers and enablers experienced by study pharmacists were also assessed. A key finding of this study was that pharmacists unfamiliar with BI could be trained to deliver alcohol interventions. In addition involving support staff to inform pharmacy customers about BI and providing regular support to pharmacy staff were found to be important factors in achieving high BI delivery rates in community pharmacies.</p><p>This trial builds on previous research undertaken by others, including a questionnaire study in New Zealand exploring attitudes, knowledge and experiences of 101 community pharmacists. These pharmacists reported being motivated to take up BI but expressed a lack of confidence, knowledge and skills to advise customers on their drinking
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A larger study conducted in New Zealand (2383 customers at 43 pharmacies), also suggested that customers were positive about being offered BI from pharmacies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>There has been one published discussion paper assessing the feasibility of BI conducted by community pharmacists in the UK
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The three feasibility studies discussed in this review (all U.K. cities: London; Glasgow; and Leeds) included a total of 14 pharmacies and 500 customers, from which 30% to 53% were identified as drinking above the UK recommended levels (i.e. women drinking more than 24 grams of ethanol/day and men more than 32 grams of ethanol/day
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The authors in the discussion paper supported the feasibility of BI delivered in community pharmacies and noted that there had been &#x0201c;little empirical evaluation of the effectiveness of community pharmacy-based services for alcohol misuse&#x0201d;, concluding that large scale effectiveness studies were now needed

This online system has several advantages over the paper-pen method. RD will have access to pharmacy participants&#x02019; details as soon as each participant is randomised and the visit to the pharmacy completed; this will allow follow-up telephone calls to be made promptly and avoid delays caused by physically collecting completed trial paperwork from pharmacies. Access to randomisation status and baseline data is prevented. The system requires pharmacists to complete all fields correctly before proceeding to the next step, ensuring trial data are complete. Data can also be accessed without revealing randomisation status.</p><p>RD will arrange two telephone calls with study participants. During both calls the researcher will be blind to the participants&#x02019; intervention condition. The first telephone call will be made within two weeks of recruitment and will take between two to three minutes to complete. The purpose of this call will be to make personal contact to confirm contact details, gather additional tracing information as necessary and to arrange the follow-up study telephone call three-months post randomisation. Structured interview schedules will be used to ensure all participants are asked the same questions in a consistent manner in both calls. The primary and secondary outcomes specified above will be collected in the follow-up study telephone call after three months.

Pharmacists will be reimbursed for their one day of training, and given a modest fee given for each trial participant. Similarly the duration of the BI has been tailored to the time available for interventions delivery in community pharmacies.</p><p>One possible consequence of these study design decisions is that a null finding may result because the effect of BI has been diluted by these study characteristics.

An evaluation of a stronger intervention or with more extended training and skills development inputs may show greater effectiveness and an efficacy trial may show more promise. We are aware of these possibilities and have made our study design decisions as we judge most appropriate in the policy context described. If the trial produces evidence of effectiveness then it will be appropriate to subsequently undertake a large multi-centre trial evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this BI model to inform decision-making about the delivery of BIs in pharmacies nationally.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ANCOVA: Analysis of covariance;AUDIT: Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test;BI: Brief Intervention;CLRN: Comprehensive Local Research Network;NHS: National Health Service;NIHR CSP: National Institute of Health Research Co-ordinated System for obtaining National Health Service Permission;NRES: National Research Ethics Services;REC: Research Ethics Committee;SASQ: Single Alcohol Screening Question;UK: United Kingdom;UKCRN: United Kingdom Central Research Network;W.H.O: World Health Organisation</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>RD, JM, IJN and CW designed the study.
