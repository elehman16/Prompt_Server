Data on 260 Dukes' B and 208 Dukes' C tumours entered into a prospective, randomized clinical trial of post-operative radiotherapy (50 Gy given with 2 Gy/fraction in an overall time of 7 weeks) were analyzed by means of the Cox proportional hazards model. The Dukes' stages B and C were analyzed in two separate multivariate analyses. In patients with Dukes' B tumours, a poor prognosis was associated with age above 60, perineural and venous invasion, tumour located less than 10 cm from the anal verge and elevated pre-operative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (greater than 3.2 ng ml-1). In patients with Dukes' C tumours, perineural and venous invasion, tumour located less than 10 cm from the anal verge, and elevated pre-operative CEA were associated with a poor prognosis. In addition, a large tumour diameter had a strong, negative influence on the prognosis. Males seemed to have a poorer prognosis than females among the Dukes' C patients. Resection of neighbouring organs was also associated with a poor prognosis in this stage. Post-operative radiotherapy as administered in the present series had no significant influence on prognosis. Based on the derived prognostic models patients with a hazard of death above the median in each stage were selected. A separate analysis of the survival in these high risk patients showed no survival benefit from radiotherapy. The proportional hazards model may be a useful tool in selecting patients for more aggressive adjuvant treatment.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00130-0082.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="195" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00130-0083.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="196" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00130-0084.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="197" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00130-0085.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="198" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00130-0086.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="199" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00130-0087.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="200" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00130-0088.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="201" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
